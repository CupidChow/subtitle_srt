00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,540

118
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,460
Of course I'm a little upset.

119
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,020
But like I said,

120
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,170
who he marries is his own business.

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,410
I just think

122
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,780
Ms. Wen has been really good
to both of us.

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,020

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,660
But it's okay.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm pretty easygoing about it.

126
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,540
Ms. Wen and I

127
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,850
can still be good friends.

128
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,980
Just like you and me.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,900
But my grandma can't accept it.

130
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,540
She really likes Ms. Wen.

131
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,730
She even gave her the family heirloom.

132
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,100
Now that Grandma knows my dad
isn't marrying Ms. Wen,

133
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,220
she seems really mad.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,660
You're quite the little observer.

135
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,780
How do you know about all this?

136
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,140

137
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,730

This one

141
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,490

144
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,610
It flies super fast.

145
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,540
Give me a demonstration

146
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,900

You can join us next time we work on it.

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,460
I might not be able to come soon.

152
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,930
Maybe we can schedule it
for another day?

153
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,140
Even better.

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,930
And I want a cola.

155
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,170
Do I have to wait in line to call you?

156
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,660
Are you really jealous of your own son?

is keeping a close eye on Le right now.

162
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,250
I really wish

163
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,140
I could see Le every single day

164
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,170
and make up

165
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,930
for all the love

166
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,020

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,490
over the past 12 years.

168
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,930
I understand how you feel.

169
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,900
Le told me today

170
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,490
that your wedding is off.

171
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,340
He told you all that?

172
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,100
Seems you two get along really well.

173
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,220
A strong blood bond

174
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,930
and an irresistible magnetic attraction
between us.

175
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,660
But he said your mom

176
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,900
seems really mad.

177
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,020
Though I can imagine why.

178
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,250
My mom

179
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,660
might have a hard time accepting it.

180
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,020
Just give her a little more time.

181
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,780
Honestly, I don't care
about your mom's stance.

182
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,610
I'm just worried she might do something.

183
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,490
I don't want Le to get hurt.

184
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,930
She won't.

185
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,050
My mom loves Le very much.

186
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,250
But if it's about getting at me,

187
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,530
I think she's capable of anything.

188
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,180
Feng Rui,

189
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,100
let's go to France.

190
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,650
The three of us
could go to Paris together.

191
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,530
I could keep teaching ballet,

192
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,250
and you could sell wine.

193
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,490
Just the three of us.

194
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,420
No one else to bother us.

195
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,420
It's nothing. I was just saying.

196
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,700
No.

197
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,610
I... I was thinking...

198
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,180
Don't worry about it. I was just saying.

199
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,100
You don't have to take it seriously.

200
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,890
Really.

201
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,130
I think that sounds great.

202
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,980
The three of us

203
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,820
will go to Paris together

204
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,420
and

205
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,370
never be apart.

206
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,220
Okay.

207
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,220
Okay.

208
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,650
Dad,

209
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,940
Rui and Yan's engagement

210
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,060
is off.

211
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,580
Is it

212
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,850
because of that girl?

213
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
They went to Hongyuan County
in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan.

214
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,250
It seems he's made up his mind

215
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,130
to be

216
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,180
with Tan Siting.

217
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,980
Some things

218
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,610
can't be kept hidden forever, Hui.

219
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,100
I always thought Rui was a smart kid.

220
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,530
After all these years,

221
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,300
he should know

222
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,650
what kind of girl

223
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,610
is most suitable for him.

224
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,530
But that's not the case.

225
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,180
He's treating me like an enemy now.

226
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,770
Rui is naive, after all.

227
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,460
Talk to him properly.

228
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,530
Maybe there's a way.

229
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,100
Dad,

230
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,580
you know how he's been

231
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,730
since he was a child.

232
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,610
Once he sets his mind on something,

233
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,650
it can't be changed.

234
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,180
That's also his strong point.

235
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,060
It seems Rui truly loves her.

236
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,380
What's the situation with Ms. Wen now?

237
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,220
She...

238
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,060
She's not even answering my calls.

239
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,140
Instead of worrying about Rui,

240
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,740
you should think

241
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,900
about how to explain this to Ms. Wen.

242
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,860
Are you done talking?

243
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,580
Come take a break.

244
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,300
Let me ask you,

245
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,140
over these years,

246
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,780
have I been

247
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,300
an adequate mother?

248
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,580
Yes.

249
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,020
But I feel Rui

250
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,620
is getting farther and farther
away from me.

251
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,500
He's grown up.

252
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,460
Some things

253
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,860
are beyond our control now.

254
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,620
He's been like this since he was little.

255
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,460
In front of me,

256
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,340
he only ever reported

257
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,660
his improved grades

258
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,780
or another award he'd won.

259
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,580
If his grades slipped,

260
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,500
or if he was wronged outside,

261
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,860
he'd always

262
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,860
come to you.

263
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,940
Rui

264
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,780
never shows his vulnerable side

265
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,300
in front of me.

266
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,140
That's because he knows

267
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,340
your expectations are too high.

268
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,020
He's afraid of disappointing you.

269
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,180
He's becoming
more and more guarded with me.

270
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
He's learned, almost instinctively,

271
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,100
what he should say,

272
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
what he shouldn't,

273
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,500
what he should listen to,

274
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,420
and what he shouldn't.

275
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,900
I feel like I'm losing my place

276
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,740
in his heart.

277
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,860
Sometimes

278
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,140
I'm jealous of you.

279
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,380
At least he doesn't push you away.

280
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Look, even the way he looks at me
has changed.

281
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,900
I'm just tired.

282
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,260
I don't even want to bother anymore.

283
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,260
Feng,

284
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,260
you have to help me this time.

285
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,860
For our son.

286
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,700
Oranges!

287
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,140
Oranges.

288
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:34,660
Dad.

289
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:34,900
Rui.

290
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,260
Over here.

291
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,880
[We have our whole lives ahead of us.
No need to rush.]

292
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,380
How do you even have the time and mood

293
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,180
to come here for tea?

294
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,500
We haven't

295
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,420
sat down and chatted like this
in a long time.

296
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,020
Let's just relax

297
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,140
and have some tea today.

298
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:50,940
Yours.

299
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,220
So? Are you busy?

300
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,180
Not too bad.

301
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,420
Haven't been here in a while.

302
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,780
It's still so lively here.

303
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,540
Rui,

304
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,140
I heard

305
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
you are

306
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,620
with Tan Siting now?

307
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,100
Yes.

308
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,540
Rui,

309
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,620
have you thought this through?

310
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,620
Did... Mom send you?

311
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,460
Dad, don't worry.

312
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,500
We've been through so much together.

313
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,020
We'll make it work.

314
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,500
And we're different from you and Mom.

315
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,260
That's good.

316
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:34,900
Have some tea.

317
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,580
Dad,

318
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,220
I've always wondered

319
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,340
how you and Mom have managed
these past few years.

320
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,500
How else?

321
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,340
We just make do.

322
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,380
Got used to it.

323
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,620
A lot of people ask me,

324
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,140
"Feng Ming,

325
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,180
how did Gao Hui ever

326
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,780
fall in love with you back then?"

327
00:14:59,460 --> 00:14:59,780
She said

328
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,660
she liked my personality.

329
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,940
She thought

330
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,460
people who love reading are gentle.

331
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,140
But look at things now.

332
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,100
I

333
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,020
haven't changed, have I?

334
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,420
But her?

335
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,900
She just doesn't like it anymore.

336
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,540
So,

337
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,860
how long do you think

338
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,660
feelings can really last?

339
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,380
It was only after we got married
that we realized

340
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,140
life wasn't what we imagined.

341
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,380
Even though I tried my best

342
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,740
to catch up with her perspective,

343
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,420
some things

344
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,900
are just ingrained.

345
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,260
They can't be changed.

346
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,660
Like even now, I prefer

347
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,140
open-air tea houses like this.

348
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,140
Down-to-earth.

349
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,140
But your mom

350
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,460
prefers high-end hotels.

351
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,660
Marriage

352
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,900
is like a tree.

353
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,620
If the roots aren't stable,

354
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,700
it grows crooked

355
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,140
and eventually

356
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,260
falls.

357
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,860
Have you noticed

358
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,260
Ms. Wen acting a bit strange lately?

359
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,780
I noticed a while ago.

360
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,780
Are she and Mr. Feng
having a disagreement?

361
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,940
Mr. Feng hasn't come to pick her up
in a long time.

362
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,060
I feel it's more serious
than just a disagreement.

363
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,780
Really?

364
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,300
Do you think their wedding is still on?

365
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,900
Hard to say.

366
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,540
Exactly.

367
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,220
Seeing her like that, it's hard to ask.

368
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,180
Help me

369
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,420
pull up the parent information
of the piano class students.

370
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,060
Okay.

371
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,300
Look.

372
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:26,980
This one.

373
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,580
This one.

374
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,340
Which one?

375
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,020
Huang Hanfei.

376
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,220
Yes.

377
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:32,940
Okay.

378
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,620
His mom came the other day

379
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,820
to inquire about his situation.

380
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,380
Right.

381
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,340
He hasn't behaved lately.

382
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Just so you know,

383
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,380
I'm not getting married.

384
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,620
The wedding is off.

385
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,300
Thank you.

386
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,780
Thank you.

387
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,180
No problem.

388
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:51,940
Let's go.

389
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,340
How's your dad doing?

390
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,060
Better than I expected.

391
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,380
That's good then.

392
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,620
You can finally put down

393
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,420
that burden you've carried

394
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,660
for so many years.

395
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,540
Yeah.

396
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,340
And you?

397
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,820
How's that boyfriend
you're so crazy about?

398
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,740
Me?

399
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,460
Yeah.

400
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,180
He's great.

401
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,820
In what way?

402
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,620
Can we talk
about that kind of stuff out here?

403
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,260
We'll save that for when we get home.

404
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,820
Whisper it so no one else hears.

405
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,380
How about

406
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,540
I tell you about his business?

407
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,580
I'm telling you, his business is huge.

408
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,260
But

409
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,260
it's mainly

410
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,660
in real estate.

411
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,380
Look.

412
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,020
What?

413
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,260
A gift!

414
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,380
A gift?

415
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,380
"Wang Shuhan, Project Manager".

416
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,420
Don't praise me yet.

417
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,660
Let me tell you,

418
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,540
they started a new project

419
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,460
in East District.

420
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,420
But you know what?

421
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,900
Old-school businessmen

422
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,780
have pretty old-fashioned thinking.

423
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,380
So

424
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,580
I suggested some newer ideas.

425
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,820
They actually adopted them

426
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
and gave me a Project Manager position.

427
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,900
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

428
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,180
Let's raise our coffees.

429
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,860
To you

430
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,100
finding your dad,

431
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,580
and to me

432
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,820
finding both a job

433
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,580
and love.

434
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,340
Cheers.

435
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,060
You're head over heels.

436
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,660
France?

437
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,160
[Cygne]

438
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,780
Are you going on your honeymoon?

439
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,340
Look,

440
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,620
our vineyard

441
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,060
has restored its production.

442
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,380
The Cygne brand

443
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,460
is getting more and more recognition.

444
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,900
I want to use this momentum

445
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
to promote our brand in France.

446
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,860
Through tastings

447
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,380
and wine competitions there,

448
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,540
we can truly

449
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,060
expand our brand

450
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,860
and establish ourselves

451
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,860
in the international market.

452
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,380
Sir,

453
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,020
how long will you be gone?

454
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,220
What about the business here?

455
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,220
We still have
so many unfulfilled orders.

456
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,580
And so many manufacturers...

457
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm leaving it to you.

458
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,380
We...

459
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,100
Us?

460
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
You'll be fine.

461
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,380
Qi, your role stays the same.

462
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,660
You're responsible

463
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,580
for orders

464
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,300
and client relations.

465
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
Your job doesn't change either.

466
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,940
At most, you'll just go to the winery

467
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,380
a few more times in my place

468
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,380
and work closely

469
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,540
with Duoji,

470
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,300
keeping in good communication.

471
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,220
That's all.

472
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
Let's try it for a while.

473
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,900
If it works out,

474
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,700
I'll hand the company over
to you completely.

475
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
And if any issues come up,

476
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,060
I can always communicate
with you from France.

477
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,460
But

478
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,860
Cygne is your life's work.

479
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,500
Yes.

480
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,020
How could the two of us possibly
manage it...?

481
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,620
You two

482
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,780
are already really capable.

483
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,860
Besides,

484
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,580
aren't you two working together

485
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,820
better and better?

486
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,060
Okay.

487
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,340
We'll do our best.

488
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,380
Yes, sir.

489
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,620
There's one more thing
I want to tell you.

490
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,020
What other big news?

491
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,780
Feng Rui and I are back together.

492
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,100
Back together?

493
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,860
And you've reunited with your child too?

494
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,020
Not yet.

495
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,940
Still want to get mentally ready.

496
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,300
I'm afraid Le

497
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,620
might not accept it so quickly.

498
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,660
True.

499
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,860
Le is still so young.

500
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,660
You need to give him some time.

501
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,940
Forget Le,

502
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,860
if it were me,

503
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,620
if I suddenly found out I had a mom,

504
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,100
I couldn't accept it either.

505
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,380
Yeah.

506
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
We'll take it slow.

507
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,340
We'll figure things out as we go.

508
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,620
Siting.

509
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,860
I won't say much

510
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,660
about you and Feng Rui.

511
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,100
As long as you're happy with it,
that's enough.

512
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,100
But his mom

513
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,540
is a tough one.

514
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,780
I knew you'd say that.

515
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
But his mom

516
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,540
has been standing between us
for so many years.

517
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,820
It's a really difficult problem.

518
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,220
I've already figured it out.

519
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,100
I'm building a life with Feng Rui,

520
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,980
not his mom.

521
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,780
Besides, we've already decided.

522
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,660
We're planning to go to France.

523
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,940
That way, we can stay away from his mom

524
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,580
and avoid conflicts.

525
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,380
That's good.

526
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,780
You just got back,

527
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,540
and you're leaving again?

528
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,180
Just to avoid his mom?

529
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,580
Not entirely.

530
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,100
I just don't want
any more entanglements.

531
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,260
But have you considered

532
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,620
that Feng Rui and his mom

533
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,380
are still bound by blood?

534
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,780
Blood is thicker than water.

535
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,860
How can you be sure

536
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,580
they won't have any contact
in the future?

537
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,220
What if his mother causes more trouble?

538
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,860
Of course I've thought about it.

539
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,420
But Feng Rui told me

540
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,300
he'll handle it.

541
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,180
That's good then.

542
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,660
I could

543
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,140
hear you all chattering from far away.

544
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,020
Look what I brought you.

545
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,100
Who's this?

546
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:21,780
Coffee.

547
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,780
Were you taking Yufan

548
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,900
for interviews again?

549
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,100
Couldn't really refuse.

550
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,220
Had no choice but to go.

551
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,220
Just finished.

552
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,020
While

553
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,100
we were being interviewed today,

554
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,660
I got a call from Sanxiao.

555
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,460
They invited me

556
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,020
to share our teaching experience.

557
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,460
Impressive.

558
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,140
Sanxiao Ballet Club

559
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,140
is ranked number one in the city.

560
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,260
Exactly.

561
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,100
Its members

562
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,220
get directly into
the university-affiliated middle school.

563
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,300
Rankings and actual ability

564
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,540
are two different things.

565
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,180
The students from the top-ranked school

566
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,460
haven't won an international gold medal!

567
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,940
Yufan really makes us proud.

568
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,420
Yes.

569
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,100
Indeed.

570
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,700
So

571
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,340
now it's all about the results.

572
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,420
Only good results bring attention

573
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,980
and a voice.

574
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
That's true.

575
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,620
It comes down to ability.

576
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,940
Ms. Tan.

577
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,460
Have some coffee.

578
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,380
Okay.

579
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,540
You deserve

580
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,420
part of the credit too.

581
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,380
I think

582
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,460
you should get involved too.

583
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,620
Not me. I'm socially awkward.

584
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,620
Socially awkward?

585
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,260
Yeah.

586
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,540
I'll leave everything else to you.

587
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,460
Alright then.

588
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,940
I'll handle

589
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,020
the social butterfly stuff.

590
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,300
By the way,

591
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,540
no one's leaving

592
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,140
after work tonight.

593
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,660
We're going to that Yunnan restaurant
I mentioned.

594
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,140
My treat.

595
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:33,940
Ms. Guan.

596
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,900
I can't make it tonight.

597
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,900
I have something to do at home.

598
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,220
Another time then. Just the two of us.

599
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:39,820
Okay.

600
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,460
Anything else?

601
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,060
Mushrooms.

602
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,180
Feng Lexuan,

603
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,020
why was your dad's wedding off?

604
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,180
How should I know about adult stuff?

605
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,500
Then ask him.

606
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,620
Why don't you ask him?

607
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,980
Why are you asking me?

608
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,300
Feng Lexuan,

609
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,740
so now you're not the one
giving me advice?

610
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,340
I really don't know why.

611
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,020
Because he fell out of love.

612
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,020
Didn't know you had it in you,

613
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,700
Yang Zihuan.

614
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,500
I was just guessing.

615
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,540
Could it be your dad
is still thinking about your mom?

616
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
Your birth mother.

617
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,060
Maybe.

618
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,860
He hasn't been able to forget her
all these years?

619
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,540
She must be really great then.

620
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
I don't know.

621
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,460
I don't even know what she looks like.

622
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,400
[Feng Rui]

623
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,060
I'll get straight to the point then.

624
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,140
I'm not here today

625
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,380
to blame you.

626
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,580
I just want to ask you a few questions.

627
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,020
Of course, no pressure.

628
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,980
If you don't want to answer,

629
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,500
you don't have to.

630
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,380
No problem.

631
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
I'll tell you

632
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,740
whatever I know.

633
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,340
When did you and Feng Rui get together?

634
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,100
This time, it was

635
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,140
when we went
to Hongyuan County in Sichuan.

636
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,460
In the years I've known Feng Rui,

637
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,580
I've always known

638
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,940
he carried Le's mom in his heart.

639
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,740
But I didn't know

640
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,980
Le's mom is still alive,

641
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,580
and that it is you.

642
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,220
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have naively tried to

643
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,820
start this relationship.

644
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,220
So I want to know

645
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,740
what exactly happened between you.

646
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,380
Why did you

647
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,300
leave Le and Feng Rui,

648
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,420
and why have you come back now?

649
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I don't want to bow out
without knowing the reasons.

650
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,300
Okay.

651
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,420
Welcome...

652
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,060
Ms. Gao?

653
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,620
Where's Feng Rui?

654
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,900
Where did he go?

655
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
I called him,

656
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,540
but he didn't answer.

657
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
Mr. Feng isn't here.

658
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,620
We don't know either.

659
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,420
What do you mean you don't know?

660
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,580
He hasn't been here
for the last couple of days.

661
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,660
Said he's going to France
to expand the market.

662
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,180
He's probably preparing

663
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,140
for that lately.

664
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,660
You didn't know?

665
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,420
The French market?

666
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,660
Gao Haotian?

667
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,860
I never knew

668
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,340
Feng Rui had an uncle.

669
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,580
Gao Hui would never admit

670
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,540
that she had a brother who was a rapist.

671
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,660
So you got close to me

672
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,740
to get back at her?

673
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,100
Partly.

674
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
But not entirely.

675
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,780
But I must admit,

676
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,780
I did use your relationship

677
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,500
to find out everything

678
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,980
I wanted to know.

679
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,740
I'm really sorry.

680
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
Having said that,

681
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,180
I'm grateful to you.

682
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,020
All these years,

683
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,540
you've been there for Le,

684
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,620
taking care of him,

685
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,020
making up for the fact
that he didn't have a mom.

686
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,260
You don't need to thank me, actually.

687
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,820
It's not entirely because of Feng Rui
that I'm good to Le.

688
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,740
Le really is a lovely child.

689
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,940
And perhaps

690
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,180
whom we meet in this world,

691
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,180
when we meet them,

692
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,540
and what kind of relationship we form,

693
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,100
are all predestined.

694
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,700
I've been thinking a lot lately.

695
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,980
There were some things
I couldn't figure out.

696
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,260
Now I've finally figured it out.

697
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,940
It's all in the past now.

698
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,500
And I hope he finds happiness.

699
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,300
Are you okay?

700
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
Why wouldn't I be?

701
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,780
You didn't answer my calls.

702
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,700
Peiyan came to see me.

703
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,860
What did she say?

704
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,900
She said a lot of bad things about you.

705
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Just kidding.

706
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,580
She wanted to know why.

707
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,180
So I told her everything.

708
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,300
I thought she had the right

709
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,140
to know.

710
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,620
I'm hanging up.

711
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,580
Bye.

712
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,500
Dad.

713
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,820
Did you break up with Ms. Wen

714
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,580
because you're still thinking
about my mom?

715
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,340
It's nothing.

716
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,740
I was just asking.

717
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:27,780
Le,

718
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,020
do you want to go on a trip?

719
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,260
Yes.

720
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,260
Where to?

721
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,380
Abroad.

722
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,740
With who?

723
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,460
With me, of course.

724
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,940
Just the two of us?

725
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:43,820
You don't want to?

726
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,220
Alright.

727
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,740
Which country?

728
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,700
France. How about that?

729
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,980
France?

730
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,540
Just the two of us guys going to France?

731
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,220
But whatever.

732
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,780
As long as we're having fun,
anywhere is fine.

733
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,420
How long for?

734
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,140
How long do you want to go for?

735
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,860
The longer, the better.

736
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,580
But Grandma

737
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,260
told me to focus on studying recently.

738
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,260
True.

739
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,060
You need to behave well.

740
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,740
Like you need to tell me that.

741
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,540
I had to

742
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,980
come to the school to see you.

743
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,940
I didn't mean to ignore your calls.

744
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,060
I just

745
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,220
didn't know what to say.

746
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,460
I didn't expect things
to turn out like this.

747
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,420
I'm sorry, Yan.

748
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:57,860
Madam,

749
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,140
you don't need to apologize to me.

750
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,660
Matters of the heart

751
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,820
are hard to explain.

752
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,740
You're a good girl.

753
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,580
And you're good to Le.

754
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,140
I've seen it all.

755
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,820
When I found out you two were together,

756
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,260
I was really happy for you.

757
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,700
You're not getting any younger.

758
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,140
I hope you can

759
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,140
settle down soon.

760
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,100
Tan Siting told me everything.

761
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
What did she say?

762
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,060
It doesn't matter what she said.

763
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,140
That's just her side of the story.

764
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,100
I won't comment

765
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,220
on what's between you.

766
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,260
But now that I know

767
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,900
Tan Siting is Le's mom,

768
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,020
there's no way things could work out

769
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,620
between me and Feng Rui.

770
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,340
She just appeared

771
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,100
in Rui's life before you did.

772
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,420
But that's not important.

773
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,700
They aren't right for each other.

774
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,620
They're not meant to be.

775
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,220
I always felt like

776
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,260
Rui was living

777
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,740
inside a shell.

778
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,780
I tried hard

779
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
to break through it.

780
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,140
But unfortunately,

781
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,660
I never managed to get inside.

782
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,540
Yan,

783
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,300
if you love someone,

784
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,100
you should persevere.

785
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,860
Don't give up.

786
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,660
I'll help you.

787
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,260
I've been carrying

788
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,660
this necklace with me lately.

789
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,180
I wanted to find the right time
to return it to you.

790
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,140
Today seems fitting.

791
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,300
Thank you for looking out for me

792
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,260
all this time.

793
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,500
Okay.

794
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,620
Alright. We're here.

795
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,180
Hello, Mr. Lu.

796
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,620
Le.

797
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,100
Mr. Feng.

798
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,500
Lu.

799
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,820
I'll take it.

800
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,820
Dad, aren't you coming home?

801
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,420
I still have some things
to take care of.

802
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,340
I'll come back as soon as I'm done.

803
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,060
Okay.

804
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,500
Alright. Go upstairs with Lu.

805
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,780
Okay. Bye.

806
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,060
Bye.

807
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,740
Hello, Ms. Tan.

808
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,700
Guess what my dad told me today?

809
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,780
What did he say?

810
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,580
He said if I behave well,

811
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,980
he'll take me to France.

812
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:01,900
Really?

813
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,220
Then you better behave well.

814
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,020
Ms. Tan,

815
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,420
I remember you used to
live in France, right?

816
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,340
Yeah.

817
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,780
Then you can be my remote tour guide.

818
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,620
I want to see if French ballet

819
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,700
is really as amazing as they say.

820
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,380
Of course, no problem.

821
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,860
Alright. Come eat.

822
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:23,940
Hello?

823
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,500
Who's at your house?

824
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,340
Two of my colleagues came over
for dinner.

825
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,900
Then you should eat.

826
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,300
Le,

827
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,220
can you give me your home address?

828
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,580
I want to send you a gift.

829
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,820
A gift?

830
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,700
Thanks, Ms. Tan.

831
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,140
No problem. I'm hanging up now.

832
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,820
Bye.

833
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,140
He didn't hear, did he?

834
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,220
I was so scared.

835
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,900
He almost heard.

836
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,900
Good thing he didn't
recognize your voice.

837
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,740
Why did you ask for his address?

838
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,660
You could have just asked me.

839
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,940
Are you silly?

840
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,380
Right.

841
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,580
Right.

842
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,540
Is he asleep?

843
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,220
You should just sleep here too.

844
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,660
No need to go back and forth.

845
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,660
Your grandpa misses you.

846
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,820
He wants you to come over
for dinner tomorrow.

847
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,380
I see.

848
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,260
It's been a long time

849
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,780
since our whole family
had a proper meal together.

850
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,420
Rui,

851
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,940
how is your winery doing?

852
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,220
It's good.

853
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,220
Cygne is on track now.

854
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,860
Our vineyard

855
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,380
is gradually increasing production.

856
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,500
We've also seen
a significant growth in orders.

857
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
You're doing very well.

858
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,780
You always

859
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,540
put my mind at ease
when it comes to work.

860
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,540
Rui,

861
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,420
your mom

862
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,540
told me about your situation.

863
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,260
Young people

864
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,260
tend to be impulsive
in matters of the heart.

865
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,860
It's understandable.

866
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,540
But the engagement thing

867
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,540
is truly beyond repair now.

868
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,220
I understand.

869
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,780
You have feelings for Ms. Tan.

870
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
But your relationship

871
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,700
is too complicated.

872
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,860
Ms. Tan is different from you.

873
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,060
You're not just on your own.

874
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,700
You have a large family

875
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,620
and a business

876
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
behind you.

877
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,260
You should understand the implications.

878
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:42,820
Grandpa.

879
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,260
I understand everything you're saying.

880
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,540
When it comes to love, you young people

881
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,100
tend to disregard
everyone else's feelings.

882
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,380
You're the ones overcomplicating things.

883
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,380
It's actually very simple.

884
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,700
In our relationship,

885
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,740
it's just her and me.

886
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,740
Besides, we're not that young anymore.

887
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,420
We really don't want to

888
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,860
carry on the grudges from the past.

889
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,540
It's not a matter of what you want.

890
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,580
Rui,

891
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,740
let me ask you,

892
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,380
are you still visiting Haotian's grave

893
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,980
on the anniversary of his death?

894
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,100
And

895
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,300
they probably haven't

896
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,380
forgotten about that girl's death,
have they?

897
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,620
Siting and I have decided.

898
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,100
We're not running away anymore.

899
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,820
If I can't marry her,

900
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,620
I don't think I'll ever marry anyone.

901
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,180
Let's eat.

902
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,300
Let me introduce you all.

903
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,540
This is my boyfriend, Wu Zuhao.

904
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,660
You can call him Zu.

905
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:19,860
Oh, Zu,

906
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,340
this is my best friend, Tan Siting.

907
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,540
A great artist.

908
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,540
Shuhan talks about you a lot.

909
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,860
You're an internationally renowned
ballet dancer.

910
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,860
It's an honor.

911
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,220
She's exaggerating.

912
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,180
She's also told me a lot about you.

913
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,860
You're head over heels.

914
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,460
Oh,

915
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
and Siting's boyfriend
is also in business.

916
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,060
He sells wine.

917
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,660
I'll introduce you sometime.

918
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,540
- Okay.
- Of course.

919
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,060
Sorry,

920
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,460
I almost forgot my dearest brother.

921
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,420
This is Wang Zeyuan.

922
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,860
Hello.

923
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,140
Zu said...

924
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,860
This is my business card.

925
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,060
today is the first time he's meeting

926
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,980
the two most important people
in my life.

927
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,660
So he insisted
that today's dinner must be

928
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,420
proper

929
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,220
and grand.

930
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,980
Today is our first time meeting.

931
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,300
It's a pleasure to meet you both.

932
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,900
Hope everyone enjoys the meal.

933
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,780
Thank you.

934
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,860
Wang Shuhan,

935
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,620
you seem really busy lately.

936
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:16,780
You're not even answering calls.

937
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,180
What big project are you working on?

938
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,780
Is that how you address me?

939
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,660
Watch your tone

940
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,180
when you're talking to me.

941
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,420
Uh,

942
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,820
sorry about that.

943
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,900
Even though I'm his elder sister,

944
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,180
he never shows me any respect at home.

945
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,820
Siting, talk some sense into him.

946
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,020
How enviable.

947
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,900
It's so nice.

948
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,660
I wish I had a younger brother
to protect

949
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,300
and care for me.

950
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:36,820
Right?

951
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,180
Here.

952
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,820
Let's eat.

953
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,300
Okay.

954
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,620
Can you confirm?

955
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,860
We're still investigating

956
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,700
the specifics.

957
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,420
Please come with me to the station later

958
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,260
to give your statements.

959
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,340
Okay.

960
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,380
Haotian.

961
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,580
What's wrong?

962
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,660
Gao Hui.

963
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,100
Gao Hui, you... Calm down.

964
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,940
Haotian.

965
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,740
Calm down, Gao Hui.

966
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,140
What happened?

967
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,780
Haotian,

968
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,660
tell me!

969
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,740
What happened?

970
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,460
- Mom.
- Calm down. Gao Hui!

971
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,140
Haotian!

972
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,700

973
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,100
Tell me!

974
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,260
Alright, Gao Hui.

975
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,700
Gao Hui, that's enough.

976
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,060
Haotian.

977
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:50,700
Mom.

978
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,540
Come home with me!

979
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,620
