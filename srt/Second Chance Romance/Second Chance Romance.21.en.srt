I always lost to you guys.

188
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,530
Now that you mentioned marbles,
I remember.

189
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,180
You're Sun Tiantian?

190
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,730
Yes.

191
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,650
Did you transfer

192
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,530
and then go abroad later?

193
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,530
We haven't seen each other
in over 20 years, right?

194
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,940
Yeah. Time flies.

195
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,530
Later,

196
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,220
because of my father's work,

197
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,940
our whole family moved to Singapore.

198
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,820
In recent years,

199
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,820
we've been having
some business dealings domestically.

200
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,420
So I came back.

201
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,060
Still think it's better here.

202
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,060
Now,

203
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,530
I've started a company here.

204
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,460
What does your company mainly do?

205
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,420
Investment.

206
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,010
Dabbling in some finance-related fields.

207
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,650
For instance, we invested

208
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,890
in this sports complex.

209
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,490
Sports complex?

210
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,980
Which sports complex did you invest in?

211
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,010
The one in East District.

212
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,010
I'm actually managing
the sports complex project

213
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,940
in East District.

214
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,180
I'm the Project Manager.

215
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,940
Really?

216
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,850
Oh my god. What a coincidence.

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,370
Yes.

218
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,340
Zu.

219
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,700
Zu, come here for a moment.

220
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,610
Let me introduce you.

221
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,940
This is Sun Tiantian,

222
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,370
my elementary school classmate.

223
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,420
This is Wu Zuhao.

224
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,850
Mr. Wu from Shengnuo Real Estate.

225
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,130
Mr. Wu, hello.

226
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,250
I've heard so much about you.

227
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,770
Hello.

228
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,980
Oh, and here's my business card.

229
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,850
Sun Tiantian from Fengjin Investment?

230
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,250
Yes.

231
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,610
Shuhan and I
haven't seen each other in years.

232
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,010
Yeah.

233
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,980
Didn't expect
we'd be reunited like this.

234
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,340
What a coincidence.

235
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,130
She's been under
a lot of work pressure lately.

236
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,850
You must take her out more

237
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,730
and let her relax.

238
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,940
Exactly.

239
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,650
Since I took on this project,

240
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,940
I've even gotten dark circles.

241
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,420
Not at all.

242
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,850
Still as beautiful as ever.

243
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,770
You're so sweet.

244
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,370
Oh, can I add you both as a friend?

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,300
Sure.

246
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,490
You can add me.

247
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:49,940
Okay. I'll scan your code.

248
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,460
I'll send you his contact details later.

249
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,130
Alright.

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,530
Such a coincidence.

251
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,580
Yeah. It's really been too long.

252
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,650
Come on, let's add each other.

253
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,730
Added.

254
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,130
Okay.

255
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,370
I have to get back to my dinner.

256
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,010
I should go.

257
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,580
We're all friends here.
Let's keep in touch.

258
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,700
Alright. I won't keep you. Go ahead.

259
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,940
Okay. Bye.

260
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,340
So?

261
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,610
Pretty good, right?

262
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,220
My classmate is doing really well now.

263
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,610
And she's practically
in the same industry as us.

264
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,370
Alright. Go to the bathroom.

265
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,420
Okay.

266
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm going then.

267
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:22,940
Okay.

268
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,940
Here.

269
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,300
I really didn't expect

270
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,250
they'd require the full
registered capital to be paid in.

271
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,610
Sun didn't expect it
to be this serious either.

272
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,650
We've tried every possible way.

273
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,060
We're still short by 20 million.

274
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,370
What do we do now?

275
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,890
It's okay. We'll figure something out.

276
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,700
Zu,

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,730
if the registered capital

278
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,060
isn't fully paid, does that mean

279
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,530
our project can't start?

280
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,100
It means we can't break ground at all.

281
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,300
We don't qualify.

282
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,730
It's fine. I'll find a way.

283
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,370
Trust me.
Things will work out eventually.

284
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,770
Speak.

285
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,010
Hey, can't you be a little nicer

286
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,490
when you talk to your sister?

287
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,700
Let me ask you,

288
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,580
do you have 20 million
in your account?

289
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,770
Lend it to me.

290
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,890
How much?

291
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,580
Wang Shuhan,

292
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,700
have you been kidnapped?

293
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,650
What are you talking about?

294
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,340
Can you keep your voice down?

295
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,420
It's just
that my East District project

296
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,580
needs 20 million more
to get started.

297
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,250
If you have it,

298
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,730
lend it to me.

299
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,300
Do you think I'm a bank?

300
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,770
What game company

301
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,850
has that kind of money?

302
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,530
What about Zu?

303
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,650
Didn't he secure funding
quite successfully?

304
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,420
Alright.

305
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,650
Stop. I see.

306
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,820
If you don't have it, fine.

307
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,580
Why ask so many questions?

308
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,100
If I could borrow it elsewhere,

309
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,060
I wouldn't be calling you.

310
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:56,730
I'm hanging up.

311
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,850
Unbelievable.

312
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,510
[Sun Tiantian]

313
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,300
Fengjin Investment will continue
to target overseas markets.

314
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,890
Hello, Tiantian.

315
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,060
Well, it's me, Shuhan.

316
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,610
Do you have time lately?

317
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,650
Let's meet up.

318
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,530
Mr. Wang, it's Shuhan.

319
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,340
Listen,

320
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,010
I have a really great project lately.

321
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,340
If you're interested,

322
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,460
I can tell you about it.

323
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,220
Tiantian, sorry.

324
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,850
I didn't know
you were going abroad today.

325
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,130
I asked to meet on such short notice.

326
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,100
It's fine.

327
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,100
Let's not stand on ceremony.

328
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,580
Besides, I still have time.

329
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,650
And I have nothing else
this afternoon.

330
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,060
So, what's up?

331
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,420
Here's the thing.

332
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,220
Is there any chance

333
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,730
you could lend Shengnuo Real Estate
20 million?

334
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,130
Or, you could lend it to me personally.

335
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,340
I'll write you an IOU

336
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,650
in my own name.

337
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,010
So sudden?

338
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,490
Here's the situation.

339
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,100
It's about that sports complex project

340
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,580
in East District.

341
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,650
You also invested in it.

342
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,100
We just got notified

343
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,370
that the registered capital
must be fully paid in

344
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,420
before the project can start.

345
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,460
So

346
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,220
it's caught us completely off guard.

347
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,770
I understand its urgency.

348
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,820
And I really want to help you.

349
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,220
If I had 20 million myself,

350
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,220
I'd just lend it to you.

351
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,820
But as you can see,

352
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,770
I'm flying to South America tonight

353
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,610
for our company's currently

354
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,770
most important

355
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,580
copper mining project.

356
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,010
Honestly, most of our company's funds

357
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,650
are tied up in it.

358
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,530
So financially,
I might not be able to help you.

359
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,700
But aren't you an investment company?

360
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,010
Could you invest a bit more
in this project?

361
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,580
You know

362
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,490
the sports complex project

363
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,370
has huge prospects.

364
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,370
Or,

365
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,300
would you consider investing
in our company, Shengnuo Real Estate?

366
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,060
It has great prospects too.

367
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,460
It's a very good project.

368
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,370
There's no doubt about that.

369
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,370
But

370
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,300
before we invest in any project,

371
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,700
we need to conduct
a professional evaluation

372
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,610
and determine
a reasonable investment amount.

373
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,100
It's not like going to the market
for groceries.

374
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,610
You can't just decide

375
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,730
to buy an extra pound.

376
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,300
I understand.

377
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,770
Have you contacted the banks?

378
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,850
Zu has.

379
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,100
But

380
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,100
we're still waiting for the results.

381
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,890
The registered capital
for a real estate company

382
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,250
is usually over 100 million.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

383
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,820
I understand that.

384
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,100
Shuhan,

385
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,890
is all the funding

386
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,100
from your previous financing round
in the account?

387
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,370
Yes.

388
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,820
But the problem is,

389
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,340
it's not been fully received

390
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:49,770
yet.

391
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,650
That's why the project can't start.

392
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,770
We're just short by 20 million.

393
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,460
That's a real shame.

394
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,850
Normally,

395
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,530
you should use that money
for a short-term investment.

396
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,770
Otherwise, it's a waste.

397
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,850
What kind of short-term investment?

398
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,180
Are they that profitable?

399
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,220
Mr. Wu is an old hand
in the real estate industry.

400
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,700
He should be clear about these things.

401
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,370
Actually,

402
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,610
I didn't tell him I was coming

403
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,610
to see you today.

404
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,340
Because I want to share
some of his burden.

405
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,850
And I want to surprise him.

406
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,100
Mr. Wu is really lucky.

407
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,610
But Shuhan,

408
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,730
I really don't have

409
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,300
a suitable project for you right now.

410
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,180
I'll keep an eye out for you, alright?

411
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,220
Zu,

412
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,730
do you remember

413
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,820
my classmate, Sun Tiantian,

414
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,460
who we met

415
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,890
at the restaurant last time?

416
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,850
She's in investment.

417
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,220
The one in overseas real estate?

418
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,940
Yes.

419
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,490
She just recently returned
to do business here, right?

420
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,060
Yes.

421
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,820
I think she said
she was in Singapore before.

422
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,300
Lately, they're developing
a mining project in South America.

423
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,580
Mining in South America?

424
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,940
That's not a small investment.

425
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,660
Given the current economic climate,

426
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,860
your classmate's got some real guts.

427
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,180
I didn't expect her
to be doing business on that scale.

428
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,380
Do you think we should ask her for help?

429
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,460
Alright, let's stop talking about work.

430
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,900
I've been thinking,

431
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,530
we've been too busy with work

432
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,380
to visit your parents.

433
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,490
How about we find some time to see them

434
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,620
once things settle down?

435
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,180
Sure.

436
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,380
I told them about you last time,

437
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,770
and they really want to meet you.

438
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,090
What do they like?

439
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,570
I'll prepare some gifts.

440
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,570
Listen,

441
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,290
you don't need to buy anything.

442
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,090
They'll be happy just to have you visit.

443
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,050
Then

444
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,220
I'll make the arrangements.

445
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,770
We'll all go out for a meal together.

446
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,290
Let's eat.

447
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,860
Okay.

448
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,940
Le,

449
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,250
Mr. Lu will take you home

450
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,090
after school today.

451
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:06,980
Why?

452
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,980
I've been quite busy lately.

453
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,700
Here.

454
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,940
Take this.

455
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:14,860
Okay.

456
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,980
Bye, Grandma.

457
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,490
Bye.

458
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,940
Bye, Mr. Lu.

459
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,620
Bye, Le.

460
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:23,900
Bye.

461
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,330
Let's go.

462
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,060
What kind of short-term investment?

463
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,260
Are they that profitable?

464
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,220
Mr. Wu is an old hand
in the real estate industry.

465
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,740
He should be clear about these things.

466
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,300
Actually,

467
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,620
I didn't tell him
I was coming to see you today.

468
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,380
Because I want to
share some of his burden.

469
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,820
And I want to surprise him.

470
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,220
Mr. Wu is really lucky.

471
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,780
But Shuhan,

472
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,660
I really don't have

473
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,300
a suitable project for you right now.

474
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,220
I'll keep an eye out for you, alright?

475
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,300
Tiantian, didn't you just say

476
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,500
you were flying to South America

477
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,060
for that mining project?

478
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
Is that project available?

479
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,740
Can't we invest a little in it?

480
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,820
That project

481
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,220
requires a huge investment.

482
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,260
It's not as simple as a sports complex.

483
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,500
And the first round of private funding

484
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,700
is about to close.

485
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,740
To be honest,

486
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,060
most of our company's money

487
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,140
has been invested in it.

488
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,740
And I'm going there now

489
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,700
for the final preparations
before the launch.

490
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,460
That project is too risky.
It's not suitable for you.

491
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,540
I'll let you know
if something suitable comes up.

492
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,140
Be sure to notify me first thing.

493
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
And let me know as soon as you're back.

494
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,940
We haven't had a meal with Yuan yet.

495
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,420
Don't worry.

496
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,220
I will try my best

497
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,820
to help you figure this out.

498
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,500
Alright.

499
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,540
And thank you for trusting me so much.

500
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,180
I should be the one saying thanks.

501
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:05,940
Tiantian,

502
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,020
have you arrived in South America?

503
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,260
If you come across any short-term,

504
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,540
high-return investment projects,

505
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,940
do let me know right away.

506
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,180
Shuhan, not yet.

507
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,260
I'll check again after I return
the day after tomorrow.

508
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,740
Tiantian,

509
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,340
about that South American

510
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,460
mining project you mentioned
before you left,

511
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,180
could you possibly

512
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,740
squeeze out a little share for me?

513
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,020
You know I'm really desperate

514
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,380
for the money right now.

515
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,100
Can you help me out?

516
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,660
Our shares are almost full.

517
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,100
And you have to buy it in the name

518
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,740
of a company.

519
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,220
I understand what you're saying.

520
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,620
Don't worry.

521
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,260
I'll figure out a way to handle this.

522
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,460
Also,

523
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,260
if this works out,

524
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,260
I promise your work
won't be for nothing.

525
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,340
Thank you.

526
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,580
I think

527
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,260
during this process...

528
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:32,940
Look!

529
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,140
Many people might...

530
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,900
What are you doing?

531
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,460
back out.

532
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,260
Isn't that... Tan Siting?

533
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,780
Right?

534
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,620
No wonder she looks so elegant.

535
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,300
You know what?

536
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,140
I actually had a ballet dream
when I was little.

537
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,660
Stop daydreaming.

538
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,180
Maybe in your next life.

539
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,940
Stop slacking off.

540
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,340
We can't leave
until we finish checking this today.

541
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,860
Finish writing this.

542
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,980
You write it. I'm not writing it.

543
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,500
Fine, I'll write it.

544
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,540
Everyone,

545
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,860
Ms. Tan's interview

546
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,380
was extremely successful.

547
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,900
The ratings exceeded our expectations.

548
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,700
Applause! Congratulations!

549
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,780
I never expected

550
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,300
such a serious, niche talk show

551
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,700
to break into the mainstream.

552
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,100
Plus the documentary,

553
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,540
I've even seen people watching it

554
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,500
on my way to work lately.

555
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,180
You could say

556
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,340
Ms. Tan is the hottest ballet star
right now.

557
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,540
Get her autograph now.

558
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:27,940
And

559
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,660
I just got a lot more calls.

560
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,900
Many

561
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,580
top-tier ballet schools

562
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,940
want to cooperate with us.

563
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,540
They want to

564
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,020
send their students here for training.

565
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,740
That's really great.

566
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,380
Perfect timing.

567
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,940
Ms. Zhuang, you, Ms. Tan,

568
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,740
and everyone else are here.

569
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
These are the top students
who've already sent in their materials.

570
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,260
Each one is exceptional.

571
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,900
Come take a look.

572
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,700
It's even more than that.

573
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,020
Several domestic arts festivals

574
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,900
have invited our students to perform.

575
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,620
Here.

576
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,580
Really impressive.

577
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,020
I never thought

578
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,980
our ballet circle
could get this much attention.

579
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,420
Yeah.

580
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,380
Look.

581
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,260
Ms. Zhuang,

582
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,820
I have to propose a toast.

583
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,700
As long as the cup is full,

584
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
coffee counts as wine.

585
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,500
Here's to our school's original vision

586
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,020
finally being realized!

587
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,580
Bottoms up!

588
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,780
Ms. Guan,

589
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,700
do you remember this one?

590
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,340
From the competition.

591
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,660
Excellent.

592
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,940
I remember that girl.

593
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,100
This one is good too.

594
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,940
Look.

595
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,460
Ting.

596
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,620
Madam.

597
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,140
We're going to be extremely busy.

598
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,140
It's all thanks to you.

599
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,380
Madam, I plan to return to Paris.

600
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,500
With him?

601
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,500
What about the child?

602
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,620
Him too.

603
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,540
But it will take a little more time.

604
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,060
For now, I can still handle
the school work.

605
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,140
Alright.

606
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,180
That's a real shame.

607
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,740
But

608
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,660
I'll say it again.

609
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Whatever you decide,

610
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,820
I support you.

611
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,540
Hello?

612
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,860
Look at that, miracles do happen.

613
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,500
You actually called me?

614
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,540
Mom and Dad came over last night.

615
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,700
They brought a bunch of groceries.

616
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,020
Your share is here with me too.

617
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,260
Come get it all tonight.
I don't want it.

618
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,100
Okay. Got it.

619
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,900
I'm hanging up.

620
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,700
How's that 20 million you mentioned

621
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,460
coming along?

622
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,260
Do you still need me
to help you figure it out?

623
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,020
Now you're asking me?

624
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:28,940
Let me tell you,

625
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,580
I found a solution myself.

626
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,260
Oh, Yuan,

627
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,980
do you remember a neighbor we had

628
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,620
when we were little named Tiantian?

629
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,420
The one who always played marbles

630
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,140
with us

631
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,340
and kept losing to us?

632
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:40,980
Remember her?

633
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:42,860
Yeah.

634
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,580
Didn't she transfer away later?

635
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,100
Yes.

636
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,820
Seems she's back in the country now.

637
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,780
She started
some investment company here.

638
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,140
What's her company called?

639
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,300
Fengjin Investment.

640
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,300
And she even said
if there are good projects,

641
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,500
she'd bring me in on them.

642
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
Don't rush into it.

643
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,260
You haven't seen each other for years.

644
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Better to be cautious.

645
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,540
Alright.

646
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,100
I get it.

647
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,660
You sound like a broken record.

648
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,340
Bye.

649
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,740
Two, three.

650
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:31,980
Go.

651
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,140
Watch your heads.

652
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,420
Heads up. Yes.

653
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,340
Look at yourselves in the mirror.

654
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Hands. Hand positions.

655
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,940
Toes. Point your toes.

656
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
Good.

657
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,180
Opposite side.

658
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,620
Not bad.

659
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,180
Watch your calves. Calves.

660
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,460
Tighter.

661
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
Hand positions.

662
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,260
Good.

663
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,260
Opposite side.

664
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,700
Heads up.

665
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,820
Good.

666
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,940
I need to take this call.

667
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,100
Hello, Dad.

668
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,300
[Payphone]
Ting!

669
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,780
You finally called me.

670
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,060
Are you okay?
How have you been?

671
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,500
It's not easy

672
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,500
for me to get to town.

673
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,180
Today, Dolma and the others
came here to buy things,

674
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,020
so I tagged along.

675
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,100
I'm doing fine. Don't worry.

676
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,460
How have you been lately?

677
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,340
I've been good.

678
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:28,860
Oh, Dad,

679
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,500
I want to tell you something.

680
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,900
Feng Rui and I are back together.

681
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,340
Really?

682
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,020
That's wonderful!

683
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,180
I could tell last time.

684
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,540
But you just wouldn't admit it.

685
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,340
That's great.

686
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,420
I wish you both happiness.

687
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,300
Thank you.

688
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,180
[Store]
So,

689
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,660
what are your plans now?

690
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,300
France?

691
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,100
Going to live there?

692
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,180
Yes.

693
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,020
Because of his mom?

694
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:03,900
Okay.

695
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,380
As long as you're happy,

696
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,340
I'll support you no matter where you go.

697
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,260
Dad.

698
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
You've been coughing a lot.

699
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,260
I've told you before.

700
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,060
You should go see a doctor.

701
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,860
I'm fine.

702
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,140
Yesterday, I helped a cow give birth.

703
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,300
Probably caught a bit of a chill.

704
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,660
You must take good care of your health.

705
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,540
Ting,

706
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,340
their car is here.
I should head back now.

707
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,460
Next time I get a chance,

708
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:34,980
I'll...

709
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,420
I'll come to town and call you.

710
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,100
Don't worry.

711
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
I'm doing just fine.

712
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,180
You take care.

713
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:43,740
I'm hanging up.

714
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,140
Zu,

715
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,620
what if we use the money we have on hand

716
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,540
for some

717
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,100
high-return short-term investments?

718
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:02,940
Shuhan,

719
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,260
all investments carry risk.

720
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,380
The company can't afford
any risks right now.

721
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,420
But delaying the construction timeline

722
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,740
is also a risk.

723
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,420
Thank you for sharing the burden.

724
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,820
But the company
will have some project payments

725
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,060
coming in within the next two weeks.

726
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,780
So I asked Sun

727
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,540
to wait a bit longer.

728
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,380
Don't worry.

729
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,740
I'll get back to work.

730
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,460
Shuhan,

731
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,060
I managed to squeeze out a spot for you.

732
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,700
An institution is currently looking

733
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,660
to acquire our first-phase equity fund.

734
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,660
I'll figure out a way

735
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,980
to get you an early payout from it.

736
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,060
It shouldn't take more than a week.

737
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,500
Tiantian, it's me.

738
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,340
I got your message.

739
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,420
Thank you so much.

740
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,860
You really did me a huge favor.

741
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,740
Here's the situation now.

742
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,460
I'm short by 15 million.

743
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,100
So, how much do you think

744
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,340
I should invest in that project

745
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,100
to earn back the money I need

746
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
in the shortest time possible?

747
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,700
That would require an investment
of 7.5 million.

748
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,300
And the sooner, the better.

749
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,460
Because we're about to close the round.

750
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,340
7.5 million.

751
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:20,940
Yes.

752
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,620
I remember you said

753
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,460
that we had to sign in the name

754
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,580
of a company.

755
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,540
You need this urgently,

756
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,140
but our company
has a lot of regulations,

757
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,300
so signing the contract

758
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,940
might take too much time.

759
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:34,900
Alright.

760
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,940
Because you need the money urgently.

761
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,940
We actually aren't supposed to
operate that way.

762
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,380
We'll definitely need
a company contract later.

763
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,900
No problem.

764
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,500
Tiantian, thank you so much.

765
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,780
When you're back in the country,

766
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,620
I'll treat you to a proper feast.

767
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,260
You're welcome.

768
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,620
I'm returning tomorrow.

769
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,860
Think it over.

770
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,260
Transfer the money to me by tomorrow.

771
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,180
No need to wait that long.

772
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,820
We've been classmates for so long.

773
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,900
This afternoon will do. Wait for me.

774
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,500
Ms. Sun.

775
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,860
Okay.

776
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,860
Ms. Wang,

777
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,140
the mortgage procedures
for all your assets

778
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,020
have been completed.

779
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,940
[Debtor's Signature]

780
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,860
Alright. I've finished signing.

781
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,100
Here. Thank you.

782
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,060
You're welcome.

783
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,060
Oh,

784
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,180
and please check

785
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,380
your balance information.

786
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,820
Here's your ID.

787
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,340
Thank you.

788
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,740
I'll leave you to it then. I'm off.

789
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,020
Okay.

790
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,900
It should be fine.

791
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,940
Hello, what's up?

792
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,460
I looked into your classmate

793
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Sun Tiantian's company.

794
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,460
Something seems off.

795
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,540
What do you mean, off?

796
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,540
This company
isn't registered domestically at all.

797
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,460
It's a major international company.

798
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,340
An international company, understand?

799
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,540
The company is based overseas.

800
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,380
And many overseas companies

801
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,580
are now investing

802
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,420
in domestic projects.
What's so strange about that?

803
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,380
No,

804
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,620
if she's doing business domestically,

805
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,380
shouldn't she register the company here?

806
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,700
Let me tell you,

807
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,140
that is a major international company.

808
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,460
It's huge.

809
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,100
They even invested

810
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,860
in our sports complex project.

811
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,060
I had to beg and plead

812
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,420
just to get a tiny share

813
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,300
to do business with them.

814
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,660
Stop being so paranoid.

815
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,620
Wang Shuhan!

816
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,780
Haven't you been burned enough
over the years?

817
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,900
You're nearly 40 years old.

818
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,420
Aren't you familiar with these kinds

819
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,300
of "scam a friend" schemes by now?

820
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,700
I'm just giving you a friendly reminder.

821
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,540
I'm worried you'll get cheated!

822
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,620
All these years...

823
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,380
"All these years" again.

824
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,420
Can you stop saying that?

825
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,580
Listen,

826
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,500
I promise you

827
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
this is the last time.

828
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,900
I'm absolutely doing things properly

829
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,140
this time.

830
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:55,860
Okay?

831
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,700
I'm hanging up.

832
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,980
It'll definitely be fine.

833
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,540
Tiantian,

834
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,500
I've got everything sorted on my side.

835
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,700
I'll wait for your news then.

836
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,040
[Yuanxin Bank]

837
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,940
So,

838
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,660
you could say you've contributed

839
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,540
to Ms. Zhuang's school.

840
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,820
I suppose so.

841
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,060
The happiest part

842
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,620
is contributing to the dance world.

843
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,420
I'm feeling a bit proud.

844
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,700
Ms. Great Artist,

845
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
may I have the honor

846
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,340
of taking you out for a meal?

847
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,460
I happen to be free tonight.

848
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,900
How about

849
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,860
we pick the most expensive restaurant?

850
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,460
Sure.

851
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,580
You choose.

852
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,500
Lin.

853
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,700
Yes, go ahead.

854
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,700
Please take us
to the nearest Cantonese restaurant.

855
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,700
The recommended destination

856
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
is 10.5 kilometers away.

857
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
Shall we go there?

858
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,820
That's a bit far.

859
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,700
The traffic is terrible.

860
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,620
How about

861
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,660
eating at home instead?

862
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,460
Your place?

863
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,100
Le isn't home these couple of days.

864
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,100
We can have some time
for just the two of us.

865
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,340
Then find the nearest supermarket.

866
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,300
Okay.

867
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,900
Go to the nearest supermarket,

868
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,060
then head home.

869
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,940
Found the following navigation route.

870
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,900
Ready to go.

871
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,580
We had a deal.

872
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,420
You're the chef tonight.

873
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,860
Okay.

874
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,620
You can be my assistant.

875
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,180
Okay.

876
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,140
Bye, Mr. Lu.

877
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,020
Okay. Bye.

878
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,260
Bye.

879
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,260
Bye.

880
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:54,780
Okay.

881
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,700
Let me help you.

882
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,300
Alright. I've got it.

883
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,420
Can you carry that?

884
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,260
Tonight, we're cooking...

885
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,940
a feast.

886
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,100
Come in.

887
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,980
Have a seat. I'll wash the vegetables.

888
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,660
Okay.

889
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,060
Let me show you around.

890
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,020
This is Le's room.

891
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,420
Take a look.
I'll go wash the vegetables.

892
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,380
I'll help you.

893
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,900
Alright. Then you shell the peas.

894
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,420
Who is it?

895
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:07,860
Le.

896
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,340
Le.

897
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:15,780
You're back.

898
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,860
Ms. Tan?

899
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,620
Le.

900
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,140
Weren't you at Grandma's house?

901
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,140
We thought you were staying
at Grandma's.

902
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,820
Are you two

903
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,780
dating?

904
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,900
When did it start?

905
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,660
Dad.

906
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,860
We should be honest, right?

907
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,380
Yes.

908
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,900
Do you remember

909
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,580
my last business trip

910
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,540
to Hongyuan County
in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan?

911
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,620
That's when it started.

912
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:53,740
Le,

913
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,460
are you unhappy that your dad and I

914
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,500
are dating?

915
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,540
Actually, whether he dates or not
doesn't really concern me.

916
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,260
But Ms. Tan,

917
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,900
why didn't you tell me?

918
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,340
It's not that I didn't want to tell you.

919
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,340
I've been completely open with you.

920
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,820
I've told you everything.

921
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,140
But why did you keep hiding it from me?

922
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,740
It was my dad's voice
on the phone that day,

923
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,260
wasn't it?

924
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,660
But you told me it was your colleague's.

925
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,820
I'm sorry I lied to you.

926
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,940
If I hadn't found out myself,

927
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,380
how long were you planning to
keep hiding it from me?

928
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,780
Ms. Tan,

929
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,180
I considered you my best friend.

930
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,260
But you just see me as a kid, don't you?

931
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,260
I...

932
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,140
Ms. Tan and I

933
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,700
always wanted to tell you.

934
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,540
We just wanted to find

935
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,980
the right time.

936
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,540
Ms. Tan,

937
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,780
you've always known me well.

938
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,980
Or

939
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,260
did you deliberately get close to me

940
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,340
and become friends with me

941
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,140
just for my dad?

942
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,460
Feng Lexuan!

943
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,700
We

944
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,300
never intended to deceive you.

945
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,420
The situation is just a bit complicated.

946
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,700
We had our reasons for not telling you.

947
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,420
Do you remember when I gave you a...

948
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:16,900
Le,

949
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,060
this

950
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,020
is my fault.

951
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,900
I shouldn't have kept things from you.

952
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,660
I apologize.

953
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,580
But just now you said

954
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,780
I got close to you because of your dad.

955
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,620
I swear

956
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,260
that's absolutely not true.

957
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,860
I hope you can believe me.

958
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:18,620
Here.

959
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:42,860
Tiantian,

960
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
I remember
you're returning tonight, right?

961
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,100
I'll pick you up from the airport then.

962
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
Let's have dinner tonight.

963
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,860
Something came up last minute.

964
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,460
I might need to stay here
for a few more days.

965
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,460
It's fine.

966
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,100
Well,

967
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,220
focus on your work.

968
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,340
Let me know

969
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,500
as soon as you're back.

970
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,260
I'll pick you up.

971
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,660
Here, have some more.

972
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,180
Okay. I know.

973
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,300
Oh,

974
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,380
I have a business trip to Shanghai.

975
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,020
Contact me anytime

976
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,220
if anything comes up at the company.

977
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,900
What could possibly happen
at the company now?

978
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,940
I'm just

979
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,060
waiting for our project to start.

980
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,220
I'm going on this trip

981
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,420
to get the project started faster too.

982
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,340
I know.

983
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,820
By the way, how long will you be gone?

984
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,900
I'll be back within a week.

985
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,580
A week.

986
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,780
I'll have a surprise for you

987
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,100
when you get back.

988
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,780
What surprise?

989
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,940
If I told you now,

990
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,220
would it still be a surprise?

991
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,940
Now you've got me

992
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,460
looking forward to coming back
before I've even left.

993
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,940
To your surprise.

994
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,380
Here.

995
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,420
- Cheers.
- Okay.

996
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,420
Oh,

997
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,580
what was the name of the friend
or classmate

998
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,260
you mentioned the other day?

999
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,380
Tiantian? Sun Tiantian.

1000
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,700
Sun Tiantian.

1001
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,460
Didn't I mention her at the company?

1002
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:09,940
Yes.

1003
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,860
When we met her that day,

1004
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,460
she said

1005
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,100
she invested
in our sports complex project.

1006
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,980
I think she did say that.

1007
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,300
That's strange then.

1008
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,100
I went to Sun from Tongjie today

1009
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,580
specifically to check the investor list.

1010
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,380
I didn't see that name.

1011
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,780
For such a large project,

1012
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,180
she probably couldn't invest
as an individual, right?

1013
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,820
But I didn't see the name Fengjin

1014
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,380
either.

1015
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,580
Not even the company name?

1016
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,180
That can't be right.

1017
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,260
Maybe she wants to invest
but hasn't yet.

1018
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,740
Zu, take your time eating.

1019
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,220
I'm going to the bathroom.

1020
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,940
Tiantian, have you decided
when you're coming back?

1021
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,340
Don't you think his behavior
is a bit off today?

1022
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,660
His attitude

1023
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
wasn't what I expected.

1024
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,980
You mean him suddenly

1025
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,740
asking if we're dating?

1026
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,860
It's been 12 years, after all.

1027
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,580
He's never had a mom.

1028
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,340
If we suddenly tell him

1029
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,020
I'm his mom,

1030
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,660
can Le accept it?

1031
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,340
So I'm wondering

1032
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,860
if we should

1033
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,700
wait for a more suitable moment

1034
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:46,980
to tell him?

1035
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,060
Okay.

1036
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:51,740
Whatever you say.

1037
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,780
And you said

1038
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,700
he'd stay at your mom's
for a couple of days.

1039
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,580
Why did he suddenly come back?

1040
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,140
Never mind.

1041
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,180
Go upstairs now.

1042
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,140
Le is home alone.

1043
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,100
I'm leaving.

1044
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Alright.

1045
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,100
Be careful on your way.

1046
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,380
Let me know when you get home.

1047
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:12,780
Okay.

1048
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,100
Go upstairs now.

1049
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,740
Buckle up.

1050
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,300
Let's go, sir.

1051
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,860
Ready, sir.

1052
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,300
I'm leaving.

1053
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:21,620
