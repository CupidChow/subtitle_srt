19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,540
Yes.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,180
Okay.

Ms. Zhuang.

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,660
How's your foot?

24
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,490
Tomorrow is the last review.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,330
It's almost healed.

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,460
Must get it checked thoroughly .

27
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,690
As a ballerina,

28
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,180
don't take your foot injury lightly.

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,130
Will Mr. Wang go with you?

30
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,380
He's been running around for you lately.

31
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,060
I heard

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,690
you've known each other for a long time.

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,780
Yes.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,780
Yes.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,570
Is he your good friend's brother?

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,450
Yes.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,820
No wonder.

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,410
Then this relationship goes way back.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,940
Last time, as he donated,

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,570
I knew he was doing it because of you.

41
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,850
Now that you got injured,

42
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,260
he was more worried than I was.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,780
I think he's serious about you.

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,730
There's

45
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,890

He's like my younger brother.

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,890
I understand.

I'm not an expert in this area,

52
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,130
so I won't advise you.

However,

54
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,890
I hope for a relationship,

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,610
you won't choose the hardest path,

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,660
as you do with ballet.

57
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,500
Be good to yourself.

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,450
Sometimes, giving yourself a chance

Alright.

how is her recovery?

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,130
She's recovering very well.

66
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,890
Don't worry.

67
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,340
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

68
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,130
You're welcome.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,730
Still need to be careful later.

70
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,130
Although it has recovered,

71
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,060
she shouldn't run or jump.

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,610
Also, don't walk too much,

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,610
but a little walking is fine.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,340
Okay.

75
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,780
And no strenuous exercise

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,340
or the like.

77
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,060
Be careful.

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,450
It's okay. The doctor said it's fine.

79
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,610
You're more nervous than I am.

80
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,610
This foot is so important to you.

81
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,130
Ordinary people don't mind

82
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,940
even if we become lame.

83
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,890
Yuan, thank you.

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,450
How will you thank me?

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,690
I'll treat you to a big meal.

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,690
Okay.

88
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,780
Come to my house tomorrow.

I'll cook for you.

90

Be careful.

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,220
Careful.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,730
Where are we going today?

93
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,410
Let's open more blind boxes.

94
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,580
Your taste

95
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,810
is very polarizing.

96
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,810
Is it interesting?

97
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,170
Yeah.

98
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,050
Do you like this place?

99
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,700
Yes.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,170
Your decor style

101
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,170
and this atmosphere

102
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,170
don't quite match the first impression

103
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,290
I had to you.

104
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,290
I like things with contrast.

105
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,580
So I have to get

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,170
to know you more in the future.

107
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,610
How have you and Yuan been lately?

108
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,100
Interested in him?

109
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,250
No.

110
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,900
You mentioned him
when you were drunk that day,

111
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,700
saying you weren't getting along.

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,810
That day

113
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,610
when I was drunk,

114
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,490
did I say nonsense?

115
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,900
Anything I shouldn't have?

116
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,700
No.

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,610
You didn't want to talk,
so I didn't ask.

118
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,930
Nothing serious.

119
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,370
He likes someone who I feel

120
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,930
won't lead to a good outcome.

121
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,460
And I'm afraid he'll get hurt,

122
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,340
but he won't listen to what I say.

123
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,140
From a human perspective,

124
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,370
the closer someone is to you,

125
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,610
the more likely you are
to resist their advice.

126
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,370
But Yuan will understand you.

127
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,780
Things will get better slowly.

128
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,930
After all,
blood ties can never be broken.

129
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,140
Hopefully.

130
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,020
Let me tell you,

131
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,490
if he hadn't bought me

132
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,370
my house,

133
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,020
I'd have cut him off long ago.

134
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,700
Don't say that.

135
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,140
Look at me.

136
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,700
Last year, I lost my only older brother.

137
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,730
Sometimes

138
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,700
when I'm facing this world alone,

139
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,700
I often think

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,020
how nice it would be to bicker

141
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,780
and fuss

142
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,020
with someone.

143
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,580
Sorry, Zu.

144
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,370
I shouldn't have said that.

145
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,020
Shuhan,

146
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,810
I...

147
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,580
I know

148
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,370
maybe we're moving too fast.

149
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,370
But,

150
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,250
but I never take things lightly.

151
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,370
The day I met you,

152
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,140
I had a familiar feeling.

153
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,490
It was like

154
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,140
I'd been searching for you
for a long time.

155
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,370
I'm not asking you
to believe in love now,

156
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,580
but could you try

157
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,730
to trust me?

158
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,410
Shuhan's relationship this time

159
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,410
is different from usual.

160
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,250
How so?

161
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,610
She's incredibly infatuated.

162
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,020
Incredibly infatuated?

163
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,490
Yeah.

164
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,340
She keeps talking to me

165
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,370
about

166
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,020
different things about Zu.

167
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,100
It's so annoying.

168
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,610
Has her IQ dropped?

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,140
Right.

170
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,140
So annoying.

171
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,850
But don't gossip about her

172
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,900
or bring up rumors to me,

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,250
or I'll tell her.

174
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,130
She won't let you go.

175
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,130
I'm not scared.

176
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,130
You can pass that along to her.

177
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,010
So tasty.

178
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,650
Absolutely!

Rivals any Michelin-starred restaurant.

180
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,650
Alright, stop it.

181
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,650
I know my own cooking skills.

182
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,420
I'm very aware of my limits.

183
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,490
I'm not exaggerating.

184
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,530
Every word is true.

185
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,370
And

186
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,850
since you cooked,

187
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,530
I'll do the dishes.

188
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,010
Yuan,

189
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,490
hold on a moment.

190
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,010
I need to tell you something.

191
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,100
I'm grateful for everything

192
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,980
you've done for me during this time.

193
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,890
But now that my foot has healed,

194
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,610
right?

195
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,850
So I think

196
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,370
we should

197
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,220
return to our own lives
and separate paths.

198
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,650
Don't need to go out of your way

199
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,890
to look after me like before.

200
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,490
I knew it.

201
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,730
Inviting me here and cooking for me

202
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,370
wouldn't be that simple.

203
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,530
No.

204
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,010
The point is, you have to work

205
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,850
and handle your things.

206
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,010
Don't waste time on me.

207
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,890
So, this is the Last Supper, huh?

208
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,650
To be honest,

209
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,250
since I came back,

210
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,490
I'm truly, deeply grateful

211
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,370
to you for caring for me

212
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,490
and bustling about with my affairs.

213
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,130
Especially in this past month,

214
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,490
if it weren't for you,

215
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,340
with my injury,

216
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,250
I would've suffered so much more.

217
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,890
I did all of this willingly.

218
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,610
Don't keep thanking me.

219
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,890
But I can't give you what you want.

220
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,610
I'm not asking for anything special.

221
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,300
Just like you said,

222
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,730
when you need someone by your side,

223
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,890
I can take care of you.

224
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,220
Is that so difficult?

225
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,100
What I'm trying to say is,

226
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,530
if I've been holding you back,

227
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,770
I'll be very ashamed.

228
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,010
I understand.

229
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,010
Actually, in this past month,

230
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,370
I'm very grateful to you.

231
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,490
I was so happy.

232
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,980
It felt like a dream,

233
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,370
so real.

234
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,010
If only time would slow down a bit more.

235
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,010
And I have a hope too.

236
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,850
I hope we can be lifelong good friends.

237
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,300
Of course.

238
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,530
For life.

239
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,980
Not a single day less.

240
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,530
Come on.

241
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,250
A toast to friendship.

242
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,250
And to my best brother.

243
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,490
Rest.

244
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,300
I'll clean up.

245
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,890
That won't do.

246
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,220
It's fine.

247
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,300
A healthy person

248
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,370
doesn't need help.

249
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:53,890
Ting,

250
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,890
sorry.

251
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,650
I got stuck in traffic on my way here.

252
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,530
Late again.

253
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,610
It's fine. I just arrived.

254
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,730
I've ordered.

255
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,460
You're looking great today.

256
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,650
I haven't come to see you these days.

257
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,220
How's your foot?

258
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,610
Recovered a couple of days ago.

259
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,250
All good.

260
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:09,890
Healed up?

261
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,010
Alright.

262
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,370
How do you like this watch
I bought recently?

263
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:16,890
Is it nice?

264
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,980
Yes,

265
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,490
it suits you well.

266
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,300
Oh, by the way,

267
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,420
have you ordered?

268
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,530
I just said

269
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,130
I had ordered.

270
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,890
Oh, you ordered.

271
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,980
Well, bring it on then. I'm hungry.

272
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,610
What have you been busy with lately?

273
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,730
Just busy stuff, you know.

274
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,610
You didn't answer my question.

275
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,370
What have you been busy with lately?

276
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,010
Are you in love?

277
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,250
Is it that obvious?

278
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,980
It's written all over your face.

279
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,220
I'm seeing someone.

280
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,010
How's it going?

281
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,650
We're in the honeymoon phase now.

282
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,010
Of course, it's the sweetest time.

283
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,490
But the main thing is,

284
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,420
I used to feel like

285
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,130
love wasn't meant for me.

286
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,370
I was ready to give up on it.

287
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,490
But I never expected

288
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,980
that love was waiting for me.

289
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,730
I think this one feels pretty solid.

290
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,730
Your state seems pretty good.

291
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,180
Congratulations.

292
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,700
Different from those before.

293
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,780
This place's food is good.

294
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,060
Of course, I picked it.

295
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,700
Siting,

296
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:22,940
how's

297
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,180
that thing going?

298
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,060
You know,

299
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:25,940
Le.

300
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,460
I

301
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,420
saw him again later on.

302
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,700
Recognized each other?

303
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,420
No.

304
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,020
I think he's doing pretty well now.

305
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,660
I don't know

306
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,660
if I should disturb him.

307
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,260
If I suddenly tell him

308
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,420
that I'm his mother,

309
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,660
would it give him a huge shock?

310
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,180
So, I want

311
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,700
to sort things out clearly

312
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
and be fully prepared

313
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,660
before telling him.

314
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,060
And he likes me quite a lot now.

315
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,420
What do you think?

316
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,780
If I tell him

317
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,540
I'm his mother,

318
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,940
will he hate me?

319
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
Indeed.

320
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,060
You need to think this through.

321
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm going to wrap things up at school.

322
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,300
It'll take me a long time

323
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,540
to find my dad.

324
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,300
This is the most important thing

325
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,820
for me right now.

326
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,060
Tan Siting,

327
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,020
no matter what you do,

328
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,900
I'll support you.

329
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,060
And whatever happens,

330
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,940
tell me.

331
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,460
I'll be right there on the front line.

332
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,300
Focus on your relationship.

333
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,300
Staying in good spirits is helping me.

334
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,780
Don't worry.

335
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,300
When should I meet

336
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,300
this right one of yours?

337
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,580
Yeah.

338
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,820
I'll bring him over when the time comes.

339
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,260
Give him your thorough approval.

340
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,580
Absolutely.

341
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,180
Come on.

342
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,660
Let me tell you,

343
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,140
I'm deeply in love with him.

344
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,260
Congratulations to you.

345
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,940
Hello. Whose drink is this?

346
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,060
Alright, watch.

347
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,780
Cut this at this point.

348
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,380
Got it?

349
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,180
Hello.

350
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,660
Yes, fifteen drinks.

351
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,340
Fifteen.

352
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,580
Sorry.

353
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,140
We're closed.

354
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,980
Come back tomorrow.

355
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,380
I made this.

356
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:30,980
Try it.

357
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,580
Thanks.

358
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,380
It tastes good.

359
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,620
Have you been doing well these days?

360
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,740
Not bad.

361
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,500
Is work tiring?

362
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,860
Not really.

363
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,740
Do you like your life now?

364
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,460
That's life.

365
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,860
Taste its sweetness and bitterness.

366
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,060
Have you tasted them?

367
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,260
How should I put it?

368
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
When I was nine,

369
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,740
my mother left me.

370
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,340
On the day she left,

371
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,700
I cried and clung to her waist,

372
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,740
begging her not to go.

373
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,940
But in the end, she walked away.

374
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,580
And after that?

375
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
My dad and I relied on each other.

376
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,860
Even though I didn't have a mother,

377
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,860
I got all of my father's love.

378
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,340
I know my dad would give

379
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,780
absolutely everything for me,

380
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
so even without my mother,

381
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,340
my dad

382
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,100
made sure I felt like

383
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,140
growing up in a complete

384
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,140
and warm home.

385
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,140
Back then, I always believed

386
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,380
that in this lifetime,

387
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,300
I'd never be separated from my dad.

388
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,940
Want to hear more?

389
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,620
Alright.

390
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,140
I'll tell you everything.

391
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,900
Twelve years ago,

392
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,700
something terrible happened.

393
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,860
My dad suddenly

394
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,780
left me.

395
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,660
And not long after that,

396
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,660
the person I loved most in my life

397
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,780
left me too.

398
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,060
Suddenly, I had nothing.

399
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,100
My whole world collapsed.

400
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Living was hard,

401
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,300
and I was lost.

402
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,900
When I wanted to give up,

403
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,140
Ms. Zhuang told me...

404
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,340
Right now, you feel like

405
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,660
the whole world has abandoned you,

406
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,580
but that's just how you feel.

407
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,340
Besides, don't forget,

408
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,860
no matter what,

409
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,780
you at least still have ballet.

410
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,780
You're

411
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,100
an excellent ballerina.

412
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,860
You're still that girl
who can't be crushed.

413
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,340
Right?

414
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,300
So I put on my ballet shoes
without hesitation.

415
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,340
No music,

416
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
no choreography,

417
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
only the pain and cries from within.

418
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,180
After that period of time,

419
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,340
I felt

420
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,820
life was kind to me.

421
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,700
I was fortunate.

422
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,660
We'll encounter

423
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,900
various problems and difficulties.

424
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,860
Many times, there are no solutions.

425
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,700
But as long as I can dance,

426
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,660
I feel like I'm truly alive.

427
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,660
Ballet

428
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,340
gave me a way to live.

429
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,580
During the darkest days of my life,

430
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,860
ballet was like a brilliant beam

431
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,900
of light,

432
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,420
shining into my world.

433
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,860
It turned my black-and-white life

434
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,780
into a colorful one.

435
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,260
So dance requires experience.

436
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,380
If not for that experience,

437
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,780
I wouldn't have been here

438
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,940
and talked to you today.

439
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,780
The atmosphere here is quite nice.

440
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,860

I'm back.

Fan,

453
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,420
why are you back so late today?

454
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,620
Your dad called you.
Why didn't you answer?

455
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,860
I got off work

456
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,900
and went out to clear my head.

457
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,340
Fan.

458
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,900
Fan,

459
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,860
you seem unhappy.

460
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,540
Mom,

461
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,900
when we face difficulties in life,

462
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,260
should we never give up?

463
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,900
Of course!

464
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,060
That's what we've taught you.

465
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,900
Then, on our life journey,

466
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,660
should we care about others' opinions?

467
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,340
Don't let them control you.

468
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,620
So, the biggest enemy in the journey

469
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,260
isn't others,

470
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,940
but ourselves.

Yeah, I don't quite get

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,700
I've thought it through.

477
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,900
I've decided to face it and accept it.

I'm going to bed now.

Fan's finally got it.

What did she figure out?

482
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,860
I need to call

She was practicing early in the morning.

490

Look how talented she is.

491
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
What a waste if she doesn't dance.

492
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,700
Exactly. She was born to do ballet.

493
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,060
And this turn.

494
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,900
When did she learn that?

495
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,740
She dances so beautifully.

496

So precise.

Of course not.

00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,220
I just wanted to tell you

766
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,140
the invitations have been finalized.

767
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,220
I think you'll probably like it.

768
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,620
No problem, you decide.

769
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,500
That's all then. I'll hang up.

770
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,220
Alright.

771
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:11,820
Peiyan,

772
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:12,940
thank you for your hard work.

773
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,820
Not at all.

774
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,100
It's my duty.

775
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,300
Okay.

776
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,220
Ms. Tan, I'm heading off.

777
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,660
Bye.

778
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,740
[Wen Peiyan]

779
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,420
With you.

780
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,880
[Le]

781
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,780
Ms. Tan,

782
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,220
do you think I'm cool?

783
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,700
[Tan Siting]
Of course, you're the coolest boy.

784
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,100
I came here last month.

785
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,540
Their Sichuan peppercorns
are tasty.

786
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,660
Are you here for peppercorns?

787
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,540
Thanks to Mr. Xu's kindness.

788
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,340
The local specialty is the peppercorn.

789
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,100
Yes.

790
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,660
This way.

791
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,180
Is this the place?

792
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,620
Yes.

793
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,620
Show us around.

794
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,060
In front.

795
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,660
You're all here.

796
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,020
Come here.

797
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,220
Ms. Zhuang, hello.

798
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,740
Look.

799
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,460
Last time we were filming,

800
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,220
they were too busy with work

801
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,020
to make it to the school.

802
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,820
Let me introduce.

803
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,540
This is

804
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,460
Mr. Xu.

805
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,820
This is Mr. Chen.

806
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
And this is Mr. Yu.

807
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,540
They are our school's backbone.

808
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,700
Without them,

809
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,740
we wouldn't be what we are today.

810
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,340
You're too kind.

811
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,740
Come here.

812
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,020
This is Tan Siting.

813
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,100
Ms. Tan.

814
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,060
Hello.

815
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:27,740
Hello, Ms. Tan.

816
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,100
And this is

817
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:28,940
Ms. Guan.

818
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,460
Hello.

819
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,100
I've said thank you too many times.

820
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,020
I'm

821
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,540
a lucky person.

822
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,100
That such a serious disaster has drawn

823
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,100
so many friends willing to help.

824
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,700
I'm truly touched.

825
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,540
We're all friends.

826
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,420
No need for formalities.

827
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,020
You're being too modest.

828
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,020
Mr. Feng,

829
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,220
we did that

830
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,580
because of your personal charisma.

831
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,020
That's absolutely true.

832
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,980
When we faced difficulties,

833
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,500
you didn't hesitate for a second

834
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,020
and helped us find outlets
for our grapes.

835
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,540
Now that you're in trouble,

836
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,540
we have to help you
even if we're not selling anything.

837
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,140
Well said.

838
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,020
Mr. Feng,

839
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,900
as the most authoritative
wine publication

840
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,620
in the country,

841
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,100
we set high standards

842
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,020
for featuring locally made wines.

843
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,900
Only Huacan from Mr. Wang's company

844
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,100
has been featured.

845
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,020
However, Cygne's wine

846
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,580
has impressed me this time.

847
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,580
A report will be arranged soon,

848
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,180
followed by online

849
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,620
and print media coverage.

850
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,460
Then

851
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,180
I propose

852
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,140
we all raise our glasses

853
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,260
to wish Cygne continued success.

854
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,180
- Good.
- Thank you.

855
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,860
Thank you.

856
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,500
You're welcome.

857
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,060
Congratulations, Mr. Feng.

858
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,940
Wish you greater success.

859
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,460
Greater success.

860
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,140
May your business prosper.

861
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:54,900
Excellent.

862
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,740
Okay, for the seventh one.

863
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,380
Then,

864
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,940
the speed is from 120

865
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,420
to 208.

866
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,700
Class is dismissed.

867
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,820
Okay.

868
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,620
Tired?

869
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,620
Be careful.

870
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,540
Or it may pinch your hand.

871
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
Speed up gradually from slow to fast.

872
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,340
Come on.

873
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,140
Your dad's promotion event

874
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,500
was a huge success.

875
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:19,900
Let me see.

876
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,220
Rui.

877
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,420
Dad looks quite cool in this shot.

878
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,020
Look at his poise.

879
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,060
Ms. Tan.

880
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:32,820
Where?

881
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,620
The one dancing in the back here.

882
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,500
This one.

883
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:37,740
See it?

884
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,540
It's really her.

885
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Is this a collaboration
with the ballet school?

886
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:45,900
Possibly.

887
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,220
Come on.

888
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,740
Have some fruit.

889
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,900
Try some of this.

890
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,220
Okay.

891
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:54,900
Here.

892
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,540
Thank you.

893
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,700
Thank you.

894
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,820
It's great. Try that peppercorn.

895
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,340
This bamboo shoot is excellent too.

896
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,580
Are you not on a diet?

897
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,460
But a bit spicy.

898
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,660
Ms. Tan,

899
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
I've heard so much about you.

900
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,980
Finally, meet you in person.

901
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,820
I feel so lucky.

902
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:15,860
You're not the only one!

903
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,100
My daughter is also a fan of yours.

904
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,220
Unfortunately,

905
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,980
she's studying abroad right now.

906
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,060
Otherwise,

907
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,820
she would have come with me today.

908
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
May I take a photo with you later?

909
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,260
She asked me to complete the task,

910
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,740
and I must get it done.

911
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,980
No problem.

912
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,740
The year before last in Paris, France,

913
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,180
I saw Ms. Tan perform on stage.

914
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
It was breathtaking.

915
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,580
So today, I feel incredibly honored

916
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,060
to have dinner with Ms. Tan.

917
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,580
So, let's make a toast.

918
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,980
You flattered me.

919
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,980
Here's to you.

920
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
Thank you for your presence today.

921
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,260
Let me toast you.

922
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,900
Mr. Xu,

923
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,460
Ms. Tan doesn't drink much.

924
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,820
Understood.

925
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,100
I'll finish mine. Take your time.

926
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,180
Ms. Tan finished it all!

927
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,460
Go easy on it.

928
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,900
Ting, are you okay?

929
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,100
I'm fine, Ms. Zhuang.

930
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,700
I wanted to have a little drink today.

931
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,980
Ms. Chen, please eat.

932
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:09,980
Look how thin you are.

933
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,820
Eat more.

934
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,700
Mr. Chen.

935
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,060
Mr. Chen.

936
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,860
Let me toast you.

937
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,460
Nice to meet you.

938
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,740
Let's have a drink together.

939
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,140
Come on.

940
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,460
Here.

941
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,340
Ms. Qin.

942
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,740
Alright, enjoy yourselves.

943
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,060
Yes.

944
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,940
Great.

945
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,020
When are you coming to Shanghai?

946
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,460
You planned to open a branch in Shanghai

947
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,900
to compete with me, right?

948
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,500
Who told you that? No way.

949
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,980
No way. Seriously.

950
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,500
But to be honest,

951
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,060
I used

952
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,060
to think

953
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,100
that as Ms. Gao's eldest son,

954
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
you may not be involved in the business.

955
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,740
Later on, I realized I was wrong.

956
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,540
The new generation surpasses the old.

957
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,420
With Cygne's current momentum,

958
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,740
soon you'll surpass Huacan.

959
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,780
Actually,

960
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,340
when we were the most indecisive,

961
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,620
we decided to take a gamble

962
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,460
and trust our own judgment.

963
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,460
In the end, we were quite lucky,

964
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,660
which led to a great collaboration.

965
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,540
To be honest,

966
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,820
Huacan

967
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,340
is quite traditional,

968
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
from organizational structure

969
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,820
to management system.

970
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,580
Should emulate innovative companies
like yours.

971
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,620
Your raw material cultivation technology

972
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,900
is more mature than ours.

973
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,660
Let's collaborate on a new wine,

974
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,900
and we'll call it Huacan Cygne.

975
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,300
That's a great idea!

976
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,660
This will work!

977
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,020
The wine will be a great success.

978
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,300
Come on. I'd like to make a toast.

979
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,460
This is a powerhouse partnership.

980
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,020
Deal!

981
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,500
- A powerhouse partnership.
- Indeed!

982
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,020
Sir,

983
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,100
the documentary just aired,

984
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,020
and it's hit 500,000 views!

985
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,660
Let me see.

986
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,020
And what's more…

987
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,660
we have more reason to drink now.

988
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,540
It's all positive reviews.

989
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,540
I'll take a look.

990
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:49,740
Come on, let me see again.

991
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,020
This is a great sign!

992
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,300
Come on, everyone.

993
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,380
Let's propose

994
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,660
a toast to Mr. Feng.

995
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,100
Congratulations!

996
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,660
A good omen.

997
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,180
A good sign.

998
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,180
Thank you.

999
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:58,820
Congratulations, Mr. Feng.

1000
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,740
Thank you.

1001
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,740
Is this the wine Mr. Yu brought?

1002
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,660
This is a remarkable wine.

1003
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,540
Thank you all so much.

1004
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,220
There's no more wine.

1005
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,860
Waiter!

1006
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,260
Bring us some baijiu.

1007
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,460
Don't drink anymore.

1008
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,020
Bring the baijiu?

1009
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,020
So happy.

1010
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,380
I'm happy today.

1011
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,260
We won't stop until we're drunk.

1012
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,420
Together.

1013
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,020
Come on.

1014
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,620
Here, Mr. Li.

1015
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,020
Come on.

1016
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,380
I'll take this call.

1017
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,100
Okay.

1018
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:38,900
Alright, alright.

1019
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,420
Mr. Bai.

1020
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,140
Don't let the atmosphere die down.

1021
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,860
Thank you.

1022
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:43,620
Yes.

1023
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,300
I saw it.

1024
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,620
Thank you for making it.

1025
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:47,780
Thank you.

1026
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,460
Definitely.

1027
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,700
There'll be more collaborations.

1028
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,420
Okay.

1029
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,620
