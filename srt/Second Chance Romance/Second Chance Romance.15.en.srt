00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,380
stay low-key.

When I was chatting with her earlier,

180
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,060
I asked how you met,

181
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,460
and she said

182
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,740
you were each other's first love.

183
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,780
I heard Ms. Tan got injured.
Did you know?

184
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,020
Yes. I was there.

185
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,340
Is it serious?

186
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
Probably not.

Where?

190
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,500
The one dancing in the back here.

191
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,020
Is this a collaboration
with the ballet school?

192
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,300
Possibly.

193
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,860
Come on.

194
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,240
Have some fruit.

195
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,140
Try some of this.

196
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,020
Thank you.

197
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:55,700
Be careful.

198
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,060
Quite a big company.

199
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,340
Located in this area,

200
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,140
the rent must be high.

201
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,500
It's just fine.

202
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,420
I planned to rent two floors,

203
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,340
but the lease for the upper floor
hasn't expired yet,

204
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
so I'll make do with this for now.

205
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,860
Making money is important,

206
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,260
but now, for me,

207
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,580
happiness matters most.

208
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,980
For example,

209
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,540
being with you right now.

210
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,900
As the owner

211
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,580
of a big company,

212
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,180
aren't you busy?

213
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,860
Well, a big company.

214
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,620
A company is like

215
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,780
gears arranged in order.

216
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,060
If I'm not there,

217
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,620
it won't run.

218
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,380
How long can it last then,

219
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,100
right?

220
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:57,900
But

221
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,140
if I get busy,

222
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,420
you might not see me for a long time.

223
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,780
That's okay.

224
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,980
If you're very busy,

225
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,180
I can come and help you.

226
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,700
Help me?

227
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,740
How?

228
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,300
Look,

229
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,220
while I might not know business,

230
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,740
I've got good people skills.

231
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,420
If you've got good people skills,

232
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,580
you'll always have customers.

233
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,820
I didn't notice this about you before.

234
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,180
Are you interested in doing business?

235
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,540
Yeah.

236
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,540
And I just told you

237
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,260
I love making money the most.

238
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,140
Great!

239
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,100
Then work hard.

240
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,940
Okay, Ms. Zhuang.

241
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,420
I understand.

242
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,860
I'll go back to school right now.

243
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,380
See you in a bit.

[Cygne, An Excellent Domestic Winery,

247
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,380
Sir,

248
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,060
take a look at this form.

249
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,420
Okay.

250
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,380
I'll get back to my work.

251
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:28,620
Okay.

252
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,620
The quantity you wanted.

253
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,460
Not bad.

254
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,220
It has a sweet aftertaste.

255
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,420
If you think it's fine, let's buy some.

256
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,460
How do you two

257
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,460
find the wine?

258
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
This wine is good.

259
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,620
Glad you like it.

260
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
It has a lingering aftertaste.

261
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,020
Great.

262
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,420
Well,

263
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,740
if there's no problem,

264
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,420
I'll send it to the address

265
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,300
you provided as usual.

266
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:48,980
Okay.

267
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:49,980
Thank you.

268
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,940
Alright, then.

269
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,940
We'll be going now.

270
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,860
We're leaving first.

271
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,300
Wait a moment.

272
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,740
I'll buy two bottles.

273
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,140
We'll taste them later.

274
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:55,780
Okay.

275
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,020
Thank you.

276
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,700
Is this a gift?

277
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,140
Yes.

Thank you.

We'll be going now.

283

Let me see you out.

284
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:02,980
Okay.

285
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,380
Thank you. Take care.

286

Is Mr. Feng in?

He's inside.

290

I need to see him now.

Okay, ASAP.

Okay.

Okay.

299
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,780
Mr. Feng, I'll be going now.

300
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,060
Alright.

301
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,020
This way, please.

302
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,540
Who took this photo? Where was it taken?

303
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:27,900
Look here.

304
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:28,820
This is my dad.

305
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,660
Where did you find this photo?

308
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,580
I...

309
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,940
I have an impression.

310
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,020
When we were distributing

311
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,020
at the winery's office door,

312
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,220
he seemed to come by driving a car.

313
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,700
Can

314
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,540
you…

315
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,220
But he didn't say anything.

316
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,380
Just dropped off the stuff and left.

317
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,820
So...

318
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,180
I...

319
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,660
I'll call and ask.

320
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,380
Okay.

321
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,700
Thanks.

322
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,780
Wait, I'll sign and confirm.

323
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,660
Take a look.

324
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,620
Mr. Feng?

325
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:22,660
Duoji.

326
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,140
Yes.

327
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,580
Let me ask you something.

328
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,780
I just sent you a photo.

329
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,540
I'm looking for

330
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,500
the person in the photo.

331
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,060
Do you remember?

332
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,860
When we were distributing supplies

333
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,420
at the winery,

334
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,380
a middle-aged man drove and helped.

335
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,420
He hardly spoke.

336
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,740
And he left after he put things down.

337
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,900
A middle-aged man?

338
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,860
Kind of remember. Why?

339
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,460
Could you find him?

340
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,060
That person...

341
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,620
I need to contact the station.

342
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,140
Mr. Feng,

343
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,060
I'll call you back later.

344
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,540
Okay.

345
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,020
The sooner, the better.

346
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Alright.

347
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,060
Waiting for your call.

348
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,540
Okay.

349
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,420
How is it? Can he find him?

350
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,140
He's helping. Might take some time.

351
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,180
Why

352
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,340
don't you have a seat?

353
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,260
Okay.

354
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,620
Wait a moment.

355
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:20,940
I'll get you a glass of water.

356
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,220
No need, I'm not thirsty.

357
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,500
Thanks.

358
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,020
He's calling.

359
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,300
Just a second.

360
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,060
Duoji.

361
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,380
Mr. Feng,

362
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,980
that person did do

363
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,940
some transport work for us.

364
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,020
Can you find his contact information?

365
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,900
He didn't leave

366
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,340
any contact details.

367
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,300
Those at the station

368
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
don't speak much Chinese,

369
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,500
so they didn't pay attention.

370
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,900
Is it possible he's still there?

371
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,740
I can't guarantee that.

372
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,100
I'll try to keep an eye out for it.

373
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,660
I'll call you if I find out anything.

374
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,580
Okay.

375
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,900
Please help me find him.

376
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:12,900
Alright. I will.

377
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,820
Okay, thanks.

378
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,460
I knew it wouldn't be so easy.

379
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,620
I want Duoji's current phone number.

380
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,500
I'll go over there now

381
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
and contact him.

382
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,100
Now?

383
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,220
Yes, now.

384
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,860
You haven't confirmed anything.

385
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,900
If you go over there now,

386
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,740
you'll search like a headless chicken.

387
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
But as they search like this,

388
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,100
what if they overlook him?

389
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,380
I finally got some news about my dad.

390
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,140
Don't worry,
he's sent people to look for him.

391
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,900
Once they find a clue, you can go over.

392
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,460
No. I really...

393
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,260
With just a photo,
I fear they'll miss him!

394
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,580
Because

395
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,940
that's my father!

396
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,140
I'd recognize him at a glance.

397
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,060
Please calm down.

398
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,420
How, Feng Rui?

399
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,940
It's been 12 years.

400
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,740
This isn't about you.

401
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,220
Finally, there's a clue.

402
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
I've had this dream so many times.

403
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,020
In...

404
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,500
In my dreams,

405
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,180
I always find my dad.

406
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,020
But in the end?

407
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,380
Nothing.

408
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,380
Now I've finally got news.

409
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,220
And you tell me to calm down.

410
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:08,700
Tell me,

411
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,740
how am I supposed to be calm?

412
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,860
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,060
My apologies.

414
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:20,700
It's alright.

415
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,260
How is he now?

416
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,340
He...

417
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,180
He's doing very well.

418
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:39,700
Okay.

419
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,420
Don't worry.

420
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,140
So

421
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,340
your father has been in Hongyuan County,

422
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,620
in Sichuan's Aba Prefecture.

423
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,460
I think so.

424
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,220
Now we can't get by without a phone.

425
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,820
Let alone contacting people,

426
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,460
even buying things,

427
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,220
we need our phone to pay.

428
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
But the telecom company

429
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,300
can't find his usage history.

430
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,020
So, most likely,

431
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,220
he's in a completely isolated

432
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,220
and self-sufficient environment.

433
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,180
I think so.

434
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,100
So I'd like to ask for some time off.

435
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,660
I'm going to go over there.

436
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,340
Alright.

437
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,580
Decide these things for yourself.

438
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,900
Prepare everything you need

439
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,500
before you set off.

440
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,460
Remember

441
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,540
to let us know
you're safe while traveling.

442
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,420
If anything comes up,

443
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,020
contact me right away.

444
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,900
I know.

445
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,460
Ms. Tan.

446
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,300
Ms. Wei.

447
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,420
Ms. Tan,

448
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,940
I'd like to treat you and Uncle Wang
to dinner tonight.

449
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,980
If he hadn't invited Ms. Dong,

450
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,660
my foot wouldn't have healed
in a short time.

451
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,020
I wanted to thank you.

452
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,700
Sure.

453
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,620
Yufan, can I join you?

454
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,420
I haven't seen Uncle Wang in ages.

455
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,780
Of course.

456
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,100
And if you hadn't tipped us off,

457
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
he wouldn't have come.

458
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
See you tonight.

459
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,620
Alright.

460
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,380
This one.

461
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
We're not picking it.

462
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,780
We're picking...

463
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,620
Look, I like this one of Ms. Wen.

464
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
How happy her smile is!

465
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,020
I smiled happily,

466
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,580
right?

467
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,220
Pick one of my handsome photos.

468
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:14,860
You...

469
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,540
So great!

470
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,180
Looks great.

471
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,220
This one of yours is good.

472
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,700
Put this one in the living room.

473
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,260
This one works too.

474
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,620
That won't do.

475
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,660
This one.

476
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,700
You keep thinking about...

477
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,180
You're back.

478
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:25,780
Mom.

479
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,260
Rui,

480
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,180
welcome back.

481
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,500
Look.

482
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,420
Which one?

483
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,820
Rui,

484
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,540
come here and choose.

485
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,020
This one's okay.

486
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,940
Is this one good?

487
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,900
I think this one...

488
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,980
Look how your dad's smiling.

489
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,740
It's a bit unnatural.

490
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,540
Right, it's not quite right.

491
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,260
Isn't it?

492
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:41,660
This one.

493
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:41,820
Right.

494
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,780
I'm not a huge fan of this one.

495
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,700
Which one do you like?

496
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,300
This one.

497
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,300
This one.

498
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,140
I feel like

499
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,380
this one.

500
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:51,780
No.

501
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,140
This one.

502
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,180
This is the one.

503
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:54,580
Yes, this one.

504
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:54,900
This one.

505
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,220
Rui,

506
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,100
look!

507
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,540
How about

508
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,140
putting this one in your bedroom?

509
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:01,940
Mom,

510
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,100
nobody hangs wedding photos these days.

511
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:05,940
Thanks.

512
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,620
But Rui is right.

513
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,180
Nowadays,

514
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,940
it's not that popular anymore.

515
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,140
I like hanging things on the wall!

516
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,500
Pick one of my coolest

517
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,380
and biggest photos

518
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,980
and hang it up in the living room.

519
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,700
So as soon as any guest comes in,

520
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,980
they'll see me first.

521
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,180
Alright.

522
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,740
Let's

523
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,220
hang your photo on the wall, okay?

524
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,660
Okay.

525
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,420
We've got to pick one.

526
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,060
If we must do it.

527
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,820
This one, then.

528
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,300
It's settled.

529
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,940
How's that?

530
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,900
I think it works.

531
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,340
Not bad.

532
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,460
Yan,

533
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,500
are you free on Friday?

534
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,980
Nothing much is going on.

535
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,380
Rui,

536
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,540
are you free

537
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,780
on Friday?

538
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,340
On Friday?

539
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,580
I think so.

540
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,020
Good.

541
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,540
It's settled then.

542
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,740
I had someone look it up.

543
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,940
That day is auspicious.

544
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,940
Go register your marriage.

545
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,220
How about it, Yan?

546
00:26:59,420 --> 00:26:59,740
Sure.

547
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,420
Rui?

548
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:02,700
Mom.

549
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,260
Alright.

550
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:04,740
It's decided.

551
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,060
Great.

552
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,500
It's so beautiful.

553
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,660
The girl dancing ballet on it

554
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,020
is just like Yufan.

555
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,140
She's also Ms. Tan.

556
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,540
She's also you,

557
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,020
and all the girls who love ballet.

558
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,260
Thank you for the gift.

559
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,420
If you hadn't invited Dr. Dong,

560
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,500
I might not have been able to
make it to the match.

561
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,660
You're too kind.

562
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,820
Everything happens for the best.

563
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,900
Like Ms. Tan,

564
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,140
you were born

565
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,500
to be a ballerina.

566
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,940
So continue to strive and do better.

567
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,220
I look forward
to your greater achievements.

568
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,740
Ms. Tan is my role model.

569
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,980
Keep working hard.

570
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,780
Yufan, I'll learn from you.

571
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,420
Choosing ballet, you must persevere

572
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,460
and keep going,

573
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,020
understand?

574
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,340
How have you been lately?

575
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,140
As the competition is over,

576
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,820
things should be more relaxed.

577
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,140
I'm going to Hongyuan County

578
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,980
in Sichuan's Aba Prefecture.

579
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,060
I asked Ms. Zhuang for leave today.

580
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,860
Ms. Tan,

581
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,100
why are you going there?

582
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,020
Is it about your dad?

583
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:40,780
Yes,

584
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,620
someone saw him there.

585
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,020
So, I must rush there.

586
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,180
Is that person reliable?

587
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,220
Yes.

588
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,740
It's the vineyard

589
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,380
of Feng Rui's winery.

590
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,020
My dad was there days ago.

591
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,380
When are you going?

592
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,860
Tomorrow.

593
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:56,980
So soon?

594
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,380
I got the news today.

595
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,980
I'm worried that if I'm late,

596
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,220
I'll miss him again.

597
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,820
Are you going alone?

598
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:04,860
Yes.

599
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:05,820
Don't worry.

600
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,980
I'll be fine on my own.

601
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,860
Ms. Tan,

602
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,220
if you're going there,

603
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,300
help take some throat lozenges
to Old Sir.

604
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,900
He caught a chill

605
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,420
from staying up all night.

606
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
After coming here,

607
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,380
I found some throat lozenges

608
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,980
and planned to take them to him
in the summer,

609
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,020
but since you're going,

610
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,660
could you please take them to him now?

611
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,900
Sure.

612
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
Ms. Tan, if you're going there,

613
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,380
how will you deal with the language barrier?

614
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:32,900
It's okay.

615
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,580
When I went there before,

616
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,940
I met a local friend.

617
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,460
He can be my guide

618
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,620
and help with translation.

619
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,740
That's good.

620
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,140
Ms. Tan,

621
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,300
we're seeing you off today.

622
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,660
We wish you

623
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,420
a safe journey tomorrow.

624
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,340
Thank you.

625
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,180
Hope you'll find your dad soon.

626
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,260
Alright,

627
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:04,940
I'm done.

628
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,460
Me too.

629
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,500
Take your time eating.

630
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,020
Wait. I'll take care of it.

631
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,460
Whoever finishes last washes the dishes.

632
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,740
Alright.

633
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,940
Eat slowly.

634
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,140
Eat slowly.

635
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,820
I was teasing you.

636
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,780
Leave it there.

637
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,580
I'll put it right here.

638
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,300
Have some vegetables.

639
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,540
Peiyan, are you free later?

640
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,660
Let's go out for a bit.

641
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,300
Let me finish this.

642
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:45,780
Yan,

643
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,100
go on out.

644
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,900
I'll clean up.

645
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,580
Just leave it there.

646
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,420
Okay.

647
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:54,820
Go ahead.

648
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,180
Peiyan…

649
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,180
Do you know?

650
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,900
Le has made great progress
in his studies lately.

651
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,620
Seems your mom is right

652
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,500
not to send him to the training center.

653
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,500
He's about to start middle school soon,

654
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,060
so he can put aside

655
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,540
the piano for a while.

656
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,300
But

657
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,340
he's a bit unhappy

658
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,180
because he couldn't play with his Legos.

659
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,460
But he can play

660
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,700
with them again after some time.

661
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,700
You've been very busy lately.

662
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,020
We should thank

663
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,220
Ms. Lin.

664
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,380
Because of her wonderful articles,

665
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,980
Cygne is known to more people.

666
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,660
Have you got a lot of orders recently?

667
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:34,820
Yes.

668
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,060
We've had more orders than before.

669
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,380
Le and I made a bet.

670
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,780
I found a cake shop

671
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,900
with incredibly delicious cakes.

672
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,340
One of the cakes

673
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,220
without cream is amazing.

674
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,740
Le said you don't like it,

675
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,500
but I said you do.

676
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,100
If there's a chance...

677
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,740
Peiyan,

678
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,980
actually...

679
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,060
We should break up.

680
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,100
We've known each other

681
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,900
for four or five years now.

682
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,300
So many times,

683
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,260
I've wondered

684
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,380
what

685
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,020
our relationship is.

686
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,260
Am I Le's teacher,

687
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,940
your normal friend,

688
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:36,980
or a soulmate?

689
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,740
But why even try to figure it all out?

690
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,700
Actually,

691
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,900
as long as I'm by your side

692
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,780
and taking good care of Le,

693
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,140
I feel quite happy.

694
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,740
When you agreed in the car

695
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,180
that day to give us a try,

696
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,980
I really didn't expect that.

697
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,860
And during this time

698
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,980
of preparing for the wedding,

699
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,260
it's been my happiest moment.

700
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,940
But I can sense

701
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,900
that you're unhappy,

702
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:25,980
right?

703
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,860
So, I've been thinking,

704
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,780
if it weren't for Le,

705
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,260
would we

706
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,700
even be at this point?

707
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,180
That person is Tan Siting, right?

708
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,940
She's Le's real mother.

709
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,580
Sometimes, a woman's intuition

710
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,180
is terrifyingly accurate.

711
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,180
No wonder

712
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,660
every time I look into Le's eyes,

713
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,700
I always feel like

714
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,540
I can see her shadow.

715
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,180
I

716
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:33,980
don't want

717
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,020
to keep deceiving you,

718
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,380
or deceiving myself.

719
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,900
It's unfair to you.

720
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,660
I don't want to continue this mistake.

721
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,500
So, before the invitations are sent out,

722
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,980
it's not too late for everything.

723
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,820
We can cut our losses in time.

724
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,740
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

725
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,740
Don't worry,

726
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,460
we're adults.

727
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,580
Nobody will die without someone else.

728
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,460
It's been a long time

729
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,660
since I've taken a break.

730
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,660
I want to give myself

731
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,740
a short vacation.

732
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,340
Ms. Wei has been asking me for a while.

733
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,940
Thank you.

734
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,420
Even though I know

735
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,500
you don't like it when I thank you,

736
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,300
I do want to thank you.

737
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,980
And every time I've thanked you,

738
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,820
it was from the bottom of my heart.

739
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,340
Thank you.

740
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,300
The breeze here feels so nice.

741
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,180
I want to be alone for a little while.

742
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,620
You can go ahead.

743
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,540
I'll stay here with you.

744
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,540
Give me some space.

745
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,220
Besides, if you go back late,

746
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,980
your mom and Le will worry about you.

747
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,420
Please, go.

748
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,460
Hurry!

749
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,420
Hello.

750
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,500
I thought I told you what to do.

751
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,180
About this,

752
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,940
go to Mr. Tang.

753
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,340
Tomorrow, I'm heading somewhere far.

754
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,260
For work?

755
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,180
To find someone.

756
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,260
Will you come back?

757
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,300
Of course, I'll be back.

758
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,940
Will you be gone for long?

759
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,660
What about my dad's wedding?

760
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,980
You won't miss it, will you?

761
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,580
Seems I'll have to miss it.

762
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,380
But I'll bring you a gift
when I get back.

763
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,940
