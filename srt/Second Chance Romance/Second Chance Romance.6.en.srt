00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,700
This is it.

195
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,940
There's a small cabin here.

196
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,140
This

197
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,860
can be the bedroom

198
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,220
and also a place to rest.

199
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,140
It's

200
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,140
a multi-purpose

201
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,740
cabin.

202
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,220
You can

203
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,420
cook.

204
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,500
And...

205
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,020
What's wrong?

206
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,540
Is she okay?

207
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,300
Come sit down.

208
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,700
Take it easy.

209
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,140
Slowly. Be careful.

210
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,220
Breathe slowly.

211
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,420
Take deep breaths.

212
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,300
How do you feel?

213
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,820
Easy now.

214
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,580
That's right.

215
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,500
Okay.

216
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,380
Slowly. Yes.

217
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,700
Good.

218
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Take it easy.

219
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,780
Okay.

220
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,980
Like this.

221
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,340
Will this work?

222
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

223
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,620
Here.

224
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,060
Okay. Lean back.

225
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,100
Easy now. Yes.

226
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,340
Right.

227
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,620
She's got

228
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,540
respiratory alkalosis.

229
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,260
It's a type of altitude sickness.

230
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,260
Put this mask over her face

231
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,420
and breathe back in the carbon dioxide
she exhale.

232
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,860
She'll be fine soon.

233
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,460
Are you feeling better?

234
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,300
Wait,

235
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,580
don't just focus on her.

236
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,740
You don't look so good either.

237
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,020
I...

238
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,860
Get some rest.

239
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,580
Alright.

240
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,820
I'll sleep in the car outside tonight.

241
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,180
If anything comes up, just call me.

242
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,020
Okay.

243
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,380
You should get some rest.

244
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:13,700
Okay.

245
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,060
By the way,

246
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,180
the tea is ready.

247
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,860
So is the water.

248
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,140
When you drink,

249
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,420
take small sips

250
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,420
more frequently.

251
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:19,740
Okay.

252
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,500
Sit down now.

253
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,060
Get some rest.

254
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,300
Okay.

255
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,620
Thank you.

256
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,580
Just call me if you need anything.

257
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,020
No problem.

258
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,460
Okay.

259
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,100
Are you okay?

260
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,020
Tan Siting.

261
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,380
Tan Siting?

262
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,100
Feeling better?

263
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,340
I'm alright.

264
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,140
You?

265
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,420
I'm okay.

266
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,700
If

267
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,060
anything comes up, just call me.

268
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,100
Okay.

269
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,900
I'll be right outside.

270
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,700
Okay.

271
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,100
Good night.

272
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,780
Good night.

273
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,100
I want that one.

274
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,860
I want this one.

275
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,340
I want that one.

276
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,780
I want this.

277
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,340
Thank you.

278
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,260
I want that one.

279
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,580
This.

280
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,500
That.

281
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,940
This? You want this one too?

282
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,740
I want that one.

283
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,900
No pushing. Everyone gets one.

284
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,060
I want that.

285
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,780
Here you go.

286
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Ma'am, I want this.

287
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,500
Here.

288
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Everyone gets one.

289
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,940
Everyone got one?

290
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,660
Yes.

291
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,940
Do you know how to use these?

292
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,380
No.

293
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,020
Let me show you.

294
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,620
Use this pen.

295
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,180
And you can draw with it.

296
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,660
Right?

297
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,540
Yes.

298
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,460
Then you pull this, and it disappears.

299
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,260
Got it?

300
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,740
Yes.

301
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,460
You're awake.

302
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Who wants a lollipop?

303
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,820
Me!

304
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,460
Now I understand

305
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,060
why my dad

306
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,580
comes here every year
to do charity work.

307
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,660
When I was dancing
with those kids today,

308
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,260
it felt completely different

309
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,020
from performing

310
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,740
on stage.

311
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,100
Very relaxing?

312
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,980
Here, I dance with my heart.

313
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,980
This is nice.

314
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,620
I wish time could just stop right now.

315
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,780
Do you love this place?

316
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,180
The people here live

317
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,540
such peaceful yet passionate lives.

318
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:47,940
Here.

319
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,540
Thank you.

320
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,900
Not sure what flower this is,

321
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,740
but it's beautiful.

322
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,300
This is Velvet.

323
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,780
Isn't velvet a type of fabric?

324
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,580
Yes.

325
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,380
But it's also a flower.

326
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,180
It's called the Star of Bethlehem.

327
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,100
I first learned about it
from an Italian girl

328
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,900
during a competition in Switzerland.

329
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,620
She said her hometown
was full of these flowers.

330
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,620
She showed me a photo of herself
standing in a field of them.

331
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:16,980
Look.

332
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,860
This flower is small and delicate,

333
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,460
with pure white petals

334
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,620
and a black pearl-like center.

335
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,180
That's its ovary.

336
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,580
It looked beautiful.

337
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,180
But another reason I love it

338
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,140
is its symbolic meaning.

339
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,540
What is it?

340
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,380
It's called
"the miracle of turning around".

341
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,940
The miracle of turning around?

342
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,580
Yes.

343
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,340
I think it comes from

344
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,020
the origin of the Star of Bethlehem.

345
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,660
You see, this flower

346
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,220
is like a shining star in the darkness.

347
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,100
It brings warmth

348
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,300
and hope.

349
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,460
So, Feng Rui,

350
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,740
you are my Star of Bethlehem.

351
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,780
You know what?

352
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,780
After meeting you,

353
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,620
I feel my life

354
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,740
finally has real meaning.

355
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,140
So you are my Velvet.

356
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,260
I think this is the reason

357
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,700
fate brought us together.

358
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,580
I'm starting to believe

359
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,420
that everything that happens in life

360
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
happens for a reason.

361
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,580
Just like now, being with you makes me

362
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
feel so calm

363
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,980
and happy.

364
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,460
Let's be together.

365
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,990
♪How rare it is in life
to have someone to like?♪

366
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:46,830
♪How rare it is for liking
to become favor?♪

367
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:54,150
♪How rare it is for favor
to reunite again?♪

368
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,910
♪How rare it is that it's still you?♪

369
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,020
In the end,

370
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,860
she chose to go to France

371
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,580
to pursue her ballet dreams.

372
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,380
I could never find her again.

373
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,460
Bonjour.

374
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,460
Excuse me.

375
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,500
Does Ms. Tan live here?

376
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,620
I don't know the person you mentioned.

377
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,900
She has lived in this one before.

378
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,500
And she's a Chinese who dances ballet.

379
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,580
Are you sure you don't know her?

380
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,700
There are many people
renting houses here.

381
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,740
I cannot remember
who comes and goes every day.

382
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,820
I only remember

383
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,460
a young guy living here before.

384
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,620
Alright.

385
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,500
Here's my number.

386
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,700
Can you have her call me

387
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,020
if you see her?

388
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,300
I don't have her contact information.

389
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,020
Most of the people living here...
They live here for a short period

390
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,340
and they just go away.

391
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,420
Almost no one remembers who came.

392
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,820
Okay.

393
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
I'm sorry, sir.

394
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,540
Thanks.

395
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,020
My pleasure.

396
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,420
Found her?

397
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:26,980
No.

398
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Did you give up?

399
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,740
Come back once you gave up.

400
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,100
The company needs you.

401
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,140
So you still
haven't been able to forget her?

402
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,780
I already have.

403
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,700
Maybe I've just grown fond
of the feeling

404
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,300
of missing her.

405
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,140
It really is a story full of regret.

406
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,460
That chapter of life

407
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,420
was like a phase.

408
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,060
It was beautiful, yet heartbreaking.

409
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,700
Just like this wine.

410
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,180
At first sip,

411
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,860
it has a tartness,

412
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,620
then it fills with fruity notes,

413
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,260
and finally,

414
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,420
the aftertaste

415
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,540
carries

416
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,660
a distinct violet fragrance.

417
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,620
The tannins in this wine

418
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,620
create an impact,

419
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,780
even a slight sting, on the tongue.

420
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,020
But it leaves a very deep impression.

421
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,460
Drinking this wine feels like

422
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,020
it takes me back to our farm.

423
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,980
The domestic vineyards

424
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,060
can now produce such excellent grapes.

425
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,620
It really surprises me.

426
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,660
Mr. Feng,

427
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,140
I'd like to place an order.

428
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,860
Is that possible?

429
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,020
No problem.

430
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,860
Qi,

431
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,380
draft the contract

432
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,900
and give it to our guests.

433
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,580
Okay.

434
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,940
Thank you.

435
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,540
We should be the ones thanking you.

436
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,300
You shared such fine wine with us

437
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,860
and told us your story.

438
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,140
Thank you.

439
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
It's just that

440
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,620
life holds

441
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,420
too many regrets.

442
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,980
Ms. Jin,

443
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,340
here is the drafted contract.

444
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,360
[Season's Selection: Red Calyx]
If there are any issues,

445
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
feel free to contact us anytime.

446
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,580
Alright. Thank you.

447
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,100
Mr. Feng,

448
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,980
you haven't finished your story.

449
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,500
She still hasn't come back?

450
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,420
Whether she returns or not
doesn't matter anymore.

451
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,980
We can't go back to how we were.

452
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,260
I believe you will meet again someday.

453
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,580
Such a beautiful love story

454
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,740
must have a very beautiful ending.

455
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,300
Yes.

456
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,300
Good luck.

457
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,140
Okay.

458
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,740
Bye.

459
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,140
Take care.

460
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,940
Good luck. Bye.

461
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:15,640
[Cygne]

462
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,980
I heard that Aoyun from Yunnan

463
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,060
won the gold medal again

464
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,500
at WSC.

465
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,580
Now many foreign wineries

466
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,700
are looking to invest in Yunnan.

467
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,540
It's settled then.

468
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
Excuse me for a moment.

469
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,460
Ms. Gao,

470
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,140
I've heard so much about you.

471
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,380
You are Mr. Wang from Huacan.

472
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,180
Nice to meet you.

473
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,900
Just call me Wang.

474
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,820
You are my senior.

475
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,580
I've been wanting to visit you.

476
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,540
It's great

477
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,220
to see you today.

478
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,500
You're being modest.

479
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,580
Ms. Gao,

480
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,660
your son has a very sharp mind.

481
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
He shared many of his ideas

482
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,780
and visions for domestic wine with me.

483
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,500
Young people have drive.

484
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,380
You're too kind.

485
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,020
Huacan's wine is far ahead

486
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
in the domestic wine scene.

487
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,580
Today, we have the chance

488
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,940
to taste it.

489
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,260
Tianlu Trade has a substantial business.

490
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,980
Why don't you let your son take it over?

491
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,220
The wine business isn't easy.

492
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,020
Huacan has been at it for ten years,

493
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,340
and sometimes we still feel lost.

494
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,820
So I'd like to learn more
from you today.

495
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,900
Feng Rui

496
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,980
is strong-willed.

497
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,260
He dares to think and act.

498
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,940
He can produce wine
that represents our people.

499
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
I think that in itself is commendable.

500
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,020
Yes.

501
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,980
[Cygne]
Hello, everyone.

502
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,100
Today, at the invitation
of Mr. Feng from Cygne

503
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,540
and Mr. Wang from Huacan, we're here

504
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,580
to taste

505
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,460
their new releases together.

506
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,300
The wine on your left is from Cygne,

507
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,220
and on your right is from Huacan.

508
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,220
You are all leaders

509
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,020
in our industry.

510
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,020
We look forward
to your valuable feedback

511
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,860
after the tasting.

512
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,620
Mom, I miss you.

513
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,940
Ha.

514
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,100
I miss you too.

515
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,340
I'll be back this weekend.

516
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,700
Bye.

517
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,420
Give me a kiss.

518
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,380
Good girl.

519
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,540
Bye.

520
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,940
Bye.

521
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,940
Daughters are the best.

522
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,420
Ms. Guan,

523
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,340
your daughter is adorable.

524
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,860
I should've had a daughter too.

525
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,300
Sons are too rowdy.

526
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,580
Keep trying, Ms. Bai.

527
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,540
Have a girl.

528
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,300
What if it's another boy?

529
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,940
I can't afford

530
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,940
two boys.

531
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,500
Ms. Tan, what do you think?

532
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,420
How's our school?

533
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,340
It's great.

534
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,820
It's my ideal ballet school.

535
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,780
So,

536
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,460
Ms. Tan,

537
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,260
let me be nosy.

538
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,700
Are you married?

539
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,620
Any kids?

540
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,380
You know it's nosy but you still ask.

541
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,380
Just being curious.
Don't you want to know?

542
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,940
Not yet. I'm single.

543
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,260
No boyfriend either?

544
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,420
No way. With your qualities?

545
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,300
I heard

546
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,820
French men are romantic.

547
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,300
That doesn't make sense.

548
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,620
I know.

549
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,900
You must have
too many suitors to choose from.

550
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,220
It's just that I'm too busy with work.

551
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,020
Didn't have time
to think about these things.

552
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,540
Listen to that.

553
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,060
She, an internationally
renowned principal dancer,

554
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,340
devotes all her time

555
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,460
to her career.

556
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,700
Ms. Tan, impressive.

557
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,500
Stop being nosy. Let's eat.

558
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
You listened and now you're scolding me.

559
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,660
Both are Pinot Noirs,

560
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,540
but their styles
are completely different.

561
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,100
I prefer

562
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,220
Cygne's Pinot Noir.

563
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,140
I have a different opinion.

564
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,740
Huacan's Pinot Noir

565
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,340
shows the winemaker's
unique craftsmanship.

566
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,620
The acidity is just right

567
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,060
to support the whole body,

568
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,500
making it very smooth to drink.

569
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,660
My vote goes to Huacan.

570
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,740
The aromas at each level are distinct,

571
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,300
and the palate is more mature.

572
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,540
It must have been aged

573
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,740
in new oak barrels for a long time.

574
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,580
My vote

575
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,580
goes to Cygne as well.

576
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,020
So now it's a tie.

577
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,020
Ms. Gao, your vote is crucial.

578
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,860
Pinot Noir is one of

579
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,380
the most delicate grape varieties
in the world.

580
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,220
When cultivated with care,

581
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,020
its potential is limitless.

582
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,620
A true Pinot Noir dry red

583
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,980
should lead us to explore

584
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,020
and perceive it,

585
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,180
perfectly interpreting

586
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,580
the charm

587
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,500
of its terroir,

588
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,580
rather than relying

589
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,340
on excessive human intervention
during winemaking.

590
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,020
In this regard,

591
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,860
I think Huacan's Pinot Noir

592
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,740
lets me taste what Pinot Noir should be.

593
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,660
Clean, elegant,

594
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,260
and unpredictable.

595
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,580
More

596
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
thought-provoking.

597
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,820
Today...

598
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,140
Bye.

599
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,700
There was no winner.

600
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,260
Really.

601
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,340
I was just lucky this time.

602
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,260
Next time.

603
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,780
I'm grateful.

604
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:25,940
Okay.

605
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,700
Ms. Gao.

606
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,740
We welcome your valuable feedback.

607
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,220
If you come to Shanghai,
please let me know.

608
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,020
I'll pick you up myself.

609
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,780
Okay.

610
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,540
See you next time.

611
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:34,980
Take care.

612
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,100
Accurately capture

613
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,060
the proper taste

614
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,580
and aroma

615
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,820
of Pinot Noir

616
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,660
before pursuing uniqueness.

617
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,500
I tasted Cygne's wine carefully.

618
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,180
There was

619
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,020
no winner today.

620
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,580
Dad!

621
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,460
Slow down.

622
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,460
Did you win?

623
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,860
Yes! Champion!

624
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,180
Feng Lexuan

625
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,380
wins First Prize
in the 9th Model Airplane Competition.

626
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,300
First place!

627
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,380
First prize! Let me see.

628
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,860
Dad,

629
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,100
I want to award this to you.

630
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,180
I achieved your dream for you.

631
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:54,820
Wait.

632
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,860
This is your dream.

633
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,300
You should keep it.

634
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,300
I'll achieve

635
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,340
my own dreams myself.

636
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Then,

637
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,220
when I grow up,

638
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,580
can I go pursue my own dreams

639
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,060
without worrying about you?

640
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,180
Of course.

641
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,060
Even though we take off together,

642
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,980
we each have our own destination.

643
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,140
Okay.

644
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,660
Then I'll keep it myself.

645
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,500
Dad,

646
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,140
are you going to marry Ms. Wen?

647
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,820
You...

648
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,620
Look.

649
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,580
Ms. Wen is wearing

650
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,820
Grandma's pearl necklace.

651
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,660
This is Grandma's heirloom.

652
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,140
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

653
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,940
I was wondering
why you hadn't noticed it

654
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,060
all this time.

655
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,580
How could I miss
such an obvious necklace?

656
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,700
I won the championship,

657
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,700
and now I know
you two are getting married.

658
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,540
Is today my lucky day?

659
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,700
Ms. Wen,

660
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,780
how did you manage to win over my dad?

661
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,380
Win over?

662
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,180
You're too clever for your own age.

663
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,140
What are you talking about?

664
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,220
I'm the champion!
You can't mess with me!

665
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,820
Don't mess with me!

666
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,820
Ms. Wen, save me!

667
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,300
Stop fooling around.

668
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,180
Hold still.

669
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,720
[Cygne]

670
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,780
Leg position.

671
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,140
Be steady.

672
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,900
Very good.

673
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,580
For a student

674
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,820
from a private ballet school
to be shortlisted

675
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,860
for such a prestigious competition

676
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
is a first.

677
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,380
We believe Zheng Yufan will achieve

678
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,980
great results in this final.

679
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,780
Thank you.

680
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,180
Ms. Guan,

681
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
I've been wanting to interview you

682
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,260
and only got the chance today.

683
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,260
Your student made the shortlist.

684
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,740
That's truly impressive.

685
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,860
It's just making the shortlist.

686
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,300
It's still a remarkable achievement.

687
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,140
Thank you for the interview.

688
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,980
This will help

689
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,740
raise our school's profile.

690
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
Of course.

691
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,700
Ms. Guan,

692
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,860
a question off-topic.

693
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,580
I heard Tan Siting
started teaching at this school

694
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,140
after returning from France.

695
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,500
So she's your colleague now.

696
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Could you tell me

697
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,660
what she's like?

698
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,460
Is that part of today's interview topic?

699
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,220
No.

700
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
This is purely my personal curiosity.

701
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,700
Then you should schedule
a dedicated interview with Ms. Tan.

702
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,700
That would satisfy

703
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,780
all your curiosity.

704
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,460
That would be wonderful.

705
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,460
Thank you

706
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,140
for participating

707
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,780
in the Ballet Enthusiast segment today.

708
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,420
Thank you.

709
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,260
No problem.

710
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,980
What's wrong, Yufan?

711
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,580
Is it your back?

712
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,780
Your foot?

713
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,340
Did you twist it?

714
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,340
I don't know.

715
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,420
Lift your leg.

716
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,980
Anterior talar impact injury?

717
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,180
Last time, it hurt this badly too.

718
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,460
I told her

719
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,820
to stop and rest until fully recovered,

720
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,500
but she didn't listen.

721
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,220
It's not a big deal.

722
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,660
Every dancer
sprains something a few times.

723
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,740
The situation is different.

724
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,020
None of your classmates
are injured as seriously as you.

725
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,500
You've been pushing yourself too hard.

726
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,540
If it's severe,

727
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,860
a bone spur could develop.

728
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,420
Can you do it?

729
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,780
Be careful with your foot.

730
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,420
Sir.

731
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,380
If it's a bone spur,

732
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,940
surgery is required.

733
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,620
But she's so young.

734
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,620
If it doesn't heal properly this time,
it's really hard to say.

735
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,820
Mr. Zhang,

736
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,900
I...

737
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,580
Last time, I told you

738
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
to rest properly.

739
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:43,980
But

740
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,860
Ms. Guan insisted you keep dancing.

741
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:46,940
Well?

742
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,180
The same spot

743
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,500
is acting up again.

744
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,220
This time you must rest
until it's completely healed.

745
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,340
Or a bone spur might really form.

746
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,780
If that happens,

747
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,620
then as Ms. Tan said,

748
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,100
surgery will be the only option.

749
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,860
Ms. Guan made you dance?

750
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,140
No.

751
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,620
I wanted to dance myself.

752
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,900
I'm completely out of breath.

753
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,500
How could the dancing
turn out like this?

754
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,300
I don't know.

755
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,860
Right?

756
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,180
Ms. Guan, I want to ask you something.

757
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:20,900
Go ahead.

758
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,180
I'll leave you two alone.

759
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,460
You knew Yufan's foot was injured,
didn't you?

760
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,780
Yes. Why?

761
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,820
The why did you

762
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,900
make her keep dancing

763
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,500
instead of letting her rest?

764
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,300
The submission deadline
for the competition video

765
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,500
was just over ten days away then.

766
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,420
How could she stop?

767
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,580
And after the video was recorded?

768
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
Why didn't you let her rest then?

769
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,740
It didn't hurt anymore after that.

770
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,540
Why should she rest?

771
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,260
So she kept dancing.

772
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,820
Today, her foot is injured again.

773
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,340
In the same spot.

774
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,460
So what do you want?

775
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,540
What do I want?

776
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,140
She can't dance anymore.

777
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
Are you joking?

778
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,860
The final is coming soon!

779
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,420
This career is inherently tough.

780
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,020
Getting injured
for the sake of achievement is nothing.

781
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:10,980
Everyone here

782
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,100
has been through it.

783
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,620
Have you never been injured
while dancing?

784
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,940
Which

785
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,780
holds more importance,

786
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,220
one competition

787
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,220
or her entire dancing career?

788
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,380
If a child, being young
and short-sighted,

789
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,940
plants a landmine for her future,

790
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,220
her dance career

791
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,460
will definitely be affected.

792
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,940
You are her teacher.

793
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,260
Do you want to see her
be a flash in the pan?

794
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
What are you talking about?

795
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,220
When I first entrusted her to you,

796
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,300
she was perfectly fine.

797
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,420
Now, in such a short time,

798
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,020
how did she end up like this?

799
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,980
Now that there's a problem,
you come to me?

800
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,060
We don't even know
whose responsibility it really is yet!

801
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:56,940
Fine.

802
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,460
Let's say it's my problem.

803
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,420
So I've decided she won't dance anymore.

804
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,620
Starting today, she needs to rest.

805
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,020
Now is not the time to debate
whose problem or responsibility it is!

806
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,500
The urgent priority right now
is to compete

807
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,900
in the final and get results!

808
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,140
That is the most important thing

809
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,060
for herself!

810
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,620
Ms. Guan,

811
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,780
I see it differently.

812
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
I believe compared to
her lifelong dance career,

813
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,140
one competition is nothing.

814
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,100
You're a ballet dancer too.

815
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,860
How can you
treat your student like this?

816
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,060
So you're the only one with high morals?

817
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,340
The only one who cares about students?

818
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,140
You're all afraid of her, but I'm not,

819
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,740
let me tell you!

820
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,140
Skipping one competition doesn't matter?

821
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,340
You make it sound so easy!

822
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,420
Of course it doesn't matter to you.

823
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,420
You're a genius.

824
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:38,820
Right?

825
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,940
Missing one or two competitions
is nothing?

826
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,660
Is it nothing for Zheng Yufan?

827
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,420
What right do you have
to make decisions for her?

828
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,340
What right do I have?

829
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,900
Because I am also a ballet dancer.

830
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,460
Because I am her teacher now.

831
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,500
Ms. Zhuang,

832
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,660
my focus is entirely on the school

833
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,580
and the children.

834
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,380
What did I do wrong?

835
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,100
Ms. Guan,

836
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,140
don't be upset.

837
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,380
I think you might

838
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,940
have misunderstood Ms. Tan.

839
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,900
Ms. Tan, please explain what's going on.

840
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,900
Yufan injured her foot again

841
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,540
during training today.

842
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,140
The doctor said
it's an anterior talar impact injury.

843
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,140
If this continues, she'll need surgery.

844
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,580
My opinion is that she should rest now

845
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,340
and resume training
after she's recovered.

846
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,580
Is it really as serious as you say?

847
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,180
It's just a sprained foot.
I know it well.

848
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,220
Don't exaggerate.

849
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,660
Ms. Zhuang,

850
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,500
the final

851
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,460
is in just one month.

852
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,380
Every single minute now is crucial.

853
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,220
We've prepared for so long

854
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,420
just for this one push.

855
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,420
This level of competition
isn't just about skill.

856
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,260
It also depends on luck.

857
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,100
No matter how skilled Yufan is,

858
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,300
she won't always have the luck

859
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,340
to make it to the final every time.

860
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,260
I know this competition

861
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,660
is very important to Yufan.

862
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,540
But no matter how important it is,

863
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,940
it's not more important

864
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,980
than a foot injury that could affect
her dancing future for life.

865
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,940
If competing in this competition

866
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,100
means she'll have
a permanent health issue,

867
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,260
then I am firmly against it.

868
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,340
Ms. Zhuang,

869
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,820
I think Ms. Tan
is making a big deal out of it.

870
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,420
It's just a minor injury.

871
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,500
It shouldn't be escalated

872
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,780
to the level of a lifelong health issue.

873
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,780
Yufan is a promising talent.

874
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,860
Seizing this opportunity
to achieve good results

875
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
is a chance

876
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,260
for both her and the school.

877
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,580
It's about glory, honor.
It's a great thing.

878
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,820
I'm a simple person.
Not that complicated.

879
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,660
I'm only doing this
for the children and the school.

880
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,580
How is that my fault?

881
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,100
Why are you constantly targeting me?

882
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,500
Talking about being short-sighted?

883
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,580
Saying I'm planting landmines
for my students?

884
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,140
Just because you came back
from abroad, you think you're so great?

885
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,420
You want to bully everyone?

886
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,300
Lecture everyone?

887
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,940
You're being a bully.

888
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,260
I never bully anyone.

889
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,780
I'm just calling it as I see it.

890
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:43,900
Ms. Guan,

891
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,860
don't be mad.

892
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,980
I really think

893
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,060
you've misunderstood Ms. Tan.

894
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,580
Misunderstood?

895
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,700
I don't think so.

896
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,300
Why do you think
I've misunderstood her?

897
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,340
Ms. Zhuang.

898
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,820
Yufan, how's your foot?

899
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,820
Yufan, tell Ms. Zhuang

900
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,140
your foot is fine.

901
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,700
You...

902
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,060
I'm fine, Ms. Zhuang.

903
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,860
Please don't blame Ms. Guan.

904
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,900
I agreed to keep practicing

905
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,220
last time I was injured.

906
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,340
I was afraid stopping
would delay my progress

907
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:10,980
and affect the competition.

908
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,620
Ms. Guan wanted me
to achieve good results.

909
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,220
I also wanted to push myself.

910
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,460
See? I wasn't wrong, was I?

911
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,460
Yufan,

912
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,140
what did the doctor tell you today?

913
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,780
Ms. Tan, you're right.

914
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,420
But you don't need to argue

915
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,060
about me anymore.

916
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,820
I don't want to
participate in this competition.

917
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,620
What kind of talk is that?

918
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,180
What do you mean
you don't want to participate?

919
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,060
You heard me correctly.

920
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,660
That's exactly what I mean.

921
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
I don't want to participate anymore.

922
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,340
And you don't need to argue anymore.

923
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,180
But...

924
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:44,900
Yufan.

925
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,380
Yufan.

926
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,820
We're at this point now.

927
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,700
You can't...

928
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,540
You can't just give up like this.

929
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,900
The final is about to start.

930
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,540
Let's persevere
a little longer, alright?

931
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,260
Ms. Tan and I won't argue anymore.

932
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,820
Bye, Madam.

933
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,860
Yufan!

934
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,580
Ms. Guan,

935
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,540
she has been
under a lot of pressure lately.

936
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,180
Let her calm down and think for herself.

937
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,580
Ms. Guan,

938
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,300
I know

939
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,900
you and Ms. Tan are both good teachers.

940
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,020
You both have
the students' best interests at heart.

941
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,220
Sometimes,

942
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,380
people have different perspectives

943
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,260
when handling things.

944
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,500
That's perfectly normal.

945
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,060
But

946
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,220
I hope you both
won't take it too personally.

947
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,340
We are colleagues.

948
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,820
Ms. Guan...

949
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,380
Ting,

950
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,900
the child is having a hard time.

951
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,700
She really has been
under a lot of pressure lately.

952
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,260
This is a chance

953
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,140
for her to take a break

954
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,100
and relax.

955
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
I know.

956
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,740
Don't worry.

957
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,620
He did pretty well in class today.

958
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,820
But when you go home,

959
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,620
don't rush.

960
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,740
Solidify the basics

961
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,740
and the scales properly.

962
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,180
Okay.

963
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,900
Okay, Ms. Wen.

964
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Bye, Ms. Wen.

965
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,540
Okay. Bye.

966
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:05,980
Let's go.

967
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,620
It's alright.

968
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,060
Just call me if you need anything.

969
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,340
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Tan.

970
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,380
Bye.

971
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,380
Ms. Tan.

972
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,060
Ms. Wen.

973
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,940
Are your classes over?

974
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,340
You don't have classes today, right?

975
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,020
I just left something here

976
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,020
and came to pick it up.

977
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,140
If you're free,

978
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,260
could you come with me somewhere later?

979
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,260
Today, we're going to look
at a wedding venue.

980
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,820
I'm afraid of making choices.

981
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,660
Since you've lived abroad
for so many years,

982
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,260
your taste must be
much better than mine.

983
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,060
If you're free,
could you help me decide?

984
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,980
Sure.

985
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,140
Since Ms. Tan didn't have classes today,

986
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,740
I wanted to ask her to come along

987
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,620
and give her opinion.

988
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,740
I wasn't sure if it was appropriate.

989
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,180
It's perfectly appropriate.

990
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,420
Yes, totally.

991
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,100
Sorry for taking up your time.

992
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,580
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

993
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,940
No need to be so formal.

994
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,660
This

995
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,180
our featured styles.

996
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,060
It has a satin bodice

997
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,180
with excellent drape.

998
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,060
It looks very elegant when worn.

999
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,900
It also features a small V-neck.

1000
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,060
Look, the small pearls

1001
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,700
add a very gentle,
graceful feel for the bride.

1002
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,260
This way, please.

1003
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,100
Take a look.

1004
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,500
We also have this strapless style.

1005
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,340
This one features a large bow.

1006
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,300
The tulle is designed

1007
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,940
in a layered, cake-like shape,

1008
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,420
so it gives the bride

1009
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,260
a playful and cute feeling.

1010
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,660
Playful.

1011
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,140
We have another style.

1012
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,100
This is also a featured one.

1013
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,020
It's made from classic lace.

1014
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,460
Many luxury brands

1015
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,100
featured at international fashion weeks

1016
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,820
use this fabric.

1017
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,180
Look, it has

1018
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,660
a deep V-back design.

1019
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,540
Which one do you think is better?

1020
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,300
I think they all look nice.

1021
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,860
Could you give some substantial advice?

1022
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,500
You have great poise.

1023
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,660
You'd look good in any of them.

1024
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,100
But I'm afraid of making choices.

1025
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,540
Ms. Tan, what do you think?

1026
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,420
Which one is better?

1027
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,220
I think maybe this one.

1028
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,100
Because the fabric is very special,

1029
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,580
and the back design is also beautiful.

1030
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,660
Why not try it on?

1031
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:34,900
Okay.

1032
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,820
I'll try this one then.

1033
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,380
Alright.

1034
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,980
Wait a moment.

1035
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,100
This way.

1036
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:41,580
Okay.

1037
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,580
The fitting room is over here.

1038
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,020
This part is a bit loose.

1039
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,380
If it were snugger, it would accentuate
the waistline more.

1040
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,420
This works.

1041
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:05,860
This is much better.

1042
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,340
This works, right?

1043
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,740
Yes.

1044
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,860
Just tighten it one more notch.

1045
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,540
Make it a bit tighter.

1046
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,380
Okay. I'll have

1047
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,420
the designer

1048
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,180
alter it accordingly.

1049
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,820
Why did you come?

1050
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,540
What? Are you afraid of seeing me?

1051
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,860
