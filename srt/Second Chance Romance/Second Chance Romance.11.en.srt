Go downstairs in five minutes.

Let's have a drink.

21
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,540
Hello, Yan.

22
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,730
You're back.

23
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,850
Ms. Wen,

24
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,140
where's my dad?

25
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,810
I thought he had come home.

26
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,900
He won't have dinner with us today.

27
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,780
Says there's a gathering.

28
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,410
With whom?

29
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,100
Should be his university classmates.

30
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,980
Did he solve his winery's problem?

31
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,780
It should be solved.

You'll do your homework after dinner.

35
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,930
Sure.

36
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,660

Grandma,

38
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm not going
to the tutoring center again?

39
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,900
You're about to start middle school,

40
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,170
and your schedule will be tight.

41
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,250

You have me.

44
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,410
I'll give you private lessons at home.

And last but not least,

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,020
wish you success
in your respective fields.

96
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,700

97
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,140
Come on.

98
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,780
Come on.

99
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,020

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,340
why did you show up later

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,100
than us salaried employees?

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,780
Punish yourself with a few drinks.

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,140
Yeah.

112
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,250
Take a penalty drink.

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,700
I was late. Here goes.

114
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,610
I've got a few words for you.

115
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,140
You're not available every time.

to ask you out.

119
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,780
No way.

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,700

after all these years of working,

122
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,660
it's clear in my head now.

123

125
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,020
Regardless of our profession,

126
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,780
we have to be on call 24/7.

127
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,020
In today's society,

128
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,780
the competition is getting fiercer.

129
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,730
At home,

130
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,660
our wives have

131
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,140
to manage everything.

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,250
Actually, women have it the hardest.

133
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,900
You guys

134
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,780
should cherish your wives.

135
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,370
Do you hear that?

136
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,020
That's a must!

137
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,490
I'm talking to you!

138
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,660
Let's toast to women in our class.

139
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,140

140
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,170

146
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,850
The view here is really nice.

Sitting here,

148
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,610

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,050

150
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,370
can fade away.

151
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,930
Of course.

152
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,850
It's a prime location.

153
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,930
Come on, Ting.

154
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,060
Let me show you.

155
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:34,850
Come.

156
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,730
See over there?

157
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,700
That shopping mall.

158
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,060
That's

159
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,420
where I used to work.

160
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,980
I was a sales assistant in a shoe store.

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,180
Every day, I'd say to customers,

162
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,130
"Hello,

163
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,010
welcome! Please sit.
I'll help you try them on."

164
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,490
Every day after work,

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,610
I saw the tall building
across the street,

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,890
the very place where I live now.

167
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,130
Back then,

168
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,820
many of my customers lived here.

169
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,650
When they bought shoes,

170
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,370
they'd tell me
their community was high-end,

171
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,250
the property management
was professional,

172
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,730
and how beautiful the landscaping was.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,890
So when Yuan offered to buy me a place.

174
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,490
I told him without hesitation,

175
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,490
I want to live here.

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,730
Congratulations

177
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,370
on fulfilling your wish.

178
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,180
Thank you.

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,770
But after I moved in,

180
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,010
for a few times,

181
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,490
I ran into my former customers
in the elevator,

182
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,890
and they didn't even recognize me.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,490
Then again,

184
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,180
nobody remembers the person

185
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,770
who fetched shoes for them,

186
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,420
right?

187
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,300
But I remember very clearly

188
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,130
their attitudes,

189
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,980
the clothes they were in

190
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,060
and the perfume they wore.

191
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,250
It's great they didn't recognize me.

192
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,580
What does that prove?

193
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,250
It proves

194
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,980
I've transformed successfully.

195
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,530
Well, alright.

196
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,730
Can I say otherwise?

197
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,890
Come on.

198
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,890
To celebrate having

199
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,180
such a good little brother.

200
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,890
Yuan is indeed great.

201
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,130
This whole process of brewing…

202
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,250
Or getting into international business.

203
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,980
You know,

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,130
I really love this.

205
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,650
It's like half of my dream.

206
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,490
Want to see?

207
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,730
Si,

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,300
new materials.

209
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,420
If this works out...

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,650
Pressure suits.

211
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,770
Amazing!

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,770
In the times we live in,

213
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,650
whoever falls behind will get beaten.

214
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,250
So you have to give it your all.

215
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,530
In the future,

216
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,180
man will migrate to space stations.

217
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,610
Right!

218
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,650
And migrate to Mars!

219
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,130
For our nation's dream
of space exploration!

220
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,010
Space is a journey we must undertake.

221
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,370
To spill our blood and devote ourselves

222
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,850
without hesitation!

223
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,010
Toast to that without hesitation.

224
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,770
Come on, for immediate success.

225
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,530
Come on, Feng Rui!

226
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,610
Come on.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,250
I have to thank Rui.

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,530
If he hadn't turned it down back

229
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,250
when we graduated,

230
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,490
I wouldn't have got
that hospital position.

231
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,130
Don't.

232
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,980
Who knows

233
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,610
where I'd have worked now?

234
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,250
No.

235
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,580
Don't get into all this thanking.

236
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,700
What's meant to be yours will be yours.

237
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,010
Had nothing to do with me.

238
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,420
This might not be a big deal for you,

239
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,730
but

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,130
I can't forget this kindness,

241
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,850
right?

242
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,130
Right.

243
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,180
Don't.

244
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,610
Come on.

245
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:07,890
Bottoms up.

246
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:08,980
Finish it.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,370
Go on!

248
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,850
I'm draining my glass.

249
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,250
Take your time.

250
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,010
But...

251
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,010
Yeah.

252
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,700
But then again,

253
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,890
he's got it the easiest.

254
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,060
He's his own boss.

255
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,770
Free.

256
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,730
That's better than us.

257
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,490
Well,

258
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,650
let's switch.

259
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,340
Go back to how it was.

260
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,300
You live my life,

261
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,060
and I'll live yours.

262
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,130
Works for me.

263
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,370
Stop joking, Feng Rui.

264
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,980
With a big company

265
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,010
and a large family business,

266
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,770
now you can do

267
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,010
whatever you desire.

268
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,010
How great!

269
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,820
Here's the thing,

270
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,770
Feng Rui

271
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,300
wouldn't have given up his space dream.

272
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,220
But back then, his grandfather's

273
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,460
health was failing,

274
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,340
so he...

275
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,100
You have to remember,

276
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,220
he was a scholarship winner every year.

277
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,180
That's right.

278
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,700
A top student.

279
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,300
Definitely a top student.

280
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,820
So, you don't know me.

281
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,700
That my space dream

282
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,980
was just wishful thinking.

283
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,820
I was born for business.

284
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,420
I love doing business.

285
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,770
Well.

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,770
Come on.

287
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,180
Feng Rui,

288
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,700
then

289
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,650
I wish you great success!

290
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,010
Please give me some.

291
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,340
Alright.

292
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,300
Come on!

293
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,220
Let's cheers!

294
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,300
Come on.

295
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,770
Raise your glasses!

296
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,460
Come on.

297
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,220
Feng Rui!

298
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,820
To your great success!

299
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,580
Come on.

300
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:52,850
Ting,

301
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,730
do you think wine is a good thing?

302
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,890
What else is bothering you?

303
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,370
I don't know what it is.

304
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,890
Let me tell you.

305
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,890
Back when I was young,

306
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,850
all I wanted was to be rich.

307
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,850
I thought being rich was great,

308
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,850
so I could buy

309
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,770
any trendy bag I wanted,

310
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,770
travel wherever I felt like,

311
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,010
and date whoever I pleased.

312
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,130
But now that I'm rich,

313
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,100
I suddenly feel life is meaningless.

314
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,420
During the years you were abroad,

315
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,130
I haven't had a true friend by my side.

316
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,010
Have you thought about working?

317
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,300
What could I do?

318
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,250
Tell me what I can do.

319
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,770
I've gained weight
since I stopped dancing.

320
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,370
Not 5 kg, but 10 kg.

321
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,610
Look, I don't have a degree,

322
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,100
and I'm not skilled at anything.

323
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,530
To be a saleswoman again?

324
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,730
No way.

325
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,010
Over these years,

326
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,890
I've got used to a comfortable life,

327
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,370
so I can't handle any hardship.

328
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,610
Yuan was right about one thing.

329
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,890
I'm ambitious but unskilled.

330
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:17,890
Ting,

331
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,490
as my good friend,

332
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,490
tell me the truth.

333
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,770
After all these years abroad,

334
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,890
you didn't date a boy?

335
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,700
No.

336
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,890
Not even that?

337
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,300
No.

338
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,730
Let's drink.

339
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,370
You've got some willpower.

340
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,490
Right.

341
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,060
You're

342
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,490
a successful artist

343
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,370
and career woman.

344
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,890
But let me tell you,

345
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,980
no matter how beautiful you are,

346
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,300
how great your figure is,

347
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,460
or how rich you are,

348
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,010
if you don't get married

349
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,420
and don't have children,

350
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,610
in the end,

351
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,060
you'll be lonely
and uncared for in old age.

352
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,700
Do you know that?

353
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,820
My child didn't die.

354
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,460
Who didn't die?

355
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,610
The child I thought dead

356
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,850
12 years ago, is alive.

357
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,650
He's been with Feng Rui.

358
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,100
Feng Rui, you'll marry soon.

359
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,180
What do you feel?

360
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,340
What's there for me to say?

361
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,060
It's just

362
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,100
what all of you've experienced.

363
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,340
That's completely different, okay?

364
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,940
Come on.

365
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,130
Let those of us

366
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,650
who haven't felt happiness

367
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,180
in a long time feel your joy.

368
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,340
Wu has been raising

369
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,340
his child alone all these years,

370
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,610
being both a father and a mother.

371
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,300
It's been tough.

372
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,890
We thought he'd

373
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,650
get married and have kids，

374
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,220
but suddenly he became a dad.

375
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,610
Wu,

376
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,490
in this situation,

377
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,730
you're leading us.

378
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,490
I'm leading you.

379
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,940
The leader.

380
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,700
Rui,

381
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,820
I've always

382
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,980
been curious.

383
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,490
Back then,

384
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,060
which beauty was so charming

385
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,460
that she made you

386
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,940
a father in a short time

387
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,980
and a single dad?

388
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,890
Tell us.

389
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,220
Who was it?

390
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,180
Yeah, spill it!

391
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,370
Who was it?

392
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,730
Hey, don't bring up sensitive things!

393
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,890
Liu is right.

394
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,570
But the child's mother

395
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,220
is still around.

396
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,730
She's back.

397
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,220
Who's back?

398
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,180
How would I know?

399
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,380
Well.

400
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,730
Look,

401
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,620
Feng Rui,

402
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,900
let us know when you get married.

403
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,010
We're all waiting for that day,

404
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,050
aren't we?

405
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,900
We're all waiting for it.

406
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,660
Let me clink glasses with you.

407
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,620
Well.

408
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,460
And me.

409
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,050
Let's have a drink.

410
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,660
Come on!

411
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:41,980
You guys...

412
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,770
Come on.

413
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,420
Alright.

414
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,050
You should drink.

415
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,180
Boss,

416
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,420
let me ask you.

417
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,730
I heard

418
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,380
some news from NASA again.

419
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,810
You're right.

420
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,050
All these years, I've been all alone.

421
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,810
For 12 years,

422
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,980
it was work and more work every day.

423
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,730
You know my father's situation.

424
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,980
Not a single piece of news.

425
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,380
To put it bluntly,

426
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,460
we don't know if he's alive or not.

427
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,250
But when I found out

428
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,660
Le was my son,

429
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,620
I felt like

430
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,220
I wasn't alone anymore.

431
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,980
I didn't feel so lonely.

432
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,290
I felt my life had

433
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,010
a continuation.

434
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,220

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,290
I've missed many moments

441
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,900
when he was suffering like that.

442
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,660
For these 12 years,

443
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,010
mom has always

444
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,460
been a void in Le's heart.

445
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,460
He must have asked himself...

446
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,460
countless times

447
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,180
why other kids have a mom,

448
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,900
but he doesn't.

449
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,730
I hate Gao Hui.

450
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,620
From the very beginning,

451
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,290
she stripped me
of my right to be a mother.

452
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,730
I also hate Feng Rui.

453
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,010
All these years...

454
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,660
he deceived me with Gao Hui.

455
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,980
He didn't even call me once.

456
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,090
I also hate myself.

457
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,860
I should have seen it

458
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,810
with my own eyes back then.

459
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,490
Whether the child was alive or dead,

460
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,620
if I had insisted on seeing him,

461
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,290
would things have been different now?

462
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,180
If I tell Le I'm his mother now,

463
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,900
will he hate me?

464
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,770
Siting,

465
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,980
how is the child doing now?

466
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,730
He's doing very well.

467
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,050

468
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,900

Gao Hui and Feng Rui

470
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,740

568

If we hadn't persevered back then,

574
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,020
we might have been done for long ago.

575
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,300
Now is the hardest time.

576
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,100
We must persevere.

577
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,300
Help your mom.

578
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,780
This is the life's work
of three generations of our family.

579
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,620
Can't

580
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,580
let it collapse like this.

581
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,460
Grandpa, don't worry.

582
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,900
The company won't collapse.

583
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,460
Let's eat.

584
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:40,980
Okay.

585
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,460
How does it taste?

586
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,140
Not bad.

587
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,300
Have something to say?

588
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,580
I

589
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,860
may go abroad in a while.

590
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,340
Because

591
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,060
I can't get in touch
with the company overseas.

592
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,580
So we need to talk to them face-to-face.

593
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,620
Or my company will be in danger.

594
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,940
How long will it take?

595
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,020
At most a week.

596
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,900
I promise it'll be exactly one week.

597
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,860
During this time,

598
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,420
Ms. Ming will come over

599
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,140
to cook for you.

600
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,380
She's worked for our family
for a long time,

601
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,820
and her cooking is delicious.

602
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,180
No need.

603
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,020
I can take care of myself.

604
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,060
That won't do.

605
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,580
You're

606
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,060
the treasure of our family now.

607
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,220
After I finish my work,

608
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,500
I'll take care of the cooking.

609
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,020
So, are you saying

610
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,660
the treasure should do the dishes?

611
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,460
Of course not.

612
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,580
Doing the dishes

613
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,660
is also my job.

614
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,900
Then I'm really blessed.

615
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,820
You will cook
and wash dishes for me.

616
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,260
It's

617
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,020
my blessing.

618
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,260
Others would love to cook,

619
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,820
but no one would taste.

620
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,580
Do you still have this?

621
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,580
Always keep it close.

622
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,380
When you go abroad,

623
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,020
keep it safe.

624
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,620
I believe,

625
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,260
with this,

626
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,740
everything will go smoothly.

627
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,300
Right?

628
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:37,620
Yes.

629
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,100
Eat up.

630
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,860
Let me taste this.

631
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,340
Mr. Feng, what do you think
of this contract?

632
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,780
According to our inventory count,

633
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,940
it's mainly about introducing
six types of French wine.

634
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,420
Yes, that's right.

635
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,740
Mr. Li is quite something.

636
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,220
Mr. Feng is knowledgeable.

637
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,620
Please call me Rui.

638
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,100
Given our relationship.

639
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
We developed

640
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,300
this wine at our winery.

641
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,860
Let's push for it.

642
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,060
If that doesn't work, ten percent

643
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,620
and then five percent.

644
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,700
It's a dry red made

645
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,660
from the selected pearl grape.

646
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,900
We've spent so much on marketing costs,

647
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,460
but our sales performance

648
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,260
hasn't improved.

649
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,460
Thanks for showing respect to us.

650
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,060
Cheers.

651
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,660
Come on.

652
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,660
Actually, we have some products...

653
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,820
Thank you for your trust.

654
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,580
No.

655
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,140
Please give me a chance.

656
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,180
No.

657
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,180
We can handle this very well.

658
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,780
We can't take this risk.

659
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,540
It was low last year.

660
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,020
For this year,

661
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,900
there's no way it can be low again.

662
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,820
We have to improve it.

663
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,380
So, do you have

664
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,820
a new marketing plan?

665
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,340
Hello.

666
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,620
Hello, Mr. Feng.

667
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,580
I'm David.

668
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,660
Hi, David.

669
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,140
I have good news for you.

670
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,540
We've agreed to your proposal

671
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,860
and would like to work with you.

672
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,060
Please come and sign the contract.

673
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,700
Really?

674
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,660
Yes.

675
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,060
That's great!

676
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,500
I'll come over.

677
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:11,940
Yes.

678
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,580

does Ms. Ming's cooking suit your taste?

694
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,860
It's pretty good.

695
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,180
Bye.

696
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:42,740
Bye-bye.

697
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,060
I'll walk you in.

698
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,580
I can do it.

699
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,100
It's okay.

700
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,900
Be careful on your way.

701
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:46,620
Bye.

702
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,820
Although Le doesn't have a mother,

703
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,940
what he lacks the least

704
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,460
is love.

705
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,580
Yan's given him

706
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
the maternal love he was missing.

707
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,380
She taught him piano

708
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,900
and took care of his daily life.

709
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,820
For all these years,

710
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,420
it has never stopped.

711
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,420
During pregnancy,

712
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,860
a woman's hormone levels are imbalanced.

713
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,620
The challenges she may face

714
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,820
can be unsolvable at this stage.

715
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,580
It might lead to significant mental stress,

716
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,020
anxiety, insomnia,
mood swings, frequent crying,

717
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,540
and slow reactions.

718
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,980
These are clear signs
of prenatal depression.

719
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,020
Never underestimate it.

720
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,620
If not handled properly,

721
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,500
there may be severe consequences.

722
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,220
Thanks.

723
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,940
I may go abroad in a while.

724
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,060
How long will it take?

725
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,460
At most a week.

726
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,780
I promise it'll be exactly one week.

727
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,060
Ms. Tan,

728
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,180
are you okay?

729
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,700
When are you coming back?

730
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,420
It might take another two weeks.

731
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,460
You've been gone for over 20 days.

732
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,100
I know.

733
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,140
It's almost over.

734
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,340
At most half a month.

735
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,180
I'll be back this time.

736
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,900
Does Ms. Ming's cooking suit your taste?

737
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,100
It's pretty good.

738
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,420
That's great.

739
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,460
Going into the elevator now,
might lose signal.

740
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,340
I'll hang up.

741
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,380
Bye-bye.

742
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,060
Hello, Shuhan.

743
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,380
Wait for me there.

744
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,300
I'm tidying up now.

745
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,420
Leaving soon, very soon.

746
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:01,980
Hello.

747
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,940
Hello, Shuhan.

748
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,220
You're awake.

749
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,300
Do you have a headache?

750
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,100
Why

751
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,300
are you up so early?

752
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,780
I came in the morning

753
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,820
to make you a hangover soup.

754
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,380
Here.

755
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,300
How is it?

756
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,620
Thoughtful, right?

757
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,900
I drank too much yesterday.

758
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,740
Troubled you again.

759
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,820
Don't say anything.

760
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,980
Just drink the soup.

761
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,300
Don't waste my efforts.

762
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,660
Okay.

763
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,780
Drinking the hangover soup.

764
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,660
Le,

765
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,100
he…

766
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,260
Last night,

767
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,140
his grandma knew you'd be back late,

768
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,980
so she picked him up. Don't worry.

769
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,260
By the way,

770
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,500
how's your concert preparation going?

771
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,660
Going quite smoothly.

772
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,460
Has it been scheduled?

773
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,180
When?

774
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,140
Whenever you want to hear it.

775
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,060
I'll hold it

776
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,100
whenever you want.

777
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,780
Me...

778
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,820
Once I'm sober,

779
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,700
we'll decide.

780
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,500
This time, not bad.

781
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,620
Add a point.

782
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,980
Finally, no thank you.

783
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,540
I haven't decided yet.

784
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,900
I want

785
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,660
to pick an auspicious date.

786
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,580
Enough, that's about it.

787
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,700
Drink more, finish it.

788
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,700
Have some more.

789
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,500
[Cygne]

790
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,540
Dad,

791
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,300
what's up?

792
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,140
Rui,

793
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,140
are you busy?

794
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,180
Not really. Go ahead.

795
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,620
I went to the countryside yesterday

796
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,140
and met an old friend.

797
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,500
Do you know who I met?

798
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,420
Who?

799
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,020
Do you still remember

800
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,180
that distant Fifth Uncle?

801
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,380
Fifth Uncle?

802
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,740
Of course, I do.

803
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,660
Hearing you're getting married,

804
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,180
he was overjoyed.

805
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,620
So,

806
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,700
how is his health?

807
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,820
Not bad.

808
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,380
He's almost 100 years old.

809
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,420
How are the wedding preparations going?

810
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,300
When will you register your marriage?

811
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,900
Not yet.

812
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,340
Rui,

813
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,580
this is a big deal.

814
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,260
Whatever happened

815
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,580
in the past,

816
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,260
it's all over now.

817
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,700
Cherish the one with you now.

818
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,620
I know.

819
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,460
Ms. Tan,

820
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,540
you really want Yufan to perform

821
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,180
the bridesmaid variation
from Don Quixote Act I?

822
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,980
The previous piece was indeed beautiful

823
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,860
and would earn good scores.

824
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,100
However, considering her abilities,

825
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,380
I think we should choose

826
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,700
a more striking piece for her

827
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,500
to achieve higher scores.

828
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,660
But for a competition like this,

829
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,060
the Youth Group tends
to select light-hearted,

830
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,460
beautiful and easy to perform pieces.

831
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,980
The safer the choice,

832
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,100
the harder it is to stand out.

833
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,420
At this level of competition,

834
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,220
you'll face highly skilled competitors.

835
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,300
Among contestants of similar caliber,

836
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,620
more than half tend

837
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,980
to choose the same variation.

838
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,300
Given these circumstances,

839
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,020
how confident are you

840
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,220
about securing a good score?

841
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,140
Raising the difficulty now,

842
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
can she pull it off?

843
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,580
There are two months left.

844
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,700
It's enough.

845
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,060
Changing the piece, style and variation

846
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,300
before the competition

847
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,620
is like switching weapons

848
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,780
before a battle.

849
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,220
That's risky.

850
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,140
Want to dance this variation?

851
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,260
Yes.

852
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,180
I mean,

853
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,140
for this competition,

854
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,540
want to dance this variation?

855
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,940
The piece you practiced before

856
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,860
will make it difficult

857
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
to win a major award.

858
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,060
When Dusselmeyer was preparing
for her competition,

859
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,900
she chose the Dream Variation

860
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,660
from Don Quixote Act II.

861
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,860
That's too simple for you.

862
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,980
Can't show all your strengths.

863
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,580
With your technique

864
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,820
and expressiveness,

865
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,180
you can handle a more challenging piece.

866
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,260
So, will you dance this variation

867
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,140
for this competition?

868
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,220
You think

869
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,940
I can do it?

870
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,620
Yes.

871
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,300
Okay.

872
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,100
