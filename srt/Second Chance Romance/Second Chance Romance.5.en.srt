18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,840
[Episode 5]

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,920
Still no news from your dad?

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,680
None.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,320
We've asked everyone we should,

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,800
and searched everywhere we could,

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
yet not a single clue.

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,760
He wanted to leave this sad place,

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,960
probably because what happened earlier

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,120
struck him.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,520
He didn't tell you

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,240
because he didn't want to trouble you.

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,840
I understand how he feels.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
I also know that.

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,440
But haven't seen him for years.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm desperate to find him now.

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,320
I've asked my friends to help inquire.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,800
Once there's any news,

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,160
I'll let you know.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,440
Thank you, Yuan.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,240
You don't have to thank me.

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,880
Yuan.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,960
About your sponsorship for the school,

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,440
first of all, thank you.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
I know how incredibly kind-hearted

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,360
and passionate you are,

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,520
but if this is...

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,240
I'm fully giving back to society.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,200
Overthinking it.

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
Hope I'm overthinking,

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,600
but I need to say this.

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,160
If it is because of me,

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,600
please don't do this again.

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
I admit

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,360
the donation started with you,

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,160
but everything I said before

53
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,160
was completely true.

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,120
I first knew about ballet through you.

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,080
I hope our country's ballet scene

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,440
can develop even further.

57
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
As for the donation,

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,840
please don't feel burdened by it.

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,040
I was doing what I believe is right.

60
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,200
Besides,

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm no billionaire,

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,960
just a small-time boss
who earned some modest profits.

63
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
Only get to be self-indulgent
now and then.

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,280
Just let me have this.

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,240
I said that
just because you're not that wealthy.

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,600
You have only earned modest profits.

67
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,560
No repeats,

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,240
okay?

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,640
Here.

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,080
Yeah.

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,640
You probably won't invite me up

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,440
for drinks?

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,920
I just moved in,

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,360
so the place is still a mess.

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,480
Not really fit for guests yet.

76
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
But I'll have you over once it's set!

77
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,160
Okay.

78
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,320
I'm leaving.

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,440
Bye!

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,000
Take care!

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,560
Okay.

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,840
Siting.

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,000
Does your phone want me up?

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,520
You brat.

85
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,240
Never change

86
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,040
your forgetful habit.

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,600
Siting,

88
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,160
having you back

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,240
is such a gift.

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,320
Bye now!

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,640
Drive safely.

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,800
Bye.

93
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,400
Remember to bring Peiyan home
tomorrow afternoon,

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
so your grandfather can see her.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,040
I want to marry Ting.

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,800
Rui,

97
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,040
you've always been sensible.

98
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,200
Whether with business matters

99
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
or family responsibilities,

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,400
you give us

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
the least worries.

102
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,080
Honestly,

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,840
Haotian didn't compare to you.

104
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,720
You two

105
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,440
grew up together

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,080
like brothers,

107
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,480
though he's technically your elder.

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,600
This whole situation

109
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,920
caught everyone off guard.

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,240
Even if

111
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
Tan had no intention

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,880
of blackmailing Haotian,

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,640
Haotian's death

114
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,800
rests on his hands!

115
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,880
Yet you want to marry her?

116
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,200
Want to add more drama to us?

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,440
Are you trying to trap us

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,840
in this pain forever

119
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,640
and reminding us of Haotian's death?

120
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,840
Feng Rui,

121
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,760
think this through.

122
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,760
What your mother said makes sense.

123
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,880
Even if what you said is true,

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
it has nothing to do with Ting.

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,120
She knows nothing about this.

126
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,160
We've been together

127
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,240
for so long now.

128
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,840
I know her true nature all too well.

129
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,440
Haotian is dead,

130
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,880
but will his shadow haunt my life?

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,880
In your heart,

132
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,760
is he more important than me?

133
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,920
You pampered him endlessly
since childhood.

134
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,160
Did you ever consider my feelings?

135
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,040
He was reckless and carefree,

136
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,640
while I must be sensible and obedient.

137
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,440
Is that fair?

138
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,800
Stop it!

139
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,880
End it now.

140
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,360
I can't.

141
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,760
She's pregnant.

142
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,680
Carrying my child.

143
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,480
Whether you approve or not,

144
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,920
we're staying together

145
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
and having this baby.

146
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720
When it mattered most,

147
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,520
you didn't say a word.

148
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,800
What more can I say?

149
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,280
She's pregnant.

150
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
Let this child be born.

151
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,600
Though it's hard to accept,

152
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,040
this is Rui's child after all.

153
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,080
I've lost Haotian.

154
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
I can't lose my great-grandchild.

155
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
Have you set a date yet?

156
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,080
Rui, step up.

157
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,760
Don't keep her waiting.

158
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,240
We're preparing everything.

159
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,520
Rui's fully committed.

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,520
Please don't worry.

161
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:14,800
Good.

162
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,520
I'm here.

163
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,440
You've arrived already.

164
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,760
You got here before me.

165
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,080
We were chatting

166
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,120
for a while.

167
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,280
Yan is obviously a good girl.

168
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,360
Rui is really lucky.

169
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes, Dad.

170
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,400
Let me help you.

171
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,960
No need.

172
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,040
Ms. Ming's here at home.

173
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,880
Ms. Ming.

174
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,640
Please sit.

175
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,280
Have a seat!

176
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,520
Here.

177
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,040
Have a seat.

178
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,520
Get this

179
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,560
and this.

180
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,160
You should sit down.

181
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,160
Your grandfather and father

182
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,280
were so happy

183
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,600
when they heard your news.

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,200
Yes.

185
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,240
Dad,

186
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,720
here you are.

187
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,680
You give it.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,520
You give it to her.

189
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,840
You do it.

190
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,480
Dad, you…

191
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,160
Hurry up.

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,480
Here.

193
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,560
Open it.

194
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,320
This is our family heirloom.

195
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,600
Now we're giving it to you.

196
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,800
Isn't this

197
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,880
too soon?

198
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,040
Not at all.

199
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,600
You've known each other for years.

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,720
Since you've decided to marry,

201
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,400
build your own family

202
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,040
as soon as possible.

203
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,040
But this gift is too valuable

204
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,080
and my family isn't formal about this.

205
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,960
Please accept it.

206
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,320
From now on,

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,360
please take care of Rui.

208
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,400
Please take it.

209
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,920
Alright then.

210
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,200
I'll keep it.

211
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,160
Thank you.

212
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,080
Everything is lovely,

213
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
though it makes me gain weight easily.

214
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,600
Indeed.

215
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,000
Why did you buy Le the model airplane?

216
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,920
I thought you have serious matters.

217
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,000
Look,

218
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,320
you spent 30,000 yuan

219
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
teaching him dishonesty.

220
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
We should play fair,

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,720
right?

222
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,040
When others pay,

223
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,360
of course we have to pay too!

224
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,040
What is the competition about?

225
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,160
I know what you want to say.

226
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,240
Those children bullied him last time,

227
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,320
and now they're trying to humiliate him.

228
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,240
But I want to teach Le

229
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,640
how to build his self-confidence.

230
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,600
That may be true,

231
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,760
but this isn't honest.

232
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Do you want him to accept dishonesty?

233
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
Rui,

234
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,480
stop making such a big deal

235
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,920
out of every parenting issue.

236
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,720
Don't be so stubborn.

237
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,560
Fine.

238
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,280
But

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,240
don't do this again.

240
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,000
Rui,

241
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,400
I won't meddle
with your way of parenting.

242
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,680
Don't tell me
how to spend money on the child,

243
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,400
okay?

244
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,920
Money isn't the solution to everything.

245
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,480
How did it go with your mom just now?

246
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,560
Did you speak to her gently?

247
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,120
Well,

248
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,640
just talked things through.

249
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
The grandparent syndrome.

250
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
She only did this

251
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,480
to make Le happy.

252
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:40,920
No.

253
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,360
I shouldn't have interfered.

254
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,520
This is between you and your mom.

255
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,880
I trust you'll handle it well.

256
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,880
Is this really your family's heirloom?

257
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,600
Is it appropriate?

258
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,080
Of course.

259
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,760
I mean

260
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,280
should I accept it?

261
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,200
Absolutely.

262
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,080
Why did you stop?

263
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,360
It's pointless.

264
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,360
What do you mean?

265
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,280
Dancing is pointless.

266
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,440
Repeating it so many times,

267
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
I feel like a machine.

268
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,600
There's no joy in it.

269
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,320
You're quite perceptive,

270
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,280
recognizing where your frustration lies.

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,640
What do you mean?

272
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,800
Your technique is flawless,

273
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,400
but nothing here.

274
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
You're going back home every day.

275
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
Don't you live in the dorms?

276
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,960
No. I go home.

277
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,920
Ms. Tan.

278
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,640
Dad,

279
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,760
could we use a more powerful motor

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
to increase the thrust-to-weight ratio?

281
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,880
Theoretically possible,

282
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,120
but your school rules require

283
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,600
identical power configurations
for everyone.

284
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,280
So that won't work.

285
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,520
But here's another angle.

286
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,400
To reduce the plane's weight.

287
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,000
Hello,

288
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,880
Ms. Tan.

289
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm right across from you.

290
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,880
What are you doing here?

291
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,560
Heading to rehearsal?

292
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
I'll take you to a place.

293
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,160
Modify the plane's exterior

294
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
to boost its stability.

295
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,200
How?

296
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,280
Right here,

297
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,840
add a wing fence

298
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,000
on each main wing.

299
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,400
Increased stability means

300
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,960
straighter, faster flight.

301
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
Isn't raw speed what you want?

302
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,120
Let's get to work.

303
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,440
First, remove this section.

304
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,880
This part.

305
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,320
Is this a lesson for today?

306
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,120
You could say yes

307
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,160
or no.

308
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,360
Anyway.

309
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,480
Eat as you like.

310
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,760
You earned it with today's workout.

311
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,800
Taste good?

312
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,360
Yes.

313
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,640
If no milk in it, I'd have eaten it.

314
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,760
Was that fun just now?

315
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,080
Yeah.

316
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,480
So dance

317
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,560
doesn't just happen in the studio.

318
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,120
It doesn't even

319
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,280
belong solely to the stage.

320
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,400
Thanks.

321
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,640
For what?

322
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,600
For teaching me how to feel it.

323
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,680
That's all?

324
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,880
Nothing more than that?

325
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,960
Dance

326
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,880
should be joyful,

327
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,440
like eating ice cream.

328
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,320
I shouldn't chase only success.

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,240
If you see dance

330
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,600
as your life,

331
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,600
don't feel merely

332
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,440
its pain

333
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,400
in life.

334
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Because

335
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
I know rehearsals hurt.

336
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,880
But

337
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,200
your life

338
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,480
can't be defined by pain alone.

339
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,760
You have talent

340
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,480
and relentless drive.

341
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,280
But as you push so hard,

342
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,520
you only focus

343
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,160
on rehearsals

344
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
and perfecting movements.

345
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,840
If you want to be a dancer,

346
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,640
cultivate awareness of people

347
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
and things around you,

348
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,160
especially beauty in ordinary things.

349
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,840
I still believe

350
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,720
you were born for ballet.

351
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,600
Dad,

352
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,640
if I'd known you were so skilled,

353
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,360
I would've sought your guidance
from day one.

354
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,160
Would've saved me many detours!

355
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,000
Well, whose fault is that?

356
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,880
You're too busy even to see me.

357
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,240
Besides,

358
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,800
our family's always

359
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,080
been in the wine business.

360
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
Never thought you had
model airplane expertise.

361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
Do you love model airplanes?

362
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,400
Of course!

363
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,920
Every boy dreams

364
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,560
of conquering space.

365
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,200
That's why I joined

366
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,840
every school competition.

367
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
With my smarts,

368
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
I'm somewhat of a legend

369
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,000
in youth model airplane circles.

370
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,720
A legend, huh?

371
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,320
Both sides are set up now.

372
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,760
It's ready.

373
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,400
I'll connect them.

374
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,920
Okay. Come on.

375
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,920
Did you ever have dreams?

376
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,000
Of course I did.

377
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,520
Why did you give them up?

378
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,560
It's complicated.

379
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,560
Because of me?

380
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,800
What?

381
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,240
Mom chased her dreams bravely,

382
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,120
while you gave yours up

383
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
to take care of me, right?

384
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,760
Don't think that way.

385
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
Life brings countless experiences

386
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,080
and countless people.

387
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,640
Any of them could alter your path.

388
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,640
But I still believe

389
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,640
you've sacrificed a lot for me.

390
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,800
Truly didn't.

391
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
I once dreamed of aerospace,

392
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,480
but now my dreams

393
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,280
are my wine business,

394
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,360
and watching you grow up.

395
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,160
So I hope you'll persevere

396
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,840
with what sets your soul alive.

397
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
That was quite moving.

398
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,160
Now let's test fly.

399
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,040
Alright!

400
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,200
Yes!

401
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,080
Success!

402
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,520
Way to go, Dad.

403
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,680
What do you say?

404
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,440
Incredible.

405
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,200
Want to give it a try?

406
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,760
Go.

407
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,200
Come on.

408
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,680
Try it.

409
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,120
Go!

410
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,140
[The 9th Grade-Level
Model Airplane Finals Scorecard]

411
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,980
Come on!

412
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,840
Keep going!

413
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,360
The flight team is taking the field.

414
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,960
Push harder.

415
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:31,560
Go!

416
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,760
Go for it.

417
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,120
Give it up for them.

418
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,960
Presenting the gold medals.

419
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
A huge round of applause!

420
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,280
Tiring you out?

421
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,560
We did it.

422
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,400
Finally

423
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,840
got something here.

424
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,440
The label of Huacan's

425
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,800
new wine is genuinely

426
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,280
clean and sophisticated.

427
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,680
Something we can learn from.

428
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,000
But what matters is the taste.

429
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,640
Here.

430
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,640
What do you think?

431
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,360
Noticeably sweet.

432
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,800
I find it quite pleasant.

433
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,920
Hao makes a valid point.

434
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,120
For Riesling,

435
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,000
the sweetness-acidity balance

436
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,440
should be moderate.

437
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,440
This is too sweet,

438
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,960
though ladies might favor it.

439
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,840
Is the Pinot Noir ready?

440
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:58,960
Yes.

441
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,520
Decanted?

442
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,280
Yes.

443
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,200
Compared to Cabernet Sauvignon,
Pinot Noir is softer,

444
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,520
with a paler hue, less tannic,

445
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,320
and lighter body, full-bodied.

446
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,320
Yet it carries such finesse

447
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,440
with notes of delicate wild flowers.

448
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,640
Really something for the palate

449
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,680
to discover.

450
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,160
But this...

451
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,280
doesn't surpass our Cygne.

452
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,840
Exactly.

453
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,880
We haven't unleashed

454
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,640
our flagship Cabernet yet.

455
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
If they're fielding these two wines,

456
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,640
I'd say our odds look favorable.

457
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
This tasting event

458
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,080
could be huge

459
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
for our brand exposure.

460
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,320
Industry heavyweights

461
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,880
will be there.

462
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,160
Huacan's bringing

463
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,720
their best reserves

464
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,280
to compete with us.

465
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,120
What wine should we counter with?

466
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,720
Walk through again.

467
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,440
Little boy,

468
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,240
is there something

469
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
you forgot to pay for?

470
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,840
I didn't buy anything.

471
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,320
And only my own stuff is in my bag.

472
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,360
See, our security gate

473
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,120
only beeps

474
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,320
when you walk through

475
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,480
with unpaid items.

476
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,120
Could we check

477
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,760
what's in your bag?

478
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,040
Fine.

479
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
This isn't mine.

480
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,680
I don't know why it is in my bag.

481
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,680
School supplies

482
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,480
don't grow legs,

483
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,120
nor can they hop into your bag.

484
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,840
Do you understand?

485
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,360
I swear I didn't take it.

486
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,600
It wasn't me.

487
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,080
Either pay for it

488
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,280
or admit what happened.

489
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,720
Do that, and we'll let this go.

490
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,520
We won't tell

491
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,040
your parents or school.

492
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,520
Deal?

493
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,200
I won't pay,

494
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
or admit it,

495
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,520
because I never took it.

496
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,000
Hey, you,

497
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,480
just own up to it.

498
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,080
We'll let you go.

499
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,880
Why should I, since I never did?

500
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,560
We're not accusing you falsely.

501
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,160
This item

502
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,040
was found in your bag,

503
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,720
right?

504
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,320
If you didn't put it there,

505
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,440
who else could have?

506
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,680
I did not steal anything.

507
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,320
Call the police then.

508
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,960
They'll teach you a lesson.

509
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,600
Child,

510
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,000
admit your mistake.

511
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
Or you can just buy the item.

512
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,400
It's barely anything.

513
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,480
If you're sent to the police station,

514
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,040
your future may be ruined.

515
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,320
This isn't about money.

516
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,840
Paying would mean

517
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
I admit stealing,

518
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,840
but I didn't steal it.

519
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,840
I refuse.

520
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,840
I won't admit what I didn't do.

521
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,840
You have security cameras.

522
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,360
Just check the footage.

523
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,280
Let me through, please.

524
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,400
Ms. Tan.

525
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,280
Le,

526
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,600
I saw what happened

527
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,320
with that pen.

528
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
I can vouch for you.

529
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,520
Exactly.

530
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,360
I was reading behind that bookshelf

531
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,560
by the glass panel.

532
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,320
It's a blind spot,

533
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,760
probably with no camera coverage.

534
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,280
Blind spot?

535
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,320
What's your evidence

536
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
to prove he stole this pen?

537
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,280
Well.

538
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,320
We found it in his bag.

539
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,880
Then

540
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,520
could this

541
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,400
be considered defamation?

542
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Seems we have to go

543
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
down to the police station.

544
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,040
Let it go.

545
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,080
It isn't something valuable.

546
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,280
Troublesome to go there.

547
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
The police are busy enough

548
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,280
and we've got much going on here.

549
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,000
Let it go.

550
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,680
This isn't about money.

551
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,840
It may seem small to adults,

552
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,800
but for a child,

553
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,360
this is everything.

554
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,120
His reputation is at stake,

555
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,800
so we must get to the truth.

556
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,400
Ren Zhexi,

557
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,240
don't leave.

558
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,840
You put it in my bag, right?

559
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,240
Any proof?

560
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,280
How dare you talk nonsense!

561
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,720
Ms. Tan,

562
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,960
he lost to me
in this morning's competition,

563
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,760
so he holds a grudge
and wants to get back at me.

564
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,640
If that's your story,

565
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,360
we should go to the police station.

566
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,080
We can investigate.

567
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,040
If his fingerprints are on this pen,

568
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,400
it means he planted it.

569
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,880
Once they find

570
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,320
your fingerprints,

571
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,680
how will you explain that?

572
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,880
Don't talk nonsense.

573
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,880
Regarding theft,

574
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm not an expert.

575
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,040
But I do know

576
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,560
that for minors like students,

577
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
the law won't impose severe punishment.

578
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,480
However, your parents will be informed.

579
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,080
No.

580
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
Don't call my parents!

581
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,720
I put it in his bag.

582
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
I did it.

583
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,240
Please, I beg you.

584
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,960
Don't call my parents.

585
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,880
I... I know I was wrong.

586
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,840
Ma'am, please.

587
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,560
Please.

588
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,560
Don't call my parents.

589
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,840
What do you think?

590
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,160
Here, your books.

591
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,800
Thank you.

592
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,280
This is the pen.

593
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,840
Okay.

594
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,520
A gift.

595
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,680
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

596
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
If you hadn't been here,

597
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,000
I'd have been mistaken for a thief.

598
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,480
You're welcome.

599
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,960
Never admit anything

600
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,440
that we've never done.

601
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,320
So don't be afraid.

602
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,600
Going to class now?

603
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,880
Yes, I'm running late.

604
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,480
I have a class too, and I'm also late.

605
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,280
Then let's hurry!

606
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,640
Run.

607
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
Okay, very good!

608
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,960
Put it down.

609
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,640
Let's do another set.

610
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,160
Listen to my command.

611
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,640
Take your things.

612
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,480
Alright!

613
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
After class, practice the moves

614
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,240
you learned today.

615
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,640
Ms. Tan, bye-bye.

616
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,280
Bye-bye.

617
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,160
Le,

618
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,480
observing the class?

619
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,000
Is class over?

620
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:37,720
Yes.

621
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,320
My dad's stuck in traffic
and will be late picking me up.

622
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,240
From now on,

623
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,000
whether coming early
or finishing your class early,

624
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,160
you can come in
to observe anytime you want.

625
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,360
Want to come in and try it out?

626
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,560
Can I?

627
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,280
Of course.

628
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,360
Ms. Tan, what is this?

629
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,280
A yoga block.

630
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,560
They use it as an aid

631
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,400
while practicing poses.

632
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,520
No matter what profession you train for,

633
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,560
or what special talent you pursue,

634
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,960
it's actually all quite tough.

635
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,680
When I was little, Grandma signed me up
for piano lessons,

636
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,600
and she said

637
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
that playing the piano is elegant,

638
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,240
and the piano is a social tool,
or something like that.

639
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,600
Did she say that?

640
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,600
As long as you enjoy it,

641
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,680
you won't feel tired.

642
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,000
No wonder you're my dad's friend.

643
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,000
You both say the same things.

644
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
Would you like something to drink?

645
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,040
Let me treat you to a beverage.

646
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,240
Okay!

647
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,800
What would you like to have?

648
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:09,960
Sorry.

649
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,720
How about milk or cola?

650
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
Let's skip the milk.

651
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,360
I'm allergic to dairy since childhood.

652
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,640
A bottle of cola then.

653
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,960
So am I.

654
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,680
Really?

655
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,160
I'll have cola with you.

656
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:21,840
Thank you.

657
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,800
You're welcome.

658
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,720
Alright.

659
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,640
Ms. Tan,

660
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,640
when did you start learning ballet?

661
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,960
At four years old.

662
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
It was painful at first

663
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,280
and I cried every day.

664
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,520
After crying so much, I got used to it.

665
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,680
Is learning ballet that tough?

666
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,560
If you love it, you won't feel hard.

667
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,920
All I see is the beauty of it.

668
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,600
Tiptoeing and stretching your legs,

669
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,440
every single move looks so painful.

670
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,000
Learning piano seems easier suddenly.

671
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
People often say

672
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,000
one minute on stage
takes ten years of practice offstage.

673
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,680
Learning anything can be tough.

674
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
It's quite impressive

675
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,760
that you have an interest in ballet.

676
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,120
Maybe it runs in the blood.

677
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,600
Dad.

678
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,720
You…

679
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,440
Ms. Tan treated me to a drink.

680
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,880
He just finished his class,

681
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,320
so we chatted for a bit.

682
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,480
Say thank you to Ms. Tan.

683
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,560
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

684
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,440
You're welcome.

685
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,960
If there's nothing else,
I'll be heading off.

686
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,200
Bye-bye!

687
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,320
Bye!

688
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Drinking cola, huh?

689
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,680
Give it to me.

690
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,720
Give it here.

691
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,560
I only had a little bit.

692
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,520
I told you not to drink cola.

693
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,240
Go.

694
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:54,640
Dad,

695
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,040
today Ren Zhexi

696
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,920
tried to frame me at the bookstore

697
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,080
by putting an unpaid pen into my bag.

698
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,840
Why didn't you call me right away?

699
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,240
Many people were surrounding me.

700
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,200
Fortunately, Ms. Tan was there

701
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,400
and helped me out of the situation.

702
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,320
Or I'd have been in big trouble today.

703
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,680
You know, your friend is pretty cool.

704
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,840
Ms. Deng,

705
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,040
please help me check

706
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,080
Feng Lexuan's information
from the piano class?

707
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,520
I need to contact his parents.

708
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,200
Okay,

709
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,880
I'll check it for you.

710
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,400
Thank you.

711
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,440
Here it is.

712
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,480
Thanks again.

713
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,040
You're welcome.

714
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,960
Mini Puff without milk.

715
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,640
-Thanks.
- All right.

716
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,560
Let's skip the milk.

717
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,960
I'm allergic to dairy since childhood.

718
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,240
So am I.

719
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,440
So, have you been married
for a long time?

720
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:28,840
Yes.

721
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,240
We...

722
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,760
We've been together a long time.

723
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,240
Just haven't had the wedding yet.

724
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,960
Bye-bye.

725
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,200
Bye.

726
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,040
Has Ms. Wen left work yet?

727
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,600
You haven't seen each other
for a long time, right?

728
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
At least ten years...

729
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,480
Ten years?

730
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,680
Oh my Goodness!

731
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,320
Twelve years.

732
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,160
Because I've been gone for twelve years.

733
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,280
The baby suffered
severe oxygen deprivation

734
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,520
during childbirth.

735
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
And it was less than

736
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,240
31 weeks of gestation.

737
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,320
[Feng Rui]

738
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,920
Feng Rui,

739
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
have you known about this?

740
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,720
But why didn't you tell me

741
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,560
all these years?

742
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,600
Because you had chosen Wen Peiyan?

743
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,760
Or did you collude
with Gao Hui to deceive me?

744
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,780
[Date of Birth: March 24, 2011]

745
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,840
Really?

746
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,320
No wonder he repeated a grade.

747
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,520
How could he do this?

748
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
This is a bit unkind.

749
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,040
It's okay.

750
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,320
Fortunately, Ms. Tan was there.

751
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,560
Or I'd have been in big trouble.

752
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,000
She is truly beautiful and kind-hearted.

753
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,840
Feng Lexuan,

754
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,080
someone's looking for you outside.

755
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,000
Come with me.

756
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If you haven't prepared your lunch box,

757
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,280
get them out.

758
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
The food will be here shortly.

759
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,640
Ms. Tan.

760
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,640
Le.

761
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,280
What brings you here?

762
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,360
Just passing by
and thought I'd say hello.

763
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,720
And I brought some pizza.

764
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:28,960
Miss,

765
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,600
can I have lunch with her?

766
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,960
Alright.

767
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,480
But do not leave the school.

768
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,800
Go back to our classroom after eating.

769
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,720
Is it delicious?

770
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Yes.

771
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,960
Eat slowly.

772
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,680
Ms. Tan,

773
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,680
aren't you going to eat?

774
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,960
I've eaten.

775
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,520
By the way,

776
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,960
is this yours?

777
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,640
It's my piano score.

778
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,240
Thank you.

779
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,520
I have such a forgetful habit.

780
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,960
I knew it was yours

781
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,440
when I saw it in the ballet classroom.

782
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,000
It's so refreshing!

783
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,440
My dad doesn't let me drink cola.

784
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,400
Ms. Wen lets me drink a little bit.

785
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,800
Drink as much as you want today.

786
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,760
Your dad isn't here.

787
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:24,960
Le,

788
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
you call Yan

789
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,360
Ms. Wen.

790
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,800
Isn't she your mother?

791
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,800
No.

792
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,480
She's my dad's girlfriend.

793
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,360
She teaches me to play the piano.

794
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,560
When I was born,

795
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,000
my mom passed away.

796
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,840
Grandma said it was due to labor.

797
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,880
Ms. Tan,

798
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,320
why are you asking this?

799
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,200
Although I'm your dad's good friend,

800
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,120
as I was abroad for many years,

801
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,840
I thought

802
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,360
Yan and your dad were married.

803
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
But they are going to get married.

804
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,360
It should be soon.

805
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,040
Because Grandma has given

806
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,200
the family heirloom to Ms. Wen.

807
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,840
Your grandma must hope

808
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,040
she becomes your mom, right?

809
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,280
Yeah.

810
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,760
She has been urging them.

811
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,320
But my dad is sometimes so moody.

812
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,720
I don't know what he's thinking.

813
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,800
Look at you, knowing so much already!

814
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,240
Of course.

815
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,960
Ms. Tan,

816
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,760
as my dad's good friend,

817
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,480
help me persuade him.

818
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,080
He won't listen to me.

819
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,000
As a man,

820
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,920
he should take initiative.

821
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,400
If he likes Ms. Wen,

822
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,920
he should have married her earlier.

823
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,040
I will.

824
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,200
Ms. Tan,

825
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,680
can I attend

826
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,200
your ballet class on the weekend?

827
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,120
Le,

828
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,480
recently I have

829
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,000
had something to take care of.

830
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,960
I might take some time off.

831
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,360
Once I'm done with it,

832
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,560
I'll let you know

833
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,400
and we'll meet and drink cola.

834
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,280
Really?

835
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,880
Thank you.

836
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,280
Hope to see you again soon.

837
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,920
Eat.

838
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,600
Here,

839
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,280
a napkin.

840
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,640
Thank you.

841
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,920
Is it delicious?

842
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,520
Are you hungry?

843
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,640
What did you have for lunch?

844
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,720
Ms. Tan treated me to lunch.

845
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,360
We had pizza and cola.

846
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Don't tell my dad.

847
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,400
Ms. Tan?

848
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,600
Yes, the teacher from the ballet class

849
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,280
next to the piano room.

850
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,000
Why did she meet you?

851
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,200
When I went to see her last time,

852
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,400
I left my piano score there,

853
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,720
so she sent it to me.

854
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,320
She brought it here for you.

855
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,840
Did you thank her?

856
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,280
It's okay. We know each other well.
