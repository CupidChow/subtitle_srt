193
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,770
is

194
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,180
this Old Sir you mentioned

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,370
Qu Zhen's grandfather?

196
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,100
Is he from around here?

197
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,610
He...

198
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,700
He's actually Han, not Tibetan.

199
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,940
She said Old Sir is actually Han,

200
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,650
not Tibetan.

201
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,700
He's been here

202
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,180
for a long time.

203
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,060
He said Old Sir has been here
for a long time.

204
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,730
They treat him as one of their own
and live together.

205
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,490
Qu Zhen

206
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,340
learned ballet
because Old Sir told her about it.

207
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,530
She said Qu Zhen learned ballet
because of Old Sir.

208
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,060
Well,

209
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,370
how old

210
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,530
is this Old Sir?

211
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,220
How old is Old Sir?

212
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,340
Around sixty.

213
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,700
Duoji.

214
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,060
Is this it?

215
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,530
That's him.

216
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,130
Yes.

217
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,100
Old Sir.

218
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,530
Old Sir has been protecting

219
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,060
our Tibetan antelopes here.

220
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,940
So he often goes into the mountains.

221
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,010
He's gone for months at a time.

222
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,340
Since he's a volunteer,

223
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,820
sometimes he runs short

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,180
on food and drink.

225
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,220
Fortunately, when the weather is good,

226
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,890
the villagers will bring him

227
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,650
some necessities.

228
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,250
They are heroes in our eyes.

229
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,100
Ms. Tan, let's go.

230
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,650
Up ahead?

231
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:41,730
Right over there.

232
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,010
These fences

233
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,530
were all put up by Old Sir
and the others.

234
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,490
It's really remote here.

235
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,180
Sir.

236
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,850
Sir.

237
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,300
Are you home?

238
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,850
Yes.

239
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,580
Sir.

240
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,530
Dad.

241
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,460
Here.

242
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,820
Have some apples.

243
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,130
Apples are rare

244
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,770
around here.

245
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,250
These are

246
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,370
what people usually

247
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,010
bring for me.

248
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,730
Try some.

249
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,300
Butter tea.

250
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:31,850
Here.

251
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,300
Thank you, sir.

252
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,220
You can't have dairy.

253
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,420
Have a sip of this.

254
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,940
Plain tea is fine.

255
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:47,940
Here.

256
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:55,890
Careful, it's hot.

257
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,180
Mr. Feng,

258
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,850
I never expected

259
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,580
we'd meet here.

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,610
If

261
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,890
you hadn't come to help at our vineyard,

262
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,220
Siting wouldn't have found you
so quickly.

263
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,100
Yes.

264
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,980
It's quite a coincidence.

265
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,890
I was staying at a friend's place

266
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,770
in the county town back then.

267
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,490
I heard there was a mudslide
in your area

268
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,530
and they needed volunteers,

269
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,850
so I went over.

270
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,730
It was fate.

271
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,420
Have some tea.

272
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,420
Are you alright?

273
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,530
I'll have this.

274
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,380
Okay.

275
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,380
Alright.

276
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,220
The utensils...

277
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,340
The utensils are inside.

278
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:03,900
I'll get them.

279
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:04,980
Utensils.

280
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,100
Okay.

281
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,900
Anything else I can help with?

282
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,740
No, no.

283
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,500
Not needed.

284
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,380
Don't bother.

285
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,260
Today, Mr. Tan and his daughter
are reunited.

286
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,540
To welcome our guests from afar,

287
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,860
and to thank Mr. Tan for his help,

288
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,020
let's all have a toast.

289
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,860
Come on.

290
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,580
Thank you.

291
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,980
Tashi Delek.

292
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,820
Tashi Delek.

293
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:35,700
Beef intestines.

294
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,180
Thanks.

295
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,860
This is a local specialty.

296
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,420
Yes.

297
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,060
Sir, you have some too.

298
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,300
Beef intestines.

299
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,900
Thanks for the help
these past couple of days.

300
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,700
Not at all.

301
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,660
Sir.

302
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,180
Stop drinking.

303
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,620
Good work.

304
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:53,900
Thank you.

305
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,180
Just have a little.

306
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,420
Drinking liquor on the plateau...

307
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,180
Just a little, Dad.

308
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,340
Then you should drink less.

309
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,220
Easy on the drinks.

310
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,940
Okay.

311
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,220
Ting.

312
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,380
Dad.

313
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,620
Thank you.

314
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,660
Are you cold?

315
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,980
No, I'm not.

316
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,620
The air here is so fresh.

317
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,420
Yes.

318
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,460
The air is good.

319
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,660
Just a bit less oxygen.

320
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,620
Most newcomers aren't used to it.

321
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,140
Are you okay?

322
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,500
I'm fine for now.

323
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,140
You've changed a lot.

324
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,260
Have I?

325
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,660
You haven't changed.

326
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,500
I've gotten old.

327
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,540
I must have changed.

328
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,620
Ting.

329
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
You still haven't told me

330
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,980
how you've been

331
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,220
all these years.

332
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:08,780
Dad,

333
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
do you know

334
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,340
why I never asked you that question?

335
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,580
A person with no attachments,

336
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,900
alone in a strange city,

337
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,500
isolated

338
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,260
and helpless.

339
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,860
Aren't we

340
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,820
the same?

341
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,580
Ting,

342
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,140
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:38,900
Dad,

344
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,220
don't say that.

345
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,420
I understand.

346
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,940
You can't understand.

347
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,020
No one could understand
how I felt back then.

348
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,180
And no one could help me.

349
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,140
I was terrified.

350
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,700
But I never expected

351
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,540
Wei

352
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,180
would end up like that.

353
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,020
Dad.

354
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,860
I didn't expect him to die.

355
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,740
I didn't want him to die!

356
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,900
I just wanted him to...

357
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,100
I just wanted him
to face legal punishment.

358
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,020
I...

359
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,820
He fell by himself.

360
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,540
Dad, don't say that.

361
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,140
It had nothing to do with you.

362
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,540
Gao Haotian's death
was what he deserved.

363
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,860
Has Wei called back?

364
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,340
No.

365
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,980
Officer,

366
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,340
I didn't push him!

367
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,740
He fell by himself!

368
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:45,860
Alright, tell me

369
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,300
why you were at the scene that day.

370
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,340
My master

371
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,460
and I were working overtime.

372
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,260
Then Gao Haotian showed up.

373
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,820
He asked me
to deliver the documents to him.

374
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,020
So I went to find him.

375
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,620
Later, my master went too.

376
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,340
As soon as

377
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,180
I arrived at the parking lot,

378
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,780
I saw Gao Haotian...

379
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,420
Gao Haotian was chasing Tan Jun?

380
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,500
Why?

381
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,740
I don't know.

382
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,180
What were you doing

383
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,780
when Tan Jun came to find you?

384
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,700
I was delivering documents to him.

385
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,780

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,020
Ms. Gao.

577
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,140
Ms. Gao.

578
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,260
You want the meeting room...?

579
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,060
The board meeting at 2 PM.

580
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,020
You notified me.

581
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,460
Ms. Gao,

582
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,820
the board meeting was last Thursday.

583
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,140
You chaired it yourself.

584
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,860
Ms. Gao, you've been too busy lately.

585
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,420
Then bring me

586
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
last month's reports.

587
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,100
Yes, Ms. Gao.

588
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,140
I'll still

589
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,540
bring you the coffee then.

590
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,340
Over the summer,

591
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,260
Mr. Chen's violin class is pretty full.

592
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,060
So we're considering

593
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,820
opening one more class.

594
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,260
I think that's fine.

595
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,140
Mr. Chen, we appreciate your hard work.

596
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:22,900
It's what I should do.

597
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,500
Summer is the peak season.

598
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,620
We must not slack off.

599
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,860
Thank you all for your hard work.

600
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,940
Get back to work now.

601
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,340
Okay.

602
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,060
We'll leave you to it.

603
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,460
Madam.

604
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,140
Ms. Wen.

605
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,700
Are you feeling better?

606
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,540
Much better.

607
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,780
I heard you've been
working overtime a lot lately.

608
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,140
Working hard is good.

609
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,900
But you must take care of your health.

610
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,700
Thank you.

611
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,860
I came to ask

612
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,100
if we could

613
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,700
postpone

614
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,300
the concert.

615
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,060
But weren't you well prepared?

616
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,940
Maybe there's just been
too much going on lately.

617
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,020
I feel a bit run down.

618
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,980
Are you pregnant?

619
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,700
No.

620
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,180
Is it because of the wedding plans?

621
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,060
It's due to some personal reasons.

622
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,740
It's fine if you don't want to
talk about it.

623
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,020
I'll talk to them about it.

624
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,540
Alright?

625
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,780
Thank you.

626
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,540
I'm really sorry.

627
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,380
It's fine.

628
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,580
Don't worry about it.

629
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:29,980
Thank you.

630
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,460
Mr. Feng,

631
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,860
I should be the one thanking you.

632
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,460
You brought Ting all the way here,

633
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,380
so we could finally meet.

634
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,900
Just call me Rui.

635
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,500
Rui.

636
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,700
Actually, I saw you

637
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,620
at the vineyard before.

638
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,140
I just didn't say hello.

639
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,340
I understand.

640
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,500
That situation

641
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,700
must still be

642
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,980
a painful memory for you.

643
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,700
Thanks for your understanding.

644
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,220
Sir,

645
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,340
what are your plans now?

646
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,980
I think I'll stay here.

647
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,860
After all, I'm used to everything here

648
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,140
by now.

649
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,860
But Siting...

650
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,180
I feel she really wants you

651
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,380
to go back with her.

652
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:35,980
I know.

653
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
Ting

654
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,420
has her career.

655
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
She's busy.

656
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,260
I'm afraid I'll be a burden on her.

657
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,020
Now that she's come here

658
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,660
and seen that I'm doing fine,

659
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,180
she won't worry about me

660
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,820
like she used to.

661
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,500
Yes.

662
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,500
Ms. Gao...

663
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,300
How has your mom been lately?

664
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,020
She

665
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,500
is the same as always.

666
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,860
Does she know about Ting?

667
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,500
Ting

668
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,780
has been sensible since she was little.

669
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,140
I'd like her

670
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,500
to start a family soon.

671
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,660
I really hope there's someone

672
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,580
who'll love her unconditionally.

673
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,860
Ting

674
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,500
really deserves to be loved.

675
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:40,900
Peiyan,

676
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,300
are you very busy?

677
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,900
My schedule has been quite full lately.

678
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,780
Alright.

679
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,020
But no matter how full your schedule is,

680
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,060
you must eat on time.

681
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,300
Understood?

682
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,620
I know.

683
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,980
[Music Room]

684
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,580
Is Rui

685
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,340
very busy lately too?

686
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,140
Yes.

687
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,060
He

688
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,500
has been quite busy lately as well.

689
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,580
Being busy is good.

690
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,540
Peiyan,

691
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,140
I ran into an old colleague

692
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,900
from our school's academic office

693
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,260
while grocery shopping.

694
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,100
His daughter

695
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,620
is also getting married
in the second half of the year.

696
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Said it's really hard to book a hotel.

697
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,860
You and Rui

698
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,900
should hurry up and book one.

699
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,020
Let us know once you've booked it,

700
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,100
so we can make some preparations.

701
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:23,940
Dad.

702
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,300
We broke up.

703
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,540
I'm not getting married.

704
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:32,820
Okay.

705
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,380
I see.

706
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,500
Don't worry.

707
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,940
I'll handle it for you.

708
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,220
Come home this weekend.

709
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,940
I haven't cooked in a long time.

710
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,860
With your cooking skills?

711
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,220
You only know how to make noodles.

712
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,060
Let Mom do it.

713
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,340
My zhajiangmian

714
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
is pretty amazing, okay?

715
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,660
I'll add the crunchy nuts you love.

716
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,900
Remember?

717
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,340
When you were little,

718
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,700
if you didn't do well on a test

719
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,940
or didn't get first place
in a piano competition,

720
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,900
you'd come home

721
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,940
demanding

722
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,460
my noodles.

723
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,900
I'm not bragging.

724
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,780
With a bowl of my noodles,

725
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:17,940
you

726
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
could face anything with a smile.

727
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,420
And everything will be okay.

728
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,660
Okay. I got it.

729
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,620
I'm hanging up.

730
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,140
Actually, there's one thing

731
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,100
I'm concerned about.

732
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,100
Well,

733
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,580
you can't keep living alone.

734
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,060
It's so lonely.

735
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,540
Wouldn't it be nice

736
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,540
to start a happy, warm family soon?

737
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,140
I think Feng Rui is great.

738
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,140
Dad,

739
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,180
it's not like that
between Feng Rui and me.

740
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:19,700
But

741
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:20,700
he

742
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,700
came all this way with you...

743
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,100
Maybe he just feels guilty

744
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,820
and wants to help me.

745
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,860
A lot has happened over the years.

746
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,580
Let's not talk about it.
It's all in the past.

747
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,140
Everything is fine now.

748
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,020
You can't force feelings,

749
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,780
but

750
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,940
I'd advise you

751
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,740
not to be

752
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,340
too willful sometimes.

753
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,500
Dad.

754
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,260
I'm fine.

755
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,500
It's okay.

756
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,180
Dad,

757
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,020
let me take you to see a doctor.

758
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,940
It's fine. Look,

759
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,580
beyond those mountains,

760
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,180
that

761
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,460
whole area

762
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,460
is uninhabited.

763
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,340
That's where
the Tibetan antelopes often roam.

764
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,180
I just thought,

765
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,780
if my daughter knew I was here

766
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,060
doing meaningful work like this,

767
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,340
maybe

768
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,660
she could forgive me
for leaving without a word.

769
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,060
When you suddenly left,

770
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,700
I was completely lost.

771
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,700
I looked for you everywhere
but couldn't find you.

772
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,980
I was so scared,

773
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,900
and even a little resentful.

774
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,020
But later, I realized

775
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,700
that whenever I missed you,

776
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,700
the memories that came to mind

777
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,340
were all happy

778
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,300
and beautiful ones.

779
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,580
You celebrating my birthday every year.

780
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,780
You cooking my favorite meals every day,

781
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,740
waiting for me to come home from school.

782
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
You riding your bike

783
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,020
to take me to Ms. Zhuang's
for dance lessons.

784
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,460
So

785
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,500
I feel

786
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,420
I've already received so much.

787
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,140
Gradually, I figured it out.

788
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,060
If you can find a place

789
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,740
where you can live comfortably...

790
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,380
As long as you're happy,

791
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,780
I'm at peace.

792
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,060
My only wish is for you

793
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,620
to be happy.

794
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,620
Forever happy.

795
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,660
Dad,

796
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,340
I only have one wish now.

797
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,900
Can you promise me?

798
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,060
Yes.

799
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,260
Tell me.

800
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,460
Don't move away again.

801
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,980
That way,

802
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,940
I can come visit you every year.

803
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,220
Take good care of your health.

804
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,020
Don't worry.

805
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,340
Don't worry.

806
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,380
I have to go.

807
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:47,780
I'm leaving.

808
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,020
Go on.

809
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,740
Sir.

810
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,780
Thank you,

811
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,540
Rui.

812
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:53,940
Take care.

813
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:55,700
We're leaving.

814
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,660
Alright.

815
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,140
Come in.

816
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,820
You haven't left yet, Hui.

817
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,300
What is it?

818
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,500
Hui,

819
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,860
let me tell you,

820
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,780
only you can carry off this outfit
with such class.

821
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,260
Who would believe you're fifty

822
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,540
if you told them?

823
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,900
Alright,

824
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,740
what trouble have you gotten into now?

825
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,900
What trouble could I possibly be in?

826
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,620
Can't I just come see you?

827
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,380
There aren't many things
that get you up this early.

828
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,180
Short on money?

829
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,900
Nothing escapes your sharp eyes.

830
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,460
I went to Macao, China,
a couple of days ago.

831
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,300
The Finance Department
hasn't approved the travel expenses yet.

832
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,860
If this keeps up,

833
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,660
I'll be broke.

834
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,060
Can you bear to see that?

835
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:24,780
Haotian,

836
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,980
you promised me

837
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,740
you'd stop gambling.

838
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,100
If you do it again,
even I won't be able to

839
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,380
cover for you in front of Dad.

840
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,380
I promise

841
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,140
I won't gamble anymore.

842
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,380
What am I going to do with you?

843
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,420
So about the money...?

844
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
Fine.

845
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,540
I'll go hurry them up right now.

846
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,780
Dad's birthday is in a few days.

847
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,940
Did you get a gift?

848
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,660
I'm not going.

849
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,500
It won't matter if my gift is missing.

850
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,340
Stop the nonsense.

851
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,700
Be there on time.

852
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,740
Yes, ma'am.

853
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:58,820
Get out.

854
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,540
Hui,

855
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,780
you've been licking your lips a lot.

856
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,060
The weather's dry.
Take care of yourself.

857
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,860
Here's your favorite mint flavor.

858
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,580
