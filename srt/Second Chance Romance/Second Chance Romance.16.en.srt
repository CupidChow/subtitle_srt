The sports land use permit
for that plot,

190
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,420
which we secured last time,
has been approved.

191
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,180
No wonder you've been

192
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,060
so busy lately.

193
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,300
Turns out you were working on this.

194

We will collaborate

195
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,060
on the development together.

The commercial development
in the East District

197
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,180
has always been a major issue.

198
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,660

and concerts.

203
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,420
It could enhance the city's profile.

204
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,700
This would boost local tax revenue

205
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,140

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,780

212

Also, I grew up there.

213
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,620

I wouldn't say suggestions.

218
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,820
I did understand the content

Ms. Tan,

239
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,420
do you feel like

240
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,180
things have changed a lot here
since your last visit?

241
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,140
Yes.

242
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,140
The changes are really significant.

243
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,260
The road conditions
are much better than before.

244
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,980
And the streets

245
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,020
are livelier than they used to be.

246
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,020
We get more and more tourists now.

247
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,140
I feel like there are more tourists here

248
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,700
than locals nowadays.

249
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,020
Duoji,

250
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,300
your Mandarin has improved.

251
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,780
I remember when I came
thirteen years ago,

252
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,620
your Mandarin wasn't as good
as it is now.

253
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,620
I've been working and learning
with Mr. Feng

254
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,420
all these years,

255
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,780
and I've been interacting
with the Han people a lot.

256
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,780
So I've probably improved a bit.

257
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,780
Forgot to tell you.

258
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,180
Duoji has been handling
external relations

259
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,020
for our vineyard for the past few years.

260
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,500
Right.

261
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,540
Ms. Tan,

262
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,380
it's been over ten years.
You've really changed so much.

263
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,300
I just saw

264
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,780
our photo

265
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,820
from thirteen years ago.

267
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,420

268
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,820
so much.

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,020
Mr. Feng,

270
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,540
that's the photo you dug out

271
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,380
from under the mudslide debris.

272
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,140
Remember?

273
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,500
Duoji,

274
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,180
how is the search for that man going?

275
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,540
After we hung up,

276
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,540
I started contacting all my friends.

277
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
I've asked around.

278
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,300
But only people at the contact station
have seen him so far.

279
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,780
Because he handles our deliveries

280
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,900
through the contact station.

281
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,500
I've already contacted the people there.

282
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,300
So are we going
to the contact station now?

283
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,020
Probably not today.

284
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,260
It takes at least five or six hours

285
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,180
to get there from here.

286
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,540
So we'll go to the hotel first.

287
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,020
Then we'll head over tomorrow morning.

288
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,300
It's fine.

289
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
They work there every day,
so they probably won't be gone.

290
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,020
Right.

291
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,140
Besides, Ms. Tan,

292
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,660
you must rest well on the first day.

293
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,540
Or altitude sickness can be serious.

294
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,420
I brought some medicine,

295
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,060
but I hope we won't need it.

296
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,540
Thank you, Duoji.

297
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,260

on a rainless day,

301
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,140
it's a very good sign.

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,420
No problem.

377
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:27,660
Bye.

378
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,420
My room's there.

379
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,220
Okay.

380
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,220
Feng Rui.

381
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,660
Thank you.

382
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,500
What's up with Yuan?

383
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,700
Beats me.

384
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,540
No idea.

385
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,300
Don't set him off today,

386
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,940
or he'll explode.

387
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,460
Let's all be careful.

388
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,580
I don't know.

389
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,260
What's going on?

390
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,100
Everyone looks so listless.

391
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,620
Bao,

392
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,860
Mr. Wang just chewed us out.

393
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,100
Said we let some basic bugs

394
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,860
slip through again.

395
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,780
What bugs?

396
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,580
The ones the Ghost Pupil users reported.

397
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,860
Isn't that normal?

398
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,020
Exactly.

399
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,060
Seems Mr. Wang is in a really bad mood.

400
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,580
Probably not because of the game bugs.

401
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,660
Okay. I got it.

402
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,060
You all get back to work.

403
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,020
What's going on, Mr. Wang?

404
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,780
The Tech Department
is working overtime today.

405
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,660
What are you doing here?

406
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,740
They're working overtime.

407
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,260
Is there a problem

408
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,100
with me being here?

409
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,540
What's wrong?

410
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,540
Are you in a bad mood?

411
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,860
I'm in a great mood.

412
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:22,860
By the way,

413
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,660
did we fix the lag issue

414
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,340
when the main character picks up coins
in Ghost Pupil that the client

415
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,340
reported yesterday?

416
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,060
Had Rookie fix it right away.

417
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,340
Don't make these basic mistakes again.

418
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,060
Ghost Pupil is one
of our most polished products.

419
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,060
Come on,

420
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,200
we just had the first major update

421
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,500
for the new season
the day before yesterday.

422
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,580
Every major update

423
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,380
has a few minor bugs.

424
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,660
And it was just a few code issues.

425
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,620
Easily fixed.

426
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,020
Minor issues, minor issues.

427
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,860
They're always "minor issues"!

428
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,300
If they really are,

429
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,860
then please

430
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,340
tell Rookie and the others
to be more careful.

431
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,420
One mistake,

432
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,340
and all our previous hard work
could be wasted.

433
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,060
Alright.

434
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,780
I get it.

435
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,380
We won't make
that kind of mistake again.

436
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,500
Get back to work.

437
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,860
Hello?

438
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,660
Dad.

439
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,940
Where are you?

440
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm on a business trip.

441
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,020
Something urgent came up.

442
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,100
The signal here is spotty.

443
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,980
Just leave me a message.

444
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,780
I just called Ms. Wen.

445
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,940
She's sick.

446
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,260
She sounded really weak.

447
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,260
Then

448
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,540
make sure she rests properly.

449
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,180
Can you be more considerate?

450
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,740
Show some concern for her.

451
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,100
Focus on your homework.

452
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:47,940
You're so clueless.

453
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,060
Here.

454
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,700
What did your dad say?

455
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,500
He said he's on a business trip.

456
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:11,740
Dad!

457
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,140
Who is it?

458
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:12,700
Who is it?

459
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:13,860
Sorry.

460
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,620
I mistook you for someone else.

461
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,380
It's fine.

462
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,180
Sorry.

463
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,940
Look at me.

464
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,820
Keep breathing.

465
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:16,780
Keep breathing.

466
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,660
Take it slow.

467
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,780
Inhale.

468
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:22,980
Inhale.

469
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,820
Slower.

470
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,260
It's okay now.

471
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,100
It's alright.

472
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,700
Thanks.

473
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,580
Thank you.

474
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,100
Why did you come out too?

475
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,500
This isn't your first time here.

476
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,980
Why haven't you learned?

477
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,500
I

478
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,340
thought

479
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,020
I saw my dad, so...

480
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,500
I'm fine now.

481
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
Why did you come out too?

482
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,500
Couldn't sleep.

483
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,580
You're about to get married.

484
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,820
You shouldn't be running around
like this.

485
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,780
It's been canceled.

486
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,700
What?

487
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,100
I didn't want to lie to her,

488
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,340
or to myself.

489
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,180
Don't worry.

490
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
It's not because of you.

491
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,780
Thanks.

492
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
Sorry about today.

493
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,340
I shouldn't have taken it out
on you guys.

494
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,500
It's fine.

495
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,020
It was Rookie's fault.

496
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
He wasn't careful with his work.

497
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,740
Bugs are normal.

498
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,780
It's not something Rookie and the others

499
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,540
can fully control.

500
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,180
Just tell me,

501
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,180
did things go south with Ms. Tan?

502
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,940
Don't play dumb with me.

503
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,100
Others might not know you,

504
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,260
but I know you too well.

505
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,340
There's no way she could ever like me.

506
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,260
Because she

507
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,020
already has someone else in her heart.

508
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,460
It's okay.

509
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,100
You'll meet someone better.

510
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,020
Look at me.

511
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,180
I dated over a dozen girls

512
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,540
before I met my wife.

513
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
You need to distract yourself.

514
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,500
Then I'll focus all my attention

515
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,180
on you guys.

516
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,100
Fine. Then you can
boss me around every day.

517
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,260
You can even yell at me.

518
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,100
This drink isn't strong enough.

519
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,020
I'll go get a different bottle.

520
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,060
Here's your ticket.

521
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,340
One ticket to Hongyuan

522
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,980
for 1 PM.

523
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,500
Please hurry.

524
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,500
Okay.

525
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,020
Here you go.

526
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,740
Thanks.

527
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,020
After we hung up,

528
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,740
I asked a few of my friends.

529
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,860
But no one has gotten back to me yet.

530
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,420
The place we're going to

531
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,980
is a bit remote.

532
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,260
I don't want to give up any chance.

533
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,460
Okay.

534
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:43,900
Thank you.

535
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:44,780
No problem.

536
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,980
Keep looking.

537
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,540
Right.

538
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,460
This is the place.

539
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,580
Haji.

540
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,780
Hello.

541
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,340
Long time no see.

542
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,020
Yes. It's been ages.

543
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,740
This is my good friend, Haji.

544
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,860
He knows this area very well.

545
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,340
And he knows a lot of people.

546
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,940
He just isn't very good at Mandarin.

547
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,220
Hello.

548
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,780
Right here.

549
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,460
He forgot.

550
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,580
That, right here.

551
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,100
I remember.

552
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,940
A week ago,

553
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,020
he came to my place.

554
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,260
We herded sheep,

555
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
ate,

556
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
and lived together.

557
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,540
After moving some goods,
he went somewhere else.

558
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,500
He said it was Mr. Tan.

559
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,740
He stayed here for about a week.

560
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,540
He ate,

561
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,500
herded with them.

562
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,020
Lived just like us Tibetans.

563
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,980
He also did some driving

564
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,340
and transport work.

565
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,500
But

566
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,220
he left here a week ago.

567
