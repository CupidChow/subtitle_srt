[Episode 2]

19
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,620
Siting,

20
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,060
your second audition is tomorrow.

21
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,220
I hope I make it through.

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,780
If you get in,

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,100
will you go abroad for further training?

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,900
Who knows if I'll even pass?

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,980
You'll definitely get in.

26
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
You always know what to say.

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,860
Here.

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,260
Did I tell you?

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,220
Zeyuan earned money
by writing code for someone.

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,580
He said once he gets paid,

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,700
he's treating us to a big meal.

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
That's amazing.

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
Then I'd better start thinking

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,740
about how to make that meal count.

35
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,420
Totally okay.

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,540
I don't know

37
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,780
what my mom ate
when she was pregnant with him.

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,460
How come he's so much smarter than me?

39
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,260
So hardworking and driven.

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,940
Top of everything you do, right?

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,540
Wang Shuhan, that's enough.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,420
Did you forget why we're here today?

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,380
Alright, I'll stop.

44
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,500
Siting, we came specifically

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,940
to cheer you on today.

46
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,340

I don't know what's going on.

54
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,140
Something's wrong with the shoes.

55
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,420
What do you think?

56
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,300
Hello, do you have a reservation?

57
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,940
Table one.

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,620
Right this way, please.

I've missed you so much.

63
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,140
After all these years,
you're finally back.

64
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,180
Why didn't you call me
the second you landed?

65
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,940
If I'd called you
the moment I got off the plane,

66
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,780
would you have even answered?

67
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,740
Fine. Let me get a good look at you.

68
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,220
Let me see you.

69
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,500
What are you doing?

70
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,740
Oh my god.

71
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,340
Life is so unfair.

72
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,420
How is it unfair?

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,100
Of course it is.

74
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,420
Look at you,
still so beautiful and thin.

75
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:40,940
Look at me.

76
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:41,940
I've gotten so fat that...

77
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,620
Look.

78
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,980
What's wrong? You look gorgeous now.

79
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,260
Let's not talk standing up. Sit down.

80
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,820
Come on.

81
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,500
Okay.

82
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,900
I brought wine.

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,540
Come on.

84
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:48,980
Okay.

85
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,900
Come here.

86
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,220
Have a seat.

87
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,500
Isn't this the seat for paying the bill?

88
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,460
You won't be paying.

89
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,980
Today, everything's on Wang Zeyuan.

90
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,100
Listen, Tan Siting,

91
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,580
I flew in on a full-price

92
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,820
business class ticket
just to see you the moment

93
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,300
you got back.

94
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:03,780
Reimburse me.

95
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,820
Fine, I will.

96
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,260
I just got back

97
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,940
and Wang Shuhan already
scammed a fortune out of me.

98
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,420
I'll cover it.

99
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Look at you, pathetic.

100
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,980
Come on, to celebrate Siting's return,

101
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,100
let's have a toast.

102
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,860
Cheers!

103
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,540
You finished it all?

104
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,020
I'm really, really happy Siting is back.

105
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,780
Another round?

106
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,140
Easy does it.

107
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,900
If you drink too much,

108
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,140
you're gonna make a scene, right?

109
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,020
Let me tell you, my alcohol tolerance
has improved over the years.

110
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,500
It's not just your tolerance
that's grown.

111
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,540
Your weight has too.

112
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,260
Do I need you to tell me that?

113
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,940
It's obvious to everyone.

114
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,500
If you tell anyone my weight

115
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,700
after leaving this room,

116
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,540
I'll kill you.

117
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,900
Let's drop this.
It's killing my appetite.

118
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,740
Siting,

119
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,380
how was life over there for you?

120
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,420
Pretty simple.

121
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,660
A daily routine

122
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,660
between the theater and home.

123
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,140
Got to travel around sometimes
during tours.

124
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,940
Zeyuan said

125
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,980
there's still no news
about your dad, right?

126
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,300
Right.

127
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,420
My dad doesn't have many relatives.

128
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,540
Just a distant cousin.

129
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,740
I contacted her.

130
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,140
She said my dad hasn't reached out
to her all these years.

131
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,460
I posted a missing person notice
for you online.

132
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,580
If your dad
or anyone who knows him sees it,

133
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,700
they'll contact us.

134
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:23,900
Thank you.

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,700
Right.

136
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,300
Zeyuan is an expert
in that whole internet field.

137
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,660
He posted that notice.

138
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,820
It's bound to help.

139
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,940
Big changes, huh?

140
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,100
Quite big.

141
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,700
Have I changed much?

142
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,540
Haven't I?

143
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
You've gotten more beautiful.

144
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,500
Let me tell you,

145
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,380
I never thought
I'd turn out like this either.

146
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,740
And I never imagined

147
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
I'd be living the life I have now.

148
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,380
Shuhan, you know what?

149
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,620
I've always envied you.

150
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,500
Look,

151
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,300
you have

152
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,340
both your parents by your side.

153
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,940
And

154
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,060
you have such a thoughtful
and caring brother.

155
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,220
Do you know

156
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,540
how many years it's been

157
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,260
since I last saw

158
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,860
my dad?

159
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,460
So,

160
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,100
you should be content.

161
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
That's how you live happily.

162
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,420
I am content.

163
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,340
You envy me?

164
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,980
I'm the one who envies you.

165
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,780
Since you came back,

166
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,700
have you seen that guy?

167
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,580
Who?

168
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,420
Don't play dumb.

169
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,340
Feng Rui?

170
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,780
Yes, I have.

171
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,260
This afternoon.

172
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,740
So what's the deal with you two?

173
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,540
Tell me.

174
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,180
And

175
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,900
I heard he's not

176
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,660
at his grandfather's company anymore.

177
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,980
Seems he started
his own winery or something.

178
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,980
The wine
you were downing earlier was his.

179
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,860
I thought you brought it back

180
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,140
from France for me.

181
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,940
With all that luggage,
you think I could carry wine?

182
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,500
So who reached out to whom?

183
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,380
No one reached out.

184
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,620
I was just walking around this afternoon

185
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,180
and happened to

186
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,780
stumble into his winery.

187
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,940
So we chatted for a bit.

188
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,020
That's it?

189
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,020
What else?

190
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,340
You're not
rekindling old flames, are you?

191
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,100
Enough.

192
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,180
What are you talking about?

193
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,740
When I was about to leave,

194
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,460
his wife and kid showed up.

195
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,140
His kid is already this tall.

196
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,300
Well, forget him then.

197
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,180
You don't need him.

198
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,500
I'll set you up.

199
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,620
I know tons of cute guys.

200
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,620
All top-tier.

201
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,460
You keep your top-tier guys.

202
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,780
Gosh, you're incredibly confident.

203
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,740
Top-tier?

204
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,020
I'll introduce you to someone.

205
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,980
Otherwise, you'll be
all lonely back here.

206
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,260
I'm not lonely.

207
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,180
For real.

208
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,940
Alright.

209
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,620
Grandma.

210
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,260
Madam, you're here.

211
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:05,900
Mom.

212
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,900
Madam.

213
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
Peiyan, you're here.

214
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,220
You brought so many things.

215
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,740
Let me.

216
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,340
No, it's fine.

217
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,020
Alright.

218
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,300
What brings you here?

219
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,020
Come on.

220
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,780
Sit down.

221
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,700
Have you eaten?

222
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,820
Would you like to join us?

223
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,460
Don't bother.

224
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,260
I've already eaten.

225
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,820
Come here.

226
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,740
Come on.

227
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,060
This must be Peiyan's cooking?

228
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,380
I just whipped up something simple
with what was in the fridge.

229
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,420
It looks delicious.

230
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:24,980
Have some, Mom.

231
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,460
Sit down.

232
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,300
I've eaten. Sit down.

233
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:27,860
Peiyan,

234
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,660
have a seat.

235
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,900
Thank you.

236
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,980
No problem.

237
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,700
Next time,

238
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,820
I'll get proper ingredients

239
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,500
and make you
some of my specialty dishes.

240
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,340
Okay.

241
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,740
Grandma, what are you doing here?

242
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,340
I...

243
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,860
Tomorrow's the weekend.

244
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,900
Do you want to go to my place?

245
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,980
No.

246
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,900
I haven't finished eating.

247
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,620
And I still have homework.

248
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,060
I brought a game console.

249
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm full now.

250
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,140
Let's go. Game console.

251
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,100
Grab your homework.

252
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,780
You didn't finish.

253
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,620
Let's go.

254
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,060
Alright, we'll head out.

255
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,180
I'm pretty much done, too.

256
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,900
Don't bother.

257
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,380
You two keep eating.

258
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,380
Be careful.

259
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,660
Got everything?

260
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,140
Got it.

261
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,500
I got everything.

262
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,900
Don't just play games.

263
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,100
You have piano lessons tomorrow.

264
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,460
Okay.

265
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,740
Don't worry. I'll do my homework
before playing games.

266
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,660
Madam, let me see you out.

267
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,060
It's fine.

268
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,660
Don't bother.

269
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,140
We'll walk you...

270
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,180
By the way,

271
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,940
I'll bring him back tomorrow.

272
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,060
Ma'am, bye...

273
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,860
It's been a while
since you last visited me.

274
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,020
Yeah.

275
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:39,780
Lu.

276
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,540
Put it here.

277
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,260
Okay.

278
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,180
Head back and get some rest.

279
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,220
Alright, Ms. Gao.

280
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,980
I'll get going then.

281
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,300
Okay.

282
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,740
Grandma.

283
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,180
Bye, Ms. Gao.

284
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,100
Close the door.

285
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,660
Grandma?

286
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,020
You haven't thrown away

287
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,020
these old toys of mine?

288
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,380
Of course not.

289
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,100
Every toy holds a story of yours.

290
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,940
Seeing them

291
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,180
reminds me
of how mischievous you were as a child.

292
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,980
Grandma,

293
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,940
what was my mom like?

294
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,340
Why bring her up?

295
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,220
Nothing.

296
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
It's just that

297
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,540
sometimes I feel Dad is too quiet.

298
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,740
He's such a straightforward guy.
He knows nothing.

299
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,740
I take after my mom.

300
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,020
I'm a vibrant, dream-chasing young man!

301
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,300
Right, Grandma?

302
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,460
Let me ask you,

303
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
how would you feel

304
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,940
if your dad ended up

305
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,460
with Ms. Wen?

306
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,900
Would you be happy?

307
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,660
I'd be super happy!

308
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,780
No more takeout for me then.

309
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,580
Exactly.

310
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,900
Look at Ms. Wen.

311
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,140
She's graceful and dignified.

312
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,020
Right.

313
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,620
She's pretty.

314
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,300
And she can cook, right?

315
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,860
Some birth mothers

316
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,460
aren't even like that.

317
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,220
Yeah.

318
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,020
So we have to team up

319
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,100
and get your dad...

320
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:00,980
A girlfriend!

321
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,460
Right.

322
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,460
My mom really spoils Lexuan.

323
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,780
Grandparents just

324
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,980
dote on their grandchildren.

325
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,100
It's understandable.

326
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,980
But Lexuan has really grown up.

327
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,580
He even teases us now.

328
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,100
Kids these days understand everything.

329
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,500
How mature
do you think Lexuan is for his age?

330
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,460
Probably more mature

331
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,860
than other kids his age.

332
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,740
Sometimes when I talk to him,

333
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,300
it almost

334
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,340
feels like

335
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,620
I'm talking to an adult.

336
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,020
He's so sensible.

337
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,780
That's why we communicate so well.

338
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,140
But it's almost heartbreaking
how sensible he is.

339
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,500
Don't you think?

340
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,940
He's a boy.

341
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,980
It's fine if he matures a bit early.

342
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,300
In fact, it might be good for him.

343
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,500
But kids should act like kids.

344
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,260
If Lexuan were my child,

345
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,020
I wouldn't want him to be this sensible.

346
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,900
I'd want him to make mistakes,

347
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,980
be willful,

348
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,100
and act coquettishly.

349
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,940
Everyone

350
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,660
grows up eventually.

351
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,540
But once childhood is gone,

352
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,380
it will never come back.

353
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,620
You're right.

354
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,780
And you're a good student.

355
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,700
Quick to absorb the right ideas
from your teacher.

356
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,140
I should let him keep
his childlike innocence.

357
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
He doesn't need to be so strong.

358
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
You're the same.

359
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,780
You don't always have to

360
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,380
act so strong, either.

361
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,620
It's okay to let your guard down

362
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,540
around people you trust, right?

363
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,620
Alright, everyone.

364
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,260
This is our new guest teacher,

365
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,020
Tan Siting.

366
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,260
I'm sure

367
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,820
you all recognize her.

368
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,860
Ms. Tan was the prima ballerina
at France's Amour Ballet.

369
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,540
She came to us right after retiring.

370
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,900
We're truly honored.

371
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,220
And I'm honored to work with all of you.

372
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,300
Ms. Tan

373
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,100
turned down

374
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,860
an invitation
from France's Royal Ballet School

375
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,180
to teach here.

376
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,540
I hope you'll all work together

377
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,020
and focus on nurturing the children.

378
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Let's skip the formalities.

379
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,500
The immediate priority

380
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,140
is that Zheng Yufan

381
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,940
has less than two months left

382
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,820
before the YGP

383
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,460
Japan regional competition.

384
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,820
I've been training Yufan

385
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,180
for over a year.

386
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,380
She's very talented.

387
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,060
For the YGP this time,

388
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,420
we submitted her video
to the judging panel

389
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,900
on a trial basis.

390
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,500
Unexpectedly,
she passed the preliminary selection.

391
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,740
She'll be going to Japan
to compete soon.

392
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,260
But

393
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,780
lately,

394
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,020
I feel her progress has stalled.

395
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,940
Maybe it's time

396
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,900
for a change.

397
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,700
Ms. Guan,

398
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,060
you've trained Zheng Yufan
for a long time

399
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,060
and worked very hard.

400
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,380
I think

401
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,140
maybe you should let her

402
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,980
train under Ms. Tan for a while.

403
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,300
See if that brings any change.

404
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,340
What do you think?

405
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,900
Sure.

406
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,420
Extend.

407
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,140
Draw in your waist.

408
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,660
What about the chest and waist?

409
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,620
Knees straight.

410
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,180
Everyone, knees straight.

411
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,980
Yes. Shoulders down.

412
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,540
Keep them down.

413
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:39,820
Come on.

414
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,020

565
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,260
I feel like he's softened up a bit

566
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,300

567
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,980

as formal as he used to be.

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,220
You're back.

571
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,700
You're all here.

572
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,260
Dad,

573
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,100
you're back.

574
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,300
Look.

575
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,180
Lemon fish.

576
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,420
Ms. Wen's specialty.

577
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,020
You're in for a treat today.

578
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,580
I really didn't expect this.

579
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,140
Peiyan is so capable.

580
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,740
Look, she can cook so many dishes.

581
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,900
Madam, I've always said I wanted to
cook a proper meal for you.

582
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,380
Finally got the chance today.

583
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,540
Just hope it suits your taste.

584
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,860
It does!

585
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,420
This chicken soup is really good.

586
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,900
Let's skip this part.

587
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,700
Skip it.

588
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,220
Okay.

589
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,980
This soup is delicious too.

590
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,380
Let me try.

591
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,980
By the way, Lexuan,

592
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,180
Ms. Yan said the piece
for your Children's Day performance

593
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,980
is quite challenging.

594
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,260
You'll need to
put in more effort lately.

595
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:32,900
I know.

596
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,220
After this meal, I'm going
into serious practice mode.

597
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,500
Should we ask Ms. Wen to tutor you?

598
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,180
No problem.

599
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,660
Lexuan and I work well together.

600
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,580
It'll be fine, right?

601
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,620
Absolutely.

602
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,420
Oh, Rui,

603
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,740
guess who I ran into at school today?

604
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,380
Who?

605
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,980
That friend of yours

606
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,540
we met at the winery,

607
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,220
Tan Siting.

608
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,140
What a coincidence.

609
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,340
She's now

610
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,740
actually a ballet teacher

611
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,820
at our training center.

612
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,620
We're colleagues.

613
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,300
Yes.

614
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,460
She did mention

615
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,380
she was coming back
to teach after retiring.

616
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,020
This soup is really good.

617
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,580
Could you get me...?

618
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,660
Let me get you.

619
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:20,900
Okay.

620
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,060
Thanks, Mom.

621
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,660
Let me get you some of that.

622
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,460
Try it.

623
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:26,740
Okay.

624
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,340
You met her?

625
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,220
Who?

626
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,540
Tan Siting.

627
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,940
Yes... I have seen her.

628
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Why didn't you tell me?

629
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,540
Do I have to report everything to you?

630
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,900
What did you talk about?

631
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,380
Just ordinary greetings and small talk.

632
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,580
No further contact?

633
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,980
We just met once.

634
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,580
Didn't exchange any contact information.

635
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,820
It's strange.

636
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,100
Of all places,

637
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,900
she runs into you in this city.

638
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,220
Of all places,

639
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,380
she stumbles into your winery.

640
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,380
And now

641
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,820
she happens to be colleagues
with Peiyan.

642
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,220
Don't you find that odd?

643
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,060
What she does

644
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
has nothing to do with me.

645
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,020
Rui,

646
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,260
don't forget.

647
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,380
Back then, for the sake of her career,

648
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,060
she didn't care about anything else.

649
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,220
She left a letter and ran off to France.

650
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,540
Lexuan

651
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,860
was only this small back then.

652
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,220
I worked myself to the bone.

653
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,100
I ignored the company

654
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,580
just to help you raise the child.

655
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,100
We finally got our lives back on track.

656
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,020
And now she suddenly reappears.

657
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,020
What does she want?

658
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,900
Does she want to ruin our lives again?

659
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,340
Mom,

660
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,940
it's impossible

661
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,020
between her and me now.

662
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,980
She's met Lexuan.

663
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,020
But she

664
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,980
showed no reaction to him.

665
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,580
I've completely given up on her.

666
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,140
She can no longer affect our family,

667
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,700
and she certainly can't affect me.

668
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,380
I'm relieved

669
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,780
to hear you say that.

670
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,060
I just wanted to remind you.

671
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,260
Also,

672
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,860
Peiyan

673
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,220
is so good to you and Lexuan.

674
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,940
We

675
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,060
shouldn't fail her.

676
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,460
You should head back.

677
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,860
Head position.

678
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,340
Hands.

679
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,300
Watch your toes.

680
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,540
Good.

681
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,020
Move together.

682
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,140
Very good.

683
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,100
You did a great job
with the pirouette today.

684
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,100
But still,

685
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,060
pay attention to the emotion.

686
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,580
You must feel the emotion
before you start dancing.

687
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,260
Okay.

688
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,180
Alright. You can go now.

689
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:15,900
Practice well.

690
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,860
Thank you, ma'am.

691
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,820
Okay. Bye.

692
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,500
Ms. Tan!

693
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,660
Someone's at the door asking for you.

694
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,180
You were doing just fine in Paris.

695
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,820
Why come back all of a sudden?

696
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,860
I came back because I wanted to.

697
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,220
Do I need to

698
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,100
check with you first?

699
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,620
What

700
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,060
are you planning to do here?

701
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,940
What are you trying to say?

702
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
I said

703
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,700
all I needed to say twelve years ago.

704
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
But

705
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,860
I'm not sure you understood me clearly.

706
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,740
You made yourself perfectly clear.

707
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,100
No need to waste your breath.

708
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,660
If there's nothing else,

709
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,140
I have another class to teach.

710
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,100
I'm leaving.

711
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,180
Wait.

712
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,140
You've seen it yourself.

713
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,740
Rui

714
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,020
has found his partner.

715
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,700
They're very happy together.

716
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,700
Before I came,

717
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,820
I asked for his opinion.

718
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,140
He said

719
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,740
he never wants to see you again.

720
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,660
What's past

721
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,700
is past.

722
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,900
So

723
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,900
I hope you'll stop bothering him.

724
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,220
Is this just you being presumptuous?

725
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,780
I have no interest in anyone or anything

726
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,020
related to your family.

727
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,940
I just happened to

728
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,260
bump into your daughter-in-law
at the training center.

729
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,740
And I won't be going there.

730
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,260
Good.

731
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,420
I hope you'll keep your word.

732
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,220
If it's about money,

733
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,620
you don't need to go to such lengths.

734
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,700
You could have

735
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,620
come to me.

736
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,980
You really haven't changed.

737
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,580
After all these years,
you're still the same.

738
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,580
Thinking that money
can solve everything.

739
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,260
Thanks.

740
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,020
But I don't need your money.

741
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,820
There's

742
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,700
500,000 in here.

743
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,340
I want you

744
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,700
to leave Rui.

745
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,060
Gao Hui,

746
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,140
you must've been waiting
a long time for this.

747
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,860
You deliberately sent Feng Rui away,

748
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,460
made sure I had the baby,

749
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,780
and then kept us from seeing each other.

750
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,900
The more you think that,

751
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,860
the more I have to tell Feng Rui
what happened!

752
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,940
I will wait for him to come back!

753
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,580
I'll tell him myself

754
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,860
that we lost our baby.

755
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,860
I want him to see

756
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,260
what his wonderful mother

757
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,780
has done.

758
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,020
You can tell him,

759
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,380
but

760
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,580
have you considered

761
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,300
that my brother Haotian and your father

762
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
will always be a barrier between us?

763
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,420
Even if

764
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,700
you stay together

765
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,820
for a year,

766
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,660
two years, or even three,

767
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,220
one day,

768
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,140
one of their names will come up.

769
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,780
And when it does,

770
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,700
you'll argue,

771
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,340
fight,

772
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,380
and even hurt each other,

773
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,420
until all the love and respect

774
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,860
are gone.

775
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,540
Is that what you want?

776
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,100
Do you really want to end up

777
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,620
tearing each other apart,

778
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,820
never speaking again?

779
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,660
It'd be better

780
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,660
for both of you

781
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,260
to focus on your careers now.

782
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,740
I think that's the best choice.

783
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,820
Maybe

784
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,660
we should just be together.

785
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,060
Why bring this up all of a sudden?

786
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,940
I just feel like

787
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,340
we're already like a family now.

788
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,620
I pick up Lexuan from school,

789
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,940
teach him piano,

790
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,300
cook for both of you, and...

791
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,340
Okay.

792
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,380
What did you say?

793
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,660
I said

794
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,380
okay.

795
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,940
Are you serious?

796
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,260
Of course.

797
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,660
Aren't you serious?

798
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,700
Of... Of course I am.

799
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,380
Then it's settled?

800
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,180
Okay.

801
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,260
Settled.

802
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,180
Well,

803
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,420
