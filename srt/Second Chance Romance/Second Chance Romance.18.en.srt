So that's what happened back then.

161
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,740
You should have told me.

162

In the end,

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,420
what's the point of telling you?

168
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,340
It wouldn't change a thing.

169
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,100
Only added more trouble for you.

170
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,340
So, I decided to let time

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,900
I read all sorts of things.

379
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,460
These books were posted from France.

380
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,300
What are you looking at?

381
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,940
Do you remember when you moved in,

382
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,660
there was a bouquet of Velvet there?

383
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:37,940
Hello.

384
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,900
Mr. Feng, Ms. Tan has moved in.

385
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,420
Okay, I've seen.

386
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,740
The Velvet were placed as well?

387
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,500
Yes, everything is set.

388
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,540
Alright, thank you.

389
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,460
You're welcome.

390
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,140
How did you know?

391
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,940
So your winery

392
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,420
is so close to my house,

393
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
and you asked Ms. Zhuang…

394
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,780
I wanted you to be closer to me.

395
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,300
It's a pity.

396
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,460
The person who comes here the most

397
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,940
is Wang Zeyuan.

398
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,500
Feng Rui,

399
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,740
sounds like

400
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,580
you're jealous.

401
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,580
I'm worried about you.

402
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,420
I'm fine.

403
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,180
Don't worry.

404
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,300
Right now,

405
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,620
we should be worried
about your mom the most.

406
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,460
Right.

407
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:01,900
So,

408
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,620
have you figured out how to face Le?

409
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,140
Since I found out

410
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,020
he is my child,

411
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,540
I've thought more than once

412
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,060
about how to tell him

413
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,180
that I am his mother.

414
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,420
Do you think he'll accept it?

415
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,660
I don't know.

416
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,140
But what's meant to happen will happen.

417
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,220
We'll

418
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,540
face this together.

419
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,740
Should I

420
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,820
tell him for you?

421
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,260
No.

422
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
I have to do it myself.

423
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:38,980
Okay.

424
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,780
By the way,

425
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,660
what's going on with Siting?

426
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,980
She's been unreachable lately.

427
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,420
I don't know.

428
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,220
Oh no,

429
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,060
my guess was right after all.

430
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,700
It's fine.

431
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,620
It's good.

432
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,460
Put all your energy into your work

433
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,740
and take your career to the next level.

434
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,300
Come on,

435
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,900
let's toast to my return to work.

436
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,900
Nothing else, right?

437
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,980
I'm going back to the company.

438
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,060
So you won't eat? Fine.

439
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,980
I'll eat it myself.

440
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,660
It's all mine.

441
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,700
No one's to celebrate with me.

442
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,740
I'll celebrate by myself.

443
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,060
What's so great about that?

444
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,700
Grandma.

445
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,620
Grandma.

446
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,980
What are you thinking about?

447
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,260
I've been calling you several times.

448
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,580
Have you?

449
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,580
Look, almost no apple left to eat.

450
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,340
You're back.

451
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:56,740
Le!

452
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,340
Dad,

453
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,780
you're home.

454
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,060
I bought you some pastries.

455
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,780
You left without a word

456
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,140
and came back without one.

457
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
About the comic con you promised,

458
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,180
I had to go with Mr. Lu.

459
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:10,820
Sorry.

460
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,460
I had an urgent matter to deal with.

461
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,860
How did it go?

462
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,060
It's almost done.

463
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,860
As long as it's sorted out.

464
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:24,740
Le,

465
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,700
stop playing games.

466
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,300
Do your homework in your room.

467
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,580
Take the pastries with you.

468
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,140
Go to your room.

469
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:32,940
Here,

470
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,980
take this apple.

471
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,220
Hold it tight.

472
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,220
Finish your homework before you eat.

473
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,140
The pastries are yours.

474
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,900
Who did you go with?

475
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,780
Aren't you going to say anything?

476
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,940
When will you register
your marriage with Peiyan?

477
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,820
You missed it last week.

478
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,380
I checked it.

479
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
Tomorrow is quite suitable.

480
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,700
Peiyan and I...

481
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,180
How about...?

482
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,020
We've broken up.

483
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,700
What did you just say?

484
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,460
Thanks to Peiyan's decision,

485
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,540
I didn't get lost in this mistake.

486
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,820
It gave me the chance...

487
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,580
What do you take marriage for?

488
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,180
A child's game?

489
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,180
Just because of Tan Siting?

490
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,820
Marriage

491
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,580
should not be built upon lies.

492
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,660
It's been 12 years.

493
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,940
Twelve years, and you can't move on.

494
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,100
What spell did she put on you?

495
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,340
To avoid feeling guilty toward her,

496
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,940
you hurt someone who loves you more.

497
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,980
Aren't you guilty toward Yan?

498
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,020
Allowing this to keep escalating

499
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,580
will truly hurt her in the end.

500
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,420
Think about it.

501
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
If we hadn't broken up,

502
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,860
or if she knows the truth

503
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,740
after we get married

504
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,500
and become husband and wife,

505
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,140
that will be betraying her.

506
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I want to marry with true love.

507
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,740
I don't want a marriage

508
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,780
like that between you and Dad.

509
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,740
Don't comment on my marriage.

510
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,380
We

511
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,540
may not love each other,

512
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,900
but we have feelings.

513
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,380
You've disappointed me.

514
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,100
So many years have passed,

515
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,340
and your son has grown up.

516
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,380
I thought you wouldn't
be blinded by love

517
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,820
like a young man.

518
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,620
You are now

519
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,740
a mature man.

520
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,140
You have to be responsible

521
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,740
for your marriage and family.

522
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,660
What I need to do now

523
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,620
is to take my responsibility.

524
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,780
I can't understand

525
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,820
why you hid

526
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,340
that Le was born safely?

527
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,300
You are also a mother.

528
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,860
Ms. Tan

529
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,700
is suffering
from severe prenatal depression.

530
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,220
Here is her test report.

531
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,260
Please take a look.

532
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,980
Will it affect the fetus?

533
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,580
Prenatal depression

534
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,700
may trigger more serious conditions,

535
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,860
including pessimistic thoughts.

536
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,740
Some might have violent tendencies.

537
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,860
Severely,

538
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,780
a risk of impulsive, harmful behavior.

539
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,700
All these are serious

540
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,460
and dangerous.

541
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,340
If she carries on like this,

542
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,740
she could very well lose the baby.

543
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,260
So, I suggest you

544
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,780
pay more attention to her emotions.

545
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,940
Don't let things take their course.

546
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,740
The best is to make her feel relaxed

547
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,740
and meet those who make her feel safe.

548
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,660
That would help.

549
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,100
In short,

550
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,420
you must not stimulate her.

551
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:03,940
Ms. Tan,

552
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,220
if you don't eat,

553
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,380
you won't hold up,

554
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,860
and it's not good for the baby.

555
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,180
I said I don't want to eat.

556
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,380
I heard from Feng Rui

557
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,700
that fish heads are your favorite.

558
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,300
I made some fish head soup for you.

559
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,180
Please have a little.

560
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,820
Ms. Tan,

561
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,940
I'll leave the soup on the table.

562
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,260
I'll go back

563
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,260
and come back tomorrow morning.

564
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,460
Doctor,

565
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,740
it's not even eight months yet.

566
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,300
Too early for the baby to be born now.

567
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,900

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,620

601
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,620

602

How long have you known each other?

603
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,740
A few months.

How did you meet?

605
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,820
She isn't connected to Haotian's death.

606
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,100
I know very well what she's like.

607
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,420
Her family couldn't have done that.

You've only known her for a few months.

As he colluded with others

611

to blackmail Haotian,

612
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,740
he might use his daughter
to blackmail you.

613

There's no such thing as blackmail.

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,820
So Ms. Wen didn't get a cold.

662
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,500
It was because of the breakup.

Have you

she is good to me

and also very nice to you.

I think

672
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,380
you should go to her

673
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,500

677
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,140
Have you decided?

678
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,460
That day,

679
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,740
when he came to me,

680
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,300
I was hesitating whether to tell him

681
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,900
where you are.

682
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,740
But later,

683
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,780
after listening to what he said,

684
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,660

685
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,300
that in this world,

00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,860

The misunderstanding between us is deep.

693
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,820
I thought time could change everything

694
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,820
and make me forget everything.

695
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,540

00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,020
We do.

761
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,180
You

762
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,460
inherited it from me.

763
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,020
You know how articulate I am.

764
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,260
Of course, you're more eloquent.

765
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,140
Unlike your dad,

766
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,740
he can't speak clearly.

767
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,220
With your silver tongue,

768
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,100
you've got your job, huh?

769
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,380
Does Zeyuan know?

770
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,460
Did you tell him?

771
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,180
Yes.

772
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,220
What was his reaction?

773
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,220
The same as my dad's.

774
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,780
I'm still skeptical.

775
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,980
Just stop being so suspicious.

776
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,420
Shuhan,

777
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,100
prove yourself.

778
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,820
Do a good job with this project

779
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,420
and prove

780
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,580
they were wrong.

781
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,820
Don't worry, Mom.

782
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,540
I will do a good job on this project.

783
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,180
Come on.

784
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,820
Let's go further ahead.

785
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,860
I'll tell you more.

786
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,020
Do you know?

787
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,860
When I was abroad,

788
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,820
I often dreamt

789
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,820
about our first visit to this shop.

790
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,980
Do you still remember?

791
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,900
Of course.

792
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,980
After so many years,

793
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,700
many people and things have changed.

794
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,020
But this shop hasn't.

795
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,420
It's still here

796
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,900
with the same taste.

797
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,100
Later on, I often visited this place

798
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,940
and sat here.

799
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,180
Why?

800
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,180
You don't like their food.

801
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:15,940
Seeing this reminds you of someone?

802
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,740
Mr. Feng,

803
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,180
your coffee is here.

804
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:23,620
Thank you.

805
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:23,860
Please enjoy.

806
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,740
You haven't answered me.

807
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,140
I missed you.

808
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,940
When

809
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,220
Le eats Mini Puff,

810
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,380
he looks exactly like you.

811
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,780
It makes me feel dazed.

812
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,900
No matter how often I ask,

813
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,020
he won't give up

814
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,060
this food.

815
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,900
It's all he wants to eat.

816
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,020
I promise you,

817
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,020
you won't sit here alone again.

818
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,900
I'll always be with you.

819
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,100
[News Headline]

820
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,500
Mr. Gao Haotian,
Deputy GM of Tianlu Trade,

821
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,420
accidentally fell to his death

822
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,700
while descending the stairs.

823
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,900
Updates are available for this case.

824
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,180
Before his death,

825
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,100
Mr. Gao Haotian was attempting

826
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,660
to rape an employee of the company.

827
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,300
During his attempt to flee,

828
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,220
he fell from the building accidentally,

829
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,020
dying instantly at the scene.

830
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,460
Hello, Mr. Yang.

831
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,660
Mr. Feng.

832
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,100
I'm so sorry

833
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,620
to hear the news.

834
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,500
Please accept my condolences.

835
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,140
Thank you.

836
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,300
Your mother...

837
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,380
She is not in good health right now

838
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,100
and can't come to the phone.

839
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,340
You can tell me what it's about.

840
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,980
Alright, Mr. Feng.

841
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,380
Regarding

842
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,780
the wine I wanted earlier,

843
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,620
could we postpone it for now?

844
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,260
Because what happened now

845
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,500
has caused negative public opinion,

846
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,100
and it might have an impact.

847
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,260
Okay, I understand.

848
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,100
Let's put all our transactions on hold

849
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,420
for the time being.

850
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,140
Thanks for your concern.

851
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,620
I'm really sorry.

852
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,100
Mr. Feng,

853
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,380
appreciate your understanding.

854
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,220
Please take care.

855
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,540
Take care.

856
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,100
Turn off your phones.

857
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,860
Gao Haotian's incident
escalates further.

858
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,700
Tianlu Trade is facing

859
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,420
overseas suppliers' suspensions.

860
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,620
