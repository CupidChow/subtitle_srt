[Episode 23]

19
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,380
That should be enough.

20
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,210
Hurry. Sit down.

21
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,540
Oh, only an hour for lunch break.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,100
You asked me out to eat.

23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,290
It takes 20 minutes to travel.

24
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,820
So…

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,770
We only have 40 minutes.

26
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,850
So I ordered for you in advance.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,740
I got everything you wanted. Enough?

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,930
Need to order more?

29
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,100
No.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,660
Let's start now!

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,570
Sure?

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,740
Enough for you?

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,490
Sure.

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,410
This is yours.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,410
Okay.

36
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,340
One soup each.

37
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,170
Why not have two?

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,060
No, I don't deserve it.

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,820
You don't deserve it.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,410
Alright, here.

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,940
Still need to stay in shape?

42
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,130
Of course.

43
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,010
So particular.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,610
I have to teach my students.

45
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,940
You have no idea how slim

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,940
No?

50
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,840
Yes.

51
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,890
Tastes great.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,610
Here.

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,780
I must speed up,

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,570
or I'll be late.

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,500
Take your time.

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm used to it.

57
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,010
Take it slow with the food.

58
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,220
Your stomach's on thin ice.

59
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,540
Okay, Sir.

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,220
It's so delicious.

61
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,780
No rush.

62
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,980
I can drive you over later.

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,780
It'll take at most 20 minutes.

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,500
I'll definitely make it in 15.

65
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,820
You're faster than a DiDi driver?

66
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,290
Of course.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,820
Are you sure?

68
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,130
Let's go.

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,450
Wait, I

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,450
bought you a coffee.

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,850
You even thought of that.

72
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,220
I worry you may embarrass your students

73
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,340
as you may be sleepy

74
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,220
in class like this.

75
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,260
Your coffee.

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,820
Thanks.

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,780
I, um...

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,100
Shuhan, why haven't you answered me?

79
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,130
My stomach has been off recently.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,610
Are you sick?

81
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,690
I'm fine now. Everything is better.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,260
Look, I'm in good shape, right?

83
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,980
I just dressed up.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,290
I'll meet a friend for dinner.

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,290
About to head out.

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,610
By the way,

87
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,380
how's everything going?

88
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,380
Going smoothly here.

89
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,850
I think we'll start the project

90
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,410
in the East District in a few days.

91
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,170
Once this is all over,

92
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,060
let's travel and relax.

93
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,820
Sounds good.

94
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,020
Where do you want to go?

95
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,220
We can pack our bags and go.

96
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,580
Anywhere will do.

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,460
What's wrong?

98
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,340
Why do you look so unhappy?

99
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,250
Are you mad at me?

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,020
No, of course not.

101
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,020
How could I be unhappy?

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,980
Am I that kind of person?

103
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,460
Definitely not.

104
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,540
You're my rock.

105
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,140
Alright, I won't keep you.

106
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,730
You've got so much going on tomorrow.

107
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm in a rush to head out.

108
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,730
Bye. Love you.

109
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,900
Based on the latest data feedback

110
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,140
from Sansan,

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,900
only 3% of games in the market

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,930
are paid,

113
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,050
while the vast majority are free.

114
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,170
They make users watch ads constantly.

117
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,540
Shuhan's phone is turned off.

118
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,780
Can you get in touch with her?

119
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,370
She's probably out with her boyfriend.

120
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,020
Probably no signal.

121
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,900
She'll call you back. Don't worry.

122
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,660
Always wandering around all day,

123
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,020
never letting us know in advance.

124
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,250
Alright, I'll hang up.

125
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,580
The phone you're calling is powered off.

126
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,540
Go back and review it again.

127
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,930
I need to take a call.

128
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,810
Okay.

129
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,610
Bye, Ms. Tan.

130
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,930
Yuan.

131
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,410
Siting.

132
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,580
Is Shuhan with you?

133
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,580
No.

134
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,540
What's wrong?

135
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,250
Anything happened?

136
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,580
Probably nothing serious.

137
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,250
Don't worry about it.

138
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,460
If she contacts you,

139
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,700
tell her to call me.

140
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,250
No problem.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,050
Really, nothing's wrong?

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,780
Let's find her first.

143
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,250
You're her friend, right?

144
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,220
Please settle her room fee shortly.

145
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,140
She's three days overdue.

146
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,660
If you don't pay,
we'll have to ask her to leave.

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,340
Okay.

148
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,020
Miss Wang.

149
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,460
Miss Wang.

150
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,250
Shuhan.

151
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,340
It's me.

152
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,540
Open the door.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,540
Shuhan.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,780
I'll pay the room fee later.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,490
Alright.

156
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,660
A bit messy here.

157
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,610
Wanna drink?

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,980
How did you find me?

159
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,220
Your landlord contacted me.

160
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,370
I forgot

161
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,730
you're my emergency contact.

162
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,850
Thanks for making the trip.

163
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,890
Why are you staying here?

164
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,770
I lost the apartment.

165
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,130
I was short on money a while back,

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,370
so I used

167
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,610
the apartment as collateral for a loan.

168
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,980
Then I couldn't make the payments,

169
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,730
and they took the apartment.

170
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,730
It got repossessed.

171
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,300
You should've told me.

172
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,300
How

173
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,530
was I supposed to tell you?

174
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,580
At the very least,

175
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,610
you could've stayed at my place.

176
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,530
You could've

177
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,580
stayed at home.

178
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,060
How could I go back home?

179
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,060
How could I face them?

180
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,100
Our parents think I'm not capable.

181
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,580
Previously, I even told them

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,580
I was working on a big project

183
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,370
that I was about to become successful,

184
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,770
and I'd have lots of money.

185
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,010
And in the end,

186
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,530
I lost the apartment you bought me.

187
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,100
How can I go back?

188
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,300
Go to my place.

189
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:06,900
Come on.

190
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,780
Let's go.

191
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,250
Just go back.

192
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,580
Leave me alone.

193
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,380
That's enough!

194
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,900
Look at yourself.

195
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,300
What have you become?

196
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,420
So what?

197
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,300
The house is mortgaged,

198
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,020
and the car's gone.

199
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,890
You can redeem them later.

200
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,650
What's the big deal?

201
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,300
Where's

202
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,700
Wang Shuhan,
big shot of the East District?

203
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,740
Where is she?

204
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,460
Shuhan,

205
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,130
no matter what happens,

206
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,380
your family will always be there.

207
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,610
I've rented a place for three months

208
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,940
and paid the fees.

209
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,460
When it's up,

210
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,530
we can renew.

211
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,770
Here are our three rules.

212
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:27,820
First,

213
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,660
your phone must be on 24/7

214
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,060
so I can reach you anytime.

215
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,420
Second,

216
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,380
if you need money,

217
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,940
please tell me right away.

218
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,140
Third,

219
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,780
no more reckless investments.

220
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,660
I have to go.

221
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,660
Got work to do.

222
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,980
If anything comes up,

223
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,420
just let me know.

224
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,780
Hello.

225
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,300
Hello, do you have a reservation?

226
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:11,780
Yes.

227
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,060
I found Shuhsn.

228
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,180
If you're free these days,

229
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,490
could you spend some time with her?

230
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,660
Mr. Bai, right?

231
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,580
Okay.

232
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,530
Ms. Tan, I'm off now.

233
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,530
Bye, see you tomorrow.

234
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,370
You have an hour to get dolled up.

235
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,490
See you at our usual spot.

236
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,850
A ton of coriander.

237
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:54,890
Here,

238
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,940
your favorite special sauce.

239
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:58,770
Thanks.

240
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,300
Have a drink with me.

241
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,850
Sure.

242
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,100
Waitress!

243
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,370
Two beers, please.

244
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:07,850
Okay.

245
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,580
Thank you.

246
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,610
You know, it's strange.

247
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,130
Why does hotpot

248
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,300
only taste this amazing

249
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,370
when I'm eating it with you?

250
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,940
No one else gives me that feeling.

251
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,940
Still remember this restaurant?

252
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,220
You brought me here
when we were students.

253
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,580
Really?

254
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,130
Back then, while studying ballet,

255
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,420
you also had to work outside.

256
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,010
Your first job

257
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,820
was at a small convenience store

258
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,730
as a clerk.

259
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,300
I remember it clearly,

260
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,850
your first month's salary

261
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,700
was 1,200 yuan.

262
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,300
You said you would treat me to a meal

263
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,180
as soon as you got paid.

264
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,180
Back then, we were right here.

265
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,130
I dug in like there was no tomorrow

266
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,890
and ate over 200 yuan's worth,

267
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,820
a fifth of your salary!

268
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,010
At that time, I thought

269
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,890
their hotpot was absolutely delicious.

270
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,940
Your beers.

271
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,250
Thanks.

272
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,580
But later, when I was in Paris,

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,340
I often craved hotpot,

274
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,100
but it never tasted quite the same.

275
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,730
Maybe without the right person.

276
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,490
After so many years,

277
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,060
a lot has changed.

278
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,300
But thankfully,

279
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,770
the taste of the hotpot here hasn't.

280
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,770
When I eat hotpot with you,

281
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,300
my appetite's still the same.

282
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,010
Eat up.

283
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,730
Siting,

284
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,460
I watched your interview.

285
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,490
You spoke really well.

286
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,850
Stop putting me down.

287
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,820
Really.

288
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,490
Everything you've achieved

289
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,610
is well-deserved.

290
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,820
I was really nervous back then.

291
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,490
You know what?

292
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,300
I was thinking

293
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,300
if only you were there.

294
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,060
You're so good with words.

295
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,490
So I thought,

296
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,980
if I ever get interviewed again,

297
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,890
I'll bring you along,

298
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,130
no awkwardness for sure.

299
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,250
How are things with Feng Rui?

300
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,180
Pretty good.

301
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,300
Eat.

302
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,730
His mom didn't say anything else?

303
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,250
Do you think it's possible?

304
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,530
She used Le's phone

305
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,730
to ask me to meet.

306
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,530
She probably feels like

307
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,890
she can't hold onto Feng Rui,

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,490
so onto Le with all her might.

309
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,730
I bet she's been talking trash
about me behind my back.

310
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,300
I mean, Le's been acting different

311
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,700
toward me lately.

312
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,460
Feng Rui loves you so much.

313
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,300
No matter what happens,

314
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,780
he'll always be by your side.

315
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,130
And I believe

316
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,130
it won't be long

317
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,980
before Le comes back to you too.

318
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,290
It's been 12 years.

319
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,660
Back when I was at my lowest,

320
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,250
I never imagined things

321
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,420
could turn out like this.

322
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,330
Feng Rui was gone,

323
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,140
my dad had disappeared,

324
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,090
and I lost the baby.

325
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,380
I felt like my world had collapsed.

326
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,140
But now, looking back,

327
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,330
it's all in the past.

328
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,460
So no one goes

329
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,050
through life without setbacks.

330
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,380
The key is to make peace with yourself.

331
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,700
The shadow ahead means

332
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,570
the sun is shining behind us,

333
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:40,810
right?

334
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,380
But now,

335
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,770
I have nothing.

336
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,090
Really?

337
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,140
You have me,

338
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,730
Yuan,

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,620
and Zu.

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,530
Zu.

341
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,660
Here, drink up.

342
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,860
Eat.

343
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,010
Eat this.

344
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:25,980
Bao.

345
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,260
Bao.

346
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,300
Look into this person and this account.

347
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,300
Bro,

348
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,020
we're working overtime here.

349
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,580
What's this about?

350
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,100
Drop everything else.

351
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
We need to find out.

352
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,060
Start with this one.

353
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,700
[Skyline Magnificence]

354
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,220
Cheer up.

355
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,940
Try to track it.

356
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,660
Come on, run.

357
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,660
Get ready.

358
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,300
Go!

359
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,820
Feng Lexuan,

360
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,500
see how fast I was going just now?

361
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,860
What's wrong?

362
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,180
Nothing.

363
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,300
Where were you the other day?

364
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,340
Why were you absent from class?

365
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,060
What's wrong with you?

366
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,980
You've been so down lately.

367
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,660
Still thinking about Ms. Wen?

368
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,860
Feng Le Xuan,

369
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,940
what's bothering you?

370
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,220
Say it,

371
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,020
and you'll feel better.

372
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,860
If

373
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,180
you thought someone was dead,

374
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,780
but she's actually alive.

375
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,700
What would you do?

376
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,420
My grandma loved me so much

377
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,620
when I was a baby,

378
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,980
but

379
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,540
she passed away when I was seven.

380
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,300
If

381
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,780
someone tells me she is alive,

382
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,540
I'll

383
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,260

Ever since you were little,

391
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,420
all you wanted was a mom.

392
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,020
And now, your real mom is alive.

393

00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,260
I've contacted a few friends

574
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,340
from out of town for you,

575
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
and I've negotiated their rates.

576
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,660
I'll send them to you soon.

577
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,020
Alright.

578
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,300
That's it then.

579
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,580
Shuhan, where are you?

580
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,900
[Shuhan]
Zu,

581
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,740
I'll cover the penalty fee.

582
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,180
I'm sorry.

583
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,100
I've sent my resignation letter
to your email.

584
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,100
Shuhan, where are you?

585
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,260
Can't we talk about this in person?

586
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,540
I haven't approved your resignation.

587
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,620
This isn't as serious as you think.

588
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,420
Don't need to avoid me.

589
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,940
This isn't the only reason
for the breach.

590
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,740
No need to do this.

591
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,220
Really.

592
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,140
Where are you?

593
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,980
Please call me back.

594
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:07,860
Mom,

595
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,740
what brings you here today?

596
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,900
I haven't seen Le in so long.

597
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,020
Wanted to dine with him.

598
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,980
I'll bring him back tonight.

599
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,700
It's fine.

600
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,620
Grandma.

601
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,300
Let's go.

602
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,820
Let's have dinner together.

603
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,140
Got his permission.

604
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:37,540
Yes.

605
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,340
Have a good meal with Grandma.

606
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:40,700
Let's go.

607
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,980
Alright, thank you, Grandma.

608
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,580
Less sweets.

609
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,780
Got it.

610
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:45,980
Bye.

611
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,580
Bye.

612
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,900
How's your studying going?

613
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,780
Did you do well on the midterm exams?

614
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,700
Here's your dish.

615
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,300
Grandma, you forgot?

616
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,660
The midterms were last week.

617
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,060
I got a total score of 270.

618
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,260
My highest was Chinese with 92,

619
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,860
and my lowest was Math with 88.

620
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,580
That's great!

621
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,100
Keep up the good work!

622
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,340
Are you doing well living at home?

623
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,460
Pretty good.

624
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,580
Why not stay with me for a few days?

625
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,580
At my place,

626
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,100
you can play video games.

627
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,580
No, thanks, Grandma.

628
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,140
If you refuse again,

629
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,660
I'll

630
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,140
forget

631
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,260
what you look like.

632
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,420
Don't worry.

633
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,780
I'll be there sooner or later.

634
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,820
Have you met with Ms. Tan?

635
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,260
No.

636
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,340
What about your dad?

637
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,940
Why are you asking?

638
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,740
Let's take a photo together.

639
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,340
Suddenly want a photo?

640
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,420
Come on.

641
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,780
Your mom took Le away.

642
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,740
I'm a bit worried.

643
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,260
Don't worry,

644
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,740
he is very decisive.

645
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,420
It's okay.

646
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,340
I forgot to tell you.

647
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,700
He knows you're his mother.

648
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,660
What?

649
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,900
That day, he suddenly asked me.

650
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,900
He asked,

651
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,700
"My mom is Ms. Tan, right?"

652
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,260
What did you say?

653
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,780
I said, "Yes."

654
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,540
Then he seriously asked me

655
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,340
a few more questions.

656
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,900
What did he ask you?

657
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,580
He asked,

658
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,620
"Does she

659
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,780
love you?"

660
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,500
I said, "She does."

661
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,860
Then he said,

662
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,780
"As much as I love you?"

663
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,580
I told him, "Yes."

664
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,780
I think

665
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,220
he's starting to slowly accept you.

666
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:50,940
That's a good thing.

667
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,140
I've thought countless times

668
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,580
about how to explain to him

669
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,180
why I left back then,

670
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,460
and why I've come back now

671
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,660
to find him.

672
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,780
I've even thought about

673
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,860
the expression I should have

674
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,580
when saying goodbye if he rejects me.

675
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,340
All I want

676
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,620
is to be a good mother in his eyes.

677
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,100
But I didn't expect him

678
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,020
to be so perceptive.

679
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
So,

680
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,660
thank you.

681
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,420
Why?

682
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,060
For raising him so well.

683
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,180
It makes me feel less guilty.

684
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,700
From now on,

685
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,420
we'll raise him together.

686
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,500
You'll do a better job than I did.

687
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,340
So,

688
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,860
should we

689
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,060
pick a day soon

690
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,380
for us three

691
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,620
to officially meet?

692
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,540
Good idea.

693
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,300
The ceremony matters.

694
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,660
Where should we meet?

695
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,700
Let's go somewhere he likes.

696
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,100
He loves the zoo,

697
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,700
an amusement park,

698
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,620
or maybe gaming.

699
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,420
You've come back

700
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,020
and appeared in his life.

701
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,100
That's the best gift

702
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,700
for him and for me.

703
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,220
Do you know

704
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,020
how long I've been waiting for this day?

705
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:42,940
The three of us,

706
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,420
sitting together and eating a meal.

707
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,740
At the table,

708
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,500
it'll be warm and happy.

709
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
We might

710
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,620
tease each other,

711
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,780
bicker,

712
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,300
maybe even argue.

713
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,660
What if we just have

714
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,460
a meal together?

715
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,900
Okay.

716
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,740
Let me cook.

717
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,780
I've been getting into cooking lately.

718
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,260
No way.

719
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
I have to do it.

720
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,500
I must

721
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,300
make the first meal.

722
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,380
Alright.

723
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,460
Your steak is really good.

724
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,140
You know what?

725
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,260
That steak won't cut it.

726
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,140
In this case,

727
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,020
I'll prepare something proper.

728
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,620
And then,

729
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,660
something really formal.

730
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,500
Don't overthink it.

731
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,380
Prepare a big feast.

732
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,300
This one is good. Go with this.

733
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,180
It's too sudden.

734
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,020
No, not at all.

735
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,300
I like this.

[Extra-terrestrial Guest: Meteorites]

00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,060
Still reading?

738
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,020
When did you get so diligent?

739
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,260
Dad,

740
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,900
I've always been diligent.

741
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,060
Time flies.

742
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,500
You're graduating from primary school.

743
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,500
What graduation gift do you want?

744
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,340
I'll grant it.

745
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,620
Wow, sudden kindness?

746
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,340
Better not be plotting something.

If you don't want, forget it.

748
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,460
I do!

00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,940
Is it about Ms. Tan?

They're pretty good.

761
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,340
Would you like to give them a try?

762
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,740
Did she ask you to invite me?
