00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,020
Cheers.

195
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
I really enjoyed the drinks today.

196

Wait here.

197
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,860
I'll get a driver to bring the car over.

198
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,940
Did you have fun today?

199
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,180
This is all your favorite food.

200
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,020
By the way, did you

201
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,500
properly thank

202
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,020
Ms. Wen yet?

203
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,540
Thank you, Ms. Wen.

204
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,420
Don't mention it.

205
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,820
Le worked hard for it.

206
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,100
If Ms. Wen hadn't pushed you
to practice...

207
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
No, just busy eating away.

208
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Alright, wait here.

209
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,740
I'll go get the car.

210
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,380
Okay.

211
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,260
You carry on.

Button up your collar.

213
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,420
There was a part before you arrived.

214
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,180
I recorded it.

215
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,020
So cool.

216
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,500
Don't look.

217
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,340
Focus on driving.

218
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,140
I'll play it for you.

Renowned ballet artist

Tan Siting

222
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,340
has announced her retirement
and returned home today.

223
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,660
Tan Siting, often called
the Pride of Chinese ballet,

224
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,540
has decided to return home.

225
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,220
Reports say

226
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,940
she's retiring

227
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,500
to return home and pursue teaching work.

228
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Let's wish

229
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,780
the former ballet goddess Tan Siting

230
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,940
all the best in her future endeavors.

231
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,980
Now, here's a lovely song for everyone.

232
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,060
"Chengdu Love Story".

233
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,260
Thanks, Yuan.

234
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,940
I haven't felt

235
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,660
this relaxed in a long time.

236
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,140
Don't mention it, big artist.

237
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,740
Back in the homeland,

238
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,260
of course you gotta enjoy
the good food and drinks.

239
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,260
I finally realized

240
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,020
nothing beats the arms of homeland.

241
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,140
So when are you coming into my arms?

242
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,780
Let me think.

243
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,420
Maybe in the next life.

244
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,140
That long?

245
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,420
Hey, stop messing around.

246
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,620
Thank you.

247
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,300
Get some rest.

248
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,220
I'll head off now.

249
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,500
Bye.

250
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:42,980
Bye.

251
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,020
Mom,

252
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,460
what brings you here today?

253
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,700
What?

254
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,380
I need

255
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,380
your permission to visit?

256
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,260
Rui.

257
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,860
I want to get Le a new piano.

258
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,340
His current one is still new.

259
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,340
I can't make it.

260
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,220
Can you

261
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
go pick one?

262
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,100
I don't know how to pick a piano.

263
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,460
You don't have to.

264
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,300
I have found a pro.

265
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
She's back.

266
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,340
Who?

267
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,620
Her.

268
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,460
I heard it

269
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,820
on the news.

270
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,060
Rui.

271
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,140
I know you've been

272
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,700
through a lot all these years.

273
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,260
No need to bring it up.

274
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,460
That was so long ago.

275
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,540
I've forgotten about it.

276
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,220
You really mean that?

277
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,260
Of course.

278
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,980
Good.

[Candy & Pastry Shop]

280
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,620
Excuse me,

281
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,900
do you still make
the Mini Puff without milk?

282
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,500
Our Mini Puff

283
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,420
has never contained milk.

284
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,340
Even after all these years,

285
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,500
it's still made without milk?

286
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,500
Yes.

287
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100
I used to buy from your shop
all the time.

288
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,100
Oh, so you're a regular?

289
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,980
How many would you like?

290
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,980
Just one.

291
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,780
Sure.

292
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,180
I hope the taste hasn't changed.

293
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,020
Of course. You can try it.

294
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,900
Thanks.

295
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,540
Let's check in on the traffic now.

296
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,260
There's a two-car rear-end collision

297
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,340
on Hantang Road heading southbound,

298
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,980
causing slow-moving traffic
in the section.

299
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,860
Please drive carefully
if you're passing through.

300
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,980
Right here is fine.

301
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,340
Okay.

302
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,340
That piano of yours
really does need replacing.

303
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,260
Poor tuning can affect
a player's ear, after all.

304
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,900
Sorry

305
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,500
to have taken up your time

306
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,380
and made you come so far.

307
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,660
Don't be so formal with me.

308
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm the professional
when it comes to pianos.

309
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,820
Happy to give you some advice.

310
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,780
Right.

311
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,220
Thank you for your help.

312
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,300
No problem.

313
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,220
Excuse me.

314
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,820
Sorry.

315
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,460
Excuse me.

316
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,580
Hello.

317
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,820
I'm sorry.

318
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,460
Is this yours?

319
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,140
Here.

320
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,220
Thank you.

321
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,780
No problem. Keep it safe.

322
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,940
What kind of piano

323
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,580
are you looking for?

324
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,220
We have both upright and grand pianos.

325
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,340
We can help you find the right one.

326
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,180
Do you have the Yamaha YM50?

327
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,740
Yes.

328
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,780
Right this way, please.

329
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,340
Okay.

330
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,540
May I ask

331
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,860
how old your child is?

332
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,340
Starting middle school soon.

333
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,020
Alright.

334
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,460
Look, this is the model.

335
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,860
This one right here.

336
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,580
May I try it?

337
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,540
Of course.

338
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,980
Just a moment. Let me adjust it for you.

339
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,380
Okay.

340
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,020
What do you think...?

341
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,580
What's up

342
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,940
with you today?

343
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,260
You seem off.

344
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,540
Like your mind is somewhere else.

345
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,500
Then

346
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,540
I'd better go find it.

347
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,540
Alright. Please give it a try.

348
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,460
Okay.

349
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,700
Excuse me.

350
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,260
Sure.

351
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,980
Thank you.

352
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,460
The high notes are bright,

353
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,620
and the bass is rich and full.

354
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,460
You play beautifully.

355
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,660
You must be an expert.

356
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,220
Then

357
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,580
we'll take this one.

358
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,700
Here's the thing, sir.

359
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,660
This piano

360
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,980
comes with a matching bench.

361
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,980
Could you tell me
how tall your child is?

362
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,580
About

363
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,060
this high.

364
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,940
One meter forty-nine.

365
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,460
Mom always knows best.

366
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:45,980
Alright.

367
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,860
Please wait in the lounge area.

368
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,900
I'll check our warehouse stock.

369
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,500
Okay. Thank you.

370
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,460
Mr. Feng, since winning the award,

371
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,140
have you been busier than before?

372
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,740
It should be a good thing.

373
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,260
Just worried I'll have
even less time for Le.

374
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,380
You and your mom
are both career-focused.

375
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,340
But it's okay.

376
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,420
Le is very understanding.

377
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,660
But what I said last time

378
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,940
wasn't just being polite.

379
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,420
If you and your mom are busy,

380
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,220
you can really

381
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,700
leave Le with me after school.

382
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,780
He's starting middle school.

383
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,020
He can take care of himself.

384
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,820
You two even sound the same.

385
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,020
But meals shouldn't be rushed.

386
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,740
He can't always just order takeout.

387
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,580
I usually eat alone.

388
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,220
Having Le over would mean

389
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,060
we could cook more dishes.

390
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,940
But that's too much trouble for you.

391
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,980
Don't be so formal with me.

392
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,700
You always like meeting me here.

393
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,660
Because

394
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,060
I love this street.

395
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,020
It always has a special feel to it.

396
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,700
You sound like an old man.

397
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,820
So profound.

398
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,300
Maybe I've been drinking too much tea.

399
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,460
What do you feel like eating later?

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:15,860
Sure.

402
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,220
But I know a place
that does amazing skewers.

403
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Alright. Your call.

404
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,100
Okay.

405
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,180

Someday,

409
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,940
I'll open a winery here,

410
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,460

a dance studio downstairs.

Sure.

414
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,500
It suits you.

415
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,260
After a drink, we can perform

416
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,460
a drunken fist dance.

417
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,260
Drunken fist?

418
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:34,980
Good.

419
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,060
What should I

420
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,940
name the winery?

Welcome to come again.

00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,980
Are you here for a wine tasting?

425
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,700
How long have you been open?

426

Over six years.

Thank you.

that suit the Chinese palate.

It's quite accurate.

Well, I know about making a bold retreat.

out there for so long.

She just called.

Something came up at the office,

501
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,660
so she asked me to bring Le to you.

502
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,860

Ms. Wen told me all about it.

505

You came all this way just to say that?

506

As long as you practice hard,

507

Your answers are always
full of surprises.

516
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,740
I give you two choices,

517
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,940
and you always pick a third.

I bet

521
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,660
he'd pick white.

522
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,300
Le,

523
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,180
your dad also chose white.

524
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,340
You like white that much, huh?

525
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,300
Okay.

526

What do you feel like eating later?

528
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,660
I feel like

Where are you headed?

531
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,500
I'll give you a ride.

Don't worry about it.

540
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,580
No, I have to.

541

Let's keep things clear.

542
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,300
Honestly, I didn't expect

543

from your school.

No wonder it's such a coincidence.

You weren't hoping to find
a pair of ballet shoes, were you?

551
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,420
Well, you've helped me twice now.

552

I still don't know your name

553

or what you do.

554
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,900
Is it okay to ask?

555
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,380
Of... Of course.

Are you performing
at the theater this time?

559
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,340
An audition.

561
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,460

564

We just call it Queen Ballet.

565
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Will you make it in time?

566
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,660
Yes. Don't worry.

567
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,300
Go on, we're here.

568
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:07,820
Thank you.

569
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,180
Hope we are not too late.

570
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:10,780
Bye.

571

Bye.

572

00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,740
buy those shoes.

656
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,740
Madam, that's enough.

657
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,220
We haven't been shopping long,

658
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,140
and you've already bought Le
two pairs of shoes.

659
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,500
Besides, kids at his age

660
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,740
outgrow shoes so fast.

661
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,140
It's enough.

662
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,980
Yes, I know.

663
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,420
You shouldn't spoil a child.

664
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,780
I know that.

665
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,540
But

666
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,500
I just can't help myself.

667
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,260
But those shoes really are quite nice.

668
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,180
You're right. They are nice.

669
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,340
Maybe you could think
about it a bit more

670
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:01,980
before deciding?

671
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,940
Let's sit down for a while.

672
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,420

673
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,700
Let's go over there.

674
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,460
What do you think of Rui?

675
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,620
He's a good man.

676
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,820
And we get along well.

677
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,900
Just seeing

678
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,740
how much he loves Le shows

679
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,140
how responsible he is.

680
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,100
Once, Le joked with me,

681
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,180
saying "If my dad ended up with Ms. Wen,

682
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,660
I'd be totally happy."

683
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,100
Le really likes you.

684
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,500
He talks about you all the time.

685
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,660
I also hope

686
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,700
that one day,

687
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,540
you and Rui might be together.

688
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,060
That'd be wonderful.

689
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,660
Madam,

690
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,700
I understand what you're saying.

691
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,060
Let me be honest with you.

692
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,020
Actually, I have feelings for Rui.

693
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,940
I've also wondered

694
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,900
if we could take the next step.

695
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,620
But it always feels like

696
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,460
he's overly formal with me.

697
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,540
It's like he keeps me at a distance.

698
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,940
You've got the wrong idea.

699
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,180
That's just how he is.

700
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,140
He doesn't treat me
and his dad the same way.

701
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,780
He treats his dad

702
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,820
like a friend.

703
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,180
He'd tell him everything.

704
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,660
I have to admit,

705
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,140
I'm a bit jealous

706
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,620
of his dad over it.

707
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,780
Thank you, Madam.

708
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,580

709
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:48,940

710
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,380

they were so young.

715
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,300
They were only thinking

716
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,140
about themselves,

717
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,580

719

720
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,460
No need to bring it up.

721
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,460

722
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,700

723
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,300

724
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:39,860

725
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,460

726

728
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,780
your words really put my mind at ease.

729
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,900
I think

730
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,220
you could be

731
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460

732
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,700
