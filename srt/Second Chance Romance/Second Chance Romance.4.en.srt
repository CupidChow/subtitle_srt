00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,960
I'll tell you a secret.

189
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,840
There's a water stain
on the classroom ceiling

190
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,280
that looks just like a butterfly.

191
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,280
Just look for that.

192
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,840
When you're holding the position,

193
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,600
keep looking for it.

194
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,400
Once you find it, the time will be up.

195
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,280
Good luck.

196
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
Don't let Ms. Tan down.

197
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,280
First move.

198
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,080
Plié.

199
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,200
Start timing.

200
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,960
Let's move to the next move.

201
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,800
Demi-plié.

202
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,680
Start timing.

203
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,920
Okay.

204
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
Now try it on one leg.

205
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,360
Not bad.

206
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,560
Prepare for the next move.

207
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Ready.

208
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,080
Start timing.

209
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
Final move.

210
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,440
Begin.

211
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,080
Okay. Time's up.

212
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
That was really good.

213
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,120
Quite good.

214
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,560
Yes.

215
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,600
Right.

216
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,280
Good.

217
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,480
Madam.

218
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,560
Ms. Guan,

219
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,280
did I pass the exam?

220
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,680
Wait a moment.

221
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,120
Ms. Zhuang,

222
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
here are the compiled results.

223
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,840
Please take a look.

224
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,000
Congratulations.

225
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,840
You passed the exam.

226
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,160
But

227
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,360
this school

228
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,320
is not the kind of amateur school
you might think.

229
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,880
To reach our standards,

230
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,600
you'll need to keep working hard.

231
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
I understand. I will work hard.

232
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,800
Thank you, Madam.

233
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,400
Thank you.

234
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,120
Alright.

235
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Ms. Qin will take your mom

236
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,920
to complete
the enrollment procedures later.

237
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:58,880
Ms. Zhuang.

238
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,400
This way.

239
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,400
Ms. Tan,

240
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,960
I'll leave now.

241
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,400
Thank you.

242
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Don't just stand around here.

243
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,160
Everyone, back to your classrooms now!

244
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,880
Congratulations.

245
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,360
Keep up the good work.

246
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,880
Everyone, get out of here.

247
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,000
I told you you could do it.

248
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,120
Feeling confident?

249
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes.

250
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,120
Madam, are you confident?

251
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,680
Yes.

252
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,200
She really did well.

253
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,650
Yeah.

254
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,000
I knew she could pass.

255
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,840
Thank you.

256
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,760
Sir, I came

257
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,960
to apologize.

258
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,680
Well...

259
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,680
My grandson,

260
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,840
Feng Lexuan.

261
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,800
He got into a fight yesterday.

262
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I heard from him

263
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,160
that some students
were bullying other students.

264
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,200
I said, "That can't be right."

265
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
How could

266
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,600
there possibly be bullying
in a school like this?

267
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,520
I said he was talking nonsense.

268
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
I even explained it to him.

269
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
Severe school bullying

270
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,040
can lead to criminal liability.

271
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,680
The school could be held responsible.

272
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,040
We will

273
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,200
investigate this matter thoroughly.

274
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,160
Once the investigation is complete,

275
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,360
I'll give you a response.

276
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,920
But right now,

277
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,000
there's no evidence.

278
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,520
So no one can draw conclusions yet.

279
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,400
Right.

280
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,840
I asked him.

281
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
I said, "You claim it's bullying."

282
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,600
"Do you have proof?"

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,960
"Where is the evidence?"

284
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,680
He said it happened in a blind spot.

285
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,720
Your school

286
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,600
has areas not covered
by surveillance cameras?

287
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,960
I heard the school gave him
a major demerit

288
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,200
and asked him to write a reflection.

289
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,360
I said the reflection must be written.

290
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,640
It needs to be a profound reflection.

291
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,920
But

292
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,600
the major demerit...

293
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,040
Sir,

294
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,240
without evidence,

295
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,080
and with the matter
not yet fully investigated,

296
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,080
isn't this handling a bit rash?

297
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,360
Le,

298
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,160
your grandma is so good to you.

299
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,240
With your grandma stepping in,

300
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,000
this should be resolved, right?

301
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,080
Probably.

302
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,840
Bringing in a parent as backup?

303
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,560
Feeling guilty, are you?

304
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,480
Ren Zhexi,

305
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,920
you're the one who should feel guilty!

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,480
Who threw the first punch back then?

307
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,840
- They did.
- They did.

308
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,080
Exactly! Look what they did to me!

309
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,320
You're lying!

310
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,120
Do you have any evidence that I'm lying?

311
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Or did your dear grandma

312
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,000
find some evidence for you?

313
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,920
Ren Zhexi, I'm warning you,

314
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,280
show some respect for my grandma!

315
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,280
First time I've seen

316
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,920
someone bring their grandma
into a fight!

317
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,920
You're such a coward,

318
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,800
Feng Lexuan.

319
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
Do you still sleep cuddling
your grandma at night?

320
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,920
I've heard of mama's boys.

321
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,320
First time I'm seeing

322
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,640
a little boy who needs
his grandma's protection.

323
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,920
I forgot.

324
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,200
You don't have a mom!

325
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,800
Yeah, that's right.

326
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,400
Don't!

327
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,520
Don't touch me!

328
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,320
Get off!

329
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,680
Ms. Hu?

330
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
Alright.

331
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:42,840
Okay.

332
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,840
This is really dangerous.

333
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,520
Please take care of it.

334
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,360
Mr. Feng,

335
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,920
come with me for a moment.

336
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,200
Okay.

337
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,280
You must give me an explanation.

338
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,760
Right.

339
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,920
We definitely need an explanation.

340
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,520
Sir.

341
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,400
Mr. Feng.

342
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,920
You saw it yourself.

343
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,240
The previous issue isn't resolved,

344
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,680
and now Le has pushed someone.

345
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,560
This time

346
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,200
it was caught on camera.

347
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,280
Everyone can see what happened.

348
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,400
I... I know.

349
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,240
Le was wrong to push someone this time.

350
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,880
Don't worry.

351
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,040
We will take responsibility
for our mistakes.

352
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,320
Alright.

353
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,440
Here's what we'll do.

354
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,880
You go back for now.

355
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,760
We

356
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,160
will do our best
to mediate this situation.

357
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,920
The school
doesn't want this to escalate.

358
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,640
I understand.

359
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,640
By the way,

360
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Ms. Gao came to see me this afternoon.

361
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
She holds firm

362
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,120
to her view on this matter.

363
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,440
Now Le has pushed someone.

364
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,840
Maybe you could talk to Ms. Gao?

365
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,080
Don't worry.

366
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,360
This matter

367
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,680
will be handled

368
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,560
fairly and justly.

369
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,480
I understand.

370
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,200
Understood.

371
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,040
Alright.

372
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,680
Okay.

373
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,200
Thank you.

374
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Don't you want to talk about it?

375
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm on your side.

376
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,920
Don't you trust me?

377
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,400
What others say is one thing.

378
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,480
I want to hear your side of the story.

379
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,960
Did you throw the first punch?

380
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,120
Yes.

381
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,800
They said I don't have a mom.

382
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,440
That's why I hit them.

383
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,760
You're back.

384
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,240
Ms. Wen. Grandma.

385
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
I'll go check on him.

386
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,360
So that's what happened.

387
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,800
I don't think I was wrong.

388
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,240
Of course you weren't wrong.

389
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,760
The fault lies with them.

390
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
But we need to think about this.

391
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
No matter the reason,

392
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,720
the moment you resort to violence,

393
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,680
the nature of the situation changes.

394
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,960
I know.

395
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
I know all that.

396
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,200
But I was just so angry.

397
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,880
Do you know what they said?

398
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,200
Alright, okay.

399
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,080
They also said I don't have a...

400
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,000
Forget it.

401
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I know, really.

402
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,760
Anyway, they're the ones in the wrong.

403
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
Let's not talk about it anymore.

404
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,720
You went to the school?

405
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,640
And saw the principal?

406
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,320
Do you realize that by making a scene,

407
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,320
it's Le who ultimately suffers?

408
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,920
Making a scene?

409
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,240
I... I went to solve the problem.

410
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,520
Right now, there's no evidence.

411
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
The teachers' hands are tied.

412
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
So without evidence,

413
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
we just have to accept the unfairness?

414
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,920
Besides, the principal already promised

415
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,560
he wouldn't give Le

416
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,280
a major demerit.

417
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,920
You went to the school

418
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,040
and pressured them.

419
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,520
Is that fair to the other students?

420
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,840
I told you.

421
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,960
I'm trying to find evidence.

422
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,800
Where is the evidence?

423
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,840
Where is it then?

424
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,360
By the time you find it,

425
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,920
it'll be too late.

426
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,760
Let me tell you,

427
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,800
I believe Le.

428
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,680
He doesn't go looking for trouble.

429
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,440
That other child
must have said something

430
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,840
to provoke Le into hitting him.

431
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,480
Those are two separate issues.

432
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,440
Why are you conflating them?

433
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,600
Rui,

434
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,880
Le doesn't need to stay
in a school like this.

435
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,880
Let's transfer him.

436
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,560
We're trying to solve the problem,

437
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,200
not create new ones.

438
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,960
Fine.

439
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,440
Visit that boy's family
with money tomorrow.

440
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,080
If you say Le did nothing wrong,

441
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
why should we settle with money?

442
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
Because money is the most direct
and efficient way.

443
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
So you want Le to grow up

444
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,160
thinking money solves everything?

445
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,320
Stop arguing!

446
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,840
Le,

447
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,360
we're leaving this school.

448
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,280
I'll find you a better one.

449
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,560
Le.

450
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:38,920
Alright?

451
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,880
I want to

452
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,480
hear your decision.

453
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,040
I'll go to school tomorrow
and handle it myself.

454
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,120
Then I'll take you tomorrow.

455
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,120
Is he asleep?

456
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,560
Honestly,

457
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,280
I don't know what to do.

458
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,360
You don't need to worry so much.

459
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,840
Let me

460
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,840
try to handle it tomorrow.

461
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,240
How do you plan to do it?

462
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,040
I want to handle it
the way his mom would.

463
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,200
You also think we should use money?

464
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,560
No.

465
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,760
I think a mom

466
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,720
wouldn't care as much
about who was right or wrong.

467
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,920
The most important thing would be

468
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,040
not wanting her child to suffer.

469
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,360
Even though I've never been a mom,

470
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,640
I imagine that's how it would be.

471
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,120
Then I...

472
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,280
Really, I...

473
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,680
Thank...

474
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,240
If I really want to
express my gratitude...

475
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,040
Then I'll think of

476
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,440
another way.

477
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,440
Any word from that car owner?

478
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,840
Not yet. I haven't received a callback.

479
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

480
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,640
Bye.

481
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,560
Okay. Bye.

482
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,840
Just stop right here.

483
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,720
Bye.

484
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Check if you've got everything.

485
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,280
I've got it all.

486
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,760
Then give me your lunchbox.

487
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,880
Let's just pretend you forgot
your lunchbox today, alright?

488
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,440
Why?

489
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,800
You'll know.

490
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,600
Go on in.

491
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I'll bring the lunchbox to you later.

492
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,800
Alright.

493
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,880
Bye.

494
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,560
Bye.

495
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,680
Be careful. Watch for cars.

496
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,680
Bye.

497
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,440
Good morning.

498
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,600
Yang Zihuan.

499
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,560
Another paper ball.

500
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,160
Look.

501
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,240
Feng Lexuan!

502
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,800
Your parent is here to see you.

503
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,520
What's up?

504
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,760
Who's that?

505
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,080
Is that his aunt?

506
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,640
Or his...?

507
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,680
Don't be so forgetful next time.

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,920
Feng Lexuan's mom is so pretty.

509
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,400
Make sure you eat a good lunch.

510
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,240
Feng Lexuan's mom?

511
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,800
I... I don't know.

512
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,760
So you'll have energy.

513
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,360
Okay.

514
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Go on. Back to your seat.

515
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,520
Bye.

516
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,120
Bye.

517
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,880
He does have a mom.

518
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,200
Shut up.

519
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,840
Yeah.

520
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,880
What's she doing here?

521
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,360
Okay.

522
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,320
Everyone, open your books.

523
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,040
She brought me lunch.

524
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,720
She brought him lunch.

525
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,240
Turn to page forty-five.

526
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,600
Preview the lesson on your own.

527
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,040
Hello.

528
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,120
You are...?

529
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,800
Hello, I'm Feng Lexuan's parent.

530
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,040
I'm dropping something off for him.

531
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,400
I'd like to

532
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,640
take a moment of your time.

533
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,760
Okay.

534
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,880
Hello.

535
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
I'm a parent

536
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,080
of a student in Class 2, Grade 6
at this school.

537
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,960
On March 21st, during lunch break,

538
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,120
the children were playing
near the basketball court.

539
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,160
A conflict may have occurred.

540
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,120
The children involved received demerits.

541
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
Please forgive my abruptness.

542
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,920
I noticed your car was parked

543
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,640
facing the incident location.

544
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,440
Your dashcam might have recorded

545
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,640
what actually happened.

546
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,920
As a parent,

547
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,440
I'd like to understand
the actual situation

548
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,640
to properly

549
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,160
guide my child.

550
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,520
I sincerely hope you can help

551
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,440
by providing the dashcam footage.

552
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,520
Thank you.

553
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Mrs. Ren,

554
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,680
I understand how you must feel.

555
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,800
What happened yesterday
was certainly our fault.

556
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,120
I sincerely want to

557
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,400
apologize to you.

558
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,240
If

559
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,600
you have any requests,
please feel free to state them.

560
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,880
We will do our best to accommodate them.

561
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
What do you mean?

562
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,400
You think you can just hit someone
and then offer a sweet?

563
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's not what I mean.

564
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm saying

565
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,000
we will

566
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,160
cover your child's medical
and treatment expenses.

567
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,320
This is a small gesture from our family.

568
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Family?

569
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,920
My son said

570
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,520
Feng Lexuan is
from a single-parent family.

571
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,080
Who are you?

572
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,920
Ms. Hu,

573
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,000
the impact of a child's
family background is significant.

574
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,480
An irresponsible father

575
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,000
letting a stepmother handle things?

576
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,360
No wonder the child
is always causing trouble.

577
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,000
So

578
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
the school's emphasis
on "home-school unity"

579
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,520
makes perfect sense.

580
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,200
Ms. Hu,

581
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,760
if we're talking about facts,

582
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
I have something to show everyone.

583
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,280
What are you doing?

584
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,040
The truth is now clear.

585
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,760
On behalf of the school,

586
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,280
I apologize to Feng Lexuan,

587
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,440
Duan Xiyan,

588
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
and Yang Zihuan.

589
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,080
You did nothing wrong.

590
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,240
On the contrary,

591
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,040
Feng Lexuan, Duan Xiyan,
you stood up for a student

592
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,360
being bullied.

593
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
You were very brave.

594
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,800
The principal said

595
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,440
you will receive certificates
of commendation

596
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,560
at the flag-raising ceremony on Monday.

597
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,280
And,

598
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,560
Ren Zhexi, Liu Zixin, Fu Yiwei,

599
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,480
you three

600
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,160
bullied others

601
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,360
and told lies.

602
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,160
You will each receive a major demerit.

603
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,440
In addition,

604
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,120
you are placed on probation.

605
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
If there's a next time,

606
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,520
you will be expelled!

607
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,640
Is that clear?

608
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,240
Alright. Let's begin class.

609
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,160
That was satisfying.

610
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,040
Turn your math books
to page twenty-three.

611
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,160
Dad,

612
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,760
let me use this to toast you.

613
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,760
On behalf of my classmates,
I thank you for helping clear our names.

614
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,920
You're welcome.

615
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,600
To your courage in standing up

616
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,280
for what's right.

617
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,920
Thank you, Grandma.

618
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,080
But next time you encounter
such a situation,

619
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,760
you need to learn
to protect yourself first.

620
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,440
Right.

621
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,960
Dad,

622
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,200
did you sign me up

623
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,120
for the free combat class yet?

624
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,880
Are you serious about this?

625
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,280
Maybe we should
think about it some more.

626
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,560
Dad,

627
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,800
do you know how my classmates
praised you?

628
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,560
How?

629
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,320
"Feng Lexuan, your dad is super cool,

630
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,240
inside and out."

631
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,040
Alright.

632
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,000
I'll sign you up
for the free combat class.

633
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,800
Do you know
who you should be most thankful to?

634
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,200
It's Ms. Wen.

635
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,920
She went to plead your case

636
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,000
with that child's mother.

637
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,400
Ms. Wen,

638
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,240
you must have had to endure a lot.

639
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,600
No.

640
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,520
Not at all.

641
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,200
It's

642
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,760
thanks to your dad finding the evidence.

643
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,720
Let me propose another toast
to both of you.

644
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,520
Okay.

645
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,600
Let's do it together.

646
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,200
Grandma,

647
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,880
is there anyone else I need to toast?

648
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,160
Can we eat now?

649
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,680
Alright. Let's eat.

650
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,040
Today,

651
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,880
[9th Grade Model Airplane Competition]
we grandly hold the preliminary round

652
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,260
of the 9th School-Wide
Model Airplane Competition

653
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,920
on the spring campus sports field.

654
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,520
[Waiting Area]
It aims to foster connection,

655
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,520
promote our friendship,

656
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,840
and thereby encourage the healthy
and vibrant development

657
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,880
of our model airplane endeavors.

658
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,120
Finally,

659
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,760
we wish all participants

660
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,560
outstanding results.

661
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,120
And we wish this competition
a complete success!

662
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,600
[Audience Area]

663
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,200
The competition is about to
officially begin!

664
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,400
Come on!

665
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,320
Let's have some louder cheers, alright?

666
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:37,400
Go for it!

667
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,240
Contestant number twelve,

668
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,840
Feng Lexuan!

669
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,760
Let's hear some cheers for them!

670
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,120
Come on!

671
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:04,000
Go for it!

672
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,840
I'll surpass you.

673
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,720
Contestants, please take a short break.

674
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,240
Go for it!

675
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,160
Now we'll announce the results.

676
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,760
Third place goes to

677
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,800
Xue Xiaofan!

678
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,040
Second place

679
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,680
goes to Feng Lexuan's team!

680
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,000
Their time is 30.11 seconds!

681
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,320
Now we'll announce...

682
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,000
We came in second.

683
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,360
I wanted first place.

684
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
Let's see who got first.

685
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,160
Ren Zhexi's team!

686
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,880
Their time is

687
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,160
29.05 seconds!

688
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,600
Congratulations!

689
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,680
Not good enough.

690
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,240
Go home and practice more.

691
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,400
You can ask me if you have

692
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,720
any questions.

693
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,200
Ms. Tan.

694
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,480
Okay. Bye, Madam.

695
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,800
Qu Zhen?

696
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,200
What are you doing sitting here?

697
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,880
Ms. Tan, how were my moves just now?

698
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,080
You're stretching by yourself here?

699
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,840
Hip opening and leg stretches
are fundamental skills.

700
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,440
You should practice them properly.

701
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,360
But

702
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,280
there's one thing

703
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,880
you need to pay attention to
when stretching.

704
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,600
Your hips must be aligned correctly.

705
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,520
Many people don't notice that.

706
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,360
Before my mom left,

707
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,400
I promised her I would practice hard.

708
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,640
Keep it up.

709
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,080
Should we get her shoes one size larger?

710
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,400
Sure.

711
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,240
Big feet.

712
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,480
And this color, please.

713
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,720
Get her two more pairs

714
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,520
of the genuine leather ones too.

715
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,640
Two pairs, one size larger.

716
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,200
Okay.

717
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,040
Welcome to come again.

718
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,320
Okay.

719
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,920
Thank you.

720
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,200
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

721
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,160
Keep dancing well.

722
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,360
This doesn't make sense.

723
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,440
How could they win?

724
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,800
You're still thinking about that?

725
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,040
Wasn't it just for fun?

726
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,080
Grandma, it's not just for fun.

727
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,440
A model airplane competition
is a science-based competition.

728
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,480
And it's not that I'm afraid
of losing or that I'm unhappy.

729
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,000
I just don't understand

730
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,400
why Ren Zhexi's team

731
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,320
ended up taking first place.

732
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,640
Ren Zhexi and his friends
had never built model aircraft before.

733
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,360
They suddenly decided to
enter this competition

734
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,120
and ended up taking first place.

735
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,800
It's just too strange.

736
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,680
Hello?

737
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
Feng Lexuan, major intel.

738
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,680
What intel?

739
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,200
I just heard from Ji Sen in Class 3

740
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
that Ren Zhexi's team

741
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,760
didn't even build
their model airplane themselves.

742
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,480
They didn't build it themselves?

743
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,360
Right. They say they bought it.

744
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,840
Seems they spent a lot of money on it.

745
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,680
What's the conclusion?

746
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,800
Their model airplane

747
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,080
wasn't built by them at all.

748
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,640
They bought it.

749
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,040
Are you allowed to buy it?

750
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,760
They bought it secretly.

751
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,960
The teachers didn't know.

752
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,040
I knew it.

753
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
The three of them?

754
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,160
Pigs might fly.

755
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,440
How could they?

756
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,640
You don't need to wear
your old shoes anymore.

757
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,680
From now on, you can practice
in these new ones.

758
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,040
Great.

759
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
The weather is nice today, isn't it?

760
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,440
Ms. Zhuang.

761
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,000
Ms. Zhuang.

762
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,400
Qu Zhen, you went to buy shoes?

763
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,200
Yes.

764
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,320
Look, Ms. Tan picked them for me.

765
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,760
She said they're
special soft-soled shoes for dancing.

766
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,200
What brings you here?

767
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,560
Mr. Wang said he's your friend.

768
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,120
He sponsored our school today.

769
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,520
I told Ms. Zhuang

770
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,240
it was because of you

771
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,040
that I learned
about this wonderful school.

772
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,200
Actually, I've always admired ballet,

773
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,120
and I've always hoped
to do something for it.

774
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,440
So thank you, Ms. Zhuang,

775
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,400
for giving me this opportunity.

776
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,480
On behalf of our students,

777
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,280
I thank you for your generosity.

778
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,440
You're too kind.

779
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,600
So you're Qu Zhen?

780
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,360
Yes.

781
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,200
I heard from Ms. Zhuang

782
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,680
that you're the first Tibetan girl

783
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,960
at the school to learn ballet.

784
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,680
Nice to meet you.

785
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,520
Nice to meet you too.

786
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,160
Ms. Zhuang,

787
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,240
may I invite Ms. Tan and Qu Zhen

788
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,120
for a meal?

789
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I should be the one inviting you.

790
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,480
You've made
such a big contribution to our school.

791
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,280
Right?

792
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,680
Ms. Zhuang,

793
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,600
please join us.

794
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,760
I won't go.

795
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,480
You go ahead.

796
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,000
I have several students to meet.

797
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,560
Do you need my help?

798
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,320
No need.

799
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,440
There are plenty of other teachers.

800
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,640
Besides,

801
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,360
properly thanking Mr. Wang on my behalf

802
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,560
is the most important thing.

803
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,840
Alright.

804
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,680
Go ahead.

805
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,440
Celebrate for Qu Zhen.

806
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,840
What should we eat?

807
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,440
Let's have pizza.

808
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Is that place still open?

809
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,920
I've only seen pizza in magazines.

810
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,120
I've never tried it.

811
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,640
What does it taste like?

812
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,800
You'll know once you try it.

813
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,480
Let's go.

814
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,400
Yes, those two in the front.

815
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,240
Add one more of that thing in front.

816
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,880
Are you sure?

817
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,560
That...

818
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,160
Kids!

819
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,120
Take it.

820
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,560
Grandma.

821
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,560
Here.

822
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,080
Well?

823
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,840
What do you think?

824
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,720
Look at the quality, Yang Zihuan.

825
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,640
Look.

826
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,520
It's not even on our level.

827
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,080
Can we beat them?

828
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,320
Seems like it's imported.

829
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Let me see!

830
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,600
Hurry!

831
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,280
Look.

832
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,560
Grandma,

833
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,960
where did you get this?

834
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,280
I had it specially made for you.

835
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,600
Will

836
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,800
this work?

837
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,960
I had a designer

838
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,160
from the Aerospace Academy
make this for you.

839
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,120
Beating them won't be a problem at all.

840
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,760
No.

841
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,840
The competition

842
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,640
is about building
the model airplanes ourselves.

843
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,520
Is it?

844
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,080
But you're just

845
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,800
giving us such a high-end one.

846
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,040
It's obvious the three of us
didn't make it ourselves.

847
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,480
Yeah.

848
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
That's a bit like cheating.

849
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,560
But it's already bought.

850
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,560
Wouldn't it be a waste not to use it?

851
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,320
They bought theirs,

852
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,840
but we have to make ours.

853
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,800
How is that fair?

854
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,760
They bought theirs,
so we should buy one too.

855
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,200
And we have to beat them!

856
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,000
Teach those rotten kids a lesson.

857
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,720
Right?

858
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,880
But...

859
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,200
That makes sense.

860
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,240
Right?

861
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,600
Madam, you're amazing.

862
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,760
This time,

863
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,920
we'll really teach Ren Zhexi a lesson.

864
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,360
Look.

865
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,040
It's so well made.

866
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,400
See?

867
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,720
Is it good?

868
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,760
Qu Zhen,

869
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
where is your hometown?

870
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,800
My hometown is

871
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,400
Amu Township in Hongyuan County.

872
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,120
You can see
the sacred mountains from there.

873
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,400
It's very, very beautiful.

874
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,080
There are also many lakes.

875
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,520
Yaks often pass by our village.

876
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,520
It sounds beautiful.

877
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,360
Being so far away,

878
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,200
do you miss home?

879
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,000
Of course I do.

880
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,240
When I saw my mom off this morning,

881
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,320
I saw tears in her eyes.

882
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,920
This is the first time my mom
and I have been apart.

883
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,520
I grew up by her side.

884
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
For me, the hardest thing
about coming here

885
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,120
to learn ballet
is being separated from my mom.

886
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,440
Then you must study hard,

887
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,280
so you can go back
and dance for them someday.

888
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,240
You just need to

889
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,440
dance your own ballet.

890
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,240
As long as

891
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,480
you feel free

892
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,080
and happy

893
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,760
while dancing ballet,

894
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,960
that's enough.

895
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,600
Okay, Ms. Tan.

896
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,200
Ms. Tan,

897
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,800
do you think I'm too old for ballet?

898
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,680
Can I dance my own ballet?

899
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,280
Stop joking around.

900
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,960
Yuan, just eat.

901
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
Mr. Wang, you like Ms. Tan.

902
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,560
You little rascal!

903
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Don't call me Mr. Wang.

904
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,640
Call me Uncle Wang.

905
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,400
There's a proverb from where I'm from.

906
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,720
"In life, there are only two things:

907
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,600
happiness and sorrow."

908
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,000
"One is spoken aloud,

909
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,640
the other is kept in the heart."

912
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,320
Uncle Wang, if you like Ms. Tan,

913
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,240
you should say it bravely.

914
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,560
You little one, you know quite a lot.

915
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Don't talk nonsense.

916
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,440
It's not suitable to talk while eating.

917
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:23,720
Here.

918
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,440
Try this.

919
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,480
It'll get cold soon.

[An Interview with Wang Hongyuan]

922
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,640
Sir.

923
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,760
Here is the information

924
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,360
on the wineries participating
in this red wine selection.

925
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,280
So many excellent wineries
are participating in the selection.

926
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,920
Where is Cygne's brand advantage?

927
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,480
The winner's wine

928
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,960
will become the official wine
for the City Expo.

929
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,280
That's why

930
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,120
so many wineries are participating.

931
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,360
Since we just won
the gold medal in France,

932
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,400
our brand recognition

933
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,720
is relatively higher

934
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,360
than most of our competitors.

935
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,160
And our taste profile
is fresher than theirs.

936
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,280
The only one
that can really compete with us

937
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,920
is probably Huacan.

938
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,160
Their grapes

939
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,560
come from the same region as ours.

940
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,480
There isn't much difference

941
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,760
from raw materials to craftsmanship.

942
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,800
The difference is

943
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,880
that our red wine targets

944
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,320
a younger

945
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,360
demographic.

946
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,760
So our design

947
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,400
needs to be bolder

948
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,560
and more avant-garde.

949
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,520
That's how we
differentiate ourselves from Huacan.

950
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,680
But

951
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,600
Huacan also launched

952
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,560
two youth-oriented wines last quarter.

953
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,560
They directly target our products.

954
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,720
Are they already on the market?

955
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,680
They're available in offline stores now.

956
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,440
Okay.

957
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,560
Have Hao buy some.

958
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,640
I'll do a comparison.

959
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,560
Got it.

960
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,640
Also,

961
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,200
has the marketing design

962
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,480
for the offline stores been updated?

963
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,880
Don't worry.

964
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,480
It's already been updated
as you requested.

965
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,200
I'll send it to your email later.

966
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,120
Alright.

967
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,840
That's all.

968
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,560
Okay.

969
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,440
You may go.

970
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

971
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,120
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

972
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,320
Bye.

973
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,200
So your grandma

974
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,320
had a really powerful airplane
made for you guys?

975
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,440
Dad,

976
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,680
I've been really conflicted about this.

977
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,040
Competitions should be fair and square.

978
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,280
Winning with a fake

979
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,680
is worse than losing fairly.

980
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,680
But Ren Zhexi and the others
are really annoying.

981
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,600
Did you see how smug they were
during practice?

982
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,800
Acting like the championship
was definitely theirs.

983
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,960
So you really want to beat them?

984
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,920
Of course.

985
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,720
And you plan to use the airplane
your grandma gave you?

986
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,880
I haven't decided yet.

987
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,040
But Tudou and Yang Zihuan

988
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,360
are already over the moon.

989
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,360
They also think we should use

990
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,400
Grandma's awesome airplane
to teach them a lesson.

991
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,200
I can understand that.

992
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,400
I was thinking,

993
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,200
we don't necessarily have to
use a bought one to beat them.

994
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,320
Then what do we use?

995
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,280
Have you forgotten

996
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,800
what your dad studied in college?

997
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,280
Right.

998
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,400
You can guide me then.

999
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,960
That'll be a piece of cake.

1000
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,000
No problem.

1001
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,440
But, Le,

1002
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,760
next time

1003
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,080
if your grandma
does something like this,

1004
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,000
you need to firmly refuse her, alright?

1005
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,800
No problem.

1006
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,080
But, Dad,

1007
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,400
you're not going to argue
with Grandma again, are you?

1008
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,600
No, I won't.

1009
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,600
Oh no.

1010
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,960
You will argue.

1011
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,160
It's not arguing.

1012
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,440
It's because both your grandma
and I love you.

1013
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,480
We just show it in different ways.

1014
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,040
So it's inevitable we'll have

1015
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,680
some disagreements
about your upbringing.

1016
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,760
That's all.

1017
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,760
Okay.

1018
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,320
Then later, you should

1019
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,280
talk to Grandma

1020
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,680
gently and calmly.

1021
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,360
Gently and calmly? Like this?

1022
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,400
"Grandma,

1023
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,080
I...

1024
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,200
I love you."

1025
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,520
"I

1026
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,440
really

1027
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,480
don't..."

1028
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,280
Alright.

1029
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,400
We've been talking and forgot to eat.

1030
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,920
But if I talk like that,

1031
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,920
your grandma definitely won't hear me.

1032
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,520
The food is getting cold.

1033
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,120
Hurry up.

1034
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,760
