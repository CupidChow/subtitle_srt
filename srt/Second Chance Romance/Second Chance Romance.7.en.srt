look for opportunities to try again.

97
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,100

to keep you by my side forever.

99
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,660
I raised you to become

the person you want to be.

111
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,940
Fine then.

112
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
We have nothing left to say.

113
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,860

117
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,820
I'm not.

118
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,580

What do you think?

125
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,180
Is the back a bit too revealing?

126
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,940
Not at all. It looks beautiful.

127
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,140
It really does look nice.

128
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,060
We'll have some new arrivals
in a few days.

129
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,340
You're welcome to come back

130
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,860
and try them if you have time.

131
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,220
Sure.

132
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,180
So that's the story.

133
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,700
I didn't expect her

134
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,980
to come back so suddenly.

135
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,780
Wow, man.

136
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,900
You've been carrying a torch
for over a decade.

137
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,380
You're really hung up on her.

138
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,980
You absolutely have to end up together,

139
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,100
just like these two.

140
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,900
But

141
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,140
you didn't even tell me
about something this big.

142
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,540
You really don't treat me like a friend.

143
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,740
Did you confess your feelings to her?

144
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,220
She doesn't see me that way.

145
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,060
That's normal.

146
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,300
Take Jiao, for example.

147
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,900
She wasn't into me at first either.

148
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,860
But

149
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,620
I was persistent. I never gave up.

150
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,220
So

151
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,020
she married me right after college.

152
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,540
So you need to confess now.

153
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,300
I know,

154
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,860
you're afraid

155
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,620
if you say it,
you two won't be friends anymore.

156
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
I'm not trying to be harsh,

157
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,660
but you're really bad at this stuff.

158
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,300
You have to know,

00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,940

what your preferred

168
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,220
wedding decoration styles are like.

169
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,860
We have traditional
Chinese banquet style.

170
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,780
And also Western garden style.

171
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,500
And

172
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,060
you can choose

173
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
based on the style

174
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,580
of your attire.

175
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,780
Which one is better,
Chinese or Western style?

176
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,860
I'm not sure.

177
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,060
Which do you like?

178
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,540
I've actually been torn.

179
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,820
Personally, I prefer Western style.

180
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
I love the idea of walking

181
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,620
under a floral archway
in the wedding dress

182
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,180
with the blue sky and white clouds.

183
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,820
But I also think

184
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,140
Rui's parents

185
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,340
and mine

186
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,380
might prefer

187
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,300
a more traditional banquet.

188
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,780
Ms. Tan, what do you think?

189
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,700

somewhere nearby,

211

All these years

582
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,700
of hard work

583
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,020
have been for this moment, right?

Injured?

585
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,060

Your back.

Your meniscus.

589
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,620
We've all been through the grind.

590
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,100
Never missed a single class.

591
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,180
And she's the one?

592
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,140
She's the one acting like a princess?

593
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,500
Then she shouldn't have come to school!

594
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,380
She shouldn't have taken up dance!

595
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,940
Enough!

596
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,540
She just has to rest, is that it?

597
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,420
Well, now look.

598
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,380
The parents think

599
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,500
we're mistreating the students!

600
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,060
They don't even let them attend class!

601
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,860
You didn't sleep well, did you?

602
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,100
I'm sorry.

603
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,220
Character determines destiny.

604
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,620
That's just Ms. Guan's personality.

605
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,260
And this is yours.

606
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,580
There's no right or wrong.

607
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,940
Don't feel pressured.

608
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,500
Besides,

609
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,980
the issue with Zheng Yufan

610
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,100
isn't your fault,

611
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,540
nor is it Ms. Guan's.

612
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,220
It lies with herself.

613
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,100
I've been teaching students
my whole life.

614
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,860
I know what children are thinking.

615
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,740
Let her face it herself.

616
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,620
Everyone has to face their own life.

617
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,420
Should I not have come back?

618
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,820
I thought after all these years,
so many things

619
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,300
were in the past.

620
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,660
But they're not.

621
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,180
Ting,

622
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,700
you've been my student
since you were seven.

623
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,660
I watched you grow up.

624
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,460
I'm very happy you're back.

625
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,100
I believe in you.

626
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,100
Don't rush to resolve

627
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,540
certain obsessions.

628
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,780
You'll let them go gradually in time.

629
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,540
Believe in yourself.

630
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,540
I'm eating this.

631
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,700
None for you.

632
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,540
Le, you're here.

633
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,420
We're back!

634
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,900
Great-grandpa!

635
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,780
Great-grandpa!

636
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,820
My boy.

637
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,500
It's been so long
since you last visited me.

638
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,300
Let me see if you've gained any weight.

639
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,700
I haven't gained weight.

640
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,020
Grandpa, you look a bit thinner.

641
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,300
That's from missing you.

642
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,860
You must be starving.

643
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,020
Of course.

644
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,380
Grandma said yesterday we were coming
to Great-grandpa's.

645
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,100
So I didn't eat breakfast this morning.

646
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,260
I came on an empty stomach.

647
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,420
I thought Great-grandpa would
have lots of delicious food ready

648
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:53,900
for me.

649
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,500
Absolutely.

650
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,660
Dinner will be ready soon.

651
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,620
All the good food is for you.

652
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,180
Thank you, Great-grandpa.

653
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,460
You won first place
in the model airplane competition?

654
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,500
I have a gift for you.

655
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,260
Really?

656
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,260
Come here.

657
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,700
It's so big.

658
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,580
It's backwards.

659
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:15,900
Thirsty?

660
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
Let me get you some water.

661
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:17,820
Okay.

662
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,660
Dad,

663
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,780
Tan Siting is back.

664
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,940
It seems she's not dancing anymore.

665
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,940
She's teaching.

666
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,260
Somehow,

667
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,500
she's at the same school as Yan now.

668
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,860
They always run into each other.

669
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,340
If she's back, fine then.

670
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,180
So many years have passed.

671
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,620
It probably won't amount to anything.

672
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,860
I think she came back with an agenda.

673
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,820
She keeps finding ways
to get close to Rui and Yan.

674
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,300
She's even getting involved
in their wedding plans.

675
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,340
With all this back and forth,

676
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,140
who knows what might happen.

677
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,220
Every time I see her,

678
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,500
I'm reminded of Haotian.

679
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,660
I can't stand her

680
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,860
hovering around.

681
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,180
And I don't think it's good for Le.

682
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,220
They were young and reckless back then.

683
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,900
Now they're adults.

684
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,180
Let them handle their own affairs.

685
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,740
I don't really

686
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,220
understand this.

687
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,180
You don't have to. I do.

688
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,580
Look how happy Le is.

689
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,740
That's what matters.

690
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,580
The black one goes with the gray one.

691
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,580
Like this.

692
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,740
Let me see.

693
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
Such a thick book.

694
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,740
Le,

695
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,820
text me when you get home.

696
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,500
Next time you come,
I'll take you fishing.

697
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,300
Bye.

698
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,900
Bye, Grandpa.

699
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,380
Bye.

700
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,660
Is Tan Siting back?

701
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,980
Should I

702
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,380
pick up Le from school every day?

703
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,140
No need.

704
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,020
Don't worry about it.

705
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,900
Bye, Grandpa.

706
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,660
[Cygne]

707
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,300
Hello, everyone.

708
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,460
I'm the PR manager

709
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,860
responsible
for the Cygne brand promotion.

710
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,420
For this meeting,

711
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,460
let's first discuss
the specific promotion plan.

712
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,340
The earliest written records about wine

713
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,460
actually date back
to Emperor Wu of Han's reign.

714
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,140
According to Sima Qian's
"Records of the Grand Historian",

715
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,420
the envoy of the Han Dynasty,
Zhang Qian,

716
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,020
brought grape cultivation

717
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,420
and brewing techniques

718
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,340
from the Western Regions, located in
today's Hexi Corridor, Gansu region,

719
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,900
back to the Central Plains.

720
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,740
So, wine at that time

721
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,460
was a delicacy

722
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,340
enjoyed by the imperial family
and high-ranking officials.

723
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,140
You see,

724
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,020
the history of Chinese wine

725
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,620
is very long.

726
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,180
Yes.

727
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,700
Right.

728
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,340
And our winery currently has

729
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,780
the top-tier brewing techniques
in the country.

730
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,620
We have our own vineyard

731
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,260
in Hongyuan County, Sichuan.

732
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,300
This year we have three

733
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,340
new varieties.

734
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,660
Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir,

735
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,460
and Chardonnay.

736
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,820
The bottle you have
is the Cabernet Sauvignon.

737
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,700
Cabernet Sauvignon.

738
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,380
How's it?

739
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,380
This Cabernet Sauvignon

740
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,420
has classic aromas

741
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,260
of ripe dark berries

742
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,420
and sweet spices.

743
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,620
We aged it for sixteen months

744
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,740
in new 225-liter

745
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,580
French oak barrels.

746
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,900
The mouthfeel is excellent.

747
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,100
And the flavors are
very concentrated on the palate.

748
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,780
Last year, this wine

749
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,380
received a high score of 96 points

750
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,500
from Robert Parker.

751
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,340
Not bad.

752
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,820
Look, it has a ruby-like color.

753
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,580
Yes.

754
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,740
It seems

755
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,020
we don't need to
focus solely on foreign wines anymore.

756
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:52,700
Thank you.

757
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Domestic wines

758
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,220
are no worse than theirs.

759
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,540
Thank you.

760
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,900
We've always aimed to produce wines

761
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,460
that suit the domestic palate.

762
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,700
After all,

763
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,140
our dietary habits

764
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,540
and cooking methods are quite different
from those abroad.

765
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,220
So we've optimized the taste

766
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,940
based on different scenarios

767
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,740
where Chinese people enjoy wine.

768
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,140
We hope

769
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,180
our wines

770
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
will soon gain
international recognition.

771
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,300
Absolutely.

772
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,820
Yes, definitely.

773
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,380
With a brand like this,

774
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,020
our brand promotion

775
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,940
will be much easier.

776
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,700
The quality speaks for itself.

777
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,540
I believe Mr. Zhao now

778
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,940
has more ideas
for shooting this documentary.

779
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,980
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

780
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,180
I have

781
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,300
a deeper understanding of wine now.

782
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,700
Yes.

783
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,380
I look forward to seeing your work soon.

784
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,060
Hope it lives up to your expectations.

785
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:37,980
By the way, Mr. Feng,

786
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,780
what is Cygne's flagship product?

787
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,700
The flagship product?

788
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,060
That would undoubtedly be

789
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,660
our Cygne 2017.

790
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,060
The grapes that year

791
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,380
were exceptionally

792
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,900
high quality

793
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,780
due to

794
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,860
the unique terroir.

795
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,580
Its origin...

796
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,060
It's from the same region.

797
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,460
Isn't the altitude there very high?

798
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,300
Over 3,000 meters.

799
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,060
Because of that,

800
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,460
it gets ample sunlight and UV exposure,

801
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,300
and there's a significant
diurnal temperature variation.

802
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,660
Grapes grown in such an environment

803
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,060
are exceptionally high quality.

804
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,100
I am more confident in it now.

805
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,860
May our wine sell like hotcakes!

806
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:16,980
- Sell like hotcakes!
- Sell like hotcakes!

807
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,380
Thank you.

808
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,020
Cheers, everyone.

809
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,980
Thanks for all your brainstorming.

810
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,340
No problem.

811
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,300
When will the proposal be ready?

812
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,060
Soon.

813
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,540
Thank you.

814
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,860
Why are you so stubborn?

815
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,300
I've said I don't want to!
I don't like it!

816
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,660
Can you stop pushing me?

817
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,420
How am I pushing you?

818
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,900
I only want what's best for you.

819
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,340
That's all you ever say.

820
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,580
Ms. Tan.

821
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,340
Yufan.

822
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,420
Hello, Madam.

823
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,980
Another teacher?

824
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,300
What are you...?

825
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,860
Mom, don't talk to Ms. Tan like that.

826
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:49,780
It's alright.

827
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,820
I came to see how Yufan's foot

828
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,060
is doing.

829
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,900
Come on in.

830
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,460
Come in.

831
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,540
Ms. Tan,

832
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,220
please have a seat.

833
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:03,860
Thank you.

834
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,060
Let me get you some water.

835
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:05,740
Thank you.

836
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Ms. Guan yesterday, and Ms. Tan today.

837
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,820
Tag-teaming to fight me for my daughter?

838
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,820
Madam,

839
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
I just wanted to

840
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,260
check on Yufan's foot.

841
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,780
There's no need for you

842
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,300
to worry about that.

843
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:23,780
Ms. Tan.

844
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,260
Thank you.

845
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,340
We won't be participating
in that competition anymore.

846
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,900
And we won't be attending classes

847
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,940
anymore either.

848
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,500
Yufan,

849
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,140
you don't want to go back to school?

850
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,940
I do want to go.

851
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,580
How was your trip to Australia?

852
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,260
Couldn't get used to the climate there.

853
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,340
It's better here.

854
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,260
Warm in winter, and cool in summer.

855
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,180
Purely a vacation?

856
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,180
Of course

857
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,180
I also

858
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,580
went to check out the wine scene.

859
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,460
Gained quite a lot of insight, actually.

860
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,820
There's

861
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,820
a large plantation in a suburb

862
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,860
about several dozen kilometers
from Melbourne.

863
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,700
Right next to it
are the winery and cellars.

864
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,300
They still use
ancient brewing techniques,

865
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,860
but the wine they produce

866
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,100
has a very unique taste.

867
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,660
I brought some back.

868
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,900
You can try it later.

869
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,900
This year I'm also
considering introducing

870
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,420
some new wine varieties

871
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,220
to meet domestic market demands.

872
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,340
Ms. Gao,

873
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,340
I think

874
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,700
it's time for Tianlu to start
producing and selling its own wine.

875
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,700
I think this winery

876
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,820
is a good opportunity.

877
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,380
If we successfully acquire
the Australian winery...

878
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,060
Jin,

879
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,860
I trust your judgment.

880
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,260
Forgive my bluntness,

881
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,700
but how much do you earn in a month?

882
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,420
I've heard about you from Fan before.

883
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,220
She said you're

884
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,300
the first Chinese principal dancer
in a French ballet troupe.

885
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Then you must be quite accomplished

886
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,420
in your field.

887
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,340
I don't know if you have

888
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,180
any side jobs or anything.

889
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,820
Combining everything,

890
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,060
what's your annual salary?

891
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,540
Let's be frank.

892
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,980
Actually, I haven't wanted Fan

893
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,500
to continue with ballet
for a long time now.

894
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,220
First, because she

895
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,860
gets injured endlessly.

896
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,980
It pains me to see it.

897
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,100
Second, because

898
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,180
it's really not a promising career.

899
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,100
I don't mean anything else by it.

900
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,660
I'm just using you as an example.

901
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,460
Look at you.

902
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,580
You're so capable and talented.

903
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,540
Yet you retired so young.

904
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,540
Once you step off that stage,

905
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,260
the audience forgets you quickly.

906
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,660
Even if Fan makes it internationally

907
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,300
like you did,

908
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,500
and becomes a principal dancer,

909
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,380
how long can she actually dance?

910
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,060
Eight, ten years?

911
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,540
I really can't bear

912
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,740
to let her rely
on such a short-lived career.

913
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,780
Madam,

914
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,460
I understand

915
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,780
how you feel.

916
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,740
True.

917
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,140
Ballet is very demanding,

918
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,140
and the career span is relatively short.

919
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,980
But if you

920
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,140
get the chance to perform

921
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,380
on the world's biggest stages,

922
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,460
the sense of achievement and happiness

923
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,300
is something you never forget.

924
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,500
I'm just an ordinary person.

925
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,060
I don't have such high aspirations.

926
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,340
You talk about feelings and sensations,

927
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,740
but I just don't get it.

928
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,540
Our initial idea was very simple.

929
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,100
We just sent her to learn dancing.

930
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,340
We thought a girl

931
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,860
learning dance would have
a good figure and poise.

932
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,900
Just doing it as a hobby was fine.

933
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,420
We didn't expect her
to become so obsessed with it.

934
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,140
In the early years,

935
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,860
it was fine.

936
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,780
Her dad and I could do our utmost

937
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,620
to nurture

938
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,260
and support her.

939
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,020
But now we can't.

940
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,180
She's older.

941
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,180
She needs to think about her future.

942
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
So we've decided to

943
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,140
have her switch to acting.

944
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,540
Mom,

945
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,660
I told you I don't like it!

946
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,820
What do you mean?

947
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,660
What people seek in life

948
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,740
is a job that provides a living.

949
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,020
You know ballet is a dead end,

950
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,260
yet you still insist
on going down that path?

951
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,420
I just don't want you

952
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,180
to waste your best years

953
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,300
entirely on ballet

954
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,500
and find yourself with nothing

955
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,700
when you're older!

956
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,900
What will you do then?

957
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,820
You can only rely on marriage
to change your fate.

958
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,300
So why can't we find a job

959
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,300
early on

960
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,260
that allows us to live a better life?

961
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,500
I don't care about any of that.

962
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,620
You're still young.
You don't understand.

963
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,420
If you stubbornly stick to this path,

964
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,540
when you reach my age

965
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,180
and think back
on what I'm telling you today,

966
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,140
you'll regret it, and it'll be too late!

967
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,300
Anyway, I won't go learn acting,

968
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,220
film any shows,

969
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,380
or attend any acting classes!

970
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,100
That won't do.

971
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,620
If you're going into acting,

972
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,100
you absolutely need a

973
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,980
a professional teacher
to guide you in the beginning.

974
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,660
Don't worry.

975
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,220
I'll hire a good tutor for you.

976
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,900
This time we'll get a female teacher.

977
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,780
Mom!

978
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,940
Stop talking back!

979
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,620
Your dad and I
have already decided this!

980
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,220
This is non-negotiable!

981
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,220
I'm not going to any acting class!

982
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,420
Why are you so stubborn?

983
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,180
Have you been brainwashed?

984
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,380
I'm her mom.

985
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,540
I'm the one in this world

986
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,260
who most wants her to be happy.

987
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,420
You are not responsible for her life.

988
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,300
So please

989
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,580
don't use your own dreams to dictate

990
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,580
her life.

991
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,380
Qu Zhen?

992
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,260
I'll tell you a secret.

993
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,140
Ms. Tan hasn't been
in a good mood lately.

994
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,700
What happened?

995
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,940
Tell me about it.

996
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:18,940
Shuhan.

997
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,420
Bao, are you heading out?

998
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,340
I made some food. Want to eat together?

999
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,220
I won't join you guys today.

1000
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,980
I really envy Yuan

1001
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,900
for having
such a caring sister like you.

1002
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,020
Not like me.

1003
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,660
I have to worry
about a whole big family.

1004
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,860
I need to go home and cook now.

1005
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,980
You're so sweet. You envy me?

1006
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,140
I envy you.

1007
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,940
You got married

1008
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,980
and had kids so young.

1009
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:38,860
Him?

1010
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,780
No signs of progress at all.

1011
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,220
Don't worry.

1012
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,340
I think there's hope this time.

1013
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,940
Is he seeing someone?

1014
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,740
Yes. I heard his first love

1015
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,060
recently returned to the country.

1016
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,500
He didn't even tell me

1017
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,460
until I asked him.

1018
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,740
Seriously.

1019
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,740
If he had told me earlier,

1020
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,260
I might have helped him
solve it long ago.

1021
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,180
Shuhan,

1022
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,660
did you know about this person?

1023
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,540
No way.

1024
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,020
He didn't even tell you?

1025
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,140
But I think
he's really serious this time.

1026
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,820
He even sponsored a large sum of money

1027
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,140
to that ballet school.

1028
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,540
I'm running late now.

1029
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,340
I have to go.

1030
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,460
Alright, go on.

1031
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,380
Let's catch up next time.

1032
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,860
Bye.

1033
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,100
Mr. Feng,

1034
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,940
you've won a gold medal

1035
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,780
at the French wine competition.

1036
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,820
This is truly remarkable

1037
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,060
for our domestic brand.

1038
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,620
You flatter me.

1039
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,980
I feel

1040
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,820
that ballet and wine are very close

1041
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,900
in their spiritual core.

1042
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,140
I hope to pair wine with ballet

1043
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,100
in the documentary.

1044
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,100
Using ballet as a metaphor for wine?

1045
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,180
That's novel.

1046
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,660
Yes.

1047
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,380
When he told me this idea,

1048
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,460
I thought it was excellent.

1049
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,260
Riding on the momentum of this award,

1050
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,860
plus our documentary,

1051
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:57,860
I believe

1052
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,780
it's a great promotional opportunity

1053
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,940
for the Cygne brand

1054
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,900
to sell well both domestically
and internationally.

1055
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,060
Yes.

1056
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,300
So how do you plan to present it?

1057
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,660
Actually,

1058
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,180
we want to make

1059
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,540
the high-cultural image of wine

1060
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,340
more accessible.

1061
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,620
Recently, a PR company approached me.

1062
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,620
They want to film a documentary

1063
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,340
about ballet at our school,

1064
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,220
hoping to let more people
understand ballet.

1065
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,180
That's a good thing.

1066
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,820
Madam,

1067
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,580
what do you need me to do?

1068
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,340
They want me to recommend a teacher

1069
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,300
to participate in the filming
of their documentary.

1070
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,620
I'd like to recommend you.

1071
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Ballet

1072
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,860
has always been seen

1073
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,460
as a very painful art form.

1074
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,140
People think it requires

1075
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,620
enduring pain and sacrifice
beyond what ordinary people

1076
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,980
can bear

1077
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,700
to persevere.

1078
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,540
But no one has ever truly understood

1079
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,100
the powerful inner strength

1080
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:58,780
that ballet

1081
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,340
can bring people.

1082
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,420
I think you're the most suitable person.

1083
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,700
This is also the reason

1084
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,980
you have never given up
on ballet all these years.

1085
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,060
Right?

1086
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,660
Changing the public's
fixed perception of ballet

1087
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,980
and letting more people
fall in love with it

1088
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,020
were my original intentions
for founding this school.

1089
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:22,820
Ting,

1090
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,100
I know

1091
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,820
you didn't want to be
in the public eye after retiring.

1092
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,260
It's okay.

1093
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,580
I understand.

1094
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,180
If you don't want to participate,
just tell me.

1095
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,020
Madam,

1096
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,860
I'll do it.

1097
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,780
Indeed.

1098
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,100
If we want more people to understand

1099
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,860
and recognize ballet,

1100
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,820
we need the power of media platforms.

1101
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,540
Just tell me what you need me to do.

1102
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,980
Great.

1103
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,300
Thank you, Ting.

1104
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,980
It's what I should do.
