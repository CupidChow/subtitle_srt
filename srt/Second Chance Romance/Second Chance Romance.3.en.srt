00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,700
Madam.

20
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,740
Yan, have a seat.

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,940
What brings you

22
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,580
here today?

23
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,780
You love coffee, right?

24
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,180
I had someone

25
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,340
specially bring this back for you.

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,340
Give it a try

27
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,100
and see if you like it.

28
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,340
This must be really good.

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,820
I can't go a day without it.

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,420
Thanks.

31
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,780
So, how are things with you two?

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,100

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,500

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,300
We are together.

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,540
Are you serious?

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,100
Yes, I am.

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,780
How did you convince him?

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,420
I didn't really say much.

40
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,900
I just said,

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,860
maybe we should give it a shot.

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,780

When did this happen?

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,580
Just yesterday.

Madam, you...

56
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,900
Why didn't you tell me
about such a big thing?

57
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,900
What thing?

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,620
You're still keeping it from me.

don't you think that's a bit too fast?

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Too fast? I think it's long overdue.

Listen, if you're too busy,

69
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,980
I can help with some
of the arrangements.

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,980
Don't bother.

Hurry up, you two.

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,540
Alright.

75
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,260
Great.

82
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,500
than before.

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm really happy.

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,140

You're my dad's friend.

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
We met at the pastry shop.

93
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,220
You have such a good memory.

94
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,220
Ma'am, hello.

95
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,460
Hello.

96
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,860
I'm Feng Lexuan.

97
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,380
So formal.

98
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,740
I'm Tan Siting.

99
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,420
You're a ballet dancer?

100
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,940
That's impressive.

101
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,860
Ms. Tan,

102
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,660
what does it feel like
to be on your toes?

103
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,580
Like this.

104
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,100
Give it a try.

105
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,380
It hurts.

106
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,940
That's exactly what it feels like.

107
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,860
You have to focus
your whole body's weight on one point.

108
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,500
It takes intense concentration.

109
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,100
But you mustn't practice

110
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,380
on your toes at home casually.

111
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
You could easily sprain your ankle.

112
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,020
So if you really want to learn...

113
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,740
Ms. Tan.

114
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,580
Ms. Wen.

115
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,780
Why are you still here?

116
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,260
Don't you have another class?

117
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:06,940
Yes.

118
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,460
Get going. Don't be late.

119
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,780
Bye.

120
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,540
Bye.

121
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,460
So, how are you settling in

122
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,020
since you just got here?

123
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,780
Pretty good.

124
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,700
The kids here are really serious
about learning.

125
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,500
They even review
on their own after class.

126
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,540
I'm a complete novice

127
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,460
when it comes to ballet.

128
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,660
I only found out from the other teachers

129
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,300
that you were

130
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,940
the principal dancer of Cupid Ballet.

131
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,980
It's really nothing.

132
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,260
Now that I've retired, teaching kids

133
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,700
brings me a lot of joy.

134
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,820
But we're truly delighted to have you.

135
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,380
Having a master like you join

136
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,260
makes a qualitative difference

137
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,900
to any ballet company in the country.

138
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,780
You're too kind, Ms. Wen.

139
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,340
I find it very happy

140
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,300
to pass on what I've learned

141
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,620
to these children.

142
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,740
Ms. Tan,

143
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,660
do you have plans later?

144
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,460
No.

145
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,660
In that case,

146
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,820
let's have dinner together.

147
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,020
It'd be a good chance for me

148
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,980
to fill you in on things here.

149
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,020
And I'd also love

150
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,700
to get your advice on teaching.

151
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,220
Okay.

152
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,140
I'll go change first then.

153
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,620
Alright.

154
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,340
See you soon.

155
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:16,900
See you.

156
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,060
Ms. Tan,

157
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,980
see what you'd like to eat.

158
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,660
I'm fine with anything.

159
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,140
Just nothing with milk.

160
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,620
I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

161
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,860
I'll have this then.

162
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,740
The salmon.

163
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,540
Okay.

164
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,860
Thank you.

165
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,740
Thanks.

166
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,900
Then I'll have

167
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,420
a steak.

168
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,780
The steak.

169
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,620
And this one.

170
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,220
Okay.

171
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,140
That's all.

172
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:42,700
Thank you.

173
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,420
No problem.

174
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,580
I heard you lived abroad
for a long time?

175
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,620
Just came back recently?

176
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,340
I spent twelve years in France.

177
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,740
I hear France is a beautiful country.

178
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,580
I've always wanted to go there.

179
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,220
Maybe because I lived there so long,

180
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,180
I don't really notice that.

181
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,460
Well, if I ever

182
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,660
get the chance to visit France,

183
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,940
please give me recommendations
for good food and fun places.

184
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,980
Sure, no problem.

185
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,180
What made you decide

186
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,900
to come teach at our training center?

187
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,700
Mainly because I retired
from my company in France.

188
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,140
Then I returned to my mentor's school.

189
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,820
I wanted to help her

190
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,540
scout for

191
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,900
ballet talents here.

192
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,700
That's great.

193
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,620
How do you know Feng Rui?

194
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,020
You've known each other
for a long time, right?

195
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,020
We were each other's first love.

196
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,780
I'm joking.

197
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,980
Ms. Tan, you're so funny.

198
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,820
I almost thought
you were serious for a second.

199
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,380
You looked completely straight-faced.

200
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,180
Actually, we met

201
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,740
at a friend's party.

202
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,500
A friend introduced us.

203
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,540
But we didn't really keep in touch

204
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,900
during those twelve years I was away.

205
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,460
I see.

206
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,260
What about you two?

207
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,420
Have you been married long?

208
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,340
We...

209
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,300
Over here.

210
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,020
You're here.

211
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,540
Could you open this for me?

212
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,140
Of course, sir.

213
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Let it breathe.

214
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,460
Sure.

215
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,100
Is this a surprise?

216
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,420
You invited my old friend to dinner

217
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,300
without telling me.

218
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,340
We meet again.

219
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,220
I just didn't have time to tell you.

220
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,340
I ran into Ms. Tan by chance today,

221
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,180
so we arranged dinner on the spot.

222
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,020
I thought
since you two are good friends,

223
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,300
and now Ms. Tan and I are colleagues,

224
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,700
we should welcome her properly.

225
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,940
Yes, absolutely.

226
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,780
Peiyan is right.

227
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,420
We should have invited you to dinner.

228
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,940
That was my fault.

229
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,420
You're all being too kind.

230
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,580
What would you like to eat?

231
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,180
Have you ordered yet?

232
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,700
We have. Take a look.

233
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,140
Okay.

234
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,020
Let... Let me see.

235
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,660
I'm not sure what to get.

236
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,900
I'll have the steak.

237
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,580
I would've ordered for you.

238
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,380
Same as mine.

239
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
Alright.

240
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,780
One steak, please.

241
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,340
Okay.

242
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,860
Ms. Tan, were things smooth for you

243
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,940
all those years in France?

244
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,540
Everything was fine.

245
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,220
Just took some time
getting used to the food.

246
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,900
Right.

247
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,820
It's different for you artists.

248
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,140
You just need to focus on the art.

249
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,300
Not like us.

250
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,060
We're tied down by so many things.

251
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
We're not as free as you.

252
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,940
To become

253
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,980
a renowned dancer like Ms. Tan,

254
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,420
one must have to sacrifice a lot.

255
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,780
Actually, I find teaching children
quite comfortable.

256
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,820
It's something I've always

257
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,060
wanted to do.

258
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,660
Yeah.

259
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,300
I always thought

260
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,020
you aspired to bigger stages.

261
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
After all, dance means
everything to you.

262
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,500
I was thinking,

263
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,980
if I had even a fraction

264
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,740
of Ms. Tan's dedication and passion,

265
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,980
I might have become

266
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,820
a pianist myself.

267
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,700
Honestly,

268
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,220
all these years of persistence

269
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,380
weren't entirely by choice.

270
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,780
There were many times
it felt boring and tedious.

271
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,980
Oh, Rui, did you know?

272
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,380
Ms. Tan came to our training center

273
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,220
to help nurture more talents.

274
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,100
Mainly

275
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,020
to promote my mentor's school.

276
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,540
And to help her

277
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,700
scout for

278
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,700
more ballet talents.

279
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,740
And to train a few more artists

280
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,860
as accomplished as you.

281
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,220
I think

282
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,300
that's very possible.

283
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,820
There are many

284
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,020
promising young dancers here
with excellent potential.

285
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,300
Let's toast to Ms. Tan.

286
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:16,820
Okay.

287
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,700
Welcome back.

288
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,940
This red wine is from Rui's own winery.

289
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,980
How is it?

290
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,580
I know.

291
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,260
Mr. Feng gave me two bottles last time.

292
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,500
I think

293
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,260
its flavor beats
a lot of local French red wines.

294
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,820
Ms. Tan, you gave

295
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,780
such a high praise for our wine.

296
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,660
I'm honored.

297
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,540
Are you seeing anyone?

298
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,460
I've been single.

299
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,020
Guess...

300
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,340
I've gotten used to
being on my own over the years.

301
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,300
I heard

302
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,500
French men are quite romantic.

303
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,540
Why didn't you find one there?

304
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,300
Romantic, indeed.

305
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,660
But maybe it just didn't suit me.

306
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,140
Not like you two, a perfect couple.

307
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,100
You've been together
for many years, right?

308
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:17,980
Yes.

309
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,420
We...

310
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,500
We've been together a long time.

311
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Just haven't had the wedding yet.

312
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,500
But

313
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,980
we're planning it now.

314
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,180
It'll be soon.

315
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,220
Then I should propose a toast to you.

316
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,700
Here.

317
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,740
Wishing you everlasting happiness.

318
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,420
Thank you.

319
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,700
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

320
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,100
Okay.

321
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,700
Want me to come with you?

322
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:53,980
No need.

323
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,820
You two catch up.

324
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,580
Okay.

325
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,780
So, you're good friends now?

326
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,580
Not

327
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,260
exactly.

328
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,820
But Ms. Wen is nice.

329
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,020
I didn't know
you were coming today.

330
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,500
If you feel too awkward,

331
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,900
I can make an excuse

332
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,140
and leave soon.

333
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,820
It's fine.

334
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,700
Ms. Wen loves you very much.

335
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,940
She is very good.

336
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,020
Le.

337
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,340
Wash your hands.

338
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,900
What are you doing?

339
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,980
I'm practicing

340
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,300
how to stand on my toes.

341
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,260
I saw the girls in ballet class

342
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,460
do it so easily.

343
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,860
You're a boy.
Why are you practicing this?

344
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,100
Stop fooling around.

345
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,500
You sound just like

346
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,460
that teacher I met.

347
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
What's wrong with being a boy?

348
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,300
There are male ballet dancers too.

349
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,820
You're just being old-fashioned.

350
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,780
I don't like ballet anyway.

351
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,900
And I don't think
it's that nice to watch.

352
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
What teacher...

353
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,100
did you say you met?

354
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,980
A new teacher at the training center.

355
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,620
She's really pretty.

356
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,260
I heard from classmates

357
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,180
that she's

358
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,500
a famous dancer.

359
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,340
She comes off as...

360
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,540
Hard to describe,
but she feels very friendly.

361
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,460

Hot pot with beer.

384
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,580

Is it okay?

415
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,580
Definitely.
The food here is always good.

416
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,740
Ms. Tan, is the food to your liking?

417
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,420
It's great.

418
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,380
Good, right?

419
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:20,980
Careful.

420
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,660
Okay.

421
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,260
Rui, let's

422
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,180
take Ms. Tan home later.

423
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,540
Don't bother.

424
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,020
Sure.

425
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,820
It's fine. I've already called a cab.

426
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,300
No problem. We can share a ride.

427
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,660
It's on the way.

428
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,300
Don't bother.

429
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,260
The driver is almost here.

430
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,140
Then send me

431
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,500
Ms. Tan's WeChat info later.

432
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,500
I... I don't have it.

433
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:44,860
You...

434
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,580
Twelve years.

435
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,260
Right.

436
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,780
Makes sense.
WeChat didn't exist back then.

437
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,420
Exactly.

438
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,220
Well, perfect timing.

439
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,460
Let's add each other today.

440
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:53,620
Okay.

441
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,260
We'll scan your QR code.

442
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,180

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,740
Text us when you get home.

446
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,380
Sure.

447
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,620
Drive safely.

448
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,220
Got a designated driver?

449
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,100
Yes.

450
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:13,980
The cab is here.

451
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,580
Right.

452
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,580
The cab's here. I'm off.

453
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,300
Okay. Bye.

454
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,740
Bye.

455
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,980
Let's go, sir.

456
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,900
Bye.

457
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,420
The signal here is terrible.

458
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,060
It's a last-minute dinner
with Ms. Tan today.

459
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,500
Didn't have time to tell you.

460
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,900
It's fine.

461
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,820
But none of the teachers
at our training center

462
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,620
expected her to join us.

463
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,780
After all, she's such
an established dance star.

464
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:43,900
Yeah.

465
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,900
Who knows what she was thinking.

466
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,020
But it was nice
to meet up and have a meal.

467
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,700
So you two were first loves?

468
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,220
When I was chatting with her earlier,

469
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,220
I asked how you met,

470
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,580
and she said

471
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,980
you were each other's first love.

472
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,540
And she said it
with a completely straight face.

473
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,820
It really threw me for a loop.

474
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
Later she said

475
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,700
she was just joking.

476
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,220
Ms. Tan

477
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,980
has always been quite humorous.

478
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,060
You're acting

479
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,620
a bit strange today.

480
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,980
What's wrong?

481
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,900
Why did you suddenly
bring up the wedding?

482
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:38,860
Nothing.

483
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,860
We're in this relationship...

484
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,900
with marriage in mind, right?

485
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,500
It's normal.

486
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,380
It's not that... I just felt...

487
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,260
it's a bit sudden.

488
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,100
But you looked pretty cool

489
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,820
when you said it.

492
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,580
but I

493
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,700
prefer my own one.

494
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
Come to my place after class tonight.

495
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,980
Ms. Wen is making the best pasta

496
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,180
and fresh beef meatballs

497
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,180
for me tonight.

498
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,780
Your stepmom is so good to you.

499
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,180
My real mom

500
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,940
never asks what I want to eat or do.

501
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,980
She just nags about studying
and homework.

502
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,460
Nag, nag, nag all day long.

503
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,420
It's driving me crazy.

504
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,500
Tudou, you're really flexing, huh?

505
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,180
Only because we're close

506
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,340
would I not punch you for saying that.

507
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,060
You've known her since first grade.

508
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,980
Why didn't you get her
as your stepmom sooner?

509
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,060
Like it's up to me.

510
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,660
It depends on my dad.

511
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,380
You wouldn't get it.

512
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,660
Let's get to the basketball court.

513
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,460
It'll be full soon.

514
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:35,900
Let's go.

515
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,780
Why did you tell on us to the teacher?

516
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:40,940
Say something.

517
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,780
Aren't you the top student in our grade?

518
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,420
Cat got your tongue?

519
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,140
Exactly.

520
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,260
You copied homework.

521
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,060
That is wrong.

522
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,860
When did you see us copying homework?

523
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,460
Right.

524
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,300
Did we copy?

525
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,620
What are you doing?

526
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,460
What, you're scared?

527
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,980
Just pretend you didn't see anything.

528
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,820
Ren Zhexi's family is really tough.

529
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,940
His dad is like a mob boss.

530
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,020
I don't dare mess with them.

531
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,700
You should just drop it too.

532
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,500
We can't take them.

533
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:10,940
Let's go.

534
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,140
Let's go get that pasta.

535
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,020
I forgot to tell you.

536
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
My dad is tough too!

538
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,300
For this Food and Drinks Fair,

539
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,020
I'm planning to organize
a professional masterclass.

540
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,660
For the masterclass,

541
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,300
I'm thinking of inviting Mark

542
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,060
to be the lead instructor.

543
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,020
How many people do you want to invite?

544
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,300
Mark is great. Perfect.

545
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,700
Give me a rough estimate.

546
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,260
Hold on a second.

547
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,020
Okay.

548
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,740
Hello, Ms. Hu.

549
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,980
Did you come to school to fight?

550
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Why were you fighting?

551
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,060
What happened?

552
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,540
You...?

553
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,420
Ms. Hu.

554
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,420
What happened with Feng Lexuan?

555
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,220
Fighting.

556
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,900
Ren Zhexi!

557
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,260
What is wrong?

558
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,980
They were bullying Yang Zihuan.

559
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,660
And Yang Zihuan...

560
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,620
You hit us first,

561
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,460
and you think you're in the right?

562
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,100
How can you say that?

563
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Who was bullying him?

564
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,060
It was the three of you
ganging up on us!

565
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,620
Ren Zhexi!

566
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,620
Enough!

567
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:17,820
Shut up.

568
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Ren Zhexi, have you been
bullying other students?

569
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,380
No, Dad.

570
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,300
Say that again!

571
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,020
Ms. Hu,

572
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,660
is there any evidence that Ren Zhexi
was bullying other students?

573
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,180
The spot where the fight happened
isn't covered by surveillance cameras.

574
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,380
So it's just a one-sided story then.

575
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,940
They are all one-sided stories then.

576
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Alright, everyone.

577
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,540
Now that we're all here,

578
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,500
I'll tell you

579
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,980
the school's preliminary decision.

580
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,220
Each of you will write
a 600-word reflection

581
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,260
and receive a major demerit.

582
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,860
Madam,

583
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,260
why do we have to write reflections too?

584
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,460
They were the ones bullying Yang Zihuan.

585
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,060
We saw it and went to stop them.

586
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,740
Is that wrong?

587
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,180
You're writing reflections

588
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,860
because you fought at school.

589
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,140
As for your claim

590
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,860
that Ren Zhexi bullied Yang Zihuan,

591
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,820
we have no evidence.

592
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,860
I want you all to go home

593
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,060
and seriously reflect

594
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,740
on your mistakes.

595
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,700
Hand in your reflections to me
first thing tomorrow morning.

596
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,700
Understood?

597
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,820
Understood.

598
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,340
Alright. You can all go home now.

599
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,500
Dad,

600
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,740
why?

601
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,220
They were the ones bullying Yang Zihuan.

602
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,780
We went over to stop them.

603
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,620
And now we're the ones in the wrong?

604
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,260
It's not fair!

605
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,220
Why are we being punished too?

606
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,820
Look at you.

607
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,460
Where did the fight happen?

608
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,740
Up ahead. I'll take you there.

609
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,420
Okay.

610
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,900
You fought right here?

611
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,620
Yes.

612
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,740
Dad,

613
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,900
you believe me, right?

614
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,020
Of course.

615
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,660
Alright. Let's go home.

616
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,540
Let's go.

617
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,380
Today

618
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,820
marks the fifth anniversary
of Tianlu's listing.

619
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,900
A big day.

620
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,140
For these five years,

621
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,740
everyone has been diligent
and dedicated.

622
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,660
I've seen all your contributions

623
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,340
to Tianlu.

624
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,500
In the next five years,

625
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,540
we will aim even higher.

626
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,580
Alright.

627
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,260
I have some good news to share.

628
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,860
Mr. Jin, please.

629
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,660
After a unanimous board vote,

630
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,460
we've decided to acquire

631
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,180
Soler Winery,

632
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,860
located in the southeastern suburbs

633
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,060
of Melbourne, Australia.

634
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
This truly allows us

635
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,260
to produce and sell our own wine.

636
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,980
- Great!
- Great.

637
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:43,900
That's good.

638
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,180
This is just a small step

639
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
in Tianlu's next five-year plan.

640
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,540
Exploring this business model

641
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,620
means

642
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,420
Tianlu's future holds
many possibilities.

643
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,220
Good.

644
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,180
Here.

645
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,460
Ms. Han,

646
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,220
arrange for everyone

647
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,340
to get a bottle of Soler's

648
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,020
Cabernet Sauvignon dry red wine

649
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,220
as a reward today.

650
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,580
Got it, Ms. Gao.

651
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,220
- Thank you, Ms. Gao.
- Thank you, Ms. Gao!

652
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,700
Thank you, Ms. Gao.

653
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,140
Who's that?

654
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,380
Height, 145 cm.

655
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,980
Let's measure your shoulder width.

656
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,940
Chest out. Head up.

657
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,780
Okay.

658
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,700
Her neck condition looks average.

659
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,020
Ting, she's a bit nervous.

660
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,140
Shoulder width, 37 cm.

661
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,420
Arm length, 66 cm.

662
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,060
Let's measure your arm span.

663
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,580
Hands.

664
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,060
142 cm.

665
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,540
Very good.

666
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
She shows promise.

667
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,340
Qu Zhen.

668
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
Can you show us

669
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,740
some moves you can do?

670
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,100
Nice.

671
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,700
Madam.

672
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,380
You live very far away.

673
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,700
You probably
don't know much about ballet.

674
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,140
How did you hear about our school?

675
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,420
My... My Mandarin isn't very good.

676
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,460
My mom's Mandarin isn't very good.

677
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,260
But in our village,

678
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,540
everyone says my Mandarin
is the most standard.

679
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,580
It's okay. Take your time.

680
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,620
We can understand you.

681
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,500
This is the first time my mom and I

682
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,460
have left the mountains.

683
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,220
We took the train, bus,

684
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,780
and subway.

685
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,580
All for the first time.

686
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,420
On the way here,

687
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,780
I saw so many cars.

688
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,060
Even more than the cows
and sheep back home.

689
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,220
So how did you

690
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,340
and your mom hear about us?

691
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,380
Old Sir told us.

692
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,700
He even paid for our trip here.

693
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,340
Old Sir is our...

694
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,380
Qu Zhen,

695
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,180
explain to the teachers

696
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,780
who Old Sir is.

697
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,860
Old Sir is an elder from our village.

698
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,860
He knows many things and has seen much.

699
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,740
He's the one who told me about ballet.

700
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,060
So you've never
learned ballet before, right?

701
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:15,900
Then...

702
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,420
Do you know what ballet is?

703
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,100
It's dancing.

704
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,100
It's different
from the dancing back home.

705
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,740
I'm not sure why I want to learn it.

706
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,540
Old Sir has some ballet magazines.

707
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,340
I tried to copy the people
in the pictures, standing on my toes.

708
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,220
When I stretch my arms and spin,

709
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,220
it feels so free.

710
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,620
It makes me happy. Old Sir is happy too.

711
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,780
That's wonderful.

712
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,460
We all understand

713
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,860
Qu Zhen's situation now.

714
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,740
Come on.

715
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,340
Let's hear everyone's opinions.

716
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,860
The proportion is twelve.

717
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,660
Her height and leg length ratios
meet the requirements.

718
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
With no prior training,

719
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,300
she managed to get on demi-pointe

720
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,340
with her own ability

721
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,020
and held her balance briefly.

722
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
She does have good natural aptitude.

723
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
However, I still don't think

724
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,460
she meets our admission standards.

725
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,940
There are plenty of children
with a bit of talent

726
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,780
like her.

727
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,220
Besides, she has
several significant shortcomings.

728
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,500
I agree with Ms. Guan.

729
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,980
The child is indeed a bit old.

730
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,060
She's already eleven.

731
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,140
That is a real shame.

732
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,060
Her arch isn't good either.

733
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,940
Her flexibility needs work too.

734
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,340
Fine for casual dancing.

735
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,140
But I doubt

736
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,620
she can make a career of it.

737
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,460
It's just too difficult.

738
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,620
I actually think this child

739
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,740
has a better feel

740
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,780
for ballet than most people.

741
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,740
What is the purpose of dance?

742
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,100
Must it always be about achievement?

743
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,460
Can't liking it, finding joy in it,
enjoying it

744
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,540
also be an achievement?

745
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,420
Dab it.

746
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,540
Slowly.

747
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,780
You need to clean the wound properly.

748
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,740
Why are you back so early today?

749
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,260
There was a bit of trouble at school.

750
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,620
I brought Le home first.

751
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,700
Trouble?

752
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,260
Bear with it.

753
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:00,740
Nothing serious.

754
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,460
What happened?

755
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,740
Nothing serious.

756
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,900
What happened?

757
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,780
It's nothing.

758
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,140
Just a minor incident.

759
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,140
What happened?

760
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,060
What's going on?

761
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,860
It's fine.

762
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,180
Just...

763
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,420
Some students had a conflict.

764
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,580
It's okay. I'll handle it.

765
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,780
Feng Lexuan,

766
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,700
tell me

767
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,700
what happened.

768
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,100
Speak.

769
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,500
Well,

770
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,260
those three repeaters in our class

771
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,420
were bullying Yang Zihuan.

772
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,940
Duan Xiyan and I couldn't just stand by.

773
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,140
So we went to help him.

774
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,780
They pushed me first.

775
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,700
That's why I fought back.

776
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,660
And then?

777
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,660
The teacher made us write reflections
and gave us a major demerit.

778
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,340
Write reflections and a major demerit?

779
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,420
That was the teacher's decision?

780
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,100
It's okay, Mom. It's just a scrape.

781
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,020
I'll take care of it.

782
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,380
You...

783
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:15,780
Step aside.

784
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,820
Let me see.

785
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,340
Look at this.

786
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,500
Ms. Tan,

787
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,860
you were the principal dancer
in a world-class troupe.

788
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,060
You've achieved great success.

789
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,420
Of course you can say that.

790
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,620
But for most people

791
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,060
who choose ballet,

792
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,060
achieving results
is a very important part.

793
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,140
It represents

794
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,340
the reward for all their hard work.

795
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,980
Tamara Rojo.

796
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,580
I believe you all know her.

797
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,220
She became the principal dancer

798
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,900
at Royal Ballet at twenty-three.

799
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,580
She's one of those youngest
principal dancers in the ballet world.

800
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,740
But compared with

801
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,660
other renowned ballet dancers globally,

802
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,620
her physical attributes weren't great.

803
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,980
Her body proportions aren't outstanding.

804
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,020
But she has exceptional stamina.

805
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,460
She can do highly technical ballet moves

806
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,460
and character portrayals.

807
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,220
That's why she's recognized

808
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,780
as a virtuoso of ballet technique.

809
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,660
She once said something.

810
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,100
Ballet is the fairest art.

811
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,780
You get

812
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,620
exactly what you put in.

813
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,500
So, are there truly fixed standards

814
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,300
for what makes an excellent dancer?

815
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,540
Some might have great physical gifts,

816
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,020
some superb technique,

817
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,900
others strong dramatic interpretation.

818
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
But I believe

819
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,900
this child has great physical potential.

820
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,180
If she dedicates herself deeply,

821
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,260
I'm sure

822
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,820
she will achieve something.

823
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,140
Aren't dreams
about believing in the impossible?

824
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,340
Well said.

825
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,060
A dream is about believing

826
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,220
in what seems impossible.

827
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,220
Our school

828
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,260
isn't just a place to learn ballet.

829
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,300
It's a place

830
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,220
where we strive to help children
realize their dreams.

831
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,820
That is our founding principle.

832
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,540
Alright. I've heard all your opinions.

833
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,940
I think Qu Zhen

834
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,900
is worth cultivating.

835
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,860
Her weaknesses are as apparent

836
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,060
as her strengths.

837
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,780
I also believe her strengths
outweigh her weaknesses.

838
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,260
Ms. Zhuang,

839
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,020
I believe our school

840
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,580
is a professional institution.

841
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,300
So let's follow the standard procedure.

842
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,860
I propose

843
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,860
Qu Zhen take the entrance exam tomorrow.

844
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,060
If she passes,

845
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,420
we'll accept her.

846
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,860
What does everyone think?

847
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,060
What are you going
to test her on tomorrow?

848
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,540
I won't make it
unfairly difficult for her.

849
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,620
I saw she can already

850
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,700
get up on demi-pointe.

851
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,740
But it was too brief

852
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,460
to assess properly.

853
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,420
Tomorrow,

854
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,580
if she can perform

855
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,220
all the required entrance exam moves

856
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,700
correctly and standardly,

857
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,260
holding each
for no less than one minute,

858
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,700
we'll consider her qualified.

859
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,020
Okay.

860
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,220
Alright.

861
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,620
It's settled then.

862
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:47,940
Done.

863
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,980
What's wrong?

864
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,100
Ms. Zhuang,

865
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,940
we won't be enrolling.

866
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,140
You don't even know our decision yet.

867
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,820
Why are you giving up now?

868
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,220
Qu Zhen.

869
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,220
We have no money.

870
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,060
Let's go.

871
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,060
My mom

872
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,660
saw the fee schedule.

873
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,060
The tuition is too expensive.

874
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,100
We won't be enrolling.

875
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,060
Don't worry about the tuition.

876
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,940
We offer financial aid.

877
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,980
If Qu Zhen works hard enough,

878
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,860
we can waive the tuition fees.

879
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,220
And

880
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,180
we have dormitories.

881
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,740
You can live here without any cost.

882
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,900
We can study here

883
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,100
without paying tuition.

884
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,340
Really?

885
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,180
Ms. Zhuang, can we really

886
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,140
study here

887
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,900
for free?

888
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,300
Yes.

889
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,380
Thank Ms. Zhuang now.

890
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,780
Thank you, Ms. Zhuang.

891
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Ms. Zhuang.

892
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,140
No problem.

893
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,700
But there is one condition.

894
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,820
What is it?

895
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,020
If you pass the exam tomorrow,

896
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,980
you can study here for free.

897
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,060
What's on the exam?

898
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,820
What dance moves can you do now?

899
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,340
How long can you hold them?

900
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,020
I don't know. I've never counted.

901
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,220
But they're probably not very standard.

902
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,700
I can give you

903
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
a special training session tonight.

904
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,100
You seem

905
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,580
preoccupied.

906
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,140
No.

907
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,340
Honestly,

908
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,100
I just said it offhand

909
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,540
that day.

910
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,220
If you've changed your mind,

911
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,820
there's still time.

912
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,020
How could I?

913
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,060
Have you told Le?

914
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,500
Tell Le?

915
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,940
About us.

916
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,500
Should we tell him?

917
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,020
I...

918
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,620
I haven't decided yet.

919
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,540
Maybe

920
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,780
we should

921
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,420
try things out first?

922
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,860
Sounds like you're the one
having a hard time with it.

923
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,180
I am having a hard time with it.

924
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,580
From now on, I'll be

925
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,820
a free piano teacher and nanny.

926
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,220
You're getting quite the deal.

927
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,140
Le will be so happy.

928
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,860
I hope he is happy too.

929
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,940
I'll come to your place often

930
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,580
to take care of him.

931
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,980
And

932
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,820
look after you too.

933
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,500
Do you like it?

934
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:52,980
Yes.

935
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,140
I loved it too

936
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,860
the first time I saw a dance studio

937
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,780
as a child.

938
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,700
Madam, can I really learn ballet here?

939
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,420
As long as you truly like it

940
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,740
and are willing, you can.

941
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,340
Alright.

942
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,260
You can stand like that

943
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,380
thanks to your natural

944
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,340
physical strength.

945
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,180
It's normal you can't hold it for long.

946
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,780
Because you haven't had
professional training.

947
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,980
When we practice

948
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,060
working on pointe,

949
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,420
we rely on the shoe's support

950
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,820
and strong ankle strength.

951
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
But don't worry.

952
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,940
This isn't on tomorrow's exam.

953
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,420
I can teach you something useful.

954
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,460
Some tips for the basic moves.

955
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,700
Okay, Madam.

956
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,620
They're easy to learn.

957
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,820
Place your hands on the barre.

958
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,260
Feet together.

959
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,020
Get up on demi-pointe.

960
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,100
Can you do it?

961
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,820
Get up.

962
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,140
Head up a little.

963
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,500
Shoulders down.

964
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,020
Heels pressing down.

965
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,260
Very good.

966
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,140
Hands back a bit.

967
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,900
That's good.

968
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,220
One, two, three, down.

969
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,060
Tired?

970
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,140
Take a break.

971
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,140
You should be fine

972
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,220
if you

973
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,260
do this tomorrow. Don't be nervous.

974
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,020
Ms. Tan, you're so kind to me.
Thank you.

975
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,660
I just want to protect
your original love for ballet.

976
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,540
Original love?

977
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,300
Old Sir said he hopes I can always dance

978
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,300
listening to the voice in my heart.

979
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,660
Is it the same meaning?

980
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,380
Pretty much.

981
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,780
I definitely will.

982
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,060
I love ballet the most.

983
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,380
Before I met Old Sir,

984
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,060
my favorite was the dancing
from back home.

985
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,420
After I met him,

986
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,100
ballet became my favorite.

987
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
I heard you say

988
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,940
Old Sir is an elder from your village.

989
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,100
People from my village

990
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,580
go to him with all their problems.

991
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,580
He's a very reliable person.

992
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,780
Ms. Tan, thank you so much.

993
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,620
Back home, we dance when we're happy.

994
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,020
And I'm very happy right now.

995
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,580
Can I dance?

996
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,500
Of course.

997
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,100
It's OK.

998
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,980
Did you get the phone number?

999
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,380
Hey!

1000
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,540
Want to learn about the Volleyball Club?

1001
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,300
Next one.

1002
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,380
Next one.

1003
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,460
Hello.

1004
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,860
It's you.

1005
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,340
The ride-sharing driver.

1006
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,180
I'm your savior
who found your dance shoes

1007
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,100
and saved your career.

1008
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,100
You know each other?

1009
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,900
The day of my Queen Ballet audition,

1010
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,780
he took a shortcut when driving me.

1011
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,660
If it weren't for him,

1012
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,700
I would have been finished.

1013
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,940
I remember you telling me that story.

1014
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,220
What a coincidence.

1015
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,940
You want to learn ballet?

1016
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,380
Just passing by.

1017
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,260
And I saw someone I know.

1018
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,180
Your savior.

1019
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,260
Want to sign up?

1020
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:37,940
Can I?

1021
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,540
I'm quite interested in ballet.

1022
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,940
Is that not allowed?

1023
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,340
Can I?

1024
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,460
Sure.

1025
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,500
Fill out this form.

1026
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,820
Tomorrow, 9 AM,

1027
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
at the ballet studio.

1028
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,420
But let's make it clear.

1029
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,540
I'm very strict.

1030
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,220
I'm afraid you might not keep up.

1031
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:55,820
No problem.

1032
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,340
I like being treated strictly.

1033
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,460
What are you doing?

1034
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,740
I'm... I'm practicing.

1035
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,980
Ouch, ouch!

1036
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,580
Practice a bit longer.

1037
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,220
No more. I'm done.

1038
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,220
Just practice a bit more.

1039
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,900
