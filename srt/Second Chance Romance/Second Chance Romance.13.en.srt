18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,940
[Episode 13]

19
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,540
Do you think Zheng Yufan
can win an award?

20
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,820
It seems unlikely.

21
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,570
I've seen her rehearse.

22
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,100
She's fallen at the same spot
several times.

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,540
It's been like this for days.

24
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,540
Wasn't she doing well before?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,820
Guess everyone has their limits.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,660
Increasing the difficulty

27
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,130
isn't necessarily a good thing.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,410
Let's go.

29
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,020
Go.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,130
Ms. Zhuang,

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,170
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,850
I want to drop out.

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,850
Ms. Tan,

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,570
you had such high hopes for me.

35
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,170
Sorry to disappoint you.

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,730
Yufan,

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,940
we all want what's best for you.

38
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,380
If you think it's harder

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,820
because I changed the piece,

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,130
I hope you can trust me.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,260
You can do this.

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,850
It's not about you.

43
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,380
It's my own problem.

44
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,380
Yufan,

45
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,690
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

46
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,170
But don't rush.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,060
We can solve any problem together.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,260
Don't try to talk me out of it,

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,730
Ms. Guan.

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,610
I've really made up my mind this time.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,170
Thank you

52
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,170
for all your care and support.

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,170
I've let you down.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,060
Sorry.

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,260
Yufan.

56
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,170
Ms. Guan.

57
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,940
Don't go after her. Let her go.

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,820
But Ms. Zhuang,

59
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,690
are we just letting her leave like this?

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,170
Yufan,

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,060
you dance so well.

62
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,290
Why are you quitting?

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,260
Do I dance well?

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,820
Qu Zhen,

65
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,500
you must keep dancing.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,820
I hope to see you on stage someday.

67
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,170
How nice.

68
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,940
Dancing makes you happy.

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,820
What's wrong?

70
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,570
You seem down.

71
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,260
No.

72
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,170
Work issues?

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,690
Oh my.

74
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,820
Be careful.

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,250
Slow down.

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,170
It smells amazing.

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,050
This is such a feast.

78
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,290
I had hot pot with you a few times.

79
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,700
I basically got

80
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,370
all your favorites here.

81
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,050
Go wash your hands.

82
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,610
Let's eat.

83
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,050
Tasty, right?

84
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,810
You still need to eat properly.

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,050
There's nothing

86
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,700
a hot pot meal can't fix.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,290
When we were kids,

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,170
I loved watching you eat.

89
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,460
Seeing you enjoy your food so much

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,930
always made me eat more too.

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,930
You've been talking
the whole time, hardly eating.

92
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,700
Let me get some for you...

93
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,930
Who is it?

94
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,580
Who?

95
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,930
Shuhan?

96
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,170
So you're here.

97
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,930
I wondered who was having hot pot here.

98
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,170
I could smell it from outside.

99
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,810
Here.

100
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,580
You didn't need to buy anything.

101
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,580
Our place has everything.

102
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,290
Our place?

103
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,700
This is Tan Siting's place.

104
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,170
Get her a seat.

105
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,050
There's enough food.

106
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,460
Even if there wasn't, I'd still eat.

107
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,290
Sit here.

108
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,810
Don't sit so close to her.

109
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,290
Might bump her foot later.

110
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,700
Here.

111
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,930
I haven't visited lately.

112
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,930
How is

113
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,580
your recovery?

114
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,580
It's good.

115
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,050
Just following the doctor's orders.

116
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,460
No discomfort now.

117
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,460
Just waiting to heal gradually.

118
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,170
Listen, a serious bone injury
needs a long time to heal.

119
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,810
Make sure you're recovered
before going back to school.

120
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,810
The school can wait.

121
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,580
No.

122
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,930
I still teach my students every day.

123
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,460
You know what?

124
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,290
It's pretty funny now.

125
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,930
I teach sitting in a chair

126
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,700
every day.

127
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,290
It makes me feel like a professor.

128
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,170
You are a professor.

129
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,540
You know, a girl at our school

130
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:53,930
asked,

131
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,290
"What does Mr. Wang do for a living?"

132
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,580
You know what I told her about Yuan?

133
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,290
What did you say?

134
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,050
I said he's in homemaking services.

135
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,170
He does look the part.

136
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,580
Siting, let me tell you,

137
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,460
my brother is like your brother.

138
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,930
If you need anything, just call him.

139
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,170
I know.

140
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,580
He's like a brother to me.

141
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,340
Wang Zeyuan,

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,410
let me ask you something.

143
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,020
If I

144
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,170
broke my leg one day,

145
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,170
would you take care of me like this too?

146
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,810
You're overthinking it.

147
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,290
Can we not talk
about such unlucky things?

148
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,700
But just to be clear,

149
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,930
if you really broke your leg,

150
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,810
I'd take care of you.

151
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,170
See?

152
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,340
That's what sisters are for.

153
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,930
And we're siblings.

154
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,930
You ungrateful brat.

155
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,290
Where's the meat?

156
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,170
Don't take that piece of meat.

157
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,810
It's overcooked.

158
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,050
I'll put in new ones for you.

159
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,460
I...

160
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,290
I can't eat this much anymore, Yuan.

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,780
I've definitely gained weight lately.

162
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,580
Should I get some for you too?

163
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,930
Don't bother.
I don't accept pity offerings.

164
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,930
But Tan Siting,

165
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:54,930
you should watch out.

166
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,290
You have gained a bit of weight.

167
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,700
I noticed as soon as I walked in,

168
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,290
I'm telling you.

169
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,340
She hasn't.

170
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,660
Don't overthink it.

171
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,580
I'm telling you,

172
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,410
after I recover,
I'll have gained weight for sure.

173
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,170
Yuan, I...

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,540
I bet I won't even fit
into my dresses anymore.

175
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,810
You look better with more weight.

176
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,050
Stop brainwashing her, okay?

177
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,540
She's a ballet dancer.

178
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,810
How can she dance if she gains weight?

179
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,050
Can she still do ballet
if she looks like me?

180
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,980
More like a bouncing bomb.

181
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,930
She could be the first.

182
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,930
Have a drink.

183
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,580
Can you drink?

184
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,170
Cheers.

185
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,290
Cheers.

186
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,170
To a speedy recovery.

187
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,930
Look at you, so pathetic.

188
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,290
I couldn't even drag you away.

189
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,810
Are you available later?

190
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,580
Why?

191
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,700
Nothing.
Have a couple of drinks with me.

192
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,050
I can keep you company.

193
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,170
But I won't drink.

194
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,290
Yuan,

195
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,440
have a drink with me.

196
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
If you want to talk

197
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,000
about Siting and me,

198
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,270
don't bother.

199
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,980
I'm not a minor.

200
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,930
I'll take responsibility
for my own actions.

201
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,700
And

202
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,540
if Mom, Dad, or you

203
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,410
disagree because of what some relatives

204
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,700
or neighbors think,

205
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,850
then please tell them

206
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,810
that we live our lives for ourselves.

207
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,780
Their idea of respectability

208
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,460
means nothing to me.

209
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,810
You're pretty clever, huh.

210
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,050
You knew I called you here to talk.

211
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,060
But that's not what I wanted to discuss.

212
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,060
I want to tell you

213
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,940
that a relationship
is between two people.

214
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,060
My opinion

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,940
and our parents' opinions

216
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,180
don't matter.

217
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,490
Your own happiness is what matters.

218
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,300
You don't believe me?

219
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,490
I know how you feel about Tan Siting.

220
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,940
And I know

221
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,370
you've liked her

222
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,420
since you were very young.

223
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,060
Right?

224
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,060
I did start liking Siting
a long time ago.

225
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,300
I like her independence.

226
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,370
I like her courage.

227
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,820
And I like how she gives her all

228
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,060
for her dreams.

229
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,060
Sometimes

230
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,940
I even feel like
I'm not good enough for her.

231
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,250
But other times

232
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,490
I feel we're quite alike.

233
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,420
Both are working hard

234
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,370
to create our own futures.

235
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,700
I understand

236
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,100
everything you're saying.

237
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,300
But let me ask you one thing.

238
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,060
Are you ready

239
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,820
to be a dad?

240
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,300
Tan Siting's child is alive.

241
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,300
It's the child

242
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,300
we thought died twelve years ago.

243
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,820
He's alive.

244
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,770
Feng Rui raised him.

245
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,890
And Tan Siting

246
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,340
went for a paternity test
a couple of days ago.

247
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,890
It is indeed her child

248
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,770
from twelve years ago.

249
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,850
When she told me about this,

250
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,770
I was as shocked as you are.

251
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,890
It's really funny.

252
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,890
Like something out of a TV drama.

253
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,420
So, regardless of your relationship,

254
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,060
are you ready to be a dad?

255
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,890
I'll say it again.

256
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,610
I don't care.

257
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,250
Yuan,

258
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,580
you're my brother.

259
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,490
Siting is my good friend.

260
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,420
I hope you both can be happy.

261
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,850
Anyway, I've told you now.

262
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,650
Be prepared.

263
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,860
Class is over.

264
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,540
Stand up.

265
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,060
Good.

266
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,260
Relax.

267
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,700
Yes.

268
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,460
Continue.

269
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,580
Watch your expression.

270
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,180
Good.

271
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,020
Put feeling into your hands.

272
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,900
Feet.

273
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,820
Untightened. Good.

274
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,140
Yes.

275
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Control.

276
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,060
Go.

277
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,220
I'm at Cabin Bar.

278
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,700

Why is everyone leaving?

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,380
Why did they all leave?

298
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,860
Going home.

299
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,700
Get me

300

Here.

302
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
Another case.

303
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,460
Hurry up.

304
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,860
No one came to drink.

305
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,740
Why isn't anyone replying?

306
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,700
Hello.

307
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,460
Sorry, but we're closing now.

308
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,380
Hello.

309
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,980
Wh... What?

310
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,540
We're closing now.

311
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,780
Closing?

312
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,380
Yes.

313
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,260
Okay.

314
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,740
I'll call a cab.

315
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,300
Alright.

316
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,460
I'll leave when the cab arrives.

317
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,540
Wait a moment.

318
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,980
98...

319
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,340
W?

320
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,980
W.

321
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,140

Yes, it's you!

329
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,100
Wait a moment.

Open up.

333
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,860
It's my ride.

334
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,620
My ride. 98W.

335
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,140
Let's go.

336
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,060
Stop rocking.

337
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,380
Sir.

338
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,100
Wait a moment.

339
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:33,900
Pull over.

340
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,100
Oh my god.

341
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,060
Rinse your mouth.

342
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,380
No.

343
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,700
Don't bother.

344
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
You drink it.

345
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
You drink it. Thanks.

346
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,380
Let's go.

347
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,340
Home.

348
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,860
Why do you look so familiar?

349
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,900
Were you in No.11 Middle School?

350
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,940
Yes.

351
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,100
I've seen you somewhere.

352
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,620
Let me think.

353
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,980
Where did I see you?

354
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,820
Did you play basketball?

355
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,460
Yes.

356
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,100
I knew it!

357
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,220
I knew you played basketball.

358
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,580
Let me think.

359
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,140
Where did I see you?

360
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,660
I remember now.

361
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,140
I went to watch you play basketball.

362
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,900
You used to play basketball often

363
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,620
at No.11 Middle School, right?

364
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,860
What's your name again?

365
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,580
Wu...

366
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,820
Wu Jian...?

367
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,020
Wu Yanzu?

368
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,580
Wu something Hao?

369
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,620
Wu Zuhao.

370
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,420
Yes! Wu Zuhao.

371
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,140
Right. Wu Zuhao.

372
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,900
Don't you remember me?

373
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,100
I'm Wang Shuhan.

374
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,620
I was pretty famous
at No.11 Middle School too, you know!

375
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,100
What a coincidence.

376
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,180
The legendary Wang Shuhan!

377
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,140
What a coincidence it is
to run into you here.

378
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,780
It really is a coincidence.

379
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,380
Yeah.

380
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,140
Well,

381
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,140
nice car.

382
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,180
A luxury car, right?

383
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Why are you driving a luxury car
as a driver?

384
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,220
No.

385
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,980
I'm quite busy with work during the day.

386
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,180
At night, I just like
to drive around to relax.

387
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,620
I take a ride or two while I'm at it.

388
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,460
I mainly enjoy chatting with people.

389
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,180
Talk about all sorts of things.
It's interesting.

390
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,140
This car is pretty spacious.

391
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,220
Fits a lot of people.

392
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,900
You drive a luxury car just to chat?

393
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,380
I like chatting too.

394
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,380
But I never expected it
to be such a coincidence.

395
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,620
We must have a good chat today.

396
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,820
You really don't remember me?

397
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,900
I'm Wang Shuhan.

398
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,580
I remember.

399
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,460
Right?

400
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,580
I knew you'd remember!

401
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,940
What a small world.

402
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,580
Guess we're quite fated.

403
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,380
Yes.

404
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,220
Fated.

405
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,220
Wu...

406
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,380
Wu Zuhao.

407
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,300
Wu Zuhao,

408
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,660
I told you we'd met somewhere before.

409
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,620
Quite a coincidence.

410
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,940
This car is comfortable to sit in.

411
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,580
Water.

412
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
I'm thirsty.

413
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,580
I want water.

414
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,580
Whose clothes?

415
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,100
Whose car is it?

416
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,940
The car I called.

417
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,460
Yes.

418
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,780
I called it myself.

419
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,580
Phone.

420
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,260
My phone.

421
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,180
Is the ride service this good now?

422
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,340
Good morning.

423
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,300
You're awake.

424
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,020
Yes.

425
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,020
Well...

426
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,180
You were sleeping so soundly.

427
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,340
I didn't have the heart to wake you.

428
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,580
Yes.

429
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,060
I just

430
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,780
checked my phone.

431
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,940
You turned off this service.

432
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,100
How do I pay the fare?

433
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,860
It's fine.

434
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,580
We had a great chat along the way.

435
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,020
Besides, we're classmates.

436
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Consider it me taking you for a spin.

437
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,820
As long as you're feeling better,
it's worth it.

438
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,300
Classmates?

439
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,460
But you should drink less in the future.

440
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,740
A girl drinking like that

441
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,060
isn't very safe.

442
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,060
I'll get going now.

443
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,180
Bye.

444
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:56,780
Bye.

445
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,820
Um,

446
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,060
can I

447
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,540
get your contact info?

448
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,780
I'll treat you to a meal.

449
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,220
Okay.

450
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,940
Got it.

451
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,220
Well... I'll head up now then.

452
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,380
I'm Wu Zuhao.

453
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,780
Okay.

454
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,580
Wu Zuhao, drive safely.

455
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,060
Bye.

456
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,700
Bye.

457
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,180
The matters in France
have been wrapped up.

458
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,580
They spoke very highly of Cygne.

459
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,940
Thanks to your help, Mr. Wang.

460
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,540
I told you before.

461
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,380
Definitely no problem.

462
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,220
So how do you plan to
thank me this time, Mr. Feng?

463
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,620
I must thank you properly.

464
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:46,980
By the way,

465
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,220
Cygne has a wine tasting in a few days.

466
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,820
You must attend.

467
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,420
Absolutely no problem.

468
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,300
Actually,

469
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,900
I have an urgent matter today.

470
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,580
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

471
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,900
Go on.

472
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,500
You remember Cai, right?

473
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:01,980
I know.

474
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,820
Cai.

475
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,700
He signed a new painter.

476
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,340
He invited me to the art exhibition.

477
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,260
Said he's invited successful friends

478
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,700
from various industries.

479
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,540
Something came up suddenly
on my end.

480
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,580
But I don't want to turn him down.

481
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,460
I was thinking,

482
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,220
in our industry,

483
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:15,900
there's only you

484
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,620
who fits the bill as a young talent.

485
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,260
So could you attend in my place?

486
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,500
I've already spoken to him.

487
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,620
I understand.

488
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Cai said

489
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,620
he's thrilled.

490
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,580
If you can go,

491
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,260
his exhibition will be elevated.

492
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
Now it's just
about scheduling your time.

493
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,780
With the mood set like this,

494
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,620
of course I must go.

495
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,180
That's wonderful.

496
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,060
By the way,

497
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,620
bring a plus one.

498
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,620
Okay. I'll be there on time.

499
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,900
Great.

500
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,740
Ms. Wen.

501
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,900
How are the concert preparations going?

502
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,100
Pretty smoothly.

503
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,060
We're going through the procedures.

504
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,020
Share the process with me
once it's finalized.

505
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,060
My classmate wants to organize one too.

506
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,740
No problem.

507
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,100
I'll let you know once it's done.

508
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,260
I'm so jealous.

509
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,540
You have both love and dreams
in your hands.

510
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,100
I need to take this call.

511
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,900
Hello?

512
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,580
Rui.

513

Good afternoon.

514
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,700
Hope you're well-rested.

515
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,220
Wanna grab some food together?

516
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,420
I'll pick you up later.

517
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,220
No rush.

518
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,900
Take your time getting ready.

519
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
I'm taking you
to a classic old restaurant.

520
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,340
[Shuhan]
Okay.

521
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,580
Morning.

522
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,260
Morning.

523
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,780
Get in.

524
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,540
Oh, okay.

525
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,020
Watch your head.

526
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,700
Thanks.

527
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,580
Seatbelt.

528
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,260
Yes. Seatbelt.

529
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,580
Did you sleep...?

530
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,700
Go on.

531
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,740
Nothing. I was just asking
if you slept well.

532
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,140
Pretty well. You?

533
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,540
Same here.

534
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,420
Where are we going?

535
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,100
It's a surprise.

536
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,140
You'll know when we get there.

537
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,500
What are you thinking about?

538
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,580
Nothing.

539
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,020
Are you thinking about Zheng?

540
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,220
With Qu Zhen as your little informant,

541
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,100
there's nothing at our school
you don't know.

542
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,340
Don't blame yourself.

543
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,820
I heard from Qu Zhen.

544
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,380
Zheng is quitting

545
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,060
because of family reasons.

546
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,060
It has nothing to do with you

547
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,900
changing her piece.

548
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,140
Don't feel guilty.

549
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,740
I'm not blaming myself.

550
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,340
It's just that sometimes

551
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,740
things don't develop the way you expect.

552
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,300
But I can't help her.

553
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,940
Sometimes I can't even help myself.

554
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,900
That's

555
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,220
serious mental exhaustion.

556
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,660
Success depends on one's own efforts.

557
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,220
Don't force yourself.

558
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,020
You need to learn to self-regulate.

559
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,660
Relax a bit.

always turn around at the right time.

00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,180
Look at this long line.

573
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,620
You'll know once you try it.

574
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,580
I come here to eat
whenever I feel unwell after drinking.

575
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,860
You just have to wait in line.

576
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,020
See what you'd like to eat.

577
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,340
It says side dishes are unlimited.

578
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,740
Yes.

579
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,300
You can keep adding noodles.

580
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,340
I'll have a spiced corned egg

581
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,460
and tofu skin.

582
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
Look over there, they have a
Noodle Champion Board.

583
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,620
Yeah.

584
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,260
My name is second place, look.

585
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,380
Really?

586
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,420
Nineteen bowls.

587
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,820
Here are your noodles.

588
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,420
Thanks.

589
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,340
Here.

590
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,100
Try it.

591
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,020
Is this their braised food?

592
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,340
Yes.

593
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,620
Another specialty
is the mashed potatoes.

594
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,380
It's coming soon.

595
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,020
So you come here often?

596
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,300
Sometimes I run around this area.

597
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,580
If I get hungry, I come here to eat.

598
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
You run too?

599
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,580
In the mornings.

600
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,020
Compared to you,

601
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,700
my life is probably just slacking off.

602
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,100
Everyone is different.

603
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,260
Sometimes I'd like to sleep in too.

604
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,100
But I can't.

605
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,100
Too much on your mind?

606
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,300
Eating this
will make your stomach feel better.

607
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,020
How is it?

608
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,660
It's really delicious.

609
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,260
Not bad, right?

610
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,740
I think I can have two bowls.

611
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,060
It's better with some chili.

612
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,340
But you've been drinking.
Have the spicy stuff next time.

613
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,260
You know how to take care of yourself.

614
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,580
You even know
not to eat spicy food after drinking.

615
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,340
Of course.

616
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,340
It would upset your stomach.

617
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,740
[Echoes of the Mind:
Modern Art Exhibition]

618
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,940
It's nice here.

619
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,740
Not bad.

620
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,220
Right?

621
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,780
There are stairs ahead.

622
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,020
Be careful.

623
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,380
I'm fine.

624
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:00,780
Can you do it?

625
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,700
I think so.

626
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,260
Let me try.

627
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:02,580
Okay.

628
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,460
Yeah, I can.

629
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,580
Bao should be up ahead.

630
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,580
Let's go check.

631
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,020
There are more stairs.

632
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,700
Are you really okay?

633
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,220
Yes.

634
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Let me help you.

635
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,740
Bao is right there.

636
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:16,780
Bao.

637
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,300
This is Tan Siting,

638
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,620
the one I often mention to you.

639
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,940
The artist.

640
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,340
I've heard so much about you.

641
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,580
Let me introduce myself.

642
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,580
I'm Bao Hanlin.

643
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,780
Just call me Bao.

644
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,780
Now that I've met you,
I finally understand

645
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,020
why Yuan has remained single

646
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,820
all these years.

647
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,020
Just shut up.

648
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,780
I often hear Yuan talk about you.

649
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,940
Pleasure to meet you.

650
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,340
Let me introduce you.

651
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,220
This is our star of the day,

652
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,780
the modernist painter Shi Jie.

653
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
Just call me Shitou.

654
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,060
This is my business partner,
Wang Zeyuan.

655
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,540
Hello.

656
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,100
Pleasure to meet you.

657
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:51,860
And this

658
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,260
is our national pride,

659
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,780
the Venus of the Parisian scene,

660
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,860
Ms. Tan Siting.

661
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,860
Is it because of my foot that you

662
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,380
describe me that way?

663
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,260
Venus has been armless for millennia.

664
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,340
I know of Tan Siting.

665
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,140
I've seen your performance
at the theater.

666
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:06,860
It was brilliant.

667
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,820
I was impressed.

668
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,020
I just never expected

669
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,780
the ballet goddess

670
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,420
to be standing before us like this.

671
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,260
And...

672
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,060
And I really like your paintings.

673
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,740
Especially "No One Shouts".

674
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,180
You actually like "No One Shouts"?

675
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,140
Thank you.

676
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,100
Arts are interconnected.

677
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,660
You're both artists, after all.

678
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:26,940
Shitou.

679
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,020
Come here for a moment.

680
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,500
Excuse me,

681
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,580
I need to attend to some guests.

682
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:30,780
No problem.

683
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,460
Make yourselves at home.

684
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,380
We'll catch up later.

685
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,620
This is really well put together.

686
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,420
Let me introduce you.

687
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,740
This is my wife, Jiao.

688
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,620
Hello.

689
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,540
Ms. Tan, hello.

690
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,460
I often

691
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,700
hear Bao talk about you.

692
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,420
I finally got to see you in person.

693
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,460
Hello.

694
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,660
How's work lately?

695
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:46,980
Busy?

696
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,260
It's okay. Not too busy.

697
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,340
You?

698
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,220
I'm alright too.

699
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,380
He's the busy one.

700
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,780
Once I get through this busy period...

701
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,460
Mr. Shi

702
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,580
always drinks your wine

703
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,460
when he's creating.

704
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,540
He's spoiled you, hasn't he?

705
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,300
Mr. Shi,

706
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,060
I've heard so much about you.

707
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,780
Hello.

708
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,340
I

709
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,420
am Feng Rui from Cygne Winery.

710
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,780
This is my...

711
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,900
I'm Wen Peiyan.

712
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,060
I've heard so much about you.

713
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:07,860
Rui.

714
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,460
Ms. Tan is here too.

715
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,740
Should we go say hello?

716
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,420
I never expected
to run into you here today,

717
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,300
Ms. Tan.

718
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,060
What a coincidence.

719
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,420
How's your foot?

720
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,220
Much better.

721
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,380
We didn't get the chance before.

722
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,220
Please introduce him to us today.

723
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,860
Right. I didn't introduce you last time.

724
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:29,860
This is Wang Zeyuan,

725
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,820
a good friend of mine.

726
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
He works in IT.

727
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,460
This is Ms. Wen Peiyan.

728
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,260
She's the piano teacher
at the training center.

729
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,380
No need for me to introduce Feng Rui.

730
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,380
He's Ms. Wen's fiancé.

731
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,140
The big day is coming soon.

732
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,100
Congratulations.

733
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,580
Thank you.

734
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,540
I heard from Ms. Wei

735
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,740
that it was thanks to

736
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,940
your protection that day.

737
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,780
Otherwise, things could go really bad.

738
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,020
I really should thank him.

739
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,540
Lately,

740
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,380
he's been driving me around

741
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,300
and cooking for me.

742
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,780
I'm just worried
that after my foot heals,

743
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,260
I might have gained over ten pounds.

744
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,100
You can lose the weight
after you gain it.

745
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,180
Looks like you all know each other.

746
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,300
The Six Degrees of Separation is real.

747
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,100
It just shows how small

748
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,820
the world is.

749
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,660
Since everyone's here,

750
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,660
let me make a recommendation.

751
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,380
If you're interested
in Mr. Shi's paintings,

752
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,260
you can contact me.

753
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,380
If

754
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,060
you're interested in collecting wine,

755
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,100
look for Mr. Feng Rui.

756
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:23,660
Maybe

757
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,460
I'll visit your winery
to taste some wine some time, Mr. Feng.

758
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,620
Thank you.

759
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,140
No One Shouts.

760
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,460
It looks quite oppressive.

761
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,660
People and things in the world

762
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
can be replicated
within certain dimensions.

763
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,860
If you accept such a world,

764
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,420
you acknowledge your inner desires

765
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,340
and your own insignificance.

766
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,820
Then you won't let yourself
sink deep into the mire.

767
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,460
So "No One Shouts"

768
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,860
isn't about oppression.
It should be about release.

769
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
The same painting

770
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,620
can mean different things
to different people.

771
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,420
But your interpretation
is quite unique, Ms. Tan.

772
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,420
I just had a sudden insight.

773
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,460
Ms. Tan, which one are you?

774
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,100
Oppressed or released?

775
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
Neither.

776
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,780
I'm an observer.

777
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,660
Observing from the outside.

778
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,700
Mr. Feng,

779
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
lately, no matter

780
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,660
where Siting and I go,

781
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,820
we seem to run into you.

782
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,300
What a coincidence.

783
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,380
By the way,

784
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,340
I remember your family used to

785
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,740
import wine when we were young.

786
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,620
Never expected you

787
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,660
to start making your own wine now.

788
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,180
This is the wine
produced by Cygne Winery.

789
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,580
How is it?

790
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,740
You made this?

791
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,380
Smooth

792
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,380
and crisp.

793
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,020
Quite tasty.

794
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,060
It seems

795
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,420
you always make the right choices.

796
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,740
Both in career

797
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,180
and in life.

798
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,420
Wishing you happiness in your marriage.

799
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,820
These recent encounters

800
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,540
were all

801
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,940
coincidences.

802
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,420
Don't worry.

803
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,940
Go for it.

804
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,780
Mr. Wang is really talented.

805
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,420
I can tell

806
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
he cares about you a lot.

807
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:03,860
I always felt

808
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,700
someone as outstanding as you

809
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,140
would have a true love

810
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,980
waiting for you.

811
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,460
Thank you, Ms. Wen.

What do you think

819
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,900
of Mr. Wang?

820
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,900
Mr. Wang?

821
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,340
Ms. Tan's friend.

822
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,740
Wang Zeyuan?

823
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,340
Yes.

824
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,060
What about him?

825
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,340
I just think

826
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,900
he and Ms. Tan look good together.

827
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,460
And he's young and accomplished.

828
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,980
I heard he's pursued Ms. Tan
for a long time.

829
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,420
Now they're finally together.

830
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,260
Is that so?

831
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,580
It seems that way,

832
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,860
probably.

833
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,260
No idea.

834
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,780
Are you feeling more relaxed now?

835
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,340
Finished the noodles, now sipping tea.

836
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,300
You really know how to plan things.

837
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,180
You understand how to live.

838
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,580
This place is nice, right?

839
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,540
You know what?

840
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,540
I lived in a pretty remote area

841
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,780
when I was little.

842
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,980
I always thought

843
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,460
that when I grew up,

844
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,460
I would

845
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,060
live in a lively, bustling place.

846
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,900
I'm a bit different from you.

847
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,420
My work pace

848
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,900
is already very fast.

849
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,180
So when I rest, I prefer

850
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,380
to slow down. Like driving around.

851
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,780
Driving for a ride-sharing service?

852
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,060
Yeah.

853
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,740
I drive for the ride-sharing service

854
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,660
to chat with passengers.

855
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,060
Talk about all sorts of things.

856
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,580
Those passengers

857
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,820
who get your luxury car

858
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,300
are pretty lucky.

859
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,140
Actually, among those,

860
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,340
some

861
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,380
are genuinely well-off,

862
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,220
while others

863
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
might be doing it for face.

864
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,660
Their demeanor
before and after getting in the car

865
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
can be very different.

866
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,660
It's really interesting.

867
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,780
I enjoy observing them.

868
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,060
But I'm not doing it for face.

869
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,700
I purely do it for comfort.

870
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,380
You were so genuine that day.

871
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,580
Very genuine?

872
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,420
So do you live alone now,

873
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,740
or with your parents?

874
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,300
I've always lived alone.

875
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,300
My parents passed away early.

876
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,860
Later, I had some luck.

877
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,860
Started some businesses

878
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,860
and made some money.

879
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,980
I also made some friends in real estate.

880
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,460
Now we have an investment company.

881
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,820
If I said I'm a fairy,

882
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,420
would you believe me?

883
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,180
I'd believe it.

884
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,860
Were you single when you descended?

885
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,420
How do you know I'm single?

886
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,300
The whole world
heard you shouting about it that day.

887
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,660
Then

888
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,380
what about you?

889
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,460
I haven't been
in a relationship for years.

890
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,300
Never met the right person.

891
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,180
Love is something

892
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,060
you can't force.

893
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,700
Just go with the flow.

894
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,180
But I still envy those

895
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,100
who have love.

896
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,980
I just feel like

897
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,780
love isn't in the cards for me.

898
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,420
My past relationships...

899
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,060
You got hurt?

900
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,940
Actually, I don't think

901
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,620
love itself hurts people.

902
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,420
What hurts us is probably

903
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,420
the person within that love.

904
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,620
But when we meet

905
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,820
the right person,

906
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,820
then love can be good.

907
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,820
You're right, Mr. Wu.

908
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Don't call me Mr. Wu.

909
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,180
Makes it sound like
we're doing business.

910
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:38,940
Call me Zu.

911
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,140
Zu.

912
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,820
Cheers.

913
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,260
Here.

914
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,340
Take it slow.

915
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,580
You should head back now.

916
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:31,860
I'm going.

917
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:38,740
Bye.

918
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,580
Bye.

919
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,020
Let's go, sir.

920
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,060
Grape Season?

921
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,140
Yes. It is now.

922
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,780
Then I'd like one. That...

923
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,260
I'll have the peach one.

924
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,700
You want the peach one, right?

925
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,260
Get me one.

926
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,060
Watch your head.

927
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,020
Watch your step.

928
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,420
Direction. Faster.

929
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
Okay. How many orders?

930
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:19,980
Zheng Yufan!

931
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,380
What are you doing here?

932
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,740
We haven't seen you in the dance studio.

933
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,620
I've had some family matters lately.

934
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,740
I... I'll deliver the food.

935
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,460
Okay. Bye.

936
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,300
Does it hurt?

937
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,700
No.

938
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,900
Lift it up a bit.

939
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:35,860
Okay.

940
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:36,820
Tighten it a bit more.

941
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:37,940
Okay.

942
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,740
How is it, doctor?

943
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,780
Not bad.

944
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,460
Wang Shuhan.

945
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,580
Almost there.

946
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,180
So close.

947
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,500
Perfect!

948
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,460
The invitation

949
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,580
is really beautiful.

950
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,340
Solo concert.

951
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,780
