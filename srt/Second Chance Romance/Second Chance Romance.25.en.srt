[Episode 25]

19
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,690
Hello?

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,820
Ms. Gao.

21
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,500
Where is my child?

22
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,260
Why didn't you tell her

23
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,660
the child is alive?

24
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,660
Are you saying

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,380
she should raise the child on her own?

26
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,850
Her dad is gone.

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,450
She's completely alone,

28
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,730
and she just graduated

29
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,060
with no job.

30
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,610
How is she supposed to
provide for a child?

31
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,610
What can she possibly offer the child?

32
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,660
Wait for Feng Rui to return.

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,540
Once Feng Rui is back,

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,540
the two of them can...

35
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,170
Rui

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,940
won't be back anytime soon.

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,290
Besides,

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,540
our family

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,170
will never accept Tan Siting.

40
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,060
She and Rui

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,890
will break up.

42
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,010
But this child would suffer.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,380
Keeping the child with us

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,980
might be the best option.

45
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,610
She

46
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,540
could go to Paris

47
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,060
and pursue her ballet dreams.

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,380
That would be

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,780
the best way out for her.

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,130
The truth always comes out.

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,660
How can you live

52
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,380
with yourself doing this?

53
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,570
You're naive, kid.

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,610
I'd feel even worse

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,100
if I let them struggle

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,100
through an unstable life.

57
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,610
Her family

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,290
is already broken.

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,540
Should she drag herself down

60
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,340
raising a child alone?

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,850
You're her close friend.

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,050
You should understand
why I'm doing this.

63
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,460
Is Wang Zeyuan

64
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,250
your brother?

65
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,580
What do you want?

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,020
I read his company's proposal.

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,340
It's good.

68
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,810
Your brother

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,580
has real potential.

70
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,250
I'm considering

71
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,020
an initial investment

72
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,340
to get his company running.

73
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,850
Kid,

74
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,290
you have a good heart.

75
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,980
But

76
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,610
when it comes to private family matters,

77
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,410
sometimes

78
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,980
staying silent

79
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,140
is

80
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,370
the best approach.

81
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,140
I secured an investment for you.

82
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,140
Your company can officially launch now.

83
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,020
Where did the investment come from?

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,460
You didn't get scammed, did you?

85
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,850
A classmate of mine.

86
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,220
His family is very wealthy.

87
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,370
I showed him

88
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,780
your gaming company proposal
you sent me.

89
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,850
He's very optimistic about you guys.

90
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,900
I never knew

91
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,850
you had a classmate like that.

92
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,780
Can I meet with him to discuss?

93
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,660
I can elaborate on our ideas.

94
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,460
He's abroad right now.

95
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,980
Don't worry.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,700
When he's back,

97
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,930
I'll arrange a meeting, okay?

98
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,370
Please make sure to tell this person

99
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,930
we'll prioritize paying his share

100
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,700
of the annual profits.

101
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,170
No problem.

102
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,660
Thank you, Shuhan!

103
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,140
Is our startup funding

104
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,850
hush money from Gao Hui?

105
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,930
All these years I thought...

106
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,700
I thought I owed you.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,660
I thought it was because of me

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,460
you missed your chance to study!

109
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,610
I never expected...

110
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,900
Why would you do this?

111
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,660
Did you ever consider how I'd feel?

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,290
Wang Shuhan, I truly never imagined.

113
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,930
After all our years of friendship,

114
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,370
you could do something like this.

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,140
Not just that.

116
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,660
I wanted to tell you.

117
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,900
I wanted you to know

118
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,700
that all these years,

119
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,810
my understanding

120
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,810
and sympathy for you were genuine.

121
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,850
But my jealousy was real too.

122
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,540
All these years, through everything,

123
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,810
it never once crossed your mind
that it could be me.

124
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,660
Why?

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,170
Because in your eyes,

126
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,290
I was never even worthy
of consideration.

127
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,220
What are you?

128
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,700
A ballet prodigy.

129
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,780
With a bright future ahead.

130
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,930
And me?

131
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,100
Just a fishmonger.

132
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,410
An ordinary person

133
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,980
who did ballet for two years
before dropping out to work.

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,370
All these years,

135
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,780
you never once thought it could be me.

136
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,370
Because you never

137
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,140
saw me as someone on your level.

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,250
That's what

139
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,780
I hate the most!

140
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,100
It's not that it never crossed my mind!

141
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,370
I just didn't want to believe

142
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,140
my best friend,

143
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,580
you,

144
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,940
could do such a thing.

145
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,260
Best friend?

146
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,460
I was just your perfect foil.

147
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,460
Feng Rui,

148
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,900
you're still here.

149
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,500
I'm about to head out.

150
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,540
Ever since you joined our class,

151
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,500
the atmosphere's been so much better.

152
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,380
Really?

153
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,140
Guess my lousy dancing

154
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,980
is good for something.

155
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,500
Wish I'd met you sooner.

156
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,980
Then our classes

157
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,900
wouldn't have been so boring.

158
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,260
Yeah.

159
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,460
Why

160
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,580
would a guy like you

161
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,100
learn ballet?

162
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,380
Because I like someone.

163
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,500
Who?

164
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,140
I'm not sure yet.

165
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,780
Just

166
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,380
a bit of a crush.

167
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,620
If you like her, go for it.

168
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,940
I don't even know

169
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,060
if she likes me back.

170
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,380
Ms. Tan.

171
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,740
Thanks.

172
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,180
Appreciate it.

173
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,100
Shuhan.

174
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,180
Why are you still here?

175
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,460
Are...

176
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,340
Are you both

177
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,420
free for dinner tonight?

178
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,980
I'll pass.

179
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,820
Too tired today.

180
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,940
Just want to go back and rest.

181
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,700
Maybe

182
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,660
you two should go.

183
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,060
Well, next time then.

184
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:10,820
Okay.

185
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,020
Next time.

186
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,220
Definitely next time.

187
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:13,900
Alright.

188
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:14,940
Let's go.

189
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,180
We're off.

190
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,940
Bye.

191
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,500
Bye.

192
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,700
Feng Rui,

193
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,100

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,540
Come on.

384
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,540
We're really going to be late.

385
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,100
Quick.

386
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,660
You can take it with you to eat.

387
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:35,940
Hurry.

388
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,260
Let's go.

389
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,620
We're here.

390
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,460
Good morning, Madam.

391
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:44,860
Good morning, Madam.

392
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,260
Hurry up.

393
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,220
Bye, Dad.

394
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,580
Okay.

395
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,580
Bye.

396
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,260
Bye.

397
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,740
Eat well.

398
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,940
[Paroxetine Hydrochloride Tablets]

399
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,500
Come in.

400
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,940
So it was her.

401
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,780
Wasn't she your best friend?

402
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,820
I didn't expect it either.

403
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,500
Makes sense.

404
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,700
People are complicated.

405
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,380
If she could do this,

406
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,940
maybe this is the outcome she wanted.

407
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,740
But rumors will eventually pass.

408
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,900
I believe that.

409
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
I believe

410
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,420
she'll never escape the guilt
for the rest of her life.

411
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,780
I'll go talk to Mr. Zhu.

412
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,460
She should face legal consequences.

413
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,700
No need.

414
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,340
After all, we were once friends.

415
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Maybe this is just how our story ends.

416
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,940
She almost...

417
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,780
ruined you.

418
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,340
And you're still

419
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,420
protecting her?

420
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,420
I can't be like her.

421
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,260
I just can't.

422
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,340
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

423
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,260
By the way,

424
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,180
Le

425
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,940
mentioned you today.

426
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,700
What did he say?

427
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,140
He just asked if I'd seen you.

428
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,660
I think he might be missing you a bit.

429
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,020
Feng Rui, are you really happy

430
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,100
with me?

431
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,300
Why would you ask that?

432
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,220
Of course.

433
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,460
I'm definitely happy.

434
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,700
I'm just afraid that sometimes

435
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,260
happiness can be

436
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,060
an illusion.

437
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,540
Wang Shuhan, I truly never imagined.

438
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,940
After all our years of friendship,

439
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,660
you could do something like this.

440
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,180
I wanted you to know

441
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,980
that all these years,

442
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
my understanding

443
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,180
and sympathy for you were genuine.

444
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,140
But my jealousy was real too.

445
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,900
All these years, through everything,

446
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,060
it never once crossed your mind
that it could be me.

447
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,940
Why?

448
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,500
Because in your eyes,

449
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,620
I was never even worthy
of consideration.

450
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,580
What are you?

451
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,020
A ballet prodigy.

452
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,060
With a bright future ahead.

453
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,300
And me?

454
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,420
Just a fishmonger.

455
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,780
An ordinary person

456
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,220
who did ballet for two years
before dropping out to work.

457
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,620
All these years,

458
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,100
you never once thought it could be me.

459
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,660
Because you never

460
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,420
saw me as someone on your level.

461
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,580
That's what

462
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,020
I hate the most!

463
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,540
Dad.

464
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,700
It's okay now.

465
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,260
My dad

466
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,220
suddenly decided to come back.

467
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,220
I tried so many times to convince him,

468
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,100
but he never wanted to.

469
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,260
He said he wanted to stay

470
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,660
in Hongyuan County in Sichuan.

471
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,260
Why did he suddenly come back?

472
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,860
Maybe

473
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,340
he missed you

474
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,220
and wanted to spend time with you.

475
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,700
Don't overthink it.

476
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,260
Sir!

477
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,780
Over here.

478
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,100
Dad.

479
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,860
Thank you.

480
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:45,700
Let me get that.

481
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,580
It's fine.

482
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,220
It's okay.

483
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,860
Are you tired?

484
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,220
Alright.

485
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,020
Not tired.

486
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,420
Sir.

487
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,020
Rui.

488
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,900
Thanks.

489
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,500
Appreciate it.

490
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,220
You've had a long journey.

491
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:52,700
Alright.

492
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,180
I've got it.

493
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:53,860
Okay.

494
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,380
Get in.

495
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,420
Was the ride

496
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,700
comfortable?

497
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,980
Yes. It was smooth.

498
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,140
Come on.

499
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,900
Everything went smoothly.

500
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,700
Easy does it.

501
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,340
Okay.

502
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,300
Get in.

503
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,140
Dad, let me adjust your seat for you.

504
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,420
Okay.

505
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,260
Okay. It's good.

506
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,740
Is that alright?

507
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,260
Comfy?

508
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,660
How about your legs?

509
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,300
Alright.

510
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,780
Remember to fasten your seatbelt.

511
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,620
Got it.

512
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:14,980
Okay.

513
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,780
Is that okay, Dad?

514
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,340
This car is really spacious.

515
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,380
Very comfortable to sit in.

516
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,940
Settle in. We're heading off.

517
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,340
Alright.

518
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,100
Let's go.

519
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:26,380
Here.

520
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,780
So, Dad, what do you think?

521
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,940
I haven't been back in over ten years.

522
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,860
It's like

523
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,060
I've been completely cut off
from the world.

524
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,860
I felt the same when I first came back.

525
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,220
It just feels like everything
has changed so much.

526
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
When I was in school,

527
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,940
this road

528
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,220
was nothing like it is now.

529
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,700
Yeah.

530
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,220
The outside world

531
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,660
has changed so much.

532
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,700
Should we get something to eat first?

533
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,700
I'm actually a bit hungry.

534
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,220
Dad, what would you like to eat?

535
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,220
Hot pot?

536
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,700
You love that...

537
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,020
Remember that place
that made the braised pork intestines?

538
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,700
Yes.

539
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,700
Blood curd.

540
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
And braised pork belly.

541
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,420
What do you feel like?

542
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,220
All of it.

543
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,060
I want to eat it all.

544
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,580
Then let's make sure

545
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,060
we hit every single one this time.

546
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,340
Alright?

547
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,300
Alright.

548
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,420
Hot pot first?

549
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,300
Sure.

550
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,220
Let's have hot pot first.

551
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,660
Dad, you have to try this.

552
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,820
Just dip it in a few times.

553
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,100
The tripe here is especially good.

554
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,660
I cooked this for you.

555
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,540
Alright.

556
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,140
Try it.

557
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,700
And these

558
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,540
are your favorite ivy mosses.

559
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:42,820
Okay.

560
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,700
Alright.

561
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,020
Is it good?

562
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,660
I haven't had

563
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,780
hot pot this good in years.

564
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,020
Sir, it's really good to have you back.

565
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,220
Siting missed you every day.

566
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,940
Back in Hongyuan County,

567
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,820
I always thought about her too.

568
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,540
Here.

569
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,260
Here.

570
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,740
Tashi Delek.

571
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,540
Tashi Delek.

572
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,860
Tashi Delek.

573
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,420
Dad,

574
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,140
how long are you planning to

575
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,060
stay this time?

576
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,100
I don't really have any plans.

577
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,180
I used to leave on a whim,

578
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,820
and now I come back the same way

579
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,660
I'm

580
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,580
too laid-back.

581
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,180
So where would you like to go?

582
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,900
I'll go with you.

583
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,020
There are many places I'd like to see.

584
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,140
But I don't want to

585
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,220
interfere with your work.

586
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:34,940
Dad,

587
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,860
I forgot to tell you.

588
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,540
I just quit my job recently.

589
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,940
You quit?

590
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,780
Why?

591
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,300
Well, we have plenty of time.

592
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,180
I'll tell you all about it.

593
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:42,860
Let's eat first.

594
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,900
Ting,

595
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,740
if you have the time,

596
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,860
you could really take me
to see the old house.

597
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,940
If possible,

598
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,340
we could even stay there for a while.

599
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,780
I don't know why.

600
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,820
But lately,

601
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,500
I keep thinking about the old days

602
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,740
we spent

603
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,500
in that house.

604
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,180
I'm getting old.

605
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,180
No problem.

606
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,940
I'm getting nostalgic.

607
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,740
No problem.

608
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,900
I'll stay with you.

609
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,740
Here, have another one.

610
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,220
Okay.

611
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,540
Eat more.

612
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,540
Feeling better now?

613
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,460
Much better.

614
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,220
Tashi Delek.

615
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,940
Wishing you both happiness.

616
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,500
Wishing you both happiness.

617
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,180
Put some more.

618
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:30,780
Eat up.

619
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
I'm going to eat a lot today.

620
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,660
Dad, you should eat more today.

621
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Let's all eat more.

622
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,860
We're here, Dad.

623
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,780
We're here.

624
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,860
Be careful.

625
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,100
Let me help you.

626
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,340
Here.

627
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,660
Wait for me.

628
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,020
It's fine.

629
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,100
This is the building.

630
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:54,740
Come on.

631
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,700
Come on.

632
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,180
Well,

633
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,780
after you.

634
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,340
Okay.

635
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,340
You two go on up.

636
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,300
I'll pass.

637
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,020
Alright.

638
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:04,820
Well,

639
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,460
Rui, thank you.

640
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:06,900
Not at all.

641
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,580
My pleasure.

642
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,060
Okay.

643
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:08,620
We're leaving.

644
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,220
Let's go.

645
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,180
Let's go upstairs, Dad.

646
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,180
Dad, let me help you.

647
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,180
I'm good.

648
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,460
Okay.

649
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:30,780
Dad.

650
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,580
Why are you standing there?

651
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:33,980
Come, sit down.

652
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:34,820
Okay.

653
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,180
Here.

654
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,060
Have some chrysanthemum tea.

655
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,260
That meal was pretty spicy.

656
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,100
Careful, it's hot.

657
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,580
Here.

658
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,500
You quit because you didn't want to

659
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,980
burden Ms. Zhuang and the school.

660
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,180
It's a good chance to rest.

661
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,340
Now that you're here,
I can spend time with you.

662
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,740
You didn't even call
to discuss it with me.

663
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,660
It's not that big of a deal.

664
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,220
It's all just rumors.

665
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,300
Why bother telling you?

666
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,140
As long as I know it's not true.

667
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,140
I never thought Shuhan
would do something like this.

668
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,820
Does Feng Rui know?

669
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
He only knows that Wang Shuhan did it.

670
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,660
But he doesn't know his mom

671
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,540
gave Shuhan money.

672
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,380
His mom is very ill right now.

673
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,500
I didn't want him caught in the middle,

674
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,820
so I didn't tell him.

675
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,980
Ting, now more than ever,

676
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,540
you two need to be of one mind.

677
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,540
Don't worry. I know.

678
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,060
Let's not talk about this.

679
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,940
Why don't we focus

680
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,500
on packing our things
in the coming days?

681
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,900
So we can move back to the old house.

682
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,140
Now that you're back,

683
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,380
we can stay as long as we want.

684
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,180
Okay?

685
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,060
Okay.

686
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,540
Good.

687
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,540
Don't bother with that, Dad.

688
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,180
I'll do it.

689
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:57,780
Here.

690
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,780
Done.

691
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,420
You

692
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,660
take the inner room later.

693
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,700
I'll sleep here.

694
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,660
No, that won't do.

695
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,500
You take the bed.

696
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
No, this is too narrow.

697
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,460
Not happening.

698
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
When I'm out in the mountains,

699
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,660
I'm gone
for more than half a month at a time.

700
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,780
I can sleep anywhere.

701
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,380
You take the bed.

702
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,060
Don't argue with me.

703
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,420
Whatever you say.

704
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,700
Fits just right.

705
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,300
When I was in Paris,

706
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,380
what I craved most was your

707
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,300
stir-fried rice cakes with cabbage

708
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,020
and fish head soup.

709
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,420
I've tried making them
a few times myself,

710
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
but I just can't get the right flavor.

711
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,660
I'll teach you

712
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,820
how to make it someday.

713
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,500
I'm not learning.

714
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,460
Now that you're back,
I'll just enjoy your cooking.

715
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,860
Alright.

716
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,540
I'll cook for you every day then.

717
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,580
It's fine.

718
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,500
Dad, how long have you had this cough?

719
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,020
It's fine. An old issue.

720
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,340
The climate in Hongyuan County

721
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,140
always makes me cough.

722
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,100
I haven't even finished
the throat lozenges

723
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,140
Qu Zhen brought.

724
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,220
By the way, how is she doing?

725
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,420
She's doing well.

726
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,220
She went to Guangzhou Ballet Academy
for an exchange program.

727
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,340
I'll have her come see you
when she's back.

728
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,580
Okay.

729
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,260
Dad,

730
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
how about

731
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,500
I take you for a check-up another day?

732
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,060
Don't bother.

733
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,220
I know my own condition.

734
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,700
I just don't get people nowadays.

735
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,380
They go to the hospital

736
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,700
for every little thing.

737
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,060
Once you're there,
the stress and anxiety

738
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,860
can turn a small issue
into a big problem.

739
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,500
I'm fine. Don't worry.

740
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,180
Oh, Ting,

741
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,380
if you have time tomorrow,

742
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,300
take me to see Wei.

743
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:00,860
Okay.

744
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,860
Then

745
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,220
we'll go back to the old house.

746
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,340
Alright.

747
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,900
Sleep now.

748
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,700
Wei,

749
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
it's been so many years

750
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,180
since I last visited.

751
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,940
You must blame me, right?

752
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,580
But

753
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,020
in my eyes,

754
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,820
you're not really here.

755
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,020
You've always been in my heart.

756
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,180
I always think back

757
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,380
to when you first joined the company.

758
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,940
I remember at lunch,

759
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,300
you'd always ask me
all kinds of questions.

760
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,260
Once, I was so hungry
that I couldn't take it anymore,

761
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,140
[In Memory
of My Beloved Daughter Shi Wei]

762
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,940
so I asked if you could
wait until I finished eating.

763
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,380
You looked at me with those big eyes,

764
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,740
very seriously, and said,

765
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:56,860
"Okay, Master,

766
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,300
I'll wait until you're done."

767
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,140
That adorable look of yours

768
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,620
is still

769
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,020
etched in my mind.

770
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,020
I just can't shake it.

771
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,380
It's a shame

772
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,500
that in reality,

773
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,860
I'll never see

774
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,220
that clever,

775
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,620
hard-working girl again.

776
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,100
But

777
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,100
we'll meet again

778
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,340
someday.

779
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,300
Make sure

780
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,540
you still recognize me then.

[New Product Analysis]
Last week,

783
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,420
we conducted market research
on three new products

784
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,300
for the domestic market.

785
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,700
Everyone, take a look.

786
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,180
Category One wine is selling the best.

787
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,820
It fits the mid-to-high-end habits

788
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,300
of domestic consumers.

789
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,420
But

790
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,420
it's basically similar
to the previous new products.

791
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,580
No significant change.

792
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,580
Of course,

793
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,540
that's a good thing.

794
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,540
It means

795
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,700
our product selection
has basically met quality standards.

796
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,700
But there's no breakthrough.

797
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,580
This time we have three wines.

798
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,500
The other two

799
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,260
clearly haven't gained sales traction.

800
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,580
We should try more innovative ways

801
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
to attract consumer attention.

802
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,300
Have you seen

803
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,460
my notebook?

804
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,180
Then this attempt has a major problem.

805
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,900
Is it not on the table over there?

806
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,260
That's all for my report.
