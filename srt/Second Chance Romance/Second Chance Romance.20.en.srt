00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 20]

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,660
The restaurant's food

20
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,020
is no match for Ms. Wen's cooking.

21
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,770
It's so salty.

22
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,410
They broke up,

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,660
and we suffer.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,290
Do you really like Ms. Wen a lot?

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,980
Definitely.

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,490
But can't show it to Dad.

27
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,780
The grown-ups' feelings
are unpredictable.

28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,170
As she

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,780
didn't become your mom,

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,850
are you really disappointed?

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,380
Not really.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,890
Grandma,

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,410
Dad likes

34
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,500
what he likes.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
I like what I like.

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,980
My dad's feelings come first.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,500
Mine come after.

38
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,260
I'm easygoing.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,780
There's a package for you.

40
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,100
For me?

41
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,170
You haven't finished eating yet.

42
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,780
Grandma, I'm full.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,410
A figure.

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,500
Who sent this to me?

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,850
I didn't buy anything.

46
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,780
Strange.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,780
I got it.

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,780
I'll do my homework in my room.

49
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,660
I also think the gaming industry

50
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,290
is promising.

51
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,890
Hope we'll collaborate in the future.

52
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,780
Real estate should be viable.

53
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,260
Yes.

54
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,690
Let me properly introduce you now.

55
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,410
Zu

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,130
is the President
of Shengnuo Real Estate,

57
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,260
and I'm

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,890
the Project Manager
of the East District

59
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,780
Sports Industry Park project.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,410
Without any experience in real estate,

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,780
can you handle this big project

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,660
right off the bat?

63
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,130
Although she has no experience,

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,500
she has provided us

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,660
with very valuable advice.

66
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,730
And if she hadn't had the capability,

67
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,780
I wouldn't have made her
my project manager,

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,290
would I?

69
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,890
So your company got that land?

70
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,290
It's my friend's company.

71
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,340
Your friend's company got the land

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,890
and let you develop it?

73
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,130
We're developing it jointly.

74
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,610
Developing the old district

75
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,780
involves a lot of things.

76
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,260
It'll take a long time to get approvals,

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,500
yet you've started planning already?

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,980
Seems you know quite a bit about it.

79
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,660
My friend's company has taken care

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,260
of these tedious procedures,

81
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,130
Shuhan can just get right to work.

82
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,980
Seems your business is doing very well.

83
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,380
Cut it out.

84
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,980
What's with all the questions?

85
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,820
Besides,

86
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,290
the project is not that big.

87
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,410
What makes you think I can't handle it?

88
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,900
After all, I was quite a big shot

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,610
in East District back in the day.

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,660
I can get it done

91
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,250
with just a few phone calls.

92
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,370
You're worrying over nothing.

93
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,900
Real estate isn't as easy

94
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,490
to make money in as it used to be.

95
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,100
But if it can improve

96
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,460
people's quality of life,

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,140
there will be business opportunities.

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,020
You really have great taste,

99
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,140
especially in choosing an amazing girl

100
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,100
to be your girlfriend.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,730
I wish my bestie

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,900
everlasting happiness.

103
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,900
But I must make one thing clear.

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,100
Don't bully her.

105
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,370
If you mistreat her,

106
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,290
we won't let you get away with it.

107
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:52,900
Of course.

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,410
Cheers!

109
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,140
Is he a decent guy?

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,140
Can't say it here?

111
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,100
Let's talk about it later.

112
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,290
Ms. Tan,

113
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,370
is the street dance figure from you?

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,370
Do you like it?

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,250
Yes.

116
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,660
Thank you.

117
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,780
Stop playing.

118
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,140
Go do your homework.

119
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,250
If I catch you playing,

120
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,780
I'll confiscate all of them.

121
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:41,850
Be self-disciplined.

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,050
Le,

123
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,100
hurry up.

124
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,980
Sweetheart,

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,700
wake up.

126
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,610
Did you hear me?

127
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,370
Come on.

128
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:20,980
Get up.

129
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,580
Quickly.

130
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,050
Come on.

131
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,250
Go.

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,100
Enough with this.

133
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,370
Now is not the time.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,980
It's okay.

135
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,850
It's a holiday today.

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,850
Besides,

137
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,580
he'll have less time with this
in middle school.

138
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,100
Who is spoiling him now?

139
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,980
You're good in every way,

140
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,340
except for your studies.

141
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,460
Your father was an excellent student.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,140
I never had to worry about him.

143
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,580
I wonder who you take after.

144
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,580
Grades aren't everything.

145
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,460
I think he's doing well in all aspects.

146
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,220
My dad is the best.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,100
Have you done your homework?

148
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,250
Grandma,

149
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,020
please don't start the day with this.

150
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,460
It affects my mood.

151
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,220
I finished it all last night.

152
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,490
You even checked it.

153
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,140
Nonsense!

154
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,250
When did I ever check it?

155
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,220
Dad,

156
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,610
didn't she check my homework yesterday?

157
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,100
Alright.

158
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,220
I'll help you check it from now on.

159
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,730
Here.

160
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,140
Eat this piece too.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,340
Still one in my hand.

162
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,250
Eat this piece too.

163
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,700
I've never eaten two pieces.

164
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,340
But today is a special case.

165
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,850
Alright, Mr. Wang.

166
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,340
That's all.

167
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,220
We'll be in touch when needed.

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,140
When did you come in?

169
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,490
You didn't make a sound.

170
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,700
What's happening?

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,340
You look so happy.

172
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,490
Guess

173
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,060
how much funding our sports park project

174
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,770
has secured.

175
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,420
For this project,

176
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,700
the first round should be
at least 20 million.

177
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,490
Fifty million?

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,650
Eighty million.

179
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,850
Eighty million?

180
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,340
Eighty million in the first round?

181
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,890
Not enough.

182
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,340
I've decided to take out

183
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,130
some more loans from the bank.

184
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,770
Sun just called me

185
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,490
and said the investors

186
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,220
are optimistic
about this park's prospects.

187
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,700
Of course, the returns will be high.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,730
Or they wouldn't have invested readily.

189
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,130
Zu,

190
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,250
I also think this project is quite good.

191
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,420
Should we

192
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,700
invest a bit ourselves?

193
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,460
No.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,490
Remember,

195
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,850
unless it's necessary,

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,060
never touch your own available funds.

197
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,700
A company will be

198
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,980
in danger at a time like this

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,180
if it runs out of cash flow.

200
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,980
You're the business pro here.

201
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:29,980
I'll listen to you.

202
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,610
So you'd like to order more

203
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,420
of our new Pinot Noir from this year?

204
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,940
How about ten cases?

205
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,850
Ten cases?

206
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,490
Alright.

207
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,420
I can offer

208
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,180
a better price.

209
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,100
Great.

210
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,700
That should be all.

211
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,220
I'll have my colleague assist you.

212
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,890
Okay.

213
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,700
Qi,

214
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,490
please handle this.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,460
Sure thing.

216
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,940
Okay.

217
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,420
Just one moment, please.

218
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,100
Three bottles, right?

219
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,490
Yes.

220
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,890
Okay.

221
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,890
Sir,

222
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,940
let me double-check the order details

223
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,940
with you.

224
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,420
Hello.

225
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,980
What are we having for lunch today?

226
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,420
Sorry,

227
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,490
I've got plans for lunch today.

228
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,130
With who?

229
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,700
Le.

230
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,250
He texted me this morning,

231
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,700
saying he wants to grab lunch.

232
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,790
[Cygne]

233
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,370
Le.

234
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:12,940
What to eat?

235
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,370
I booked a table at the pizza place.

236
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,420
Want to join?

237
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,460
I...

238
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,460
No,

239
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,700
I'll leave you two to your lunch.

240
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,490
I get the feeling

241
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,980
that someone's stealing you
away from me,

242
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,700
Come over to my place tonight.

243
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,220
Okay, see you tonight.

244
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,460
Bye.

245
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,010
He's arrived.

246
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,420
Ask Mr. Zhang to wait

247
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,220
for a moment.

248
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,850
I'll grab something from home.

249
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,420
Fifteen minutes.

250
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,730
Okay.

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,980
Alright. I'll be right back.

252
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,300
Le, why are you still at home?

253
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,130
It's the weekend.

254
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,010
Where should I be?

255
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,650
I thought you were having lunch
with Ms. Tan today.

256
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,770
No.

257
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,420
When?

258
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,010
But she called me and said

259
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,420
you were going to eat pizza.

260
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,300
No.

261
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,420
No?

262
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,300
Congratulations.

263
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,700
Rui is back by your side.

264
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,130
"Back" is the wrong word.

265
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,370
He has always been by my side.

266
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,130
Please stay away from Le.

267
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,060
As his grandma,

268
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,890
you're asking his mother

269
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,530
to stay away from him.

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,730
Have you fulfilled your duty
as a mother?

271
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,130
It's because of you.

272
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,890
Enough.

273
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,730
Stop playing the victim.

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,370
We never forced you.

275
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,460
Back then,

276
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,980
you chose to go to Paris

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,340
for your own career.

278
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,010
Le

279
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,610
is at a crucial stage in his studies.

280
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,700
Must you influence him at this time?

281
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,730
When to tell him

282
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,220
is my right as his mother.

283
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,300
Don't worry about it.

284
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,610
What you should be worried about is

285
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,650
what if Le finds out

286
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,420
that the grandma he loves most

287
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,940
kept us apart for 12 years?

288
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,730
It doesn't matter.

289
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,130
Go ahead and tell him

290
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,890
if you want to watch him suffer.

291
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,460
When you all forced me to leave,

292
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,100
why didn't you ever consider

293
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,940
that Le would suffer like this today?

294
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,370
As long as I'm alive,

295
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,180
I will always be his mother.

296
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,850
Tan Siting,

297
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,460
don't think that, as you've won Rui,

298
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,940
you can marry him.

299
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,940
Let me tell you frankly,

300
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,610
I will never agree.

301
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,700
The Gao family

302
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,010
will never agree.

303
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,770
You're too confident.

304
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,460
Marriage is a matter
between Feng Rui and me.

305
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,180
As for your Gao family...

306
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,850
Honestly,

307
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,890
do you think I'd want to marry

308
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,940
into the family of a rapist?

309
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,060
Perfect.

310
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,370
We don't want Rui to marry

311
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,180
the daughter of a murderer.

312
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,650
Mom.

313
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,460
Just the right time.

314
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,220
You may

315
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,220
stay away from her

316
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,370
or from us.

317
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,460
You think I don't know

318
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,460
what you two did

319
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,370
behind my back.

320
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,010
It'll probably be harder

321
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,420
for me to see Le.

322
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,980
Hello, Ms. Hu.

323
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:03,650
Hello.

324
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,460
Something came up at home,

325
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,980
so I came to pick him up early.

326
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,980
It's okay.

327
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,730
Remember to turn in
your activity class homework tomorrow.

328
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,300
Go back with your grandma.

329
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,130
Okay.

330
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,370
Alright.

331
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:15,940
Ms. Hu,

332
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,610
we're leaving now.

333
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,370
Goodbye, Ms. Hu.

334
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:17,890
Bye-bye.

335
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,460
Bye-bye.

336
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,890
Take care.

337
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,130
Grandma,

338
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,610
why did you pick me up so early today?

339
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,650
Your great-grandpa misses you

340
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,700
and wants to eat with you.

341
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,300
Your great-grandfather's
is too far away.

342
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,940
Come home with me

343
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,370
tonight.

344
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,650
What about my dad?

345
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,460
He's been busy lately.

346
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,420
For these few days,

347
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,610
you'll stay with me.

348
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,850
What has Dad been doing recently?

349
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,700
It's like he's vanished!

350
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,200
He was never like this when busy.

351
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,640
Has something happened?

352
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,160
No, that's not right.

353
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,870
He just broke up with Ms. Wen

354
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,950
and is already dating someone else.

355
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,160
Isn't that a bit too fast?

356
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,160
It can't be.

357
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,460
Mr. Lu bought them for you.

358
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,130
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

359
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,700
You're welcome.

360
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,980
Grandma,

361
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,730
are you giving me a break today?

362
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,220
No more vocabulary drills?

363
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,180
Rest helps studying.

364
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,130
Might I play for a bit
at great-grandpa's place?

365
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,370
Yes.

366
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,490
Go all out.

367
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,480
Goodbye.

368
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,320
Goodbye, miss.

369
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,470
Students in the first row,

370
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,110
have you seen your parents?

371
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,680
Yes.

372
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,360
Go on.

373
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,760
Bye.

374
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,920
Bye.

375
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,940
Ms. Hu, have you seen Feng Lexuan?

376
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,460
He left a while ago.

377
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,180
His grandma picked him up early.

378
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,180
I see.

379
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:21,780
Thanks.

380
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,780
What's wrong?

381
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,780
Where's Le?

382
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,700
My mom picked him up.

383
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,940
I called her, but she didn't answer.

384
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,180
So what should we do?

385
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,500
Let's go to my mom's place.

386
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,260
Grandpa.

387
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,980
Hello, Le.

388
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,900
Let me get that for you. Here.

389
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,420
Grandma said Great-grandpa missed me,

390
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,940
and he wanted me to eat with him.

391
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,220
Grandpa,

392
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
did you miss me?

393
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,300
Of course I did.

394
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,220
It's been a while, little buddy.
(Watch on www.kisskh.la to support Admin)

395
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,100
Go on inside.

396
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,820
Great-grandpa's waiting for you.

397
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,300
Okay!

398
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,860
Haven't brought Le over
for dinner for ages.

399
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,820
A friend happened to send some beef.

400
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,180
Ask Ms. Ming to cook it up.

401
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,820
Okay.

402
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,820
Le, have some beef.

403
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,780
Eat more beef.

404
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,580
That's right.

405
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,140
Beef helps you grow strong.

406
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,060
Thank you, Great-grandpa.

407
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,620
Broccoli.

408
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,700
Here,

409
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,980
eat this.

410
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,660
Steamed chicken with chili oil.

411
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,220
No one's at home.

412
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
Where could they be?

413
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,820
Let me think.

414
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,100
Rui.

415
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:54,860
Hello, Dad.

416
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,940
Are Mom and Le with you?

417
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,020
Yes.

418
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,020
We're having dinner.

419
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,460
I got it.

420
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,820
Well.

421
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,180
I'll head over now.

422
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,300
My mom took Le to my grandpa's house.

423
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,020
I should have guessed

424
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,460
things wouldn't be that simple.

425
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,060
I didn't expect

426
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,460
my mom to act so quickly.

427
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,780
Do you think

428
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,380
we should tell Le the truth

429
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,380
as soon as possible

430
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,500
instead of delaying?

431
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,780
It really is time.

432
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,220
It's okay.

433
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
I'll drive you to your meeting.

434
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,460
Leave it to me.

435
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,780
Here.

436
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,300
Feng Rui will be here in a bit.

437
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,180
Tell Ms. Ming to save some food for him.

438
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,380
Here, Le, eat.

439
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,300
Try some chicken.

440
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,300
No more room on the plate.

441
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,300
The viewership of Ms. Tan's documentary

442
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,580
has exceeded three million.

443
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,460
Plus Mr. Yu's recent interview with you,

444
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,820
my phone

445
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,500
is ringing off the hook right now.

446
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,540
So many reporters

447
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,380
want to know

448
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,460
when they can schedule

449
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
an exclusive interview with you.

450
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,220
I feel like I'm not very good

451
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,220
at interviews.

452
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,220
The last one

453
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,300
was to promote our school.

454
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,580
So…

455
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,500
Um,

456
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,300
Ms. Tan doesn't like facing the media.

457
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,100
Ms. Qin,

458
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,980
turn down all the interview requests.

459
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
I've been telling them so.

460
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,980
But they want fairness.

461
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,820
Coming off as unfair

462
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,300
is hurting everyone's feelings.

463
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,060
Ms. Tan,

464
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,100
you could give them some guidelines

465
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,220
and set conditions

466
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,580
before the interviews.

467
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,700
I'm sure they'll cooperate.

468
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,020
As your documentary

469
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,340
is so popular right now,

470
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,700
ballet is receiving

471
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,540
unprecedented public attention.

472
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,020
If we can leverage

473
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,340
media collaboration now,

474
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,860
I'm sure it'll be immensely beneficial

475
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,740
for our school's visibility

476
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,940
and the promotion of ballet.

477
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,460
Which media outlets are there now?

478
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,020
There are

479
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
Comic Weekly,

480
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,060
the Grand Chronicle,

481
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,980
Dancer,

482
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
City of Dance,

483
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,180
and

484
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,820
A Date with Miracles.

485
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,500
I think I've seen

486
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,980
City of Dance before.

487
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,020
Is it a talk show format?

488
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,940
Yes.

489
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,820
The program wants

490
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,220
to help people learn more

491
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,500
about various types of dance

492
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,740
through interviews with professionals

493
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,620
and rising stars

494
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,860
in the dance world.

495
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,820
Seems this program

496
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
aligns well with our original intention.

497
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,260
Yes.

498
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,580
If this program lets

499
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,460
more people understand ballet,

500
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,740
get to know our school,

501
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,340
and see so many talented children

502
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,500
at our school,

503
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,180
I'll join this program.

504
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,940
Great!

505
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,580
I'll contact them right away.

506
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,620
Let's choose a role.

507
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,740
Huang.

508
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,980
Okay?

509
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,980
Okay.

510
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,380
Le,

511
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,580
take a break

512
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,060
and have some fruit.

513
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,100
Alright?

514
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,020
Here,

515
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,500
have some fruit.

516
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,300
Give me a sec.

517
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:18,860
Stop playing.

518
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,580
Rui.

519
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,260
Is everyone here?

520
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:20,860
Yes.

521
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm almost done.

522
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,700
Go.

523
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,300
Go.

524
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,780
That's so high!

525
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,860
Penalty kick!

526
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:32,780
Dad.

527
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,620
Rui.

528
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,140
Grandpa.

529
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,220
Dad.

530
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,900
Le.

531
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,580
Le,

532
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,060
it's time to do your homework.

533
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,100
Ms. Ming,

534
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,380
take Le upstairs to do his homework.

535
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,220
Okay.

536
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,780
Le.

537
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,540
Go on.

538
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,060
Dad,

539
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,460
my good times end when you arrive.

540
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:04,780
Mom,

541
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,220
I need to talk to you.

542
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,100
Here,

543
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,740
Le.

544
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,500
Here.

545
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,580
Have some water first.

546
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,780
After Le finishes his homework,

547
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,780
I'll take him home.

548
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,060
Stop right there.

549
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,100
Today, in the presence of your grandpa

550
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,540
and your dad,

551
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,020
let's get this straight.

552
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,780
Dad,

553
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,780
they're taking Le to France.

554
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,300
I want the three of us to be together.

555
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,860
To let Le have an environment

556
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,060
where he can bond with his mother.

557
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,420
We could go anywhere.

558
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,940
Go wherever you want.

559
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,020
I can't stop you,

560
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,020
and I won't.

561
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,100
But I raised Le,

562
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,740
and he should stay with me.

563
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,740
You're not taking him away

564
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,500
unless I'm dead.

565
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,220
Le needs a mother too.

566
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,900
For 12 years, he's lived a life

567
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,540
without a mother by his side.

568
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,500
Isn't that enough?

569
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,540
So,

570
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,700
you want to separate me from him?

571
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,300
Is this her idea?

572
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,740
Who caused this situation?

573
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,180
You know better than anyone.

574
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,700
If you hadn't deceived us 12 years ago,

575
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,980
we never would have separated.

576
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,860
You knew Siting wasn't quite herself,

577
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
yet you lied that the baby was gone.

578
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,180
Do you know what you did

579
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,340
was like killing her?

580
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,540
And

581
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,300
about Haotian's matter,

582
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,700
I know you can't move on.

583
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,860
Why do you have to implicate me?

584
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,300
Just because he was my uncle?

585
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
He was a rapist!

586
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Rui,

587
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,980
you shouldn't have said that.

588
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,020
Rui,

589
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,620
it's not your mother's fault.

590
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,700
Blame me.

591
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,060
Your separation...

592
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
was caused by me.

593
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,460
Who are you?

594
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,980
I'm Feng Rui's father.

595
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,980
I'm about the same age as your father,

596
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,780
so I'll call you Ting.

597
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,860
You're a smart girl,

598
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,020
I believe you know why I'm here.

599
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,420
To talk me into breaking up
with Feng Rui?

600
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:54,940
In that case,

601
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,140
we have nothing to talk about.

602
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,940
You've seen how his mother

603
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,580
and grandpa feel.

604
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,060
If you insist on being with him,

605
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,100
what's your plan?

606
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,820
When he comes back,

607
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,100
we'll leave this place.

608
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,540
Have you thought about where to go?

609
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,700
France.

610
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,780
That's a good idea.

611
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,940
You can continue to dance ballet

612
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,660
and pursue your dreams.

613
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,820
To be with him,

614
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,820
I believe a thoughtful girl like you

615
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,660
must have considered many things.

616
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,540
And you might have some heart knots.

617
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,660
That's why I'm here today

618
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,860
to share with you

619
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,060
some of my experiences.

620
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,060
When I was young,

621
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,660
I also had to make choices.

622
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,580
Before I met his mother,

623
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,860
I had a girlfriend.

624
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,940
We were together for five years,

625
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,940
and our feelings ran very deep.

626
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,100
We were about to get married.

627
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,180
Suddenly,

628
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,580
two choices

629
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,100
were placed before me.

630
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,900
One was

631
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,940
to marry my girlfriend

632
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,620
and struggle

633
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,980
through a life of poverty.

634
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,020
The other was to marry

635
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,060
into the Gao family.

636
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,460
At that time,

637
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,340
his mother was the only daughter

638
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,100
of the wealthiest family in the county.

639
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,380
She was young

640
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
and quite attractive.

641
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Many people liked her,

642
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,500
but she took a fancy to me.

643
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,980
Everyone around said

644
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,260
I had hit the jackpot.

645
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,540
But I couldn't bear
to leave my girlfriend.

646
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,540
Before I was 25,

647
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,980
I had never tasted coffee,

648
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,500
eaten seafood,

649
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,700
or flown on a plane.

650
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,900
I hadn't even left my province.

651
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,020
Got through college

652
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,340
with scholarships and part-time jobs.

653
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,100
After graduation,

654
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,980
my monthly salary barely covered
family expenses,

655
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,940
leaving almost nothing.

656
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,700
Conversations with my family

657
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,060
were mainly around money.

658
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,100
I believe you can't imagine

659
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,940
such financial hardship.

660
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,700
During that time,

661
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,060
my girlfriend's love for me

662
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,780
was the only beautiful thing I had

663
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,660
to be grateful for

664
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,580
in my poor life.

665
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,220
I refused the proposal

666
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,060
from the President,
who was Feng Rui's grandpa.

667
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,980
He acted very generously.

668
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,300
He told me

669
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,620
as long as I continued to work hard,

670
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,180
I would be promoted fairly.

671
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,580
By the end of that year,

672
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,540
I did get a promotion

673
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,900
and a raise,

674
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,540
but I was still insignificant

675
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,580
in the company.

676
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,220
My salary barely managed

677
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,380
to support my family.

678
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,500
You can probably guess

679
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,660
what happened next.

680
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,580
So, you left your girlfriend,

681
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,180
the one beautiful thing in your life.

682
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,940
Actually, my girlfriend

683
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
chose to let go.

684
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,740
She told me

685
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,620
she could accept living a life

686
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,020
of poverty with me,

687
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,100
but she couldn't bear

688
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,140
that I would give up

689
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,020
an opportunity

690
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,060
to change my destiny for her.

691
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,940
She didn't want to face

692
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,100
my regret and resentment

693
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,460
in the future.

694
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,020
I'll be forever grateful

695
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,820
for her decision.

696
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,020
Love isn't meant

697
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,700
to endure erosion.

698
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,020
Especially once many external factors

699
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,300
get involved,

700
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,740
it becomes nearly impossible to

701
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,140
stay the same.

702
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,620
Someone has to let go first.

703
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,300
Considering both of your futures,

704
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,300
I hope

705
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,220
you'll let go first.

706
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,940
Ms. Tan, hello.

707
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,980
I'm Zhai from the directing team.

708
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,780
Hello, Zhai.

709
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,340
This way, please.

710
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,660
Okay.

711
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,900
We'll go to the dressing room
for makeup.

712
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,220
Alright.

713
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,420
There are two outfits.

714
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,100
You can try them on.

715
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,020
I'll wear this one.

716
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:00,580
That's fine.

717
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,140
Hui,

718
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,100
about this matter,

719
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,900
Feng Ming has never let me tell you

720
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,900
to avoid affecting your emotions.

721
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,740
Over these years,

722
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,860
he's been doing things silently for us.

723
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,300
He knows what you want

724
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,900
and what you don't want,

725
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,860
always putting your needs first.

726
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,620
Yet, you turn a blind eye.

727
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,220
It's not easy for Rui either.

728
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,300
After going

729
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,060
through so much,

730
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,220
they ended up being together again.

731
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,620
That shows he truly loves this girl.

732
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,620
I've been thinking these past two days,

733
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,420
Haotian's matter

734
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,460
has had a big impact on Rui and Le.

735
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,740
Was it because we made

736
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
a selfish decision?

737
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:51,860
Dad,

738
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
I can't stand her.

739
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,580
Whenever I see her

740
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,860
with Rui,

741
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,740
I can't help but think of Haotian.

742
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,580
I can't take it.

743
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,740
Only I know

744
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,220
how I feel about Haotian.

745
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,300
No matter what he did,

746
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,940
he was still my brother.

747
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,100
Back then,

748
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,220
my mom went through hell

749
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,860
to give birth to him,

750
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,020
and later handed him over to me.

751
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,940
But I failed to take good care of him.

752
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,740
So,

753
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,940
no matter what others said,

754
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,460
no matter what others did,

755
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,660
I'd still believe in him.

756
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,380
Hui,

757
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,220
you're not young anymore.

758
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,020
Whatever decision you make,

759
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
I won't interfere.

760
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,660
I only hope that you can

761
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,780
be healthier and happier.

762
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,500
At the end of the day,

763
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,260
whether it's love or hatred
in this world,

764
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,020
one must learn to detach

765
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,260
and slowly let go.

766
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,860
In this world,

767
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
things forgettable

768
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,580
have long been forgotten.

769
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,140
But those unforgettable

770
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,220
will never fade away.

771
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,460
Take Le back in a couple of days.

772
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,900
I always thought

773
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,700
that in this family,

774
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,180
you understood me best.

775
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,580
Sorry, Rui.

776
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,700
You know,

777
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,620
things were complicated back then.

778
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,940
Haotian's incident

779
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,860
caused huge turmoil for the Gao family.

780
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,140
To protect the Gao family's legacy,

781
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,620
your mom tried every means

782
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
and lobbied everywhere.

783
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,420
She couldn't sleep at night.

784
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,140
It was really hard for her

785
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,980
to face what Haotian did.

786
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,140
But in front of others,

787
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,860
she had to appear very strong.

788
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,380
This was her fate.

789
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,740
Moreover,

790
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,420
back then, Tan Siting's

791
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,700
mental state was not optimistic.

792
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,260
Your mom thought

793
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,740
we couldn't entrust her

794
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,620
with a baby that still needed
an incubator.

795
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,740
You were so young back then
and didn't know

796
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,740
how long or difficult the road ahead

797
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,500
would be.

798
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,740
So,

799
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,780
separating

800
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,740
might have been the best choice.

801
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,900
I thought Ting had told you everything,

802
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,100
but I never expected her to...

803
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Rui, I know

804
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,820
you've suffered these years.

805
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,500
Actually,

806
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,300
I've blamed myself

807
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,940
for as long as you've suffered.

808
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,380
So now I've come to terms with it.

809
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,580
As long as you're happy

810
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,100
and Le is happy,

811
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,700
you can marry Ting and go to France.

812
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,460
I'll support you

813
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
no matter what you choose.

814
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,820
It's a way for me to make up

815
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,100
for my mistake 12 years ago.

816
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:53,940
I

817
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,060
wish you well.

818
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,380
May you be happy.

819
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,460
It's getting late.

820
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,020
Go back and rest.

821
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,540
Thank you.

822
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,780
For what?

823
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,060
It's all in the past.

824
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,180
Then about Rui…

825
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,740
You don't need

826
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,060
to interfere.

827
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,540
But you want to meddle?

828
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,460
Still going to make Rui suffer
in the middle?

829
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,180
And keep Le living without a mother?

830
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,860
Just stay out of it!

831
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,940
Okay, no problem.

832
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,860
Fill it out and take a look.

833
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,620
Check the questions.

834
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,180
Okay.

835
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,980
All of these?

836
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,980
Yes, including receiving.

837
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,740
Bai, the camera position is ready.

838
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
What kind of shots do you need?

839
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,500
Just a moment, please.

840
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Ms. Tan, excuse me.

841
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,100
Alright.

842
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,700
Hello.

843
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,140
Siting,

844
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,180
are you

845
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,900
doing okay over there?

846
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,180
Everything's going smoothly.

847
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,740
Le is fine, don't worry.

848
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,540
When will the shooting finish?

849
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,660
In about two or three hours.

850
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,100
Okay.

851
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,540
Do your best.

852
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,380
Alright.

853
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,660
Bye.

854
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,620
Hello, dear audience.

855
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,420
Welcome to City of Dance.

856
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,900
I'm Yu, your host for today.

857
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,980
Today, we're honored

858
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,060
to have

859
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,740
a truly remarkable guest

860
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,420
joining us on set,

861
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,180
Tan Siting,

862
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,180
the world-renowned ballerina.

863
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,100
Let's welcome Ms. Tan.

864
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,420
Ms. Tan, please say hello
to our viewers.

865
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,620
Hello everyone,

866
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,540
I'm Tan Siting.

867
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,220
Today, we collected a question.

868
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,300
A viewer would very much like to ask.

869
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,180
He said you started learning ballet
out of interest from a young age,

870
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,860
and now it has become your career.

871
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,500
This is a lifestyle
many people dream of.

872
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,420
Regarding this,

873
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,100
what's your advice?

874
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,500
Many people might think

875
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,540
when doing something
you're interested in,

876
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,460
it's easier to immerse yourself,

877
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,060
stay passionate,

878
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,900
and succeed.

879
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,140
But I hold a different view.

880
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,220
When pursuing any endeavor,

881
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,860
you'll face setbacks and difficulties.

882
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,380
How you respond

883
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,500
is what truly matters.

884
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,620
Because we

885
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,500
waver and struggle.

886
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,860
Faced with adversity,

887
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,300
you may retreat

888
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,180
or even give up.

889
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,100
But I believe this is normal.

890
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,700
When facing setbacks and difficulties,

891
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,500
how do you adjust

892
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,860
your mindset?

893
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,100
I believe success is never easy,

894
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,660
and failure is common.

895
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,500
At such times, better to try

896
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,860
to relax, let go,

897
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,860
and then start fresh.

898
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,740
Work hard to overcome the challenge.

899
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,220
When you do, you'll find

900
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
you gain a deep sense of accomplishment,

901
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,580
which will fuel you with greater drive

902
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,700
to continue pursuing your dreams.

903
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,060
[City of Dance]
Thank you

904
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,900
[Dance with Passion]
for sharing with us

905
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,860
truly valuable experience.

906
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,220
I heard

907
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,540
that after your last performance,

908
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,140
you decided to retire.

909
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,020
So I'd like to ask,

910
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,460
any special reason behind this decision?

911
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,020
Because I wanted to come back home.

912
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,500
I wanted

913
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,020
to come back here,

914
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,020
especially to see my teacher,
whom I haven't seen for long,

915
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,140
and to visit my hometown,
where I grew up and learned to dance.

916
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,860
I also learned
that after returning to China,

917
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,740
you became a guest instructor

918
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,220
at a dance school.

919
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:20,700
Yes.

920
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,700
Why is that?

921
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,700
Because Ms. Zhuang,
the founder of this school,

922
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,220
was my first ballet teacher.

923
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,260
Hui.

924
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:40,980
Hui.

925
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,540
You need to eat something.

926
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,380
You haven't eaten in two whole days.

927
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,500
Carrying on like this, you'll collapse.

928
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,700
Ms. Yang,

929
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,020
let me handle it.

930
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:55,860
Okay.

931
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,380
Mom,

932
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,820
eat something,

933
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,180
or you'll wear yourself out.

934
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,420
Hao...

935
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,460
Haotian.

936
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,740
Haotian.

937
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,540
I feel like he hasn't left.

938
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,300
He's still here.

939
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,260
He wouldn't do that.

940
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:38,740
Mom.

941
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:40,820
Mom,

942
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,220
this is the police's conclusion.

943
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:46,940
Maybe he had

944
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,420
too much to drink that day.

945
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,140
That

946
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,780
Tan something.

947
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,660
And that girl.

948
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,180
Do you know them?

949
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,260
He's Shi Wei's master.

950
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,180
We've met

951
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,740
in the break room a few times.

952
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,380
He seems pretty humble.
