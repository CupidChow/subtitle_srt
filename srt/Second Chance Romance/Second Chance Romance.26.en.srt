00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,530
What then?

196
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,850
Ms. Tan is severely slammed online.

197
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,820
You should comfort her.

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,460
Feng Lexuan,

199
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,220
in the past few days...

200
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,490
Have you not seen her for a while?

201
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,770
Yes.

202
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:44,940
Oh no.

203
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,460
She must be really hurt by this.

204
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,340
Rui.

205
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,100
Dad.

206
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,490
Have you and Le finished dinner?

207
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,180
Yes.

208
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,890
He's doing homework.

209
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,730
And you?

210
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,340
How's Mom?

211
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,700
Still the same.

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,980
She finds it hard

213
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,100
to remember things.

214
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,060
But

215
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,340
she doesn't drive me away.

216
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,820
I've always thought

217
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,300
we couldn't still be living apart

218
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,700
when we get old, right?

219
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,580
She's

220
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,770
been strong-willed her whole life.

221
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,300
Now, it seems she needs me

222
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,060
to do something for her.

223
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,250
How is Ms. Tan doing?

224
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,700
After her dad came back,

225
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,850
Siting's mood has been much better.

226
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,980
Be patient.

227
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,060
Let them spend more time together.

228
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,100
It should get better.

229
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,650
Dad,

230
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,060
I'll

231
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,580
come to see you tomorrow.

232
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,130
Okay.

233
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,580
Pan-fry this on high heat.

234
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,420
I know.

235
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,250
The hotter the fire,

236
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,530
the better the flavor
of the fried fish head,

237
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,980
and the thicker and whiter
the fish head soup

238
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,340
will be.

239
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,460
Some add milk

240
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,250
to get that white color.

241
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,940
That's not right.

242
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,420
Fire-kissed flavor.

243
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,300
This way…

244
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,100
Don't let it splatter on you.

245
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,300
Fry out the protein

246
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,220
from the fish head.

247
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,460
Dad,

248
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,010
don't forget
to sprinkle chopped green onions.

249
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,650
I won't forget.

250
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,220
Here we go!

251
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,770
Come on,

252
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,460
fish head

253
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,490
and tofu soup!

254
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,250
So fragrant!

255
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:46,940
Oh, hot!

256
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,220
Be careful.

257
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,460
It smells amazing.

258
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,420
Let me smell it.

259
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,220
This is definitely the taste

260
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,250
of the fish head soup in my dreams.

261
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,770
Okay.

262
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,010
Eat up!

263
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,730
I've got to try a bite right now.

264
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,010
Can't wait any longer.

265
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,460
Well.

266
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,460
I won't serve you.

267
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,220
Dad, help yourself.

268
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,180
Alright.

269
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,730
This is the taste, Dad.

270
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,460
You know,

271
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,940
only with fresh fish

272
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,770
can we make this soup.

273
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,490
That's right.

274
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,730
I'll

275
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,490
make it for you every day.

276
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:20,700
Here.

277
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,220
Forgot to buy any wine today.

278
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,340
Should have a little drink to celebrate.

279
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,980
You've prepared some?

280
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,340
And it's yellow rice wine!

281
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,820
Come on.

282
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,370
This is great!

283
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:39,890
Good.

284
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,650
Come on.

285
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,730
Take a sip.

286
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,250
A tiny sip.

287
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,340
Not too much now.

288
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,770
Okay.

289
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,370
Here.

290
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,130
I remember when you were little,

291
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,730
whenever I poured some wine,

292
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,730
you'd always ask,

293
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,010
"Dad,

294
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,730
is the wine tasty?"

295
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,770
With my chopsticks,

296
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,460
I dipped just a tiny bit

297
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,220
and

298
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,650
let you taste.

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,700
You said, "No,

300
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,460
I'm too young

301
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,770
to drink alcohol."

302
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,420
And I would say, "Alright,

303
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,370
when you grow up, drink with me."

304
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,490
And you'd say,

305
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,770
"Okay!

306
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,010
I hope I grow up fast,

307
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,770
so I can drink

308
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,490
with you."

309
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,980
Time flies.

310
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,850
Feels like it was just yesterday.

311
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,730
Dad,

312
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,460
I really regret it.

313
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,250
If only I had come back earlier,

314
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,730
do you think

315
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,940
I would have found you earlier

316
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,180
and drunk more with you?

317
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,220
It's not too late now.

318
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,580
Come on.

319
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,580
Take a sip.

320
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,250
Cheers!

321
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,010
Take your time.

322
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,580
How is it?

323
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,100
Take your time.

324
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,980
Have some soup

325
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,460
to settle it.

326
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,220
Delicious.

327
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,770
Eat.

328
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,250
Why aren't you eating?

329
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:10,700
Have more.

330
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,220
Go on, eat!

331
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,010
Going to the restroom.

332
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,300
Come on, Dad!

333
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:45,530
Okay.

334
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,180
Eat!

335
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:46,460
Come on.

336
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,100
Eat while it's hot.

337
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,770
Have some of this.

338
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,490
I'll get this for you.

339
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,490
Okay.

340
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,490
Food from our hometown is the best.

341
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,180
Is it good?

342
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,010
So delicious!

343
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,460
Only the glutinous rice cake

344
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,770
from our hometown tastes the best.

345
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,490
Have some more soup.

346
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,250
Eat more.

347
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,660
What do you want to say?

348
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,860
At your place,

349
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,420
I saw your drugs.

350
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,700
Speak up if anything is on your mind.

351
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,530
I wish I could get

352
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,570
through this difficult time

353
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,730
with you.

354
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:25,860
Dad,

355
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,460
Feng Rui and I have a child.

356
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,010
Pick up the pace.

357
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,700
I'll put it right there.

358
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,220
After eating, take it to the kitchen.

359
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,250
Dad,

360
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,180
what happened to Ms. Tan?

361
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,140
She

362
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,290
resigned.

363
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,250
Resigned?

364
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,010
She won't be working

365
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,860
at the school for the time being

366
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,010
because her family is in trouble.

367
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,010
Did she give birth to me for money

368
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,050
and then leave with it?

369
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,180
You...

370
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,980
I saw it online.

371
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,570
Do you believe those things online?

372
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,860
I don't know.

373
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,810
Can I see her?

374
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,730
I want to ask her in person.

375
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,900
She

376
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,250
hasn't been in the best shape lately.

377
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,730
We won't be able to see her for a while.

378
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,770
Do you

379
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,730
remember what I told you?

380
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,050
You can't

381
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,010
just believe what you hear.

382
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,940
Need to feel it for yourself.

383
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,090
You know Ms. Tan.

384
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,770
You know what kind of person

385
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,980
she is.

386
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,420
Would she do such a thing?

387
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,700
You're old enough

388
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,810
to have your own judgment.

389
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,580
So,

390
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,660
haven't you

391
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,660
revealed yourselves to Le?

392
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,420
He is quite sensible.

393
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,420
At such a young age,

394
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,860
he has his own ideas.

395
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,060
He figured it out

396
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,460
that I'm his mother.

397
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,940
Feng Rui and I were thinking,

398
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,940
what would be the best way

399
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,340
for us three to live together?

400
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,780
Perhaps Le saw me as a friend back then.

401
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,220
At first, we got along.

402
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,380
But

403
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,100
when I found out he was my child,

404
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,900
I got so anxious.

405
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,940
Desperately wanted

406
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,700
to acknowledge him

407
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,860
and get closer to him.

408
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,340
But kids

409
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,620
tend to be rebellious.

410
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,500
So he feels distant from me.

411
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,700
Anyway, I think

412
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,380
I'll take it slowly.

413
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,380
No rush.

414
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,500
Need to find the right opportunity.

415
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,380
Ting,

416
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,900
you know I've

417
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,460
always hoped within my lifetime

418
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,460
to see you build your own family.

419
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,460
When I heard this news,

420
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,100
I was so happy,

421
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,940
but also deeply remorseful.

422
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,980
Think about it.

423
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,660
Over all these years,

424
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,340
you've gone through so much.

425
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,980
Yet, I wasn't by your side

426
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,180
to protect you.

427
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,140
Dad,

428
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,780
I didn't want to tell you these things,

429
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,020
afraid you'd worry too much.

430
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,300
Those matters are past.

431
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,340
Look, I'm perfectly fine.
(Watch on www.kisskh.id to support Admin)

432
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,620
If Feng Rui,

433
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,980
Le, and I

434
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,940
can acknowledge

435
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,460
each other in the end,

436
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,620
it would be wonderful

437
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,940
for the four of us to live together.

438
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,940
Right?

439
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,340
Yes.

440
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,980
What brings you here today?

441
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,540
This card,

442
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,100
please give it

443
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,660
to Gao Hui.

444
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,860
This is the return, principal

445
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,540
and interest on the investment

446
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,620
she made in me 12 years ago.

447
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,780
I don't want my career

448
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,580
to be built on ruining others' lives.

449
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,020
I doted on you when I was little,

450
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,300
so when I was told to give you the best,

451
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,700
as long as it was good for you,

452
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,700
I never had any objections.

453
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,860
But I never thought

454
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,940
you would hate me the most now.

455
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,060
And

456
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,620
don't need to pay it back.

457
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,900
This is a debt I incurred.

458
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,060
So, no matter how long it takes,

459
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,900
I will pay it all off.

460
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,620
Honestly,

461
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
those 12 years

462
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,900
were constant worry.

463
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,460
Now that things have hit rock bottom,

464
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,900
I'm actually lighter than ever.

465
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,660
And I'll hustle for it

466
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,420
when the lease ends.

467
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,340
Don't worry.

468
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,100
I'll find a job.

469
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,420
As for Mom and Dad,

470
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,340
please tell them

471
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,380
that I've let them down.

472
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,140
I'll find time to see them.

473
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
You may have to visit them more often.

474
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,860
I'm disappointed in you,

475
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,660
but I don't hate you.

476
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,740
Shuhan.

477
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,100
Yuan,

478
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,140
I'm sorry.

479
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,580
Apologize to Siting.

480
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:15,900
Hello.

481
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,100
Is your dad asleep?

482
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,260
Yes.

483
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,100
And Le?

484
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,780
Is he asleep?

485
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,300
He's asleep too.

486
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,100
How was your dad today?

487
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,540
Still the same,

488
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,980
but in a good mood being back here.

489
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,980
He's happy to see you.

490
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,220
I'm doing fine.

491
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,220
I could come back and stay with him.

492
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,940
Haven't felt this way for ages.

493
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,260
That's great.

494
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,020
Can you take care

495
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,140
of him by yourself?

496
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,940
Yes, don't worry.

497
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,540
I can spend some time with him.

498
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,500
You've had a long day too.

499
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,140
If nothing's wrong,

500
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,460
go to bed early.

501
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,620
Don't stay up too late.

502
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,740
If anything happens,

503
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
call me right away.

504
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,460
Goodnight.

505
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,900
Dad, do you remember?

506
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,260
When I was little,

507
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,700
you always took me flying kites.

508
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,780
Of course.

509
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,300
Back then,

510
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,900
most people bought
their kites ready-made.

511
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,180
But you made ours by hand.

512
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,660
And every kite

513
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,300
you made was always

514
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,660
the most beautiful one in the sky!

515
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,620
I also remember one time

516
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,580
we were flying a big dragonfly kite.

517
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,700
I must have been in Grade Six.

518
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,140
We got it flying high,

519
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,300
and then it got tangled up

520
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,340
with a girl's kite nearby.

521
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,260
I was so anxious!

522
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,380
You pulled hard on the string.

523
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,580
In the end, the string broke,

524
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,780
and the kite flew away.

525
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,020
You cried for ages,

526
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,740
and nothing I said could console you.

527
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,420
Qu Zhen,

528
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,260
what is it?

529
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,180
Old Sir's back.

530
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,420
Careful, it's hot!

531
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:41,780
It's fine.

532
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,220
Alright.

533
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,900
Someone's knocking.

534
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,900
I'll get it, Dad.

535
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,820
Okay.

536
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,500
Coming.

537
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,220
Ms. Tan!

538
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,740
Qu Zhen, come in.

539
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,460
Ting!

540
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,300
Who is it?

541
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,580
Look who's here!

542
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,740
Old Sir.

543
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,580
Inside.

544
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,460
Old Sir.

545
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,300
Qu Zhen!

546
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,460
My girl!

547
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,500
Thank you.

548
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:09,980
What

549
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,740
brings you here?

550
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,540
And you brought gifts.

551
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,380
Uncle Wang said

552
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,580
he'd bring me to see you.

553
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,020
Her mom told her you're visiting me,

554
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,620
so she called me

555
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,700
and said she wanted to see you.

556
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,660
I really miss you.

557
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,700
How are you?

558
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,860
I'm doing great.

559
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,260
Ms. Tan told me

560
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,580
you've made great progress

561
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,420
and won an award, right?

562
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,260
Yes.

563
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,580
You're making us proud.

564
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,580
I didn't misjudge you back then,

565
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,780
my child.

566
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,980
Yuan,

567
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,260
come on in!

568
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
I have to go now.

569
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,140
Still have work to do.

570
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,980
Well, thank you for your trouble.

571
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,780
Not at all.

572
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,540
Can I have a word with you privately?

573
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,740
Okay.

574
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,260
Rui, you're here.

575
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,300
I'm back.

576
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,620
Need any help?

577
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,060
No.

578
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:17,700
Have a seat.

579
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,620
I'll be done quickly.

580
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,780
Making a vegetable soup.

581
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,260
Okay.

582
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,260
I'll put my things here.

583
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,220
Now I know why he was rushing around,

584
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,660
because you were coming.

585
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,580
Did you bring Le?

586
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,340
He's at school.

587
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,140
This must be Le's chessboard.

588
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,140
Left it behind last time.

589
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,860
Let's play a game.

590
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,500
It's been ages since I played.

591
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,020
I'm quite the Gobang expert.

592
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,660
I taught Le how to play.

593
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:12,980
Here we go.

594
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,220
Just finished up to this?

595
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,220
So we can continue.

596
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,460
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

597
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,060
Thirteen ones.

598
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,700
White.

599
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,540
White or black.

600
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,140
How are you doing?

601
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,620
Pretty good.

602
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,140
Mr. Tan looks well too.

603
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,300
Actually,

604
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,060
I feel ashamed to face you.

605
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,460
Don't say that.

606
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,180
It'll be over soon.

607
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,060
Everything will get better.

608
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,460
Qu Zhen said

609
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,900
she wants to spend the day with you.

610
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,540
I've taken leave from school for her.

611
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,700
I should go now.

612
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,980
Drive safely

613
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,620
on your way back.

614
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,260
If Shuhan were to apologize to you,

615
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,500
admit her mistakes,

616
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,060
and correct them,

617
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,980
would you forgive her?

618
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,060
If it were you, would you?

619
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,420
Goodbye.

620
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,300
Hey, can't let you keep going like this.

621
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,700
No.

622
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,660
Careful.

623
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,060
You're making

624
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,060
this move, huh?

625
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,460
I'm about to beat you.

626
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,380
That's a good one!

627
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,060
This move.

628
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,100
That's a bit...

629
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,820
You're attacking me from both sides!

630
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,820
Let me think. Look.

631
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,020
All I can do

632
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,060
is block you.

633
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,260
I won.

634
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,580
Wait, I just…

635
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,020
I got distracted.

636
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,780
No, not like that.

637
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,220
No.

638
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,780
Play again!

639
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
Undo those two moves!

640
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,500
Can't leave it like that!

641
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,260
Here!

642
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,740
Two more dishes.

643
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,140
See if you like them.

644
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,780
Ms. Tan,

645
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,220
did you live here with Old Sir

646
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,380
when you were little?

647
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:27,900
Yes.

648
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,140
It's my first time here,

649
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,060
but it feels incredibly familiar.

650
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,180
I like this place.

651
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,140
Really?

652
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:35,780
Yes.

653
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,740
That's great!

654
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,260
I also like it here.

655
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,060
Can I sleep with you tonight?

656
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,060
Of course.

657
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,420
Great!

658
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,140
Sit down.

659
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,300
Come on.

660
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,860
The dishes are ready!

661
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Let's eat!

662
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,820
Try your Old Sir's cooking.

663
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,460
Okay, Dad!

664
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,900
This is my favorite!

665
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,700
My dad knows I like meat.

666
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,620
Yeah.

667
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
Is it good?

668
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,300
Delicious.

669
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,340
Should have one of these.

670
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,180
Eat more.

671
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,500
Take your time.

672
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,940
Have this meat later.

673
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,660
Okay.

674
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,460
Look at me.

675
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,100
Ms. Tan,

676
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,100
Old Sir said

677
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,180
you never give up since you were little.

678
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,980
What did he say?

679
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,380
He said...

680
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,740
He said

681
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,580
you are...

682
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,580

683
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,980

684
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,180

you'll surely,

686
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,860

689

No.

A dancer like yourself.

691
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:53,940
Let's go.

692
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,860
Old Sir, I'm leaving.

693
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,540
My child,

694
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,660
keep working hard.

695
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,180
I'll be waiting for your good news.

696
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,860
Live to be a hundred!

697
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,780
Go ahead.

698
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,980
We'll be off then.

699
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,940

700
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,060

701
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,780
Be safe.

702
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,740
I will.

703
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,900
Thanks for everything.

704
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,260
Goodbye.

705
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:26,780
Bye-bye.

706
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,180
Go.

707
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,820
Goodbye.

708
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,980
Goodbye, Ms. Tan.

709
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,220
Bye-bye.

710
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,820
When hearts are united,

711
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,660
there is no distance.

712
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,060

Qu Zhen is a warm-hearted child.

Yes.

716
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,980
In Hongyuan County,
Sichuan's Aba Prefecture,

717
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,740
there are many children like Qu Zhen.

718
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,700
They have rich imaginations,

719
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,100
and they love life.

720
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,260
Being with them

721
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,660
is like stepping

722
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,420
into a colorful world.

723
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,580
I've always had a wish.

724
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,540
When I'm capable,

725
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,260
I'll establish an education fund

726
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,780
in Hongyuan County,
Sichuan's Aba Prefecture,

727
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,580
so that children like Qu Zhen

728
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
can leave the mountains

729
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,620
and leave the grasslands

730
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,180
to see the world beyond,

731
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,580
so their lives

732
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,460
can become more colorful.

733
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,820
We can accomplish this together,

734
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,300

00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,220
I haven't been very good at my job,

776
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,220
making Siting go

777
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,860
through so much hardship.

778
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,060
Don't talk nonsense, Dad.

779
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,540
I've always felt like a princess.

780
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,940
Princess?

781
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,300
But in front of Rui,

782
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,300
you should tone down

783
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,740
those princess airs of yours.

784
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,180
Obviously, Rui is someone

785
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,580
you can truly rely on.

786
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,060
He's mature, steady,

787
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,860
warm-hearted,

788
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,060
and very considerate.

789
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,980
Ting

790
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,740
is gentle and kind-hearted.

791
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,180
So you two must live

792
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,060
a good life together.

793
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,980
Got it, Dad.

794
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,260
Come on.

795
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,540
I wish you both eternal happiness.

796
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,300
- Come on.
- Thank you.

797
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,420
Okay.

798
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,620
Please rest assured.

799
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,620
We'll remember what you've said.

800
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,300
I'll take good care of her.

801
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,380
Okay.

802
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,540
Quick.

803
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,300
Eat it while it's hot.

804
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:04,980
Have more.

805
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,540
It's delicious.

806
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,180
Truly delicious.

807
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,180
Dad, why aren't you eating?

808
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,740
I'll

809
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,940
use the restroom.

810
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,500
Delicious!

811
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,180
Slow down.

812
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,300
Okay.

813
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,860
Eat more.

814
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,460
Eat a little more!

815
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:32,900
Dad!

816
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,700
Mr. Tan.

817
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:35,460
Dad!

818
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,060
Let me!

819
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,500
Mr. Tan.

820
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:40,620
- Dad!
- Mr. Tan.

821
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,580
Dad!

822
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,100
Are you okay?

823
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,940
Dad, get up.

824
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:43,740
Here.

825
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,740
[Emergency Room]

826
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:45,700
Doctor!

827
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,140
The patient is stable for now.

828
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,620
He should regain consciousness soon.

829
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,620
However, he's been experiencing

830
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,580
these symptoms for some time.

831
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,740
It's advanced lung cancer.

832
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,660
You need to be mentally prepared.

833
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,460
Can we see him?

834
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,020
You can't enter this area.

835
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,500
Please complete
the hospital admission procedures.

836
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,100
Alright, I will.

837
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:09,700
Don't worry.

838
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,460
Wait here

839
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,700

840
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,780
