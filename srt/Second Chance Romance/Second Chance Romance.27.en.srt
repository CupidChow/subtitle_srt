stay here with him,

So low.

You can't run sideways.

176
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,220
Little one,

177
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,010
would you like me

178
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,980
to fly it with you?

179
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,010
I was really good at flying kites

180
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,730
when I was young.

181
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,650
Shall we give it a try?

182
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,340
Okay. Come on.

183
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,980
Listen to my directions.

184
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,610
Here.

185
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,220
One, two!

186
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,250
Run!

187
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,300
Let out the line!

188
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,980
Let out the line!

189
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,980
Good!

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,730
Be careful!

191
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,460
Watch your step!

192
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,490
Slow down. Be careful.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,650
It's up!

194
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,650
See, it's up now.

195
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,010
Quick, you can let out a bit more.

196
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,250
Let out the line!

197
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,250
Run a few steps!

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,610
Hurry!

199
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,130
Come on.

200
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,530
Here, try it yourself.

201
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,370
You try it yourself.

202
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,770
See,

203
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,610
it's up now.

204
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,130
Right?

205
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,730
Give it a tug.

206
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,250
Give it a tug like this.

207
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,730
Feel...

208
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,370
Feel how the wind catches it.

209
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,770
Yes. Use your hands to steer.

210
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,220
Okay.

211
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,250
Good.

212
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,010
Be careful.

213
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,610
Can you...

214
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,890
Can you manage it yourself?

215
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,340
Be careful.

216
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:45,730
It's fine.

217
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,490
Okay.

218
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,180
Look.

219
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,610
Le, you...

220
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,420
Le, can you control it?

221
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,220
Thank you, sir.

222
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,610
Let's go, Dad.

223
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,940
Let's go.

224
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,530
Go.

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,010
I'll make dinner

226
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,890
for you tonight.

227
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,650
Alright.

228
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,220
Ting,

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,010
they always say
sons take after their mothers.

230
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,340
That saying is absolutely right.

231
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,980
Le is exactly like you

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,490
when you were little.

233
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,730
So full of energy.

234
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,730
Seems like he's got
an endless supply of it.

235
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,130
Those big, bright eyes

236
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,220
are so lively,

237
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,770
always full

238
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,770
of curiosity

239
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,890
and a thirst for knowledge.

240
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,610
He's just so adorable.

241
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,370
I really wish

242
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,770
I could spend more time with him.

243
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,530
How about

244
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,340
you teach me

245
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,610
how to make
fish head and tofu soup tonight?

246
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,770
Sure.

247
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,730
Once I learn,

248
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,610
I can make it for Le.

249
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,370
I'll tell him

250
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,850
it's his grandpa's signature dish!

251
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,100
Let's go buy a fish head now.

252
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:51,610
Let's go.

253
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,100
Over there?

254
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,940
Okay.

255
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,700
Dad.

256
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,130
Dad,

257
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,420
let me repeat it.

258
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,180
Wash the fish head

259
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,420
and drain the water.

260
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,100
Then pan-fry it in oil,

261
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,100
put it in a pot to stew,

262
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,610
and add water.

263
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:08,940
Right?

264
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,530
Then you can add some ham slices.

265
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,130
Finally, add the tofu and vegetables.

266
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,700
Right?

267
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,650
Is that correct?

268
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,460
You weren't saying anything. I thought

269
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,650
I got it wrong.

270
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,890
Remember

271
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,180
to use hot water.

272
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,370
Hot water. Got it.

273
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,130
Hot water.

274
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,610
Then add the hot water.

275
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,460
And we need to buy

276
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,130
the biggest fish head.
(Watch on www.kisskh.id to support Admin)

277
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,650
It's hot.

278
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,610
Dad,

279
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,370
try it now.

280
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,850
The flavor must be right.

281
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,890
It's a bit hot.

282
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,130
Dad,

283
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,180
have a taste.

284
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,850
Dad?

285
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,130
Hello, Mr. Gao.

286
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,940
Make a copy of last time's
financial reimbursement form

287
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,940
and bring it down to me.

288
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,460
B1 floor. I need it urgently.

289
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,580
Right now?

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,060
Yes. Immediately.

291
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,370
Okay.

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,700
Master, Mr. Gao

293
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,700
wants me to bring

294
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,180
a copy of the reimbursement form down
to him now.

295
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,130
Go ahead.

296
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,730
Make it quick.

297
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,980
Master, could you come down with me?

298
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,580
I still have some work to finish.

299
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,420
Wei, is it a lot of stuff?

300
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,770
Not really.

301
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,300
I'll head down then.

302
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,890
Go ahead.

303
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,300
Hello, Mr. Gao.

304
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,650
I'm in the underground parking lot now.

305
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,060
Where are you?

306
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,980
Area A?

307
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,650
Okay. I'm coming.

308
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,200
[Longevity]

309
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,770
Gao Haotian!

310
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,140
Stop it!

311
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,180
Stop!

312
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,660
Stop!

313
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,090
Master!

314
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,660
Gao Haotian!

315
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,330
Master!

316
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,140
Gao Haotian!

317
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,620
Gao Haotian!

318
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,940
I'm recording this, I'm telling you!

319
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,980
I'm recording!

320
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,010
Stop it!

321
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,290
I'm recording. I'm calling the police!

322
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,980
You're utterly reckless!

323
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,980
You're done for this time.

324
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,660
You're going to
face legal consequences for this!

325
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,090
Don't move!

326
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,660
Tan,

327
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,530
delete the video.

328
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,250
Let's talk this out.

329
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,620
Talk it out?

330
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,250
There's nothing to talk about.

331
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,900
You're finished, I'm telling you!

332
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,250
Shi Wei, don't be afraid!

333
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,250
I'm calling the police right now!

334
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,140
Don't be scared!

335
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,770
Tan, delete the video.

336
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,050
Let's talk this out.

337
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,980
Talk it out?

338
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,570
It's too late for that now!

339
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,530
Just you wait.

340
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,380
You beast!

341
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,290
Name your price.

342
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,460
Just don't call the police.

343
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,050
Do you think Shi Wei

344
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,420
can just pretend nothing happened?

345
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,900
Do you think money

346
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,250
can solve everything?

347
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,730
Alright.

348
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,900
You're a monster!

349
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,290
Alright.

350
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,420
I was wrong.

351
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,010
Sorry.

352
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,380
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,250
Sorry.

354
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,140
I was wrong.

355
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,770
Master,

356
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,530
is he...

357
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,730
is he dead?

358
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,220
It seems so.

359
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,860
It seems so.

360
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,620
Master, what should we do?

361
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,530
Master, what do we do now?

362
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,050
Wei, don't be afraid.

363
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,330
Don't be afraid.

364
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,460
He...

365
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,250
He fell...

366
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,770
He fell by himself.

367
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,010
He fell and died!

368
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,180
I didn't touch him!

369
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,330
None of us touched him.

370
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,380
I have evidence here.

371
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,570
I can show it to the police.

372
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,090
He fell by himself!

373
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,220
Master,

374
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,770
you can't show the video to the police.

375
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,730
What are you saying, Wei?

376
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,490
This is evidence of his crime!

377
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:10,940
Master,

378
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,770
you just say...

379
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,490
Say I was just here
to deliver the reimbursement form.

380
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,290
He fell,

381
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,460
and you happened to see it.

382
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,770
Can't we say that?

383
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,250
What...

384
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,010
What are you talking about?

385
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,490
That's not the truth.

386
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,810
We can't lie.

387
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,980
That monster assaulted you,

388
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,810
then fell and died.

389
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,660
He got what he deserved!

390
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,010
Why are you still protecting him?

391
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,980
Master!

392
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,490
If you give the video to the police,

393
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,940
how can I go on living?

394
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,940
Wei,

395
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,290
you're really out of it.

396
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,770
You're like a daughter to me.

397
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,290
I'm protecting you.

398
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,290
Only by doing this
can we prove your innocence.

399
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,420
You understand?

400
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,900
Master.

401
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,700
Alright.

402
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,050
We're calling the police.

403
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,530
I'm calling them right now.

404
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,010
He can't be forgiven!

405
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,140
Call the police.

406
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,660
So many people.

407
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:18,770
Here.

408
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,530
Let's go, Wei.

409
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,660
Let's go.

410
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,770
Go.

411
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,980
Call the police.

412
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,290
I'll call the police.

413
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,940
I will call the police.

414
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,620
Thank you.

415
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,380
Thank you.

416
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,090
Come on.

417
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,250
Come on. Alright.

418
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,220
Thank you.

419
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,250
Ms. Gao.

420
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,700
Mr. Gao had an accident.

421
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:55,980
Ms. Gao.

422
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,460
Ms. Gao,

423
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,810
can you tell us

424
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,660
about Gao Haotian's fall?

425
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,420
How will

426
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,290
such an accident affect the Gao family?

427
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,730
Is the story
about Gao Haotian's fall true?

428
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,620
Ms. Gao,

429
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,090
regarding this accidental fall...

430
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,050
Haotian!

431
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,940
Grandpa.

432
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,180
Dad.

433
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,770
Grandpa.

434
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,460
Grandpa!

435
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,090
Dad.

436
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,730
Grandpa.

437
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,460
Grandpa!

438
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,460
Dad!

439
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,770
Dad!

440
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,570
Call an ambulance!

441
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,620
What's wrong?

442
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,620
Dad.

443
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,050
Dad!

444
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,160
[Longevity]

445
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,420
Okay.

446
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,140
Alright.

447
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,140
I left the keys on the coffee table.

448
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,620
Thank you.

449
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,380
Okay.

450
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,980
I smell hot pot.

451
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,770
Right?

452
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,420
Let's go.

453
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,530
Dad, do you remember?

454
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,490
The first house

455
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,050
on the corner there is Niu's.

456
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,050
Yes, Niu's.

457
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,490
Yes.

458
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,730
Does she

459
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,730
still live there?

460
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,770
Probably moved away.

461
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,900
Hello?

462
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,010
Ting.

463
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,730
Ms. Zhuang.

464
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,530
I heard.

465
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,770
Sorry for your loss.

466
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,700
My dad's wishes

467
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,980
have all been fulfilled, I guess.

468
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,730
He can rest with no regrets.

469
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,940
That's good.

470
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,530
If you need any help, just let me know.

471
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,660
Alright?

472
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,180
Take care of yourself.

473
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,420
Thank you, Ms. Zhuang.

474
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,090
I'll help you take it up.

475
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,860
Feng Rui.

476
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,810
I can manage on my own.

477
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,530
Thank you.

478
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,250
Heard her kid's about to finish
elementary school.

479
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:51,770
No way.

480
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,420
I saw Tan Siting picking up a kid

481
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,460
at the gate of No. 1 Elementary School.

482
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,730
The original post was deleted.

483
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,980
Probably got paid off.

484
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,490
That child

485
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,810
is the little heir of Tianlu Trade.

486
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,660
No wonder she wanted money.

487
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,140
A habitual homewrecker!

488
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,980
If she had taken the proper path...

489
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,660
When one person criticizes you,

490
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,940
maybe both have issues.

491
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,420
But when everyone criticizes you,

492
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,770
you should reflect on yourself.

493
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,700
Because she's shameless.

494
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,490
She's not even that good-looking.

495
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,050
Who is it?

496
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,460
If her acting wasn't good,
how could she seduce so many men?

497
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,770
I never liked her.

498
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,290
This video of yours is very good.

499
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,730
There are too many women
pretending to be innocent

500
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,730
while fooling around.

501
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,180
She's not quite right in the head.

502
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,420
Secretly using men to climb up.

503
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,460
A shameless conniving woman.

504
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,720
[Mourning]

505
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,380
No way.

506
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,010
I saw Tan Siting picking up a kid

507
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,050
at the gate of No. 1 Elementary School.

508
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,730
A shameless conniving woman.

509
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:04,940
Good morning.

510
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,570
Ms. Wen.

511
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,730
Madam,

512
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,700
look.

513
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,530
But this time

514
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,010
she didn't get her way.

515
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,250
She didn't get any money.

516
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,530
She...

517
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,050
She actually set her sights
on the child.

518
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,860
She's going to fight for custody.

519
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,180
This is utterly shameless!

520
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,620
Absolutely shocking!

521
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,570
Wang Shuhan,

522
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,180
how could you drag Le into this?

523
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,570
Are you insane?

524
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,810
What do you mean?

525
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,570
I don't understand.

526
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,420
Even if I were the worst person,

527
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,380
I wouldn't involve a child.

528
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,980
Look online yourself!

529
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,050
She...

530
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,620
She actually set her sights
on the child.

531
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,530
She's going to fight for custody.

532
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,900
This is utterly shameless!

533
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,380
I don't even know

534
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,570
who this so-called Cat Guy is.

535
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,330
I didn't give him Le's information.

536
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,220
Listen,

537
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,730
we had a deal.

538
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,010
Apart from Tan Siting,

539
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,810
no one else was to be involved!

540
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,570
Now it's caused a huge scandal.

541
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,380
Le's

542
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,330
location,

543
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,730
grade, and class

544
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,420
are all exposed!

545
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,940
I told you,

546
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,940
I didn't give him Le's information.

547
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,010
This wasn't my doing.

548
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,380
And I already deleted the original post!

549
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,250
I'm telling you,

550
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,220
no matter what it takes,

551
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,180
you need to shut this down now!

552
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,010
Using a child as a tool for profit...

553
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,050
Hello?

554
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,490
Hello, Mr. Zhu.

555
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,900
This is Feng Rui.

556
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,770
Mr. Feng, hello.

557
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,180
Are you still inquiring
about the previous matter?

558
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,620
Yes.

559
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,050
I just

560
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,900
came across

561
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,420
some false articles online.

562
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,420
Yes, Mr. Feng.

563
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,420
You've seen them too?

564
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,090
I saw them as well.

565
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:58,570
Yes.

566
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,530
This is already defamation.

567
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,220
We can sue the person responsible.

568
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,700
You just need to prepare

569
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,730
the corresponding materials.

570
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,180
What kind of materials?

571
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,220
Any evidence that can prove

572
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,620
the facts were fabricated

573
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,140
will do.

574
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:15,900
Understood.

575
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,090
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

576
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,420
No problem.

577
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,280
[President's Office]

578
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,140
Ms. Gao,

Several of our long-term distributors

581

582
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,860

583
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,860
and our company

584
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,860
are true.

00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,010
Ms. Gao,

587
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,140
should we contact a PR company

588
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,330

594

I don't care

595
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,940
if it's true or false.

596
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,490

have been asking about it.

724
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,530

729
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,860
it doesn't really seem to affect

730
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,130
