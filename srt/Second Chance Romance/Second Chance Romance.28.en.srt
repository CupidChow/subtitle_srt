[Episode 28]

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,660
Le.

20
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,330
Here.

21
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,290
Have some.

22
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,890
Thank you.

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,410
Le,

24
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,890
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,820
I know many around you

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,220
may be discussing things,

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,730
or some may have told you something.

28
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,850
But don't believe any of it.

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,010
It's my fault.

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,290
I didn't expect.

31
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,290
that it could escalate to this point.

32
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,660
I didn't want to hurt you.

33
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,820
So, I'm really sorry.

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,010
So,

35
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,380
what they're saying is fake,

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,380
right?

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,820
All is fake.

38
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,820
My dad said

39
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,450
he knows you're anxious now,

40
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,260
and you even got sick

41
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,690
because of the rumors online.

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,730
This illness can lead to depression.

43
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,820
You know all this is false,

44
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,380
so ignore what you hear.

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,100
What's more important is your feeling.

46
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,290
Dad taught me that.

47
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,570
Here.

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,170
Must eat more vegetables.

50
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,220
Eat more.

51
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,500
Give it to Le.

52
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,570
Le should also eat.

53
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,170
Dad,

54
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,250
how is Ms. Tan's illness?

55
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,780
It can't be cured

56
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,850
by medication or injections.

57
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,140
She needs

58
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,220
to become happy.

59
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,220
It'll only be helpful for her

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,100
when her mood gets better.

61
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,050
But

62
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,020
you were a great help today.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,220
Made her want to eat something.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,660
What she needs most now

65
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,980
is someone

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,540
to be there with her.

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,250
More companionship.

00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,220
Dad,

70
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,340
can I come to see her

71
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,460
whenever I want?

72
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,140
Of course,

73
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,250
but you have exams soon.

74
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,700
After the exams,

75
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,810
you may accompany her anytime.

76
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,850
Can you handle it alone now?

77
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,850
Let's divide and conquer.

78
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,980
You do your part as a student,

79
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,660
and I do my part as an adult.

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,370
Clear labor division.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,100
Deal.

82
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,370
Sit tight.

and evidence.

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,100
I don't feel at ease.

98
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,340
I want Tan Siting to regret it.

99

I'll give it to you in person."

100
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,170
In person?

101
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,660
You must be Joice, right?

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,220
So you're

103
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,900
in charge of the Lieqi public account.

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,290
Go ahead, what's the scoop?

105
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:33,900
Give it to us.

106
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,850
You exposed all the scoops
about Tan Siting?

107
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,980
Yes.

108
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,170
What scoop do you have?

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,340
I can't give it to you for free.

110
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,900
We could exchange information.

111
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,980
I'll tell you

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,900
what I know,

113
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,460
and you'll tell me

114
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,660
your sources.

115
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,730
I'm very curious.

116
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,220
Don't worry,

117
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,340
I have a personal grudge against her.

118
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,100
So I don't want her to get off easily.

119
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,660
But there's a gap

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,050
between the facts

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,220
I know and what

122
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,900
you've exposed.

123
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,850
Therefore, I'd like to know

124
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,810
where you got the information.

125
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,660
I see.

126
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,100
What we have can't compare

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,290
to what you know

128
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,340
as the party involved.

129
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,100
But you also know

130
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,220
how it is on the internet.

131
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,140
People like sensational things.

132
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,540
So, we did

133
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,460
a little bit

134
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,340
of creative rewriting.

135
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,850
That's all.

136
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,340
Therefore, give me your scoop.

137
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,850
Name your price.

138
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,660
We can talk.

139
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,220
I've recorded what you said.

140
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,780
Who are you?

141
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,220
That's an invasion

142
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,100
of my portrait rights.

143
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,540
You're

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,540
Cat Guy, right?

145
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,540
You posted the articles online.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,220
What you just said

147
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,980
constitutes the crime of defamation.

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:03,980
Halt.

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,100
Bro.

150
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,220
Bro.

151
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,850
It's not worth it.

152
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,780
I was trying to make money.

153
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,660
Things on the internet

154
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,410
were written casually,

155
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,220
so everyone likes them.

156
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,460
I have

157
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,850
a group of people

158
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,660
to support.

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,340
It's for making money.

160
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,220
Bro, it's not worth it.

161
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,980
Really.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,660
Alright.

163
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,540
This can be settled.

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,220
Right now,

165
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,660
delete all articles and videos
about Tan Siting,

166
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,050
and this matter will be settled.

167
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,820
Okay.

168
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:35,770
I will.

169
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,530
Delete.

170
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,100
I can help you,

171
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,770
but not just for Tan Siting.

172
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,770
I feel that Le

173
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,420
shouldn't be involved.

174
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,420
We should resolve it ASAP.

175
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,300
If you repeat this,

176
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,890
you might not be so lucky.

177
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,100
I'm Wang Shuhan.

178
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,650
I posted the post online

179
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,340
about Tan Siting

180
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,700
and fabricated its content.

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,850
It doesn't matter anymore

182
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,300
why I spread rumors about her.

183
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,890
Today, I'm not posting the video

184
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,250
to seek her forgiveness

185
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,530
or the forgiveness of the public.

186
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,220
I just want to tell you

187
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,770
what the truth is.

188
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,650
This matter

189
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,610
started 12 years ago.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,010
Tan Siting and I

191
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,980
studied ballet together.

192
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,530
We were each other's best friends

193
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,530
in this world.

194
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,420
But I was jealous

195
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,580
of everything about her

196
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,220
and also hated my mediocrity.

197
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,730
To get investment in my brother

198
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,180
and to pay off my debts,

199
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,300
I betrayed my best friend,

200
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,060
spreading fabrications to ruin her.

201
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,010
Tan Siting,

202
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,650
I apologize to you.

203
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,820
Do you know?

204
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,420
In this world,

205
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,940
you're like another side of me,

206
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,460
a side that I can never become.

207
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,650
I hope you can always be happy.

208
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,850
Still hate her?

209
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,650
I said I don't hate her.

210
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,300
At least the truth is out now.

211
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,060
At least for now,

212
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,940
everyone knows you were wronged.

213
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,580
So what?

214
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,130
For so many years,

215
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,580
she was so close to me.

216
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,300
She hurt me.

217
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,700
I think,

218
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,130
Ting…

219
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,420
I know what you want to say.

220
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,820
I'll get through this,

221
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,300
not by relying on others,

222
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,700
but on my own.

223
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,200
[How can she apologize so calmly?]

224
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,160
[You hurt someone,
and then a casual "sorry"?]

225
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,520
[Let her stab you twice
and then apologize?]

226
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,650
Look at yourself properly,

227
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,420
and you'll realize you're nice.

228
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,420
I also wish you find happiness.

229
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,770
With such a big thing happening,

230
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,420
why are you...?

231
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,180
Rui

232
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,820
discovered it.

233
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,940
She didn't tell anyone.

234
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,940
No wonder now the suppliers

235
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,130
and the company's directors

236
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,060
are starting to call me again.

237
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,650
You know

238
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,530
she has a strong sense

239
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,300
of pride.

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,650
The doctor said
that with timely medication,

241
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,460
the disease won't progress quickly.

242
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,940
What are Hui's symptoms?

243
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,890
She can't remember recent things.

244
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,180
Has to write them down

245
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,890
in a notebook, one by one.

246
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,460
I'll go see her.

247
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,940
Don't.

248
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,490
Dad,

249
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,770
please don't go for now.

250
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,770
If she sees you,

251
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,770
she'll feel bad.

252
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,890
If you care about her,

253
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,490
act like you know nothing.

254
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,940
Coming.

255
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,650
Okay, I got it.

256
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,650
Ms. Ming.

257
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,010
That's all for now.

258
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,340
Where's Dad?

259
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,220
Inside.

260
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,530
Let me know if there are any updates.

261
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:03,890
Rui.

262
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,650
Dad,

263
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,180
how are things?

264
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,060
The public is criticizing Tianlu.

265
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,180
It's getting more serious.

266
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,220
Tianlu's stock price has been affected.

267
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,100
I've received calls

268
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,180
from several of our partners.

269
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,530
Under this public opinion,

270
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,530
Tianlu's reputation will be harmed.

271
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,650
I'm afraid we'll see a lot of returns.

272
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,940
What should we do now?

273
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,580
We need to act fast

274
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,650
to turn the tide.

275
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,770
Where's Mom?

276
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,250
Does she know about it?

277
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,490
She hasn't gone to the company for days.

278
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,530
I haven't discussed it with her.

279
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:40,650
Hello,

280
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,460
Mr. Tang.

281
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,650
Please call and tell the PR company

282
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,890
that tomorrow morning, we're

283
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,370
holding an emergency board meeting.

284
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,650
Yes, tomorrow.

285
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:51,890
Morning.

286
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,770
Alright, I got it.

287
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,940
Hello.

288
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,890
Give it to me.

289
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,890
Hand me that file, please.

290
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,650
I believe

291
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,890
we need to hold a board meeting ASAP

292
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,770
to calm the shareholders' concerns

293
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,300
and stop the negative press
from escalating.

294
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,060
Dad,

295
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,100
Grandpa,

296
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,250
don't worry.

297
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,300
Leave Tianlu to me.

298
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,300
The investors are getting nervous.

299
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,530
Cat Guy was trying to scam money.

300
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,530
Warning to the clickbait accounts.

301
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,700
Tianlu Group has responded.

302
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,370
Stay rational.

303
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,100
Tianlu's young heir clarified

304
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,180
that he and Tan Siting
are in a free relationship.

305
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
[Tianlu Trade: Do not believe
or spread rumors.]

306
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,460
Tianlu Group threatens legal action

307
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,060
against rumor-mongers,

308
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,010
urges public rationality.

309
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,420
Mr. Gao,

310
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,130
what brings you here today?

311
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,530
Is this a sudden board meeting

312
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,980
to announce something?

313
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,890
Is there anything good to announce?

314
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,580
Tianlu is in such big trouble again.

315
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,650
Many orders

316
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,890
have been canceled.

317
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,650
The Overseas Marketing Department
isn't too bad.

318
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,650
But if this keeps escalating,

319
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,060
we'll fall.

320
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,300
Besides,

321
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,180
our stock price is falling.

322
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,130
I haven't seen Ms. Gao in ages.

323
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,300
When will she be here?

324
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,890
The meeting today

325
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,530
is to announce

326
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,530
that due to her health,

327
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,580
Gao Hui can't handle company affairs.

328
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,770
Feng Rui

329
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,650
will become Tianlu Trade's
Acting President.

330
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,760
[Tianlu Trade]

331
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,700
As

332
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,700
a renowned wine enterprise,

333
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,890
Tianlu's scale

334
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,250
and reputation

335
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,770
are widely recognized in the market.

336
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,010
Therefore,

337
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,010
we can't let

338
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,490
anything hurt our image.

339
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,460
In response to the false statements,

340
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,130
we must hold a press conference

341
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,580
to make an official clarification.

342
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,730
I think with our foundation
and strength,

343
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,140
we'll be able

344
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,250
to steadily weather this storm

345
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,090
and continue moving forward.

346
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,140
As the company's new leader,

347
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,140
I'll apply my experience
from creating a brand

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,290
to how we run the business here.

349
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,860
We need new energy

350
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,420
to drive our revenue

351
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,220
and leverage

352
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,660
our distribution advantages

353
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,660
to introduce our own brands into sales.

354
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,900
With solid product quality,

355
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,250
it'll become our new direction.

356
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,140
Please have confidence in me.

357
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,090
Together, we can

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,460
weather the storm

359
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,620
and march forward courageously.

360
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,940
Thank you.

361
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,490
Thank you all.

Feng.

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,290
Go to the company
and sort things out for me.

364
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,770
If you're not clear,

365
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,490
ask Mr. Tang.

366
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,490
I know about this.

367
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,660
Forget it.

368
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,940
I'll go by myself tomorrow.

369
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,180
You

370
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,010
should rest at home.

371
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,530

372
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,570
has returned to the company.

373
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,940
He's back?

374
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,290
But he doesn't know much
about the situation.

375
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,010
Is the company in a lot of trouble now?

376
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,700
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come back.

377
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,810
You wanted him to be back and help you.

378
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,330
Now that he's back,

379
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,380
you're worried.

380
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,900
Leave it to him.

381
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,420
I believe he can do it.

382
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,180
You've taken medicine today.

383
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,330
So starting tomorrow,

384
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,810
you'll be Tianlu's president.

385
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,570
To be precise, today.

386
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,620
There's a press conference tomorrow.

387
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,250
You've been working hard recently.

388
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,290
I was pushed into this position.

389
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,050
I don't know what will happen next.

390
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,290
Don't you worry.

391
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,050
Many things won't go

392
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,620
the way we expect them to,

393
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,010
right?

394
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,050
Yes.

395
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,220
What about you?

396
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,770
I won't have time to be with you.

397
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,220
Don't worry about me.

398
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,860
I'm doing just fine.

399
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,140
Focus on your own work.

400
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,620
I can take good care of myself.

401
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,250
Okay.

402
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,770
So nice to have you.

403
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,900
Work hard.

404
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,380
Go for it.

405
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:13,700
Bye.

406
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,360
[Tianlu Trade Press Conference]

407
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,250
Hello, friends from the media.

408
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,730
Thank you all

409
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,530
for attending today's press conference.

410
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,530
Some posts about our company

411
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,220
published on the internet

412
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,530
have sparked heated discussion online.

413
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,380
Some of the wording is harsh,

414
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,770
distorts the facts,

415
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,050
and is suspected
of slandering Tianlu Trade,

416
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,860
seriously affecting our reputation.

417
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,380
As to the incident of Gao Haotian,
the company's former VP,

418
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,770
Tianlu Trade

419
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,380
actively cooperated with the police

420
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,770
in investigating and gathering evidence.

421
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,860
It was concluded to be an accident.

422
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,180
Mr. Haotian Gao

423
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,490
was my uncle.

424
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,620
His untimely death

425
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,900
has always been my family's pain.

426
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,050
The incident caused

427
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,290
huge economic losses to the group.

428
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,380
But out of respect

429
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,380
for the deceased,

430
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,290
the company decided

431
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,140
not to issue a statement.

432
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,770
However, certain individuals

433
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,380
used it as a weapon for secondary harm.

434
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,380
On this,

435
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,570
I am deeply saddened.

436
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,620
We're issuing a serious warning.

437
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,770
If anyone continues
to spread rumors or slander,

438
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,940
we will take legal action

439
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,770
to defend our legitimate rights
and interests.

440
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,290
Mr. Feng, hello.

441
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,140
Is your return to Tianlu Trade

442
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,810
to help

443
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,660
the company overcome this crisis?

444
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,460
We're currently

445
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,420
facing a difficult time

446
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,290
for the business.

447
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,660
But

448
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,180
a crisis is also an opportunity.

449
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,180
Through this incident,

450
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,620
we've felt the impact of the internet

451
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,770
and understand

452
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,010
the importance of transformation.

453
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,010
The internet spreads information faster
than other channels.

454
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,330
We will launch an online store,

455
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,810
integrating it with our offline stores,

456
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,180
to open up a new front for Tianlu.

457
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,380
Look forward to growing
with our suppliers

458
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,530
and creating a new era.

459
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,530
Tan Siting, the ballerina

460
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,900
who is discussed most online,

461
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,050
is said to have given birth

462
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,330
to your son for money 12 years ago,

463
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,660
and then went to Paris

464
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,330
for her dream of ballet.

465
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,460
What's your comment?

466
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,330
Tan Siting and I

467
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,980
are in a free relationship.

468
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,330
We were young

469
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,770
and not mature enough
to handle our emotions.

470
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,570
Now,

471
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,220
having weathered life's storms,

472
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,860
we know each other's importance better.

473
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,380
We will be fine

474
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,050
and walk forward together.

475
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,220
No matter what others

476
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,250
say about us,

477
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,810
it won't affect our resolve.

478
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,460
We don't need to prove

479
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,810
that our story

480
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,220
is the same as their version.

481
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,220
We'll

482
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,050
continue

483
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,620
to be happy

484
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,570
together.

485
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,940
Regarding the online allegations

486
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,330
that your mother, Ms. Hui Gao,

487
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,660
bribed a friend

488
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,980
to slander Tan Siting.

489
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,050
What is your take on this?

490
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,660
My mother is a successful entrepreneur.

491
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,810
In my eyes,

492
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,700
she is a resilient woman.

493
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,420
No defamation allowed.

494
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,330
I believe everyone there

495
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,220
can make an independent judgment.

496
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,420
No need to discuss such baseless claims.

497
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,980
Please focus on our updates at Tianlu.

498
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,140
We will keep you updated.

499
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:36,980
Thank you.

[Class 6-2 Has Graduated]
Students,

501
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,460
[Class 6-2 Have Graduated]
today is your last day

502
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,380
in this classroom.

503
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,940
You are about

504
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,460
to take a new step forward.

505
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,460
Here,

506
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,010
I wish you good health

507

and happiness

508

for all the days to come.

509
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,770
Before you begin this new journey,

510
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,490
I hope you can fully

511
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,380
enjoy this wonderful holiday.

512
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,810
Congratulations,

513
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,700
you've graduated.

514
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,900
Congratulations to Feng Lexuan
on graduating from primary school!

515
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:21,980
Dad,

516
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,090
why didn't you ask me
how I did on my exams?

517
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,090
Every time I finished an exam,

518
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,900
your grandma would ask me how I did,

519
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,770
and I always felt so anxious.

520
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,490
So I won't ask you.

521
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,250
Forget the exams now that they're over.

522
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,940
Let's think about

523
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,570
how to spend this holiday.

524
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,290
Think.

525
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:44,900
How?

526
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,380
Where should we go?

527
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,980
Let's play video games at home first.

528
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,810
Play games.

529
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,660
What else?

530
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,660
How's your study going?

531
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,010
Extremely well!

532
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,490
Extremely?

533
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,570
No problem you can't solve?

534
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,250
Of course,

535
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,530
none.

536
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,810
Have the results come out?

537
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,570
Grandma,

538
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,660
please stop asking,

539
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,700
or I'm about to win.

540
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,460
Right.

541
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,730
Focus when playing chess!

542
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,090
I'll move here.

543
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,730
Look,

544
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,620
this snack bar

545
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,810
is so meaningful to us.

546
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,180
It has been with us

547
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,530
from when we started dating

548
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,490
to having Le.

549
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,770
We shall use

550
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,140
their pastries for our wedding.

551
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,490
It's a deal.

552
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,290
Feng Rui,

553
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,140
I want to tell you something.
(Watch on www.kisskh.la to support Admin)

554
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:54,810
Go ahead.

555
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,530
I want to go to Hongyuan County
in Sichuan's Aba Prefecture.

556
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,860
You want to go there?

557
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,090
Sure.

558
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,010
To teach ballet?

559
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,810
To teach ballet?

560
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,530
My dad

561
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,010
told me when he was alive

562
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,660
that many girls

563
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,010
like Qu Zhen are there,

564
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,570
so I want to bring ballet there.

565
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,290
Okay.

566
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,940
When are you going?

567
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,620
I'll go with you.

568
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,330
I want to go alone.

569
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,490
Alright.

570
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,860
How long will you be gone?

571
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,050
A year,

572
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,860
or maybe two.

573
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,730
Okay.

574
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,900
That's great.

575
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,330
My dad told me when he was alive,

576
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,900
he really liked that place.

577
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,420
He lived there for a very long time.

578
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,380
So I really want to see it.

579
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,530
Okay.

580
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,330
Then,

581
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,090
I'll wait for you.

582
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,980
Thank you.

583
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,010
Not bad.

584
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,460
Next.

585
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,090
Please give me one.

586
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,660
How is Ms. Tan doing now?

587
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,090
She's

588
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,460
doing pretty well.

589
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,860
She's recovering.

590
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,620
Tudou invited us,

591
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,490
three families, to go on a picnic.

592
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,420
Got it.

593
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,620
Did he mention the time?

594
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,460
I think it's this weekend.

595
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,250
This weekend?

596
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,460
Okay.

597
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,250
I'm about done with mine.

598
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,220
Awesome.

599
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,140
Ms. Tan,

600
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,660
is this your car?

601
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,570
Of course.

602
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,660
Ms. Tan, do you have a driver's license?

603
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,940
Can you drive?

604
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,770
Of course, I have a license.

605
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,180
I've never seen you drive before.

606
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,860
Ms. Tan,
didn't expect you to come today.

607
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,290
Camping with a superstar today.

608
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,220
We're so lucky.

609
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,420
Ms. Tan,

610
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,810
can we take a photo together?

611
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,090
Of course, no problem.

612
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,250
It's nice over there.

613
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,380
Let's take photos over there.

614
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,860
Let's go.

615
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:11,460
This way.

616
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:11,860
Dad.

617
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,420
Leave it to them.

618
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,010
I'll carry it.

619
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:13,980
Okay.

620
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,090
Come.

621
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,090
This is all for you to eat.

622
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,140
Nice weather today.

623
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,490
Yeah.

624
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,220
Chips.

625
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,530
Can you get that for me?

626
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,140
Alright.

627
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,220
What are you eating?

628
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,250
You're her fan.

629
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,620
Take some nice pictures with Ms. Tan.

630
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,460
I'll take a couple more.

631
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,180
Take a couple more.

632
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,010
Playing soccer?

633
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,980
Come on.

634
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,250
Boys, come play over here.

635
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,900
Okay.

636
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,660
Thanks, Dad.

637
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,900
Connect the lines by yourselves.

638
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,180
Go for it!

639
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,620
Left!

640
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,940
Have you called Ms. Tan "Mom" yet?

641
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,050
Not yet.

642
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,380
You want to, but you can't?

643
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,220
Why can't you?

644
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,330
Almost.

645
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,900
Let me tell you,

646
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,860
I've never said "Mom" since I was a kid.

647
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,090
It's on the tip of my tongue,

648
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,420
but it just

649
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,570
won't come out.

650
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,090
It's okay.

651
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,900
Take your time.

652
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,090
As long as the sentiment is there.

653
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,090
You sound really dominant lately.

654
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,140
Really?

655
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,980
I just signed up
for a public speaking class.

656
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,250
Wish you success.

657
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,980
Wish you success.

658
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,420
Thank you.

659
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,570
Enough. That's about it.

660
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,330
Get more after you finish eating.

661
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,010
Tudou.

662
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,700
Tudou, you're not cut for it.

663
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,660
Let me try.

664
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,900
Need any help?

665
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,620
It's fine. Just sit over there.

666
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,420
How did the exams go?

667
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,460
The results aren't out yet.

668
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,860
Getting into middle school
shouldn't be a problem.

669
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,900
Isn't that aiming low?

670
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,330
Did you aim high?

671
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,090
Back in our day,

672
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,620
exams were a top priority.

673
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,810
But we were under less

674
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,220
academic pressure than you are.

675
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,730
So I remember when I was little,

676
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,330
I had time to climb trees.

677
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,660
Have you ever climbed?

678
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,460
Well, I haven't really.

679
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,730
Most of my childhood was spent

680
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,050
practicing piano and calligraphy.

681
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,250
At most, I'd play with Legos.

682
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,290
When I was a kid,
people lived close to each other.

683
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,180
The neighborhoods were lively.

684
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,620
We popped in and out

685
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,730
of each other's houses.

686
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,940
We could make lots of friends

687
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,900
and play so many games.

688
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,380
Time seemed to drag on forever
back then

689
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,810
that we could watch the ants move

690
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,460
before it rained,

691
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,380
sit by a puddle,

692
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,700
watch the raindrops fall into it,

693
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,660
one by one,

694
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,420
and then watch the wet ground

695
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,660
as it dried up.

696
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,940
Think about it now.

697
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,050
Those scenes were so many years ago.

698
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,620
So why do you dance?

699
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,010
Because wearing a skirt is pretty,

700
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,180
and I can go on my tiptoes

701
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,290
and spin around.

702
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,460
I feel so happy.

703
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,460
You're not dancing anymore.

704
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,490
Do you still feel happy?

705
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,980
I do.

706
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,330
Later, I slowly came to understand

707
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,420
that happiness

708
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,570
actually is like this.

709
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,980
When I'm hungry

710
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,460
and get a piece of bread,

711
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,090
I'll feel really happy.

712
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,180
Or, when I'm sleepy

713
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,860
and can take a little nap,

714
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,530
I'll feel pretty happy too.

715
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,900
Or we're standing here

716
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,900
and chatting like this.

717
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,090
Thank you

718
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,620
for coming today.

719
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm really happy.

720
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,140
Me too.

721
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,530
So girls like to dance

722
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,810
because

723
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,380
they love beauty.

724
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,420
Is that girl in your class

725
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,380
like that too?

726
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,980
I don't know.

727
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,980
Not telling the truth.

728
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,730
That is the truth.

729
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,490
You don't want to tell me.

730
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,490
No.

731
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,770
But I think

732
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,090
she probably is.

733
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,090
[A Year Later]

734
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,980
I told you not to bring anything,

735
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,260
yet you brought so much.

736
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,460
It's okay.

737
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,900
Where's Le?

738
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,740
He's busier than I am.

739
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,260
I have to pick him up
for an event this afternoon.

740
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,940
Really?

741
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,780
Today,

742
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,010
I'll cook.

743
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,780
All the dishes you and Mom like.

744
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,690
Great!

745
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:22,740
Enough?

746
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:24,940
Careful.

747
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,610
Ms. Ming.

748
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,260
They're back.

749
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,980
Hui,

750
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,690
look who's here.

751
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,460
Come.

752
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,050
Leave it to me.

753
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,570
Haotian.

754
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,820
This is...

755
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,940
You never come back,

756
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,210
and Dad gets unhappy.

757
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,260
Are you feeling any better?

758
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,380
We got all your favorites

759
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,420
to make dinner for you.

760
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,050
Here, look.

761
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,260
So much.

762
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,740
Call Rui.

763
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,900
Ms. Ming made

764
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,300
his favorite ribs today.

765
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,980
