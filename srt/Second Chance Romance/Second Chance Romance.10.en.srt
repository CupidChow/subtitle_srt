[Episode 10]

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,690
Hello, Mr. Gao.

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,570
Make a copy of last time's
financial reimbursement form

21
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,540
and bring it down to me.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,980
B1 floor. I need it urgently.

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,130
Right now?

24
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,620
Yes. Immediately.

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,930
Okay.

26
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,100
Master,

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,930
Mr. Gao

28
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,570
wants me to bring a copy
of the reimbursement form down

29
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,730
to him now.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,380
Go ahead.

31
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,450
Make it quick.

32
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,260
Master,

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,610
could you come down with me?

34
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,060
I still have some work to finish.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,780
Wei, is it a lot of stuff?

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,940
Not really.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,170
I'll head down then.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,780
Go ahead.

39
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,690
Hello, Mr. Gao.

40
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,010
I'm in the underground parking lot now.

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,450
Where are you?

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,410

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,100
Okay. I'm coming.

44
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,730
Let me introduce.

45
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,100
This is Ms. Zhang,

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,850
the advertising planner
for the documentary

47
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,450
we discussed before.

48
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,100
Hello.

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,010
And this is...

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,890
Ms. Tan Siting,
I've heard so much about you.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,500
Hello.

52
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,290
Let's sit.

53
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,850
Ms. Zhang is here at the school

54
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,540
mainly to discuss the details

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,690
of our upcoming

56
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,340
documentary shoot

57
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,220
with you.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,850
Okay.

59
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,690
I've only ever seen Ms. Tan

60
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,850
on stage

61
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,020
or in competition videos before.

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,700
Today, I finally get to meet
the real person.

63
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,460
I'm your big fan.

64
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,290
Thank you.

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,810
I've loved ballet since I was a child.

66
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,900
But due to some twists of fate,

67
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,660
I never pursued the path

68
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,660
of professional ballet.

69
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,810
Being able to

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,850
film this promotional video

71
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,460
about ballet

72
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,140
and collaborate

73
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,980
with such a professional and renowned

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,980
ballet dancer like you

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,810
is a way for me
to fulfill my dream indirectly.

76
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,370
The honor is mine.

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,700
You like ballet too?

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,290
Yes.

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,850
And I've done some research.

80
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,850
There's actually

81
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,050
a great fondness for ballet nationwide.

82
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,930
Especially our investor this time,

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,700
who has spared no effort

84
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,900
in preserving, promoting,

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,850
and spreading ballet culture.

86
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,050
Actually, we struggled

87
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,100
to find an investor before.

88
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,540
Until this person appeared.

89
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,780
He really loves ballet.

90
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,020
It's our honor

91
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,340
to encounter an investor

92
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,460
so interested in ballet.

93
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,170
We've talked a lot.

94
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,930
Would you like to take a look

95
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,290
at some of our creative ideas?

96
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,250
Here's the thing.

97
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,980
Did you attend
Ms. Tan's class last week?

98
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,810
It was amazing.

99
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,700
Before, I always got stuck
on that grand jeté.

100
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,290
She didn't make me
practice it over and over

101
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,370
like Ms. Guan does.

102
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,580
She just played me a piece of music.

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,700
She told me
to open myself up to the music.

104
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,290
When I tried again, I did it.

105
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,490
Not just you.

106
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,140
Several people have told me
the same thing.

107
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,250
Makes me want to
sneak into her class too.

108
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,170
But honestly,

109
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,580
Ms. Guan is also really good.

110
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,290
We learn solid fundamentals from her.

111
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,170
But it always feels like
something's missing.

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,410
Alright, everyone.

113
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,250
Class is starting.

114
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,850
Morning, Ms. Guan.

115
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,660
Morning, Ms. Guan.

116
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,610
Ms. Guan,

117
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,490
I'm well aware of your capabilities.

118
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,850
All the contributions

119
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,050
you've made to the school over the years

120
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,490
are firmly in my heart.

121
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,250
I know

122
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,780
you've endured a lot of grievances

123
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,020
since Tan Siting arrived.

124
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,660
The two of you

125
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,660
sometimes

126
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,980
have very different teaching approaches.

127
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,050
But there's one thing you share.

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,580
You both want to

129
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,460
bring up the best students.

130
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,980
If you have something on your mind,
just say it.

131
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,780
Don't keep it bottled up.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,290
Ms. Zhuang,

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,580
the other day,

134
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,250
without consulting me,

135
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,410
you asked me in front of everyone

136
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,050
to let Ms. Tan take over Yufan.

137
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,930
I felt really uncomfortable about that.

138
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,660
I've been trying to

139
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,780
adjust my emotions

140
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,170
and state of mind during this time.

141
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,410
I believe

142
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,050
you had your reasons for doing that.

143
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,250
And I firmly believe

144
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,050
Ms. Tan definitely has the ability

145
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,850
to guide Yufan well.

146
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,410
We all want what's best for the children

147
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,410
and for the school.

148
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,290
But later, I realized

149
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,960
that teaching students
and being able to dance yourself

150
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,850
are two different things.

151
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,810
Many of her methods

152
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,610
just don't work.

153
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,490
I'm really worried.

154
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,290
But

155
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,170
whenever something happens,

156
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,050
you always take her side.

157
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,020
Are you jealous?

158
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,660
Like a child.

159
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,540
It's good that you can

160
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,660
speak your mind.

161
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,410
You've always been straightforward.

162
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,810
Say what's on your mind,

163
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,170
and you won't have

164
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,810
any lingering resentment.

165
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:36,850
Right?

166
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,700
I think

167
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,660
regarding teaching methods,

168
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,020
you could communicate more with Ms. Tan.

169
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,250
I trained

170
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,050
Ms. Tan myself.

171
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,050
I know her very well.

172
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,700
She's open to suggestions.

173
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,540
You're both good kids.

174
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,780
Watch your step.

175
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,580
Good.

176
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,410
Hand positions.

177
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,540
Head position.

178
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,340
Very good.

179
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,340
Foot position is good.

180
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,140
And down.

181
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,540
Head position.

182
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,540
Ma'am, good afternoon.

183
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,170
Bye.

184
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,050
Bye.

185
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,810
Bye.

186
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,010
Be safe on your way home.

187
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,180
- Bye.
- Bye.

188
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,940
Class Two, line up in two rows!

189
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,890
Get in line.

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,300
Kids in the first row,

191
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,010
do you see your parents?

192
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,770
Yes!

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,770
Go ahead.

194
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,010
Bye, Ma'am.

195
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,650
Bye!

196
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,530
Bye, Ma'am.

197
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,420
Bye, Yang Zihuan.

198
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,180
Kids in the second row,

199
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,530
do you see your parents?

200
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,820
Yes!

201
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,490
Go ahead.

202
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,180
Hello.

203
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,530
Here, let me take that.

204
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,060
Let me carry it.

205
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,420
Thank you, Grandma.

206
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,010
Come on.

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,890
Hurry.

208
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,770
Get in.

209
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,180
Yes.

210
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,980
Get in the car.

211
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,980
Get in.

212
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,650
Siting, I asked you out today

213
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,940
to apologize to you.

214
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,980
Oh, stop it.

215
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,370
Listen,

216
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,700
my parents

217
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,890
speak without thinking.

218
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,700
If anything they said

219
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,420
was out of line,

220
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,300
please don't take it to heart.

221
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,610
I can understand.

222
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,300
Ever since my mom left me

223
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,180
and my dad

224
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,820
to find her own happiness
when I was nine,

225
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,060
my dad never looked for another partner.

226
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,700
He was afraid I'd be mistreated.

227
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,580
So I understood

228
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,650
your parents' perspective

229
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,700
over a decade ago.

230
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,300
Hey,

231
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,890
why keep bringing up those sad memories?

232
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,300
Look at this life now.

233
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,890
How nice.

234
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,180
Look at this life.

235
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,340
Yes. This life.

236
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,370
It's so good.

237
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,530
Listen,

238
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,490
you can't force feelings.

239
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,130
Shuhan, if I really like him,

240
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,490
no one can stop me.

241
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,650
I heard from Yuan

242
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,340
that you met Feng Rui again?

243
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,490
I just did him a few small favors.

244
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,460
You still can't let him go?

245
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
I heard he's getting married soon.

246
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,730
Don't go stirring things up
at a time like this.

247
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,340
There are just some things
I want to figure out.

248
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,730
Some things?

249
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,940
What's left unclear between you two?

250
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,010
My child might still be alive.

251
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,530
I'm not sure yet.

252
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,060
I need more time.

253
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,460
Excuse me.

254
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,220
Are you Ms. Tan Siting?

255
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:13,700
Yes.

256
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,250
It really is you. I wasn't mistaken.

257
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,770
Hello, Ms. Tan.

258
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,850
I study ballet too.

259
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,100
I've watched
all your performances online.

260
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,610
I've always wanted to be
a dancer like you.

261
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,650
My daughter's been a big fan of you.

262
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,420
She reads about you every day.

263
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,180
Could I please have your autograph

264
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,300
and a photo?

265
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,890
No problem.

266
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,850
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

267
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,650
Mom.

268
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,650
Come on.

269
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,300
Then take a picture with her.

270
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,770
Okay.

271
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,530
Ms. Tan, could I later...

272
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,530
Miss, could you please

273
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,490
take a photo for us?

274
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,130
Sure.

275
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,420
No problem.

276
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:55,890
Come on.

277
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,890
Okay. Thank you.

278
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,420
No problem.

279
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,770
Stand properly.

280
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,650
Mom, over here.

281
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,300
Look over here.

282
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:02,940
Ready.

283
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,100
One, two, three.

284
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,340
Let's take one more.

285
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,250
Okay. Thank you.

286
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,180
One, two,

287
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,370
three.

288
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:09,940
Alright.

289
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:10,770
Here you go.

290
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,700
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

291
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,180
Thank you.

292
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,700
Thank you.

293
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,300
No problem.

294
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,650
- Thank you.
- Okay.

295
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,060
Let's go.

296
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,060
It's fine.

297
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,530
Thank you.

298
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,180
Thank you.

299
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,220
You're quite famous.

300
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,850
Still very popular
even after returning home.

301
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,370
Happy now?

302
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,250
Try this tea.

303
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,770
Haven't had tea here in a long time.

304
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,490
Didn't we come here often?

305
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,250
We came here all the time before.

306
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,890
Yeah.

307
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:30,940
See?

308
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,580
"We have our whole lives ahead of us."

309
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,890
"No need to rush."

310
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,700
According to reports,

311
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,820
Hongyuan County
in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan,

312
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,100
experienced
sudden heavy rainfall last night.

313
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,770
Feng Lexuan!

314
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,220
Hurry up. We're gonna be late.

315
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,220
Large areas of the road
were covered with debris and mud.

316
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,700
Due to the darkness and heavy rain,

317
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,700
heavy machinery was deployed overnight.

318
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,140
I'm not even awake yet.

319
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,300
I really need to
get some proper sleep today.

320
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,100
I definitely need to go to bed early.

321
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,820
Isn't that what I tell you every day?

322
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,060
We're running late.

323
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,460
Well,

324
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,340
eat breakfast on the way.

325
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,340
Using loaders and rescue equipment

326
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,700
for clearance efforts.

327
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,940
After several hours
of continuous work...

328
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,820
Hello, Qi.

329
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,060
The road has been reopened.

330
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,100
Next,

331
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,980
let's turn our attention
to financial news.

332
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,300
Green development
is a distinct requirement

333
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,700
for high-quality growth.

334
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,300
I see.

335
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,580
Wait for me at the winery.

336
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,300
I'll be right back.

337
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:19,940
Hurry up.

338
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,540
I have something to do.

339
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,580
Quick.

340
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,260
Head outside.

341
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,580
Put your shoes on. Quick.

342
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:25,940
Hurry up.

343
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,540
Faster.

344
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,060
So, what's the situation?

345
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,980
Last night,

346
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,260
Hongyuan County

347
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,100
had heavy rainfall.

348
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,700
Early this morning,

349
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,940
the factory director, Mr. Ciren,
called me.

350
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,540
Said the heavy rain caused a mudslide.

351
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
Half the vineyards
in our factory area were destroyed,

352
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,820
and the winery was damaged too.

353
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,060
Any casualties?

354
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,940
I heard there were some minor injuries.

355
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,820
How much wine do we have left
in the cellar ready to ship?

356
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,220
None.

357
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,460
How many of the vineyards can be saved?

358
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,060
The manager is still assessing.

359
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,420
Okay.

360
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,020
Sir.

361
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,300
Mr. Ciren says

362
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,980
they should be able to save

363
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,620
five tons of raw material
from the vineyards.

364
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,340
Five tons.

365
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,540
That's good.

366
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,180
Contact

367
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,380
our regular suppliers.

368
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,180
See how many grape raw materials

369
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,700
that meet our standards
they have on hand.

370
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,580
We'll take all of it.

371
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,060
I've already called and asked.

372
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,500
It's the grape ripening season now,

373
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,420
so out of the five suppliers

374
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,540
we've worked with before,

375
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,500
only two can supply us.

376
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,700
If we combine them...

377
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,100
How many?

378
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,740
About six tons.

379
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,380
Qi,

380
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,740
contact all the buyers
who purchased our wine.

381
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,820
Tell them the situation,

382
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,700
and that we'll issue full refunds.

383
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,580
We'll also send them

384
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,340
samples of our 2018 vintage

385
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,860
as compensation.

386
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,620
Understood.

387
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,740
We've suffered...

388
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,900
Call the equipment supplier

389
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,900
to restore production capacity
as soon as possible.

390
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,620
Okay.

391
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,060
Alright.

392
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:55,860
Mr. Wang.

393
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,460
I'm listening.

394
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,740
Don't call me that.

395
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,300
I've been waiting
for this wine for years.

396
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,580
The clients have already paid.

397
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,820
What am I supposed to do now?

398
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,700
I... I understand.

399
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,140
I understand this is a loss for you.

400
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,180
But this is a natural disaster.

401
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,500
We

402
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,300
didn't expect it

403
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,860
to cause such severe damage.

404
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,220
Don't worry.

405
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,820
We will issue you a full refund.

406
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,500
And...

407
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,540
What good is your refund?

408
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,580
These clients
are all long-term relationships.

409
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,220
How am I supposed to
explain this to them?

410
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,660
Qi.

411
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Book me the earliest flight.

412
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,100
I need to go to the factory.

413
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,780
Okay.

414
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,020
And contact local relief organizations.

415
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,140
Buy a batch of post-disaster
relief supplies.

416
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,820
Make sure the quantity is sufficient.

417
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,140
Have them delivered to the site fast.

418
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,020
But with such huge losses,

419
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,420
if we spend more money on supplies...

420
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,220
These are two separate matters.

421
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,860
You should have had
some measures in place.

422
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,660
Like emergency safeguards
for the factory.

423
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,980
Yes. You're absolutely right.

424
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,620
We should have had
some emergency measures.

425
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,100
But like I said,

426
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,580
this was a natural disaster.

427
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,420
No one expected such heavy rain.

428
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,380
I'm really sorry.

429
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,260
Alright.

430
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,580
Okay.

431
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,260
Ms. Li,

432
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,340
I'm sorry.

433
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,620
Maybe we could reach out
to individual vineyards?

434
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,620
It's the only way

435
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,620
to solve the immediate problem.

436
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,380
The quality from individual vineyards
is inconsistent.

437
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,420
There's no way to guarantee it.

438
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,340
And the taste varies too much.

439
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,060
Even if it solves our supply problem

440
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,980
for now,

441
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,180
in the long run,

442
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,820
it would hurt our brand too much.

443
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,460
We absolutely can't do that.

444
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,020
What if

445
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,620
I have them send some samples over?

446
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,980
If the quality is good,

447
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,940
we could use some.

448
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,660
That would take too long.
We can't afford to wait.

449
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,420
Our grapes are special to begin with.

450
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,180
Most grapes on the market

451
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,100
are different from our variety.

452
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
I'm aware of that.

453
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,940
Quality over quantity.

454
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,820
Maybe

455
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,540
Tianlu Trade has some channels.

456
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,460
Sir,

457
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,540
is a flight
in two and a half hours okay?

458
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,180
Yes. That works.

459
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,020
I'll leave things here
in your hands then.

460
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,540
Okay.

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,180

Yes. That's him.

Difficulties will be resolved.

How are you going to resolve this?

487
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,540

take responsibility.

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,540
I've been waiting for it

573
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,860
to be ready for a long time.

574
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,140
Here.

575
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:49,780
Try it.

576
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,180
Okay.

577
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,660
Here.

578
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,180
See if it's good.

579
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,780
It's still good.

580
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,780
Look

581
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,300
what else I found.

582
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,220
See?

583
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,740
I keep it in front of my desk.

584
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Whenever I see it,

585
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,580
I remember when you first came

586
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,420
to Hongyuan County

587
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,340
twelve years ago.

588
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,660
So happy.

589
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,980
Our appearances have changed.

590
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,620
A bit more

591
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
weathered now.

592
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,500
Mr. Ciren.

593
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
All the follow-up work

594
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,620
and everything in the process

595
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,980
will have to rely on you.

596
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,580
Okay.

597
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,140
It's my duty.

598
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,100
Once the rain stops

599
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,460
and we're sure there's no
secondary danger,

600
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,100
we'll start work again.

601
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,820
Okay.

602
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,060
Alright.

603
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,580
Okay.

604
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:48,900
I'll

605
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,180
get right on it then.

606
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,820
Alright.

607
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,820
I'm leaving.

608
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,540
How big is the shortfall
in raw materials?

609
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,580
At least

610
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,860
around twenty-five tons.

611
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,780
Don't worry.

612
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,860
Leave it to me.

613
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,420
I'll figure something out.

614
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:07,820
It's alright.

615
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,420
Mr. Feng,

616
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,700
we all know

617
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,500
you're under the most pressure

618
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,860
and feeling the worst

619
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,060
about this disaster.

620
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,940
You've been running around,

621
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,140
working non-stop without rest.

622
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,060
Actually, people are like
pressure cookers.

623
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,380
Sometimes they need to
let off steam too.

624
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,100
You've already done exceptionally well.

625
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,820
Really.

626
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,060
Good things never come easy.

627
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,860
I can wait.

628
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,660
I can wait for it

629
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,540
to be released again.

630
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,820
I believe in you.

631
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:40,900
Definitely.

632
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,300
I have something

633
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,340
to give you later.

634
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,380
Right away.

635
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,660
The art education center you founded

636
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,860
has really benefited all the kids here.

637
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,500
They are very grateful

638
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,740
and have written many thank-you letters.

639
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,340
But they didn't know your address.

640
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,500
So they entrusted you...

641
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,500
They entrusted me

642
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,220
to pass them on to you.

643
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,540
The same.

644
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,300
It's all their heartfelt thoughts.

645
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,300
They wrote these themselves?

646
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:21,780
Yes.

647
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,460
So many.

648
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,060
Impressive.

649
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,220
Did they draw many of these themselves?

650
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,260
They drew the pictures
and wrote the words themselves.

651
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,740
Yes.

652
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,220
They gained so many

653
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,220
extracurricular experiences

654
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,660
at the training center.

655
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,180
Really.

656
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,580
There really are a lot.

657
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,700
Then

658
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,900
please tell them
I received their letters.

659
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,660
Okay.

660
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,820
Hello, sir.

661
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,420
First, thank you for helping us

662
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,340
get access to beautiful things

663
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,580
like music, dance,

664
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,180
and ballet.

665
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,100
Though I have never met you,

666
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,420
deep down,

667
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,100
we truly respect you.

668
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,380
I imagine you are an elegant gentleman.

669
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,420
From Qu Zhen.

670
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,940
Very good.

671
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,580
Head position. Hand positions.

672
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,220
Good.

673
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,820
Good.

674
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,540
Hand positions.

675
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,260
Your overall form

676
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,780
and the lighting are both perfect.

677
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,020
If we have a chance

678
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,060
to do another take later,

679
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,140
I'd like to see a bit more

680
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,420
physical interaction
between the two of you.

681
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:58,900
Okay.

682
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,340
No problem.

683
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,140
Let Yufan rest for a bit first.

684
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,580
Alright.

685
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,620
I'll go get some coffee too.

686
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:02,940
Okay.

687
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,340
You all take a break as well.

688
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,580
Okay.

689
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,460
That last take was good.

690
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,660
But the lighting wasn't quite enough.

691
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,580
I told you I want to dance ballet!

692
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,820
Stop forcing me.

693
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,340
I don't want to study acting!

694
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,380
I just finished my ballet class.

695
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,500
I'm begging you.

696
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,380
Thank you for your understanding

697
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,060
and acceptance of our delayed delivery.

698
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,660
It won't exceed three months.

699
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,260
Hello.

700
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,020
Would you be willing to agree to

701
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,940
postpone our order?

702
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,860
I'm very sorry.

703
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,820
This order

704
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,420
has caused you such a significant loss.

705
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,820
But rest assured.

706
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,380
We will pay the penalty
as stated in the contract.

707
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,420
I can understand your difficulties.

708
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,060
Natural disaster, after all.

709
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,860
Let's proceed
with your proposed solution.

710
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,900
How did you like

711
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,300
the sample of our new wine this year?

712
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,180
Okay.

713
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,980
Thank you for your trust.

714
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,900
So, two tons, right?

715
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,620
Okay. Thank you.

716
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,420
We will send you the contract
once it's drafted.

717
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,460
Thank you.

718
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:11,740
Mr. Xu,

719
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,340
I received your text.

720
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,780
Thank you

721
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,820
for being willing to accept
our delayed shipment.

722
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,580
Yes.

723
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,620
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

724
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,140
Thank you.

725
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,980
The taste of the sample
is still quite good.

726
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,460
It's just that our order volume
is quite large.

727
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,380
If delivery is delayed,

728
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,900
we might lose many clients.

729
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,780
Also, you sourced these grapes
from a new acquisition.

730
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,380
We are concerned
about whether the quality

731
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,660
meets the standard.

732
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,300
How about this?

733
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,700
Besides the compensation
stated in the contract,

734
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,220
for your potential client losses,

735
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,780
I'll add an extra fifteen percent
of the payment value

736
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,740
as compensation.

737
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,860
Excellent.

738
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,020
Mr. Feng, you can supply me
with eight tons?

739
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,100
That's enough.

740
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,220
Look, how about this?

741
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,500
I'll pay you five percent

742
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,100
above the market price, alright?

743
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,780
Don't stand on ceremony.

744
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,660
Where are you now?

745
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,460
I...

746
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,580
I'll come find you.

747
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,660
And we'll sign the contract.

748
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,420
Okay. Wait for me.

749
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,820
We've finished notifying
all the merchants

750
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,060
who ordered the 2017 vintage.

751
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,180
Are many people choosing a refund?

752
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,540
Luckily, you decided to
give the samples away for free.

753
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,860
After everyone tasted the wine,

754
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,300
they gained a lot of confidence in us.

755
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,580
So they chose not to request a refund

756
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,220
and are willing to accept
our next released vintage.

757
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,740
Okay.

758
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,100
How many people
are not requesting refunds?

759
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
About eighty percent.

760
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,700
I contacted
several major wine merchants today.

761
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,300
It was the same situation.

762
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,700
But

763
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,180
I've only managed to source eight tons
of raw material grapes.

764
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,100
That's still far from enough.

765
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,180
No problem.

766
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
I can source around twenty tons here.

767
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,300
You've all done very well.

768
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,860
Go back and get some rest now.

769
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,060
Great job.

770
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,500
Okay.

771
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,620
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

772
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,020
Sir, aren't you going back?

773
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,020
Right away.

774
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,300
Okay.

775
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,140
You don't need to come tomorrow.

776
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,460
I promised you both a four-day holiday.

777
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:18,980
Have you forgotten?

778
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,460
But we haven't finished...

779
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:22,940
Yes.

780
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,420
You've already handled things very well.

781
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,460
Doing this is harder than selling wine.

782
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,220
You've already done great.

783
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:28,780
Keep it up.

784
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,420
Thank you, sir.

785
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,140
Thank you, sir.

786
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,660
Sir, we appreciate your work.

787
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,460
Your phone.

788
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,740
I'm really sorry.

789
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,060
Our problem has put you
in a difficult position.

790
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,940
I know you want to

791
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,300
promote our domestic wine.

792
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,620
And that was my original intention
for entering this industry.

793
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,460
Gaining recognition
in the overseas market

794
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,060
is an encouragement

795
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,780
for everyone in this industry
who shares the same intention.

796
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,420
So,

797
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,700
you two are the hardest for me to face.

798
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,740
Sorry

799
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,460
for informing you so late.

800
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,060
When I saw you today,

801
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,820
it reminded me

802
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,180
of the story of your brand
that you told me.

803
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,420
That's

804
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,700
what moved me the most.

805
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,500
Thank you for your trust.

806
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,660
I know you urgently need this shipment.

807
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,100
How about this?

808
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,380
Let me recommend
another domestic wine brand to you.

809
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,060
Their winery

810
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,020
is from the same region as ours.

811
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,780
I'm very familiar with them.

812
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,220
The quality is guaranteed.

813
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,340
I believe

814
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,780
you will like them.

815
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,180
Mr. Feng,

816
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,820
what is the name of this wine brand?

817
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,460
Mr. Feng,

818
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,420
this is a great business opportunity.

819
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
How did you think of me?

820
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,900
Our wines come from the same region.

821
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,020
Though

822
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,820
the brewing techniques differ slightly,

823
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,940
your wine,
in terms of taste and quality,

824
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,660
is absolutely good enough
to be marketed internationally

825
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,620
as high-quality national wines.

826
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,820
I'm just very surprised.

827
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,420
You could have sourced raw materials

828
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,220
from other manufacturers.

829
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,860
Such a good opportunity.

830
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,500
Are you really giving it to me?

831
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,020
Right now

832
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,300
is the peak season
for all manufacturers to make wine.

833
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,260
By the time I find the grapes
and finish brewing,

834
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,420
the delivery time would long be overdue.

835
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,780
Besides,

836
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,940
I don't see it
as giving you the opportunity.

837
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,180
On the contrary,

838
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,420
you're helping me solve a problem.

839
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,700
Mr. Wang,

840
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,660
we both represent domestic wine.

841
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,100
We can show the world

842
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,540
that China can also produce
top-tier wine.

843
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,700
Mr. Feng,

844
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,380
I admire

845
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:47,940
your vision.

846
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,900
This mudslide

847
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,740
caused you such significant losses.

848
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,260
Yet you're giving
such a great opportunity

849
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,140
to Huacan.

850
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,700
Let me tell you something.

851
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,820
You might not know.

852
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,460
I bought

853
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
a lot of

854
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,300
Cygne 2017.

855
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,380
It was mainly for comparative research.

856
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,060
Well, this time,

857
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,100
I'll give you all my inventory.

858
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,740
It should be enough.

859
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,940
You take Cygne's best wine.

860
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,100
It will be fine.

861
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,060
All of it for me?

862
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,300
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

863
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,380
I'll now

864
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,100
contact the Finance Department

865
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,340
to transfer you the payment
at 1.5 times the market price.

866
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,700
Don't mention it.

867
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,460
Like you just said.

868
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,940
We both represent domestic wine.

869
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,940
I must give my full support.

870
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,020
Alright then.

871
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,420
Let's do it at cost price.

872
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,100
Thank you.

873
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:49,820
Okay.

874
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,540
Wrists. Pay attention to the rhythm.

875
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,220
Very good.

876
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,500
Good.

877
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,980
And down.

878
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,260
Prepare the second one. You two.

879
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,940
Practice the piano well.

880
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,380
Be serious this time.

881
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,220
Thank you.

882
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:12,620
No problem.

883
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,260
Bye, Yang.

884
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,860
Bye.

885
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,500
Ms. Wu.

886
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,060
Ms. Tan, long time no see.

887
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,820
They said you took leave. You're back.

888
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,420
I went to handle some family matters.

889
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,180
Did Feng Lexuan come to class?

890
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,460
He won't be coming to class anymore.

891
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,620
Why?

892
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,740
His grandmother called.

893
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,460
Said he's starting middle school,
and the academic load is heavy.

894
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,700
From now on, Ms. Wen
will teach him piano at home.

895
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,940
His grandmother will come later
to handle the procedures.

896
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,300
Did you need something from Feng Lexuan?

897
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,700
No, nothing.

898
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,660
Just asking.

899
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,700
Bye.

900
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,180
Thank you. Bye.

901
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,540
[DNA Test Report]

902
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,620
Back then, you had severe depression.

903
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,660
You were unable to care for the child.

904
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,980
And the child's condition was critical.

905
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,820
No one could guarantee his survival.

906
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,420
I could only have you sign
the power of attorney

907
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,740
and transfer him to another hospital.

908
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,780
But after the transfer,

909
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,940
the hospital

910
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,820
once thought he wouldn't survive.

911
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,300
We had all given up hope.

912
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,940
Every time

913
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,420
I saw him, he was lying in an incubator

914
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,300
with tubes all over his body,

915
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,300
but he was still struggling to breathe.

916
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,780
Miraculously,

917
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,420
he survived.

918
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,460
Later, we gave him a name

919
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,660
with the character "Le".

920
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,540
We hoped he could

921
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,540
grow up safely and happily all his life.

922
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,300
And he really did

923
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,460
grow up happily.

924
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,820
When he was three,

925
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,740
he had a high fever
that lasted a very long time.

926
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,300
Rui

927
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,820
put all his work aside

928
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,500
and took care of him wholeheartedly.

929
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,980
After that,

930
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Rui decided to

931
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,740
forget the past

932
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,780
and start over.

933
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,580
Although Le doesn't have a mother,

934
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,060
what he lacks the least

935
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,940
is love.

936
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,100
Yan gave him

937
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,660
the maternal love he was missing.

938
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,020
She taught him piano

939
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,300
and took care of his daily needs.

940
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,100
For all these years,

941
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,420
she's never stopped.

942
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,380
You've probably already seen

943
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,580
how Le

944
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,460
acts towards Yan.

945
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,620
I hope

946
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,820
you think clearly

947
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,700
about what consequences

948
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,220
your next actions might bring.

949
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,580
Why didn't you tell me

950
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,900
that my child was still alive?

951
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,380
Both you and he
were in such terrible condition.

952
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,740
Do you think
he would have survived with you?

953
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,700
What do you think I should have done?

954
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,940
So that's why you lied to me

955
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,580
and took my child away?

956
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,460
Think whatever you want.

957
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,060
Le has grown up.

958
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,500
He has his own thoughts.

959
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,700
None of us

960
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,820
can predict the outcome.

961
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,100
Does Feng Rui know?

962
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,820
What difference does it make?

963
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,180
This time,

964
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,900
I will not give up my rights

965
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,140
as a mother.

966
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:15,940
Hello?

967
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,100
Shuhan,

968
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,060
can you keep this a secret
for me for now?

969
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,260
Okay.

970
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,140
I understand.

971
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,020
How long are you going to
keep hiding things from me?

972
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,220
Everything is piling up at once.

973
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,060
I'm just overwhelmed, Feng Rui.

974
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,780
What you need to do now is

975
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,740
eat well, drink well, and sleep well.

976
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,260
Leave everything else to me.

977
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,140
I'll also find a way

978
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,100
to handle the situation with your dad.

979
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:27,860
Alright?

980
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
I think this child has come too early.

981
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,180
We...

982
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:35,820
Let's get married.

983
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
But I got accepted.

984
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:56,780
Ting,

985
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,620
if you want to dance, I support you.

986
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,180
I was thinking

987
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,700
maybe we could

988
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,780
consider this

989
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,860
after the baby is born.

990
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,940
You're just brushing me off, Feng Rui!

991
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,100
No. I'm just analyzing this rationally.

992
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,540
This isn't rational analysis at all.

993
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,100
You're not considering things

994
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,380
from my perspective at all.

995
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,860
I understand how you feel.

996
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,580
But we need to

997
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,860
handle things one at a time,

998
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,260
don't we?

999
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,140
What can we handle right now?

1000
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,580
This?

1001
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,220
Or this child?

1002
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,420
Or wait for my dad to come back

1003
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,820
and figure out
how to deal with your mom?

1004
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,260
I'm sorry.

1005
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,300
We...

1006
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,980
I won't think about all this anymore.

1007
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,300
Alright?

1008
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,260
I was impulsive just now.

1009
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,740
I'm sorry.

1010
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,940
I don't know

1011
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,780
why everything is piling up right now.

1012
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,540
I know.

1013
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,660
Let's not think about it, alright?

1014
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,300
Let's not think about it.

1015
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,380
I'm here for you.

1016
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,260
I was impulsive.

1017
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,820
Whatever you want to do,
I'll support you.

1018
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,260
Alright?

1019
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,140
[Jingming Law Firm]

1020
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,660
Ms. Tan,

1021
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,180
given your situation,

1022
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,900
I believe

1023
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,900
you have full grounds
to sue for custody modification.

1024
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,660
For the past 12 years,

1025
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,100
you've been deprived
of your parental rights

1026
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,660
due to concealment.

1027
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,940
This is fundamentally different

1028
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,300
from voluntarily relinquishing them.

1029
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,660
And with your current
financial situation,

1030
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,540
you have sufficient means
to support the child.

1031
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:33,940
However...

1032
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,340
Please speak frankly.

1033
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,100
Children over eight years old

1034
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,740
are considered persons
with limited capacity for civil conduct

1035
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,900
under the Civil Code.

1036
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,900
When determining custody,

1037
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,780
the court will generally seek
the opinion of the child themselves.

1038
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,020
Your child is already twelve.

1039
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,540
During this time,

1040
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,620
he has been living with his father.

1041
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,180
So, subjectively speaking
in terms of emotions,

1042
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,740
he might lean more towards his father.

1043
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,300
In this regard,

1044
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,900
we can't guarantee
your chances of winning.

1045
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,980
Currently, your relationship
with the child...

1046
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,620
He doesn't know I'm his mother yet.

1047
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,500
I see.

1048
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,980
