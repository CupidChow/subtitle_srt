19
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,900
Mr. Gao.

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,740
Mr. Gao,

21
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,180
what's up?

22
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,020
Where is your director?

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,580
He has off work.

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,420
Please come back tomorrow
during the day.

25
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,220
Off work?

26
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,420
Who are you?

27
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,180
I've not seen you

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,700
before.

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,820
I'm Shi Wei from the Finance Department.

30
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,940
I look forward to your guidance.

31
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,540
Okay.

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,700
Transfer the money to me.

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,580
I need it urgently.

34
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,340
I, I can't make that decision.

35
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,820
Can't make the decision?

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,620
I can't.

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,380
You're so pretty and you can't?

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,020
I, I really can't.

39
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,740
Please come back tomorrow.

40
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,860
I understand.

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,740
You have procedures.

42
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,340
But Ms. Gao has approved it.

43
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,340
Come on.

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,780
Come here.

No, this won't work.

Mr. Gao,

52
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
you've drunk too much.

53
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,140
Fine.

54
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,900
I'll go to your director tomorrow.

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,580
I'm busy now.

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,940
Have to hang up.

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,100
Bye-bye.

58

Who were you on the phone with?

59
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,500
A friend.

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,740
If it continues, your gut may protest.

63
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,940
Guess it's fine.

64
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,500
I heard

65
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,460
you sponsored Siting's school.

66
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,460
Well done,

00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,780
You went all out this time.

00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,420
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,140
What am I talking about?

71
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,500
Do you think I'm blind?

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,100
Even Bao knows about your secrets.

73
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,060
How could I not know?

74
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,140
After all these years,

75
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,900
I'm clear about what's on your mind.

76
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,420
I like her. What's the problem?

77
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,980
Nothing at all.

78
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,420
We're both single.

79
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,540
No strings attached, no obligations.

80
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,380
Any problem?

81
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,020
No.

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,860
Shuhan,

83
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,500
do you think I have a chance

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,540
now that she's back?

85
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,940
There is a chance,

86
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,500
but it's quite slim.

87
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,380
After all these years,

88
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,100
you have no sense of reality.

89
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,500
Please stop daydreaming

90
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,540
about Siting.

91
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,020
You know the situation, right?

92
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,220
You...

93
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,820
Don't meddle in my affairs.

94
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,980
As your sister,

95
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,260
I have to look out for you.

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,380
I'm an adult now.

97
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,420
Don't want interference.

98
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,540
Besides, I think I'm doing fine.

99
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,820
Thanks for the reminder.

100
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,300
Oh, right,

101
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,220
I'll be going out later.

102
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,940
Should I drop you off?

103
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,460
Alright.

104
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,340
Don't put on the air.

105
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,780
Are you kicking me out?

106
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,860
I'll go.

107
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,860
Make sure you finish all of these later.

108
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,900
I made them myself.

109
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,140
Wash them after you eat.

110
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,540
I won't see you off.

111
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,580
Goodbye.

112
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,300
Yes.

113
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,580
Right.

114
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,220
Yeah.

115
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,100

116
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,660

118
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:38,620
Okay.

119
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,020
Is that correct?

120
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,260
Hao,

121
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,940
two extra orders.

122
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,740
See if they were added.

123
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,060
Added?

124
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,580
Let me check.

125
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,100
Okay.

126
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,620
Good.

127
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,580
Thank you.

128
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,900
They've been added.

129
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,820
Sir,

130
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,220
our 2017 vintage wine
is going to sell like hotcakes.

131
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,780
You mentioned having some extra stock.

132
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,500
Is this it?

133
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,340
My phone has been ringing off the hook!

134
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,780
I haven't had a break all morning.

135
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,060
You've worked hard.

136
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,860
Handle all the orders on your hands

137
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,260
and leave work early.

138
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,460
Really?

139
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,820
Thank you.

140
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,900
You're such a kind person.

141
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,340
I was worrying about not watering
the flowers this morning.

142
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,540
If they wither and die,

143
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,540
I would cry my eyes out.

144
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,180
Did you hear that?

145
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,180
What?

146
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,140
She likes flowers.

147
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,060
Likes flowers?

148
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,260
She likes flowers!

149
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,260
But I know nothing about flowers.

150
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,820
After you finish your work,

151
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,700
I'll take you to buy some flowers.

152
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,780
The earlier the better.

153
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,140
Okay.

154
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,540
As a man, take the initiative.

155
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,900
So many flowers. How to choose?

156
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,460
Look.

157
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,900
So many options here.

158
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,700
If you don't know how to choose,

159
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,620
roses

160
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,860
will be the simplest and most direct way

161
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,220
to express your feelings.

162
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,580
That may seem too forward.

163
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,780
Too forward?

164
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,980
Then try the balloon flower.

165
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,900
It's a bit more subtle.

166
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,700
This is the balloon flower?

167
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,620
Madam,

168
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,300
do you sell Velvet?

169
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
It's sold out.

170
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,380
Please look somewhere else.

171
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,260
Thank you.

172
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:34,980
Madam,

173
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,740
do you sell Velvet?

174
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,460
I don't have it.

175
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,700
Turn left ahead.

176
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,020
That shop at the corner should have it.

177
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,660
Go and take a look.

178
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,260
Thanks.

179
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:50,980
Rui,

180
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,540
what flower is that?

181
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,940
That's

182
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,300
Velvet.

183
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,700
Velvet works too!

184
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,780
A girl would like it
if you give it to her.

185
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,100
Madam.

186
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,580
Please take a look.

187
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,500
Please get me that bunch of Velvet.

188
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,060
Here.

189
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,700
Okay.

190
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,140
This one is indeed prettier.

191
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,900
I'll take this bunch.

192
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,500
Alright.

193
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:18,780
Okay.

194
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,820
Please scan here.

195
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,100
Okay.

196
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,500
Forty yuan.

197
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,180
Not bad!

198
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,420
This looks nice.

199
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,020
Qi should like it.

200
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,380
Madam,

201
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,860
do you sell Velvet?

202
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,100
Miss, sorry.

203
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,900
The last bunch was sold to them.

204
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,180
If you're not in a hurry,
I can reserve one for you.

205
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,980
That would work.

206
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,340
Madam,

207
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,460
we'd like to change it.

208
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,820
The roses from before.

209
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,220
You want the roses?

210
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,980
We don't want this one.

211
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,220
Thank you.

212
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,260
Then,

213
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,460
this is good.

214
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,340
It's also forty.

215
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,980
Don't need to pay again.

216
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,540
Alright.

217
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,100
Alright.

218
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,900
Thank you!

219
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,500
This one works too!

220
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,860
Velvet.

221
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:56,740
Okay.

222
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,380
Thank you! How much?

223
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,220
Qi will like this better.

224
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,740
Great.

225
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,220
Okay.

226
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,460
Let's go.

227
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:01,980
Go.

228
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,660
You can scan here.

229
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:02,940
Alright.

230
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,580
Rui,

231
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,700
I'll be waiting for you in the car.

232
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,660
What a coincidence.

233
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,940
Never thought that after so many years,

234
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,100
you still like Velvet.

235
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,980
I accompanied a colleague here.

236
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,340
That day, I saw
Peiyan liked Velvet very much,

237
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,820
so I came to get some.

238
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,380
This bunch is for her.

239
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,100
Could you help me

240
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,740
take this back to her?

241
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,460
Let me pay you.

242
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,380
No need.

243
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,300
She and I are colleagues.

244
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,700
No need to be formal.

245
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,300
Alright.

246
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,460
Thank you on behalf of Peiyan.

247
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,820
But

248
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,420
I really think

249
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,780
Velvet would be a very suitable choice

250
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,060
for the bridal bouquet at your wedding.

251
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,580
What brings you here?

252
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,820
This

253
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,340
is for you.

254
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
So this is Velvet.

255
00:10:59,540 --> 00:10:59,940
Yes.

256
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,900
Why did you give me flowers

257
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,100
all of a sudden?

258
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,300
Do you still have class?

259
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,300
Yes, one more.

260
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,100
Then go ahead.

261
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,140
Thank you.

262
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,500
I really like it.

263
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,860
I'll head off.

264
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,180
Okay.

265
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,620
Ms. Wen,

266
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,500
how is the wedding preparation going?

267
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,700
Almost there.

268
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,580
You've prepared for so long.

269
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,020
We're looking forward to it.

270
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,340
Once the date is set,

271
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,780
I'll inform you right away.

272
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,380
We have to be there.

273
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,900
These flowers are beautiful.

274
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,300
Thank you.

275
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,380
I'll go back to work.

276
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,420
Okay.

277
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,900
Students in the second row,
see your parents?

278
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,220
Yes!

279
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,420
Go.

280
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,700
Did you say goodbye to your classmates?

281
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,420
Yes!

282
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,820
Off you go.

283
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,660
Take care.

284
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,340
How's the homework load today?

285
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,420
It's okay.

286
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:04,740
Alright.

287
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,020
Math is a bit tough.

288
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,260
I might need your help.

289
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,380
Helping you is no problem,

290
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,100
but don't have me do all of it for you.

291
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,020
Hello, Lin.

292
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,220
Any orders?

293
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,260
I feel hot.

294
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,260
The air conditioning is on.

295
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,620
Stronger wind.

296
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,180
Don't take this seat.

297
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,180
Dad, you're being so naggy.

298
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,060
Dad,

299
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,580
where is Ms. Wen?

300
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Why didn't she come?

301
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,660
They'll be home a little later.

302
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,900
What's wrong?

303
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,660
I've always picked you up, right?

304
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,620
That's true.

305
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,540
You've got Ms. Wen now,

306
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,860
so forget about me, huh?

307
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
Our private time must be preserved.

308
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,260
So you…

309
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,140
Right!

310
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,060
Before they come back,

311
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,780
let's play rounds of games.

312
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,940
Okay, let's go.

313
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,860
Don't let them find out.

314
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,580
Quick!

315
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,260
Ms. Wen.

316
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,860
Madam,

317
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,260
what can I do for you?

318
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,300
Here's the thing.

319
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,620
You said you wanted

320
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,700
to hold a solo concert.

321
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,900
I have contacted

322
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,860
the venue and worked out the process.

323
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,860
Now they need your personal information.

324
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,980
We'll meet with them again.

325
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,940
We may follow the process
during this time.

326
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,340
That's wonderful,

327
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,820
Madam.

328
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,140
I will prepare the material

329
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
as soon as possible

330
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,180
and hand it over to you.

331
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,660
Alright.

332
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,860
If I can hold the concert
before the wedding,

333
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,380
my life would be complete.

334
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,020
What? You're getting married?

335
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,060
It's in the works.

336
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,340
Congratulations!

337
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,260
Thank you.

338
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,420
Beautiful flowers.

339
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,380
Thanks.

340
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,900
Alright, get back to work.

341
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,660
I'll be heading off now.

342
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,060
Thank you, Madam.

343
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,740
No problem.

344
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,200
[Music room]

345
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,500
Come on, Shuhan.

346
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,740
Take these to the kitchen.

347
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,780
You could've just come over.

348
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,100
No need to buy so much food.

349
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,220
So many plastic bags.

350
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,860
We might order food online.

351
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,420
That's different.

352
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,820
Food online is not fresh.

353
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,100
These vegetables

354
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,620
were grown by our neighbor, Ms. Zhao.

355
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,860
Alright, I get it now.

356
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,100
Let me handle this.

357
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,580
Take a break.

358
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,940
Anyway, you'll cook later.

359
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940
I'll not lift a finger.

360
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,340
Is Yuan's company busy lately?

361
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,020
Yes.

362
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,260
A new game is set to launch soon.

363
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,700
He's

364
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,420
so busy that he has been staying

365
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,580
at his office.

366
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,140
Why is that?

367
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,020
Being a boss

368
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,060
is busier than being an employee.

369
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,860
Doesn't make sense.

370
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,220
You just don't get it.

371
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,820
A boss has to handle so many things

372
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,700
at the company all day long.

373
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,300
Certainly, he is busy.

374
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,460
It's not like being an employee.

375
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,260
Alright, Mom, stop wiping.

376
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,220
I can call a cleaning service later.

377
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,700
How long has it been
since you last cleaned?

378
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,620
Cleaning service?

379
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,740
Stop wasting money on that.

380
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,060
I really don't know

381
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,460
why you're so busy.

382
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,420
You should find some time
to do the cleaning.

383
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:44,820
Exactly.

384
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,300
You're lazy.

385
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,900
Fine, I'm lazy.

386
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,100
I'm the laziest person in the world.

387
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,700
Madam, let me do it. Take a break.

388
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,260
Okay.

389
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,180
Clean my hands.

390
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,860
This flower

391
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,540
is quite rare.

392
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,460
From Rui?

393
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,100
He's quite romantic now.

394
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,620
I haven't seen

395
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,220
this kind of flower before.

396
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,380
Ms. Tan

397
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,500
introduced me to it

398
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,100
when we checked the venue,

399
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,020
so I found out about it.

400
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,540
It really is beautiful.

401
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,860
Is she

402
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,580
still teaching at your place?

403
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,340
Yes.

404
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,020
One class a week.

405
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,540
She used

406
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,620
to pursue Rui,

407
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,220
but he ignored her.

408
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,460
Ms. Tan

409
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,540
is quite humorous.

410
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,580
Last time, she joked

411
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,300
that she was Rui's first love.

412
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,700
Keep your distance from her.

413
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,620
Madam,

414
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,020
please rest assured.

415
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,860
Rui is outstanding,

416
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,380
so it's normal for him to have admirers.

417
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,620
And I think

418
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,980
he is much more attentive

419
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,380
to the wedding than before.

420
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,620
Look,

421
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,340
he gifted me with flowers.

422
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,900
That's good then.

423
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,300
Dad,

424
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,020
when is your wedding?

425
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,820
Have you set a date yet?

426
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,500
Not yet. Why?

427
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,420
You've been acting strange lately.

428
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,620
No.

429
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,220
Yes.

430
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,820
Definitely!

431
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,460
Hey.

432
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,180
Are you getting cold feet
about marriage?

433
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,980
No way.

434
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,300
Men never mess up at the crucial moment.

435
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,980
If anything confuses you,

436
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,860
tell me.

437
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,100
I'll help you sort it out.

438
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,460
Nothing confuses me.

439
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,420
You're

440
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,340
only twelve years old,

441
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,620
yet the way you talk is grown-up!

442
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,380
You're getting married soon,

443
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,500
and Ms. Wen is going to join our family.

444
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,300
So I have to consider you

445
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,460
and protect her

446
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,300
from harm.

447
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,900
Don't you agree with this?

448
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,980
Another round.

449
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,500
Shuhan,

450
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,060
how's it going with Huang?

451
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,300
We broke up.

452
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,740
Broke up?

453
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,500
But you were just starting to date.

454
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,700
Why did you break up?

455
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,220
Well,

456
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,180
when it isn't right, we broke up.

457
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,980
No one is ever suitable to you.

458
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,620
Changed partners now and then.

459
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,660
Isn't it embarrassing if this gets out?

460
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,940
Dad, it's the 21st century!

461
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
Is it against the law to break up

462
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,700
because it isn't working out?

463
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,100
You should be self-respecting.

464
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,780
You're

465
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,700
in your thirties, almost forty.

466
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,220
Stop being so irresponsible.

467
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,700
Be more responsible for yourself.

468
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,700
What your dad said

469
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,780
really makes sense.

470
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,900
When I was your age,

471
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,980
you and Yuan were in elementary school.

472
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,900
Look at you.

473
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,140
Just look at your state.

474
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,020
Forget about having kids,

475
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,540
you change boyfriends more often

476
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,980
than you change clothes.

477
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,700
Do you know

478
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,620
what our neighbors think?

479
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,540
How do they see it?

480
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,860
They bring
up the most uncomfortable topics.

481
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,300
Whenever they see us,
they talk about you.

482
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,540
Bad enough when they say it
to our faces,

483
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,780
but behind our backs,

484
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,740
they must be making up stories.

485
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,180
Right?

486
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,580
What did I tell you before?

487
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I asked

488
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,540
you two to move in with me.

489
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,100
If not with me,

490
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,220
live with Yuan.

491
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,060
Where you're living now

492
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,300
has nothing you need.

493
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,540
It's inconvenient to do anything.

494
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,380
Now is great!

495
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,220
Living there, you hear gossip
all day long.

496
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,980
We've lived there for decades.

497
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,020
That's our home

498
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,140
and your roots.

499
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,340
Never

500
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,740
forget where you came from.

501
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,260
Yes, we're used to living there.
It's convenient.

502
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,260
If we live here,

503
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,980
our lifestyle habits are different,

504
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,020
so we'll die of frustration.

505
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,540
Oh my goodness!

506
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,540
Who knows who will be frustrated?

507
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,980
Stop being cheeky!

508
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,380
I'm just worried

509
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,980
that you and Yuan may not be able

510
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,060
to take good care of yourselves.

511
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,580
For example, Yuan

512
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,500
is too busy with company matters

513
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,540
to even eat properly.

514
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,500
Can it go on like this?

515
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,140
There are so many nice girls
in this city,

516
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,260
yet he likes none.

517
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,300
Don't meddle

518
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,380
in our matters.

519
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,700
I really don't want to.

520
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,140
By the way, Mom,

521
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,660
Siting is back.

522
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,100
Siting?

523
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,700
Tan's daughter?

524
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,420
Yeah,

525
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,500
Tan Siting.

526
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,620
We did ballet together
when we were kids.

527
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,020
She went abroad years ago, right?

528
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,540
Yes.

529
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,500
She's back?

530
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,300
Recently.

531
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,860
Does Yuan know?

532
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,580
Of course he knows.

533
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,620
Not only does he know,

534
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,180
but he was overjoyed.

535
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,900
He's still stuck on her, is he?

536
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,500
I just told you

537
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,740
not to meddle in our matters.

538
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,260
Besides,

539
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,820
Siting is doing well now.

540
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,100
She's a teacher at a ballet school.

541
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,820
Yuan even sponsored her

542
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,660
to support her career.

543
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,180
Sponsored her?

544
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,540
Dad,

545
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,580
I always make mistakes
with triangle calculations.

546
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,580
Which one?

547
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,500
This one.

548
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,420
This one, yes.

549
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,940
Calculate it like this.

550
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,860
These two sides,

551
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,060
AE over PA

552
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,420
equals three times ten.

553
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,380
Equals one-half.

554
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,260
Then,

555
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,500
the sine of AF is

556
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,580
AF over PA,

557
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,980
which equals sine sixty degrees,

558
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,220
and that's one-half

559
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,780
root three.

560
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,060
Alright, so AF equals

561
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,260
one-half root three.

562
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,260
There we go.

563
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,500
Now look.

564
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,500
Wait.

565
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,580
What are

566
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,980
trigonometric function formulas?

567
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,820
Haven't you

568
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,700
learned them yet?

569
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,260
Never heard of them.

570
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,580
That's beyond my level.

571
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,420
Haven't heard of it?

572
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,180
We won't learn that

573
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,260
until middle school.

574
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,820
Haven't learned?

575
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,260
I'm only in Grade six.

576
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,860
I remember

577
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,980
we learned it back in elementary school.

578
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,620
No?

579
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,700
Forget it.

580
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,380
I'll ask you about model aircraft,

581
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,740
but I'll figure out the math stuff
on my own.

582
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,020
Good thing I didn't write that down,

583
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,260
or I'd be scolded by my teacher.

584
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,380
Let me try your method.

585
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,980
Coming.

586
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,020
No need to bring gifts.

587
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,500
Leave them to me.

588
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,380
I couldn't come empty-handed.

589
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,900
Mom, Dad,

590
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,980
Siting is here.

591
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,220
Hello there!

592
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,100
Mrs. Wang.

593
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,980
Ting.

594
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,580
Mr. Wang.

595
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,420
After so many years apart,

596
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,660
you're still so pretty and dignified.

597
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,740
You're more dignified.

598
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,300
Mr. Wang also looks great.

599
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,340
Are you both doing well?

600
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,420
Yes!

601
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,260
Sit down and talk.

602
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,660
Ting,

603
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,940
we know

604
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,500
you danced exceptionally well abroad.

605
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,020
Coming.

606
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,260
I've retired now,

607
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,180
and I'm teaching students.

608
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,660
We're very happy about this.

609
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,580
Mr. Wang.

610
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,100
Shuhan.

611
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,060
Hurry inside.

612
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,980
Everything's fine.

613
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,500
Stop looking.

614
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,220
Let's talk inside.

615
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,660
Yuan,

616
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,940
why so late today?

617
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,100
Hurry.

618
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,740
Guys.

619
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,820
Let's cook.

620
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,420
Ms. Wen, what are we gonna eat today?

621
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,620
Go

622
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,420
ask your dad

623
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,180
to eat.

624
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,820
He is deeply engrossed in reading

625
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,500
my sixth-grade math textbook.

626
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,700
When tutoring me in math,

627
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,500
he taught me middle school-level stuff.

628
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,820
I was speechless.

629
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,300
You have to understand…

630
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,700
He was the third top science student
back in his day.

631
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,460
He won awards
in Math Olympiads every year.

632
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,780
You've told me that
like a hundred times.

633
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,780
Although I didn't inherit

634
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,300
his talent for academics,

635
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,140
my artistic talent

636
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,380
is simply unparalleled.

637
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,340
Watch closely now!

638
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,860
That's enough.

639
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,420
Wash your hands.

640
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,300
Have you?

641
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,220
I have. Smell them.

642
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,020
They smell nice.

643
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,620
You haven't decided
on the wedding dress.

644
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,900
The boss just called

645
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,820
and told me new styles have arrived.

646
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,220
When will you two take a look?

647
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,940
No rush for this.

648
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,140
This depends on

649
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,460
whether Rui has the time.

650
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,860
I...

651
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,700
I'm fine with anything.

652
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,540
You shall arrange it.

653
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,460
That's good then.

654
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,980
Alright.

655
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,460
Come on.

656
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,300
Time to eat.

657
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,740
Okay.

658
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,060
Let's start.

659
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,780
Again,

660
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,420
you cooked for us. Thank you.

661
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,940
"Thank you" again?

662
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,100
Try the fish.

663
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,580
Eat up.

664
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,340
Come on now.

665
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,380
Let's start eating!

666
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:00,820
One, two, three.

667
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,620
Here you go.

668
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,140
Okay.

669
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:02,740
Here.

670
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,860
Grandma, have the fish first.

671
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,380
You eat first.

672
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,260
Serve Grandma first.

673
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,660
I'll dig in.

674
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,020
Let's dig in.

675
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:11,900
Thank you.

676
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,540
All dishes are your childhood favorites.

677
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,580
Let's eat.

678
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:16,980
Come on!

679
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,460
Ting,

680
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,020
see if it has that same old flavor?

681
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,580
Thank you.

682
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,300
Have more.

683
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,420
This is my favorite.

684
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,340
Eat some fish.

685
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,180
Isn't this your favorite?

686
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,700
It's delicious.

687
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,460
Delicious, right?

688
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,140
Ting,

689
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,300
being abroad for so many years,

690
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,540
do you have a partner yet?

691
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,980
No, still single.

692
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,260
I'm used to being on my own now.

693
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,860
If I remember correctly,

694
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,780
you and Shuhan are the same age.

695
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,860
Right. That's why I'm single.

696
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,980
Look!

697
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,140
I'm talking about you.

698
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,100
When I was around your age,

699
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,740
both of them

700
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,020
were in elementary school.

701
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,540
She said that a moment ago.

702
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,860
Mom, why rush when she isn't?

703
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,140
Don't meddle in.

704
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,860
And you too!

705
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,940
You're old enough.

706
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,580
Your high school classmates

707
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,620
have married and had kids already.

708
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,060
Mom, this is annoying!

709
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,740
After you get married,

710
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,580
she won't say another word.

711
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,540
Yes, once you get married, I'll stop.

712
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,540
Of all ways to fail as a son,
leaving no heir is the worst.

713
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,580
Whether you buy a house
or a car isn't important.

714
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,540
What's crucial

715
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
is to continue our family line.

716
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,780
Right?

717
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,460
Ting,

718
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,500
look.

719
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,220
You've known each other for years.

720
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,300
Yuan is like your own little brother.

721
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,700
His career has done exceptionally well

722
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,540
these past couple of years.

723
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,660
He's become picky.

724
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,460
In the future,

725
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,900
if you come across any nice girls,

726
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,460
remember to introduce them to him.

727
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,020
Mom.

728
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,580
Mrs. Wang is right.

729
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,260
Yuan is like my own little brother.

730
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,180
Since you have spoken up today,

731
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,300
I'll introduce someone to him.

732
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,180
Great!

733
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,140
But everyone I know

734
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,700
is involved in ballet.

735
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,860
There seems to be a pretty nice girl
in our community.

736
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,020
She's young and pretty,

737
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,980
with a good character.

738
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,740
If it works out, then...

739
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,460
Great.

740
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,140
Let's meet sometime soon.

741
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,580
We trust your recommendation.

742
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,100
Right?

743
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,380
Those who do ballet

744
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,980
are too beautiful.

745
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,660
Yuan can't handle someone like that.

746
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,580
Exactly!

747
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,220
Those in ballet

748
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,900
are too gorgeous

749
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
and too outstanding.

750
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,620
Yuan

751
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,900
needs a gentle,

752
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,580
virtuous, and good homemaker

753
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,420
suitable for daily life.

754
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,740
Right, Yuan?

755
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,900
Mom, Dad!

756
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,780
You talked so much.

757
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,620
Are you hungry?

758
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,380
Yes.

759
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,420
Eat if you're hungry.

760
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:52,980
Eat.

761
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
Go on, eat.

762
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,420
Eat.

763
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,260
Have some more!

764
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,180
Eat a lot!

765
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,820
Alright, let's eat.

766
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
If it weren't for their cooking,

767
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,380
I wouldn't let them come here.

768
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,140
Stop and eat.

769
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,100
She hasn't lost her childhood self.

770
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,420
Hurry up and eat!

771
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,940
Have some more.

772
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,940
Eat up.

773
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,420
Have more.

774
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,900
The food is indeed quite good.

775
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,180
This dish is delicious.

776
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,660
Right.

777
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,940
If it weren't for their cooking,

778
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,220
I wouldn't have let them come here.

779
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,260
Ting,

780
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,260
come by often when you have time.

781
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,660
Okay.

782
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,100
Please head back.

783
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,580
Alright.

784
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,540
I'm so sorry.

785
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,860
No need to see me out. Go back.

786
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,620
It's okay.

787
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,500
Take care.

788
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,300
I'm leaving now.

789
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:32,940
Alright.

790
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,060
Yuan,

791
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,780
we know

792
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,580
that for all these years,

793
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,220
you have had feelings for Ting.

794
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,180
She is a good girl.

795
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,540
We all like her too.

796
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,900
But the neighborhood

797
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,820
knows her past.

798
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,340
If you get involved with her,

799
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,940
we'll be the talk of the town!

800
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,340
Everyone has a past.

801
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:01,780
The bowl.

802
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,300
Do you even know

803
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,620
what kind of person she is?

804
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,140
It's useless for us to know,

805
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,700
as the neighbors will remind us

806
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,820
what kind of person she is.

807
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,540
Yuan,

808
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,540
your father cares deeply
about his reputation.

809
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,980
He is proud of you.

810
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,900
Yet you just had to go

811
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,740
and embarrass him like that.

812
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,900
Trying to make us a subject of gossip?

813
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,340
Mom, please stop talking.

814
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,700
You made me invite her over for a meal.

815
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,500
What kind of meal is this?

816
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,340
It's a trap!

817
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,780
Why did you say that at the table?

818
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,180
Yuan,

819
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,860
you're my own brother.

820
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,460
Ting is my good friend.

821
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,540
I want both of you to be happy.

822
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,180
But you know

823
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,500
she doesn't have feelings for you.

824
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,100
If you approach it this way,

825
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,300
it will put pressure on her.

826
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,900
Have you considered her feelings?

827
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,540
Shuhan,

828
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,220
Dad, Mom,

829
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,620
I like her.

830
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,580
I've liked her since I first met her.

831
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
This is my own business.

832
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,340
It has nothing to do with you.

833
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,620
I'm leaving.

834
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,100
Wait...

835
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:28,760
[Wang Zeyuan]

836
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,200
[Wang Zeyuan]

837
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
[Wen Peiyan]

838
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,740
Peiyan.

839
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,940
When will you get out of work today?

840
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,100
Don't forget
we'll try on the wedding dress.

841
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,580
I remember.

842
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,420
After finishing
this afternoon's matters,

843
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,940
I'll head over.

844
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,420
If I get late, check it out first.

845
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,180
Anyway, my suit has been ordered.

846
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:37,740
Okay.

847
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,900
Then get back to work.

848
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,500
I'll be okay on my own.

849
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,780
Alright.

850
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,780
Hello.

851
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,460
Hello,

852
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:24,820
Ms. Tan.

853
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,420
Are you free in a little while?

854
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,140
The wedding dress is altered.

855
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,820
Feng Rui said he will be late.

856
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,260
Could you come with me to take a look?

857
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,300
I'm free.

858
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,700
As long as I can help you

859
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,500
and not cause any trouble for you.

860
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,020
How could that be?

861
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,380
I really need your advice.

862
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,580
Alright then.

863
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,460
See you in a bit.

864
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,220
Okay.

865
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,820
See you later.

866
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,740
Alright, bye-bye.

867
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,580
Bye-bye.

868
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,940
A video?

869
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,660
But I have to change clothes later.

870
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,780
I'll send you a photo instead.

871
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,140
Okay, bye-bye!

872
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,420
He even asked for a video?

873
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,020
Yeah, it was Le.

874
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,300
He wants me to take a photo
and send it to him.

875
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,700
Says he needs a say in the matter.

876
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,420
So cute and clever.

877
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,900
Isn't he coming today?

878
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,980
He has a training class.

879
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,220
Feels like you get along well with him.

880
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,940
That's quite rare.

881
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,420
Yes, it is.

882
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,980
I've been teaching him piano for years.

883
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,620
When I first met him,

884
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,300
he was only about this tall.

885
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,900
Now he's past my shoulder,

886
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,060
almost as tall as me.

887
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
As you know,

888
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,020
it's not easy for Rui

889
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,420
to raise a child by himself.

890
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,340
So in daily life,

891
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,580
I try to take care of him
whenever I can.

892
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,940
When he can't pick Le up on time,

893
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,180
Le will wait in our class.

894
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,260
I remember when he was little,

895
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,460
he was so funny

896
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,780
and asked me,

897
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,980
"Ms. Wen, do you have a boyfriend?

898
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,900
My dad is single too.

899
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,500
Do you want to meet each other?"

900
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,340
I laughed at that moment.

901
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:00,860
I thought

902
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,820
this little kid knew nothing.

903
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,340
Later on, he told me

904
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,540
he felt his dad was very lonely,

905
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,500
like a goose from the flock

906
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,380
that had fallen behind,

907
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,340
needing a partner.

908
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,260
He said he felt

909
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,180
I was the goose he needed.

910
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,500
So I asked him, "Why me?"

911
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,500
He said, "I like the way you smell.

912
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,020
It's a little bit like Mom."

913
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,900
When I heard those words,

914
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,140
I felt so heartbroken for him.

915
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,460
That's why over these years,

916
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,220
I've always treated him as my own.

917
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,260
Are we almost there?

918
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,460
Yes, we're near.

919
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,460
Mr. Du.

920
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,380
No.

921
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,380
No.

922
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,100
No.

923
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,860
The 2017 vintage was
in extremely high demand.

924
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,900
I'm not refusing to sell it to you.

925
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:55,780
Sir.

926
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,580
There's one case left.

927
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,420
One case.

928
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,460
There's one case.

929
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,060
A customer just returned a case.

930
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:02,860
Yes.

931
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,980
I'll send the order over right away.

932
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,180
Thank you.

933
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,460
How are things at the winery?

934
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,740
All orders are prepared

935
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,460
and ready for dispatch.

936
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,580
Finally, it's all done!

937
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,020
You have worked hard.

938
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:18,740
Sir,

939
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,380
after this busy period,

940
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,820
I want a couple of days off.

941
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,540
Just you?

942
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,820
Or you two together?

943
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,820
Take four days.

944
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,340
Thank you.

945
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,140
These flowers

946
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:38,980
are nice.

947
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,340
Thanks, sir.

948
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,420
Thank you.

949
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,140
This shop is really quite busy.

950
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,740
Yeah.

951
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,020
Hard to get an appointment here.

952
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Thanks for today.

953
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,780
Don't mention it.

954
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,500
You came with me again.

955
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,100
No problem.

956
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,620
Just a moment, please.

957
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,260
Thank you.

958
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,020
It's nothing.

959
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,780
Madam,

960
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,100
what brings you here?

961
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,900
Weren't you on your way to pick up Le?

962
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,100
I sent Lu to get him.

963
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,740
Today, you're trying on wedding dresses,

964
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,140
so I had to come and see!

965
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,340
Where's Rui?

966
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,540
He said he would be a bit late.

967
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,820
Ms. Tan was free today,
so she came with me.

968
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,980
You met her at the school last time.

969
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,220
Ms. Tan,

970
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,140
I heard you gave a lot

971
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,020
of suggestions for the wedding venue.

972
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,700
Thank you.

973
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,980
Don't mention it.

974
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,180
We're old friends.

975
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,020
Just helping out a little.

976
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,260
Being abroad for many years,

977
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
she has excellent taste.

978
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,740
Last time, she gave us

979
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,900
a lot of very useful suggestions.

980
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,260
You're

981
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,740
so good to Yan.

982
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,940
But you should also

983
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,740
think about your own future.

984
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,460
Thank you.

985
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,380
I still have plenty of time.

986
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,820
No rush.

987
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,660
Ms. Gao,

988
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,860
we've prepared the dress.

989
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,140
Now that Ms. Wen is here,

990
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,540
would you like her to try it on?

991
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,060
Of course.

992
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,540
Come on, try it on.

993
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,780
Alright, I'll go try it on.

994
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,260
Please wait a moment.

995
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,660
Okay.

996
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,700
This way, please.

997
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,660
Have you

998
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,380
found your dad?

999
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,780
It's

1000
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,860
about two lives.

1001
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,420
Can't just easily

1002
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,580
forget.

1003
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,700
They are about to get married.

1004
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,060
There's no need for me to tell you

1005
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,820
about Rui's feelings for Yan.

1006
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,300
You've been around them so much,

1007
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,260
so you should have seen it.

1008
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,460
It took Rui over a decade

1009
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,140
to move on from your relationship.

1010
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,420
Now,

1011
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,060
everything is falling into place.

1012
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,020
If you have feelings for him,

1013
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,940
please don't disturb his life anymore.

1014
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,060
I really envy him

1015
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,620
as you cared about him very much.

1016
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,180
If only Le had a mother too.

1017
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,980
Yan

1018
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,820
will become a good mother.

1019
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,820
Of course, I know.

1020
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,100
She is such a good person.

1021
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,980
A stepmother
can't replace a real mother.

1022
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,140
Don't you agree?

1023
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,620
Absolutely gorgeous.

1024
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,540
Ms. Gao, you have a discerning eye.

1025
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,500
This one is perfect for Ms. Wen.

1026
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,780
The most beautiful bride.

1027
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,020
Right, Ms. Tan?

1028
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,420
Gorgeous.

1029
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,540
Hello.

1030
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:28,900
Okay.

1031
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,500
I got it.

1032
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,380
I'll be right there.

1033
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,820
This part can be adjusted.

1034
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,220
Ms. Wen, something urgent came up.

1035
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,220
Gotta go.

1036
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,300
Ms. Gao is here to help you
with the final decisions.

1037
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,060
You don't need me anymore.

1038
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,380
Okay. Thank you so much for today.

1039
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:40,900
No problem.

1040
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,780
I'm off now.

1041
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,300
Bye-bye.

1042
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,940
Goodbye.

1043
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,540
This one is truly gorgeous.

1044
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,940
Let me know if you need adjustments.

1045
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,420
Rui, I've finished trying on the dress.

1046
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,620
Everything went smoothly.

1047
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,860
If you're still busy,

1048
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,740
no need to rush over today.

1049
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,900
Excuse me.

1050
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,620
Could I

1051
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,340
get a ride in your car?

1052
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,420
I'm in a hurry to get to this place.

1053
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,060
Okay.

1054
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,020
Alright.

1055
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,420
Where are we going?

1056
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:46,900
Here.

1057
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,580
Alright.

1058
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,220
Have you ever been to this place?

1059
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:03,980
No.

1060
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,620
Sorry about that.

1061
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,540
It's okay.

1062
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,020
Do you want some water?

1063
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,140
There's some in the drawer.

1064
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,660
No, thanks.

1065
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,940
Could you please drive a bit faster?

1066
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,260
I'm in a big hurry.

1067
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,500
Alright.

1068
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,700
Are you okay?

1069
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,620
I'm fine.

1070
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,180
Please step on it.

1071
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,020
Sorry.

1072
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,420
What's the rush for?

1073
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,780
