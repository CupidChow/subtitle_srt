[Episode 12]

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,930
This color is lovely.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:41,820
Yeah.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,570
This one's especially

22
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,820
good for women.

23
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,290
Right.

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,980
What about mine then?

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,690
And mine is...?

26
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,410
This is a dry red.

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,740
Huacan's shipment
should have arrived by now.

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,130
Remind Duoji.

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,740
Tell him to check it quickly.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,690
We need to ship it out soon.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,490
Okay.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,460
It's pretty urgent.

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,050
Got it.

34
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:02,930
Mom.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,330
What time did you finish drinking
last night?

36
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,170
I haven't seen my old classmates
for a long time.

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,780
We were having fun,
so I had a few more glasses.

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,170
So the raw materials gap

39
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,130
was filled by Mr. Wang

40
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,730
from Huacan?

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,130
Yes.

42
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,690
You actually

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,940
partnered with Huacan.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,540
How come you didn't tell me

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,060
about something this big?

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,780
Should I tell you as your son

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,730
or as your competitor?

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,450
Alright.

49
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,100
As long as it's resolved.

50
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,820
I just acquired a winery in Australia.

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,690
They have a lot of experience

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,060
producing Pinot Noir dry reds.

53
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,060
I thought they'd be useful

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,980
for the company's

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,500
long-term development.

56
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,340
But it seems

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,060
you need them more right now.

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,660
At the very least,

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,060
their expertise and brewing methods

60
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,170
can help you speed up
the delivery of this Pinot Noir.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,220
I've already given them the heads-up.

62
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,130
Are you listening?

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,130
Yes.

64
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,500
Thank you, Mom.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,980
I think

66
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,130
it's more appropriate

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,540
for you

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,340
to thank Tianlu

69
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,450
as a competitor.

70
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,010
Bye.

71
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,220
Okay.

72
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,540
You always struggle

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,220
with this move.

74
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,220
Alright.

75
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,100
Repeat this move and that one

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,980
a hundred times in a row.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,980
Otherwise,

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,980
if Ms. Guan finds out,

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,780
it'll be a disaster.

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,450
Okay.

81
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,730
Yes, Madam.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,540
Alright.

83
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,730
Head back now. Come again next time.

84
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,100
Hey kid, who are you looking for?

85
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,340
I'm looking for Ms. Tan.

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,060
Ms. Tan Siting.

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,290
You're so young.

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,140
How did you find this place
all by yourself?

89
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,660
The teacher
at the training center told me.

90
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,780
It didn't seem far,
so I walked here myself.

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,610
Impressive, right?

92
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,290
No.

93
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,490
That's dangerous.

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,050
Don't do that again.

95
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,540
I know.

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,490
But you probably
won't see me often from now on.

97
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,170
I won't be taking classes there anymore.

98
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,250
Why?

99
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,140
My grandma said I'm about to
start middle school,

100
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,660
and I need to focus on my studies.

101
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,170
How about we exchange contact info?

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,140
Sure.

103
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,810
Awesome.

104
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,460
I'll scan your code.

105
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:08,980
Here.

106
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,540
Done.

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,490
Added you.

108
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,250
Okay.

109
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,050
That way,

110
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,580
if you ever need anything,
you can reach out to me.

111
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,250
And if I need anything,
I can contact you too.

112
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,370
Ms. Tan,

113
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,170
actually, I came today

114
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,140
to share something with you.

115
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,780
What is it?

116
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,340
Beautiful, right?

117
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,930
This is my mom.

118
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,660
You always asked me

119
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,340
why I love ballet.

120
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,020
She was a ballet dancer too.

121
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,930
Even though I've never met my mom,

122
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,140
I carry her in my mind.

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,220
She was the kind of person
who shone brightly.

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,700
Dad secretly told me

125
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,340
that my mom has turned into a swan.

126
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,930
She went off to chase her dreams.

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,540
But I know

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,580
she's passed away.

129
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,290
Look,

130
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,780
when she's up on her toes,

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,460
doesn't she really look like a swan?

132
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,250
After Dad gave me this photo,

133
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,100
I've kept it safe ever since.

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,580
All my classmates

135
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,810
have moms.

136
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,810
But for me, it's always been

137
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,780
either Grandma or Dad.

138
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,780
And later,

139
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,020
there was also Ms. Wen.

140
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,220
But she's not my mom.

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,290
I never dare

142
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,460
mention my mom at home.

143
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,540
Because whenever I do,

144
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,490
my grandma gets really upset.

145
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,810
But when I'm sad,

146
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,900
I secretly look at this photo.

147
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,980
I just watch her dancing.

148
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,220
Later,

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,580
I started bringing it
to parents' meetings

150
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,900
and school events.

151
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,170
I even brought it

152
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,250
to my model airplane competitions.

153
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,410
It makes me

154
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,930
feel like

155
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,370
she's always with me.

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,340
Over time,

157
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,610
it became a habit.

158
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,540
Really?

159
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,170
Last time

160
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,660
you said

161
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,730
learning ballet

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,700
requires sacrifice from a young age.

163
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,410
Yeah.

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,780
You have to endure the pain.

165
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,100
So I was wondering

166
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,410
if it hurt a lot

167
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,020
and made my mom want to cry

168
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,730
when she was practicing

169
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,730
on her toes.

170
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,410
But

171
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,050
chasing dreams

172
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,410
is always hard.

173
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,850
So my mom must have struggled a lot.

174
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,170
If she were here,

175
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,340
I'd give her the biggest hug.

176
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,580
Le.

177
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,820
Do you like Ms. Wen?

178
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,820
Then

179
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,340
do you want her to be your mom?

180
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,460
She's marrying my dad,

181
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,100
not me.

182
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,370
Ms. Wen is really nice to me.

183
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,730
And I like her very much.

184
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,890
But

185
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,340
she likes me because of my dad.

186
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,580
I like her

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,700
because of my dad too.

188
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,370
So whether she becomes my mom

189
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,060
is up to my dad.

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,420
It doesn't matter if I want her

191
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,340
to be my mom.

192
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,890
Have you been happy all these years

193
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,980
without a mom?

194
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,180
I think I've been pretty happy.

195
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,130
But it's not like I don't have a mom.

196
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,340
She's just

197
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,850
supporting me in a different way.

198
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,650
I'm used to it.

199
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,730
I love her so much.

200
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,770
I never dare

201
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,010
say any of this at home.

202
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,700
But today I finally let it all out.

203
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,180
Feels so good.

204
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,650
Ms. Tan,

205
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,700
apart from Tudou and Yang Zihuan,

206
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,100
you're the one
who knows my secrets best.

207
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,420
I'm honored.

208
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,370
Can you keep this conversation
between us?

209
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,100
Of course.

210
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,460
Secrets are meant to be kept.

211
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,580
Alright.

212
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,370
Head home now.

213
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,370
Remember,

214
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,730
don't wander off alone like that again.

215
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,250
Got it. Thanks, Ms. Tan.

216
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,890
Bye.

217
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,890
Bye.

218
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,130
Bye.

219
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,060
Maybe I shouldn't

220
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,700
fight for Le's custody.

221
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,460
I don't want him to be unhappy.

222
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,300
Or to lose his happiness.

223
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,220
I'll just stay in his life as a friend.

224
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,860
Tan Siting,

225
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,460
it's time to move forward.

226
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,940
Tan Siting's the principal dancer
with Queen Ballet.

227
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,650
Her persistence and passion for ballet

228
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,460
are truly moving.

229
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,650
It's just like Cygne's

230
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,980
dedication and pursuit
of brewing techniques.

231
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,980
Just imagine

232
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,130
the classic ballet Swan Lake,

233
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,940
with its graceful spins,

234
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,180
paired with swirling wine in a glass.

235
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,620
It's a perfect

236
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,980
visual

237
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,940
and symbolic match.

238
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,460
Mr. Feng,

239
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,580
what do you think?

240
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,020
Not bad.

241
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,780
This is...

242
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,580
This isn't the final version, is it?

243
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,180
Right. These are just some raw clips.

244
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
I'm sure you'll love

245
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,620
the final version even more.

246
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:57,940
Okay.

247
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,700
Our partner this time

248
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
is a China-chic stationery brand.

249
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,860
They hope to
collaborate closely with us.

250
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,340
The main focus will be
on co-branded merchandise.

251
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,660
Plus online and offline activities

252
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,620
targeting the K-12 demographic.

253
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,100
This will also

254
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,460
help expand our company's

255
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,650
brand influence.

256
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,740
Xu has explained it very clearly.

257
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,740
We always prioritize brands

258
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,770
with positive values.

259
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,770
Partnering

260
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,890
with a stationery brand kids love

261
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,700
could really benefit

262
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,340
the games

263
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,060
we're about to launch.

264
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,020
Shan,

265
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,300
set up a meeting

266
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,660
with their leader as soon as possible.

267
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,100
You and Huai

268
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,300
need to iron out

269
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,620
all the details carefully.

270
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,820
Yuan,

271
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,740
we've already reached out.

272
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,500
They'll be visiting us here.

273
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,420
Perfect.

274
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,580
Huai,

275
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,300
you'll handle the reception.

276
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,180
Got it. No problem.

277
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,340
Xu,

278
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,580
prepare a couple of our games.

279
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,340
Alright.

280
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,420
Contact Bao or me

281
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,060
if any issues come up.

282
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,700
Alright.

283
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,300
Go, go.

284
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,180
Everyone, go for it.

285
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,180
Hey, Bao,

286
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,300
could you help me check

287
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
if any changes are needed?

288
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,380
[China chic]
Let me see.

289
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,780
[Ms. Zhuang]
Mr. Wang,

290
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,460
we cordially invite you

291
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,900
to our school

292
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,180
tomorrow at 2 PM.

293
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,700
We'll be showing this year's progress

294
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,860
for investors and sponsors.

295
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,420
Those who competed abroad.

296
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,820
This is Yufan.

297
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
And this is Huan.

298
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,660
They're both exceptional students.

299
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,420
Recently,

300
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,580
we've done

301
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,700
a bunch of curriculum changes.

302
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,460
We've worked
with some foreign music schools...

303
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,660
She's seven.

304
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,180
Perfect age.

305
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,420
Six to seven years old.

306
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,740
And dance training

307
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,300
should start young...

308
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:35,780
You'll see

309
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,300
great things in the future.

310
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,900
Mr. Wang, you might not know.

311
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,860
But our school was built

312
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,420
step by step

313
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,620
hrough everyone's collective effort.

314
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,700
Now that you're here,

315
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,060
have you noticed
how things have changed here?

316
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,260
It's all thanks to your leadership,
Ms. Zhuang.

317
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,060
Not really.

318
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,260
A documentary crew

319
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,100
is filming at the school.

320
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,420
Let's go and check it out later.

321
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,660
- Really?
- Wonderful.

322
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,340
Look at this girl.

323
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,020
Yes.

324
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,300
Not easy.

325
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,820
I'll snap one for you. Take a look.

326
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,300
Alright.

327
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,820
Yes.

328
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,220
Come on.

329
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,820
It's a team effort.

330
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,420
Actually, we currently...

331
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,700
Are you that gentleman?

332
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,220
The one

333
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,900
who funded the art education school

334
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,420
in Hongyuan County, Sichuan?

335
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,700
Ms. Zhuang said

336
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,820
you'd be here today.

337
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,340
You are...?

338
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,900
I'm Qu Zhen.

339
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,700
Duoji told me...

340
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,220
Yes.

341
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,100
I asked him to deliver
the postcard to you.

342
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,380
You look just like I imagined.

343
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,300
So you're Qu Zhen.

344
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,940
I received your postcard.

345
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,300
You came all this way from home

346
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,420
to dance here. That's incredible.

347
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,940
I really should thank you.

348
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,500
Keep it up.

349
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,420
I will.

350
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,060
Mr. Feng,

351
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,060
could we get a photo together?

352
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,020
Sure. Let's take one.

353
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,300
We currently have students...

354
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,940
Like...

355
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,100
Yufan.

356
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,700
Yufan.

357
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,020
Right.

358
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,980
Zheng Yufan

359
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,700
is preparing

360
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,020
for the YGP

361
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,740
Japan regional competition.

362
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,220
Mr. Feng.

363
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,460
Mr. Feng.

364
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,300
So

365
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,460
we're definitely going to win awards.

366
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,140
Mr. Feng, let me introduce you.

367
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,220
This is Mr. Wang.

368
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,900
That's eloquent.

369
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,340
Long time no see.

370
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,900
You two know each other?

371
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,300
Ms. Tan.

372
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,820
This is Ms. Tan Siting.

373
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,060
I suppose you've all admired her
for a long time.

374
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,660
Let me introduce our sponsors.

375
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,220
This is Mr. Wang.

376
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,540
This is Mr. Zhang.

377
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,740
This is Mr. Wang.

378
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,540
You're already familiar with him.

379
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
This is Mr. Hu.

380
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,900
And this is Mr. Feng.

381
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,660
Ms. Zhuang, everyone's here.

382
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,420
Shall we take a group photo?

383
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,100
Sure.

384
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,780
Come on.

385
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,220
All together.

386
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,660
Step forward a bit.

387
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,060
Mr. Feng, you're tall and handsome.

388
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,900
Stand in the middle.

389
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,060
Alright.

390
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,620
Come on. Right.

391
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,500
Okay.

392
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,020
Everyone, look over here.

393
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:54,660
Come on.

394
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,460
Three, two, one, okay.

395
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,420
One more.

396
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,860
Three, two, one.

397
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,020
That's good.

398
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,660
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

399
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,740
Let's go.

400
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,260
Okay.

401
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,460
Everyone, please follow me

402
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,020
to get a closer look at ballet

403
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,300
and experience its charm.

404
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,660
Right.

405
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:14,860
Come on.

406
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,100
They're filming a documentary.

407
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,180
Okay.

408
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,820
Come on.

409
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,220
Take a look.

410
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,300
Steady your footing a bit more.

411
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,540
Okay.

412
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,020
Expression.

413
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,380
Okay.

414
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,860
Take a break now.

415
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,500
Ms. Tan, be careful.

416
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,220
Are you hurt?

417
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,300
I'm sorry.

418
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,140
Do you want to lie down?

419
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,860
Yuan.

420
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,300
What happened?

421
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,020
Where did you hurt? Let me see.

422
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,660
Shuhan, what are you doing here?

423
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,820
Siting,

424
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,020
what's going on?

425
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,300
What happened to you?

426
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,900
Just a minor hairline fracture.

427
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,900
How did it get so serious?

428
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,780
It's nothing. I just...

429
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
You should be worried about Yuan.

430
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,780
He took the hit for me and ended up

431
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,740
getting hit in the head.

432
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,780
Don't say that.

433
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,060
It's not a big deal.

434
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,060
Yeah, right.

435
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,740
As long as you're not dead.

436
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,580
Now it hurts, huh?

437
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,060
You two, really...

438
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,900
My head hurts.

439
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
You showing up gives me a headache.

440
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,060
No...

441
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,260
How are you feeling?

442
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,540
Doctor.

443
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,820
Doctor, how is he?

444
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,780
His head...?

445
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,020
Mild concussion.

446
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,820
Concussion?

447
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,460
Generally, if he's awake,
he should be fine.

448
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
But he needs to stay
for observation overnight.

449
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,900
If he's all good after the checkup
tomorrow morning,

450
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
he can get discharged.

451
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,340
You too.

452
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,260
Your blood pressure
is a bit high right now.

453
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
It might be caused by the trauma.

454
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,500
I recommend you also stay
for observation tonight.

455
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,580
You can leave after the checkup tomorrow
if everything's fine.

456
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,580
Look,

457
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,500
doctor.

458
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,260
My brother

459
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,340
works in IT.

460
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,500
He relies on his brain for his job.

461
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,820
Please make sure
he gets a thorough check-up.

462
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,980
And you're absolutely right.

463
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,740
They both need
comprehensive examinations.

464
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,300
We can't risk
any long-term complications, okay?

465
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,300
If you're concerned,

466
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,660
we can also do an MRI.

467
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,140
Are you experiencing

468
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,460
any other discomfort?

469
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,540
Any dizziness?

470
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,300
No.

471
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,020
Any nausea?

472
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,340
Not really.

473
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,060
Okay, that's good.

474
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,140
We'll wait for the morning results

475
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,540
and reassess then.

476
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,260
Thank you, doctor.

477
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,780
Thank you.

478
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,580
Appreciate it.

479
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,020
Thanks.

480
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,540
Thank you, doctor.

481
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,300
Thank you, doctor.

482
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,740
No problem.

483
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,700
No dizziness? No nausea?
Are you sure you're okay?

484
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,260
I'm really fine.

485
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,300
Let me check again...

486
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,300
Shuhan.

487
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,860
Hey,

488
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,180
you didn't tell Mom and Dad, did you?

489
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,900
If I had told them,
they'd have rushed over here already.

490
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,060
You must not tell them.

491
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,660
This minor injury will heal
in a couple of days.

492
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,060
Really?

493
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,620
You need to get that MRI done properly.

494
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,500
That's what the doctor said.

495
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,100
And you too...

496
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,420
Stop talking.

497
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,820
My head hurts even more.
It's starting to hurt again.

498
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,820
Just go.

499
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
I'll take care of her.

500
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,460
You should go.

501
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,300
Why are you telling me to leave?

502
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,220
Stop pushing me away.

503
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,740
It's fine. Just go.

504
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,980
Siting, focus on recovery.

505
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,580
You should go back and rest.

506
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,740
Take care of yourself.

507
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,500
Listen,

508
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,460
don't have any brain damage.

509
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,580
I'm fine. You should go.

510
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,980
So careless.

511
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,580
What if he really gets impaired?

512
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,580
How are you feeling now?

513
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,180
Siting,

514
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:57,940
have some water.

515
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,780
It's fine.

516
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,740
I can do it myself.

517
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,580
Just rest.

518
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,220
Use the straw. Drink it like this.

519
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,180
Is it too hot?

520
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,700
It's okay, right?

521
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Sit down.

522
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,580
I'm fine.

523
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,980
I'll bring some soup for him tonight.

524
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,980
Remember, okay?

525
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,420
And her...

526
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,940
This is Ms. Wen.

527
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,180
I just wanted to let you know

528
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,340
we've moved

529
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,660
to Classroom No. 2 today.

530
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,980
I was worried you might not find it,

531
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,180
so I'm telling you in advance.

532
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,020
Alright.

533
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,980
See you soon.

534
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,220
What's with the media these days?

535
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,060
Making a big deal
out of nothing and writing articles.

536
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,900
Look at this.

537
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,340
Look.

538
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,780
What article?

539
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,260
Look.

540
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,300
"Accident

541
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,500
at Ballet School

542
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,940
Filming Location".

543
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,500
Here.

544
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,660
Isn't that Ms. Tan from our school?

545
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,300
It really is.

546
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,500
Heard she's quite famous.

547
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,940
No wonder it made the news.

548
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,500
Doctor,

549
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,460
how is the patient in bed 28?

550
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,980
Bed 28?

551
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,780
A minor hairline fracture.

552
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,740
Hairline fracture?

553
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,740
Is it...

554
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,500
Is it serious?

555
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,820
Will it affect her dancing?

556
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,460
I know, Madam. Don't worry.

557
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,740
I'll update you if anything comes up.

558
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,460
Ms. Tan.

559
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,340
Ms. Wen.

560
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,740
What brings you here?

561
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,900
Don't get up.

562
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,460
I saw the news

563
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,420
and came to check on you.

564
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,140
Thank you for making the trip.

565
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,660
These news reports

566
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,580
are always so dramatic.

567
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,900
It's really nothing serious.

568
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,740
I'll be back in a couple of days.

569
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,020
But you look

570
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,180
pretty bad, though.

571
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,020
What did the doctor say?

572
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,740
It's fine.
Just a minor hairline fracture.

573
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,460
Doctors, you know.

574
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,780
They're cautious with their words.

575
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,740
It's really nothing.

576
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,220
You still need to rest properly.

577
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,580
After all, it's an injury to the bone.

578
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,740
Thank you

579
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,660
for coming.

580
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,300
Rui was there too?

581
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,420
Yes.

582
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,140
He was at the school earlier today.

583
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,180
But he's fine.

584
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,460
When I

585
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,660
got hurt, Mr. Wang

586
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,260
caught me. He hit his head too.

587
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,540
So we both ended up in the hospital.

588
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,300
How are the preparations going?

589
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,180
Pretty smoothly.

590
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,820
But

591
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,260
with you injured, a lot of things
must be inconvenient.

592
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,540
If you need any help,

593
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,820
just let me know.

594
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,580
No, thanks.

595
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,220
Hospitals here

596
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
are really convenient now.

597
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,060
They provide three full meals a day,

598
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,300
and it's quite good.

599
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,660
But I usually cook for myself...

600
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,420
Are you hungry?

601
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,260
The line was so long.

602
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,220
So long...

603
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,980
This is Mr. Wang.

604
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,460
This is Ms. Wen. You've met, right?

605
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:48,740
Yes.

606
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:48,980
Hello.

607
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
We've met.

608
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,740
Yuan, why did you buy so much?

609
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,500
Of course I'd buy plenty of food.

610
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,180
Sorry.

611
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,500
It's fine.

612
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,340
I haven't done anything all day.

613
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,940
I really don't have much of an appetite.

614
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,660
You need to eat your meals.

615
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,660
With your head injury...

616
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,500
It's really risky for you
to be walking around like this.

617
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,180
I'm fine.

618
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,060
I bought lots of things you like.

619
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,580
Oh my, this is way too much.

620
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,340
Would you like to join us?

621
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,500
No, I've already eaten.

622
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,420
Have a little something.

623
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,300
No. thanks.

624
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,180
Thanks.

625
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
Let me help you.

626
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,140
Thanks.

627
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,420
This is too much.

628
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,580
They're all your favorites.

629
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,020
It's not too much at all.

630
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,060
I told you the hospital has food.
You had to go out and buy it.

631
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,940
Doesn't it smell good?

632
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,940
Yes.

633
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,900
The line was really long.

634
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,940
I just think it was dangerous for you

635
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,180
to go with your head injury.

636
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,980
It's nothing.

637
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,500
What if you got hit again?

638
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,420
She worries too much.

639
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,660
Here.

640
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:34,940
Thanks.

641
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,940
Can we finish all this?

642
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
Are you sure you don't want to join us?

643
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,820
Really, I'm fine. I've eaten.

644
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,260
You guys go ahead.

645
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,980
Ms. Wen, have a seat.

646
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,940
Have a seat.

647
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,140
Sir,

648
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,940
we're heading out.

649
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,740
Okay. See you tomorrow.

650
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,300
See you tomorrow.

651
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,460
Bye.

652
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,460
Ms. Wen, you're here.

653
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,020
Are you off work?

654
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,700
Yes.

655
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,340
Bye.

656
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,900
What are you doing here?

657
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,980
Just passing by.
Brought you some pastries.

658
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:56,900
Okay.

659
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,500
I'll be a little while longer.

660
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,660
Wait for me a moment.

661
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,500
No rush.

662
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,260
Take your time.

663
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,220
I'll just prepare some lessons here.

664
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,700
Okay.

665
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,500
Try this.

666
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,060
This place is quite famous.

667
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,740
Thank you.

668
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,260
Thanks.

669
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,460
I heard Ms. Tan got injured.
Did you know?

670
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,740
Yes. I was there.

671
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,980
Is it serious?

672
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,020
Probably not.

673
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,500
She's already in the hospital.

674
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,060
It just rained.

675
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,380
The air outside must be so fresh.

676
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,420
Yeah.

677
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,020
You know what?

678
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,100
Eleven years ago,

679
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,180
I went to Paris to see you.

680
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,020
Back then, Bao and I

681
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,860
had just started
our mobile game company.

682
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,740
During the most stressful
and difficult time,

683
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,540
when we had burned through

684
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,700
all the startup funding from his family,

685
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,820
we were looking
for investors everywhere.

686
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,780
One day,

687
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,100
I met with a very important investor,

688
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,300
but got rejected.

689
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,860
I was really discouraged

690
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,580
and upset that day.

691
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,820
I suddenly didn't want to
hold back anymore.

692
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,780
I went to Paris,

693
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,060
bought tickets,

694
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,820
and watched your performances
for five days straight.

695
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,340
You weren't

696
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,940
as famous then as you are now,

697
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,300
but you were just as dazzling.

698
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
Swan Lake,

699
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,340
The Nutcracker,

700
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,020
and Giselle.

701
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,180
The audience

702
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,060
was mesmerized by you.

703
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,500
It felt like I was back

704
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
to the first time I saw you dance.

705
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,260
You were so absorbed,

706
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,860
so lost in the moment.

707
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,540
During the curtain call,

708
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,940
you looked so happy.

709
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,980
I knew then

710
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,300
that you had let go

711
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
of all the bad things

712
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,420
and moved forward.

713
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,540
Later, I returned,

714
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,060
refreshed,

715
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,300
and continued with my game company.

716
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,100
Then I found an investment soon after.

717
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,700
So I feel that trip to Paris

718
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,300
brought me good luck.

719
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,580
Thank you.

720
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,940
So does that mean we're even?

721
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,580
We're even.

722
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,540
Take it slow.

723
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,140
I'm fine. Be careful.

724
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,540
Watch your step.

725
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,260
I can manage.

726
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,860
Mind your step.

727
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,540
Okay. No, thanks.

728
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,540
Careful.

729
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,340
Let her sit down first.

730
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,820
Sit.

731
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,340
Sit here.

732
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,060
Careful.

733
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,580
Come on.

734
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,660
Take it easy.

735
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,380
Okay.

736
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,580
Okay.

737
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,260
Can I use any towel,

738
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,540
Siting?

739
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,060
Let me get you some water.

740
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,780
Any is fine.

741
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,420
Thanks.

742
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,060
Just help yourselves to drinks.

743
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,580
Don't worry about us.

744
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,540
Just rest.

745
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,100
Okay.

746
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,380
Here.

747
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,340
Just got back from the hospital.

748
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,100
Wipe your hands.

749
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,380
Thanks.

750
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,260
Here.

751
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,860
Have you been eating properly?

752
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
The fridge is empty.

753
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,260
I keep it simple when I'm alone.

754
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,020
There's nothing at your home?

755
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,540
Just some bread?

756
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,380
Put it down.

757
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,100
You two should head back now.

758
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,060
The doctor said

759
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,340
if he

760
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,500
doesn't rest properly,
he could risk impairment.

761
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,340
I'm fine. I'm worried about you.

762
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,260
Just go. I'm fine.

763
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,900
But are you sure
you'll be okay alone at home?

764
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,340
Should we make you some food
before we leave?

765
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,100
No need. I can just order in. It's easy.

766
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,980
Just go.

767
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,380
Alright then. Yuan,

768
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,380
let's go.

769
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,340
It's inconvenient for Siting
to be here with a guy.

770
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:25,940
But...

771
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:26,980
It's fine.

772
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,060
Go back.

773
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,620
Let's go.

774
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,060
Call us anytime if you need anything,

775
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,580
alright?

776
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,420
Take care.

777
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,700
I'll call you if I need anything.

778
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,340
You guys go back.

779
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:34,980
Okay.

780
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,060
Remember to eat.

781
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,700
Okay.

782
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,860
You must eat.

783
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,300
He needs rest.

784
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,420
Okay. I know.

785
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,300
Keep in touch.

786
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,820
Alright.

787
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,340
Got it.

788
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,900
Okay. Siting knows.

789
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,540
You get some rest.

790
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,580
Bye.

791
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,940
Bao said he called you,
but you didn't answer.

792
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,300
Call him back when you have time.

793
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,540
Oh?

794
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Can you think

795
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,500
before you act next time?

796
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,220
Think about Mom and Dad.

797
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,300
Think about me.

798
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,300
Think about

799
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,060
the more than a hundred employees
who are relying on you.

800
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,740
You just charge ahead without a care.

801
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,580
My head hurts.

802
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,740
It hurts again?

803
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,420
For real?

804
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,500
Are you okay?

805
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,060
I can't stand to look at you.

806
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,940
It's upsetting just seeing you.

807
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,900
The kids

808
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,220
all wanted to visit you.

809
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,980
Brought a ton of good food.

810
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,060
My car was practically overflowing.

811
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,540
You're quite popular.

812
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,340
Here.

813
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,220
With my popularity,

814
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,580
should I show off a bit?

815
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:38,980
Yes.

816
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Show off all you want.

817
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,140
You are what you eat, huh.

818
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
To mend your bones.

819
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,580
It's so delicious.

820
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
Then have more.

821
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,980
This fish...

822
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
Really good, right?

823
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,660
It tastes a bit like my dad's cooking.

824
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,140
Ms. Zhuang,

825
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,020
I didn't expect Feng Rui

826
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,980
to also invest in our school.

827
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,540
He's always held onto a dream
about ballet.

828
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,740
After his vineyard found some success,

829
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,540
he contacted me.

830
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,740
Said he started
an Arts Education Foundation

831
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,220
and wanted to invest in our school.

832
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,500
I never heard you mention it before.

833
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,940
You both

834
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,980
took

835
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,300
different paths.

836
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,980
And you've both done well.

837
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
I didn't want to

838
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,980
bring up old memories.

839
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,980
I just hope you're both doing well.

840
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,580
I was thinking

841
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,900
I'd be back in class
in a couple of days.

842
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,420
Yufan's competition is coming up soon.

843
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,660
Her injury has just healed too.
She needs recovery time.

844
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,140
And then...

845
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,900
Don't.

846
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,180
Listen to me.

847
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,300
Just stay home

848
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,940
and focus on getting better.

849
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,700
The school

850
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
needs

851
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,340
a healthy Ms. Tan.

852
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,420
Okay. I'll rest for a couple more days.

853
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,740
But

854
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,460
I won't be going to

855
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,860
the training center.

856
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:10,900
Alright.

857
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,980
I understand.

858
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,540
Mr. Feng is here.

859
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,420
Sir,

860
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,020
we're back.

861
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,180
You came back together?

862
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,620
Yes.

863
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,980
I'm not against office romances.

864
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,980
But don't let it go to your heads

865
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,340
and affect your work.

866
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,820
Don't worry, sir.

867
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,940
Under your brilliant leadership,

868
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,220
we can overcome any obstacle.

869
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,660
This recent disaster proved that.

870
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,380
By the way,

871
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,780
I need to talk to you about something.

872
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,100
Sit.

873
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,100
I plan to expand our winery.

874
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,020
First,

875
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,140
I'll acquire 300 more acres of vineyards

876
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,380
to plant the grape varieties we need.

877
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Aren't you moving a bit too fast?

878
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
We haven't even shaken off
the shadow of the mudslide.

879
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,340
It's precisely because of this incident

880
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,740
that I'm more confident.

881
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,860
Most of our previous partners

882
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,460
have chosen to continue working with us.

883
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,020
I can feel their trust.

884
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,940
But

885
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,940
what if something similar
happens again...

886
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,060
Wine itself is a gift

887
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,820
from nature.

888
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,980
Natural disasters
are part of nature too.

889
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,420
If we can't avoid them,

890
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,860
we'll just tough it out.

891
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,540
- Mr. Bao.
- Mr. Bao.

892
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:34,820
Mr. Bao.

893
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,300
Hello, Mr. Bao.

894
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,380
Thanks.

895
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,540
Why are you coming so close?

896
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,380
I'm looking at your heroic mark.

897
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,580
You played the hero this time.

898
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,060
You risked your life for her.

899
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,220
Siting must be so touched.

900
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
I think

901
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,340
she just feels guilty towards me.

902
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,140
Then you should press your advantage.

903
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,900
Have you heard that saying?

904
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,420
"Just a little bit closer,

905
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,420
and I'll go with you."

906
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,900
You made that up, didn't you?

907
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,980
If you want to win the beauty,

908
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,940
you have to

909
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,820
create opportunities
where there are none.

910
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,540
Is it money you lack?

911
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,140
You lack romance.

912
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,980
Have you finished with those new

913
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,740
code modules?

914
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,980
You always brush me off
when we talk about this.

915
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,100
Mr. Bao.

916
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,860
Go on.

917
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,420
Fine.

918
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,100
Think it over carefully.

919
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:34,820
Mr. Bao.

920
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,060
Mr. Bao, take a look at this.

921
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,460
Mr. Bao.

922
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,860
Mr. Bao, please look at this.

923
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,460
Are you here to go camping?

924
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,340
Yeah.

925
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,420
Camping at your place.

926
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,900
I brought lots of your favorite food.

927
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,500
Look,

928
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,620
I had my mom prepare it specially.

929
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,580
Enough to last you three days.

930
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,900
I'll put it in the fridge for you.

931
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,980
And eggs.

932
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,980
Mr. Wang,

933
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,020
that miracle doctor you brought

934
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,380
is truly amazing.

935
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,060
He cured us

936
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,940
of our chronic issues.

937
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,500
Exactly.

938
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,180
My waist can even move now.

939
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,860
Brush your foot.

940
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,420
And it's not easy for Ms. Tan
to be on her own.

941
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,700
It's great that you can be here.

942
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,700
Yes.

943
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,740
It's really not easy.

944
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,420
By the way, everyone,

945
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
you know it's been hard for her

946
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,740
to get around lately, right?

947
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,380
So I'll be assisting her.

948
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,620
If anything comes up,

949
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,820
you can just talk to me.

950
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,060
Well...

951
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,300
Okay. No problem.

952
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,780
Let me get your contact info, Mr. Wang.

953
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,940
May I?

954
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,780
Steps.

955
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,900
Can you do it?

956
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,500
Yes.

957
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,780
Is your foot still hurting?

958
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,780
It's better.

959
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,140
Alright.

960
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,700
Let me adjust the leg rest
for your left foot.

961
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,380
More comfortable?

962
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,420
You're getting more and more thoughtful.

963
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,060
Okay.

964
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,700
Brush your foot. Engage your core.

965
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:18,780
Good.

966
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,060
Scan my code.

967
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,780
Then we'll contact you for anything.

968
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,020
What else would you like to eat?

969
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,940
Just let me know.

970
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Let you know?

971
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,580
Last time I came,
I noticed you didn't even have a pot.

972
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,420
So I bought one.

973
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,420
Next time,

974
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,500
I can make hotpot for you.

975
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,100
Yuan, that's too much.
It'll go to waste.

976
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,020
You like this.

977
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,060
There's plenty more.

978
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,580
Siting.

979
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
I'll pick you up after class.

980
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,500
Bye.

981
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,140
Bye.

982
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,300
Mr. Wang, let's keep in touch.

983
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,500
Come by anytime.

984
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,020
Mr. Wang is so handsome

985
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,300
and so kind-hearted.

986
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,260
Ms. Tan,

987
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,940
what does Mr. Wang do?

988
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,900
Homemaking services.

989
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,620
Homemaking services?

990
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,300
Homemaking services.

991
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,820
Don't rush.

992
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,300
Take it slow.

993
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,300
Yufan,

994
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,820
in this dance, you need to express

995
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,140
that you have already set a goal

996
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,300
to pursue your dream.

997
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,260
So you must give it all your passion.

998
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,780
Let the judges see your courage

999
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,260
and professionalism.

1000
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,140
That's how you get high scores.

1001
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,900
Understand?

1002
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
Footwork.

1003
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,260
Stop.

1004
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,220
I can do it.

1005
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,460
Why are you stopping me?

1006
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,020
Yufan,

1007
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,820
this set of moves is just

1008
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,860
an en dedans,

1009
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,300
followed by a fouetté.

1010
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,300
You can do it.

1011
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
But not right now.

1012
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,300
Ms. Tan,

1013
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,460
I might be a bit tired lately.

1014
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
Let me try a few more times.

1015
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,060
I know I can do it.

1016
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,100
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

1017
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,220
But

1018
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
rushing won't help.

1019
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,260
But there's not much time left.

1020
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,060
And I promised you.

1021
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,380
Yufan, relax.

1022
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,900
I know this variation

1023
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,140
is difficult for you.

1024
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,380
But

1025
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,220
if you can push through it,

1026
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,980
you'll reach another level.

1027
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,380
I think you need to rest now.

1028
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,620
Alright?

1029
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,380
Ms. Tan,

1030
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,460
actually, I feel

1031
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,820
my old variation was more stable.

1032
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,380
Let me ask you,

1033
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,220
what's the purpose of competing?

1034
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,940
Is it just to win a trophy?

1035
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,300
Isn't it?

1036
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,220
Of course not.

1037
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,060
I'm telling you,

1038
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,580
it's to use the pressure of competition
to push past your limits,

1039
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,380
to improve,

1040
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,940
and to step onto bigger stages.

1041
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,020
If you just play it safe,

1042
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,380
what's the point of the trophy?

1043
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,820
You need to overcome not your opponents,

1044
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
but yourself.

1045
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,500
I know you're very tired today.

1046
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,940
So go home and rest early.

1047
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,380
Remember what I told you before.

1048
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,020
Feel it with your heart.

1049
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,460
Cheer up.

1050
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,380
I'll come and help you.

1051
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,420
Here.

1052
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,020
Let me get that.

1053
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,700
Be careful.

1054
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,340
I'll hold your bag.

1055
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,660
Okay.

1056
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,980
Watch out. There are steps ahead.

1057
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,940
Chase.

1058
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,220
Spin.

1059
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,020
You need to express
a feeling of freedom.

1060
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,580
Continue.

1061
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,020
Put more of yourself into it.

1062
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,660
You need to...

1063
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,100
Yes.

1064
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,820
Keep going...

1065
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,860
Again.

1066
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,300
Be more stable.

1067
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:05,940
Begin.

1068
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,380
You need to feel it.

1069
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,140
Express that feeling of freedom!

1070
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,860
Joy!

1071
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,740
Share the feeling of joy.

1072
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,220
Yes.

1073
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,860
Continue.

1074
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,580
I can't do it.

1075
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,100
Yufan, you can do it.

1076
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,460
Try drawing

1077
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,580
from your own life experiences.

1078
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,340
From your life...

1079
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,420
I can't feel it!

1080
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,660
I know all the things you're saying.

1081
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,100
But I just can't
express them in the dance!

1082
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,180
Can you please stop pushing me?

1083
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:53,940
I'm not pushing you.

1084
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,940
I want you

1085
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,620
to unlock your potential.

1086
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,260
Because I know you can do it.

1087
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,940
I can't.

1088
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,700
Maybe I'm not as talented

1089
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,620
as you all think I am.

1090
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,660
You are talented,
and you are hardworking.

1091
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:08,900
Yufan,

1092
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,100
if you want to stand out
in this competition,

1093
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
you must step out of your comfort zone.

1094
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,660
Everyone pursuing a dream

1095
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,780
goes through this phase

1096
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,820
of self-doubt.

1097
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,380
But you have to trust my judgment.

1098
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,100
And you have to believe in yourself.

1099
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,060
I said

1100
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,900
I can't do it!

1101
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,220
I can't even finish this piece now!

1102
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,260
How can I compete?

1103
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,820
Ms. Zhuang always says

1104
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,380
she sees her younger self in me.

1105
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,180
But we are

1106
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,060
two different people.

1107
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,540
And I don't have your ability.

1108
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,860
I've seen Black Swan.

1109
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,100
What's so great about the Black Swan?

1110
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,300
I don't want to be the Black Swan.

1111
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,540
For that one moment,

1112
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,740
she paid with her life.

1113
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,780
Do you have to give your life for art?

1114
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,700
