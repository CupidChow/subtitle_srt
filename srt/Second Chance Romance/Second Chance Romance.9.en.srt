00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,500
I thought

192
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,220
his height and build
looked a lot like your father's.

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,810
Most importantly, I heard the locals

194
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,500
call him Tan.

195
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,980
Tan

196
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,260
isn't a very common surname.

197
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,860
So I thought

198
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,220
it was likely your father.

199
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,690
That's why I called you.

200
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,460
Where did you

201
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,140
see...

202
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,100
see my father?

203
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,500
I...

204
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,980
Well, you see,

205
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,740
I noticed your post mentioned

206
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,340
a reward, right?

207
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,220
Don't get me wrong.

208
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,810
I really shouldn't

209
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,100
take the money.

210
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,860
After all, it's a good deed.

211
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,140
But

212
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,650
my family is struggling.

213
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,260
My wife doesn't work,

214
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,100
and my child is still young.

215
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,220
So I... I really need the money.

216
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,860
So, could you give me the reward

217
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,980
first...?

218
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,860
Here's the thing, Mr. Wang.

219
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,860
I rushed over
as soon as I got your call.

220
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,340
I was in such a hurry.

221
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,570
I didn't bring much cash with me.

222
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,100
But if the information you provide

223
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,340
confirms the man

224
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,570
is my father,

225
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,570
I will definitely give you the reward.

226
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,620
Alright then.

227
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,050
I... I'll trust you.

228
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,020
So here's what happened.

229
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,100
I was on a business trip.

230
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,100
One day, I was eating out.

231
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,340
It was really cold that day.

232
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,740
A little snowy too.

233
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,100
A homeless man came into the restaurant.

234
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,890
The staff tried to kick him out.

235
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,460
They said, "Tan,

236
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,810
I've told you

237
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,860
so many times

238
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,380
not to come here.
Why are you back again?"

239
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,140
I thought he looked really pitiful.

240
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,500
He wasn't dressed warmly,

241
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,140
and his lips were purple from the cold.

242
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,500
I figured I'd ordered
too much food anyway.

243
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,620
So I shared some of my meal with him.

244
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,690
We ate together

245
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,570
and chatted a bit.

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,740
He said he'd been away from home
for a long time.

247
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,980
He hadn't gone back.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,930
He missed home

249
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,620
and his daughter.

250
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,500
You're his only daughter, right?

251
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:48,980
Yes.

252
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,860
Then he must have been talking
about you.

253
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,050
Oh,

254
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,260
and I noticed
he didn't seem to be in great shape.

255
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,930
His mind wasn't very clear.

256
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,340
He was limping when he walked.

257
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,810
I wondered if he'd gotten hurt

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,100
while he was out there.

259
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,810
So you really need to find him quickly.

260
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,690
Had he been drinking?

261
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,220
He usually gets like that
after he drinks.

262
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,620
Right.

263
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,620
At first, he wasn't drinking.

264
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,930
But then, while eating,

265
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,460
he wanted a drink.

266
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,500
It was cold.

267
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,380
So I bought him
a small bottle of baijiu.

268
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,740
But he didn't drink much.

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,860
If I'd known he would get like that,

270
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,810
I wouldn't have bought it for him.

271
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,500
It's okay.

272
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,500
You meant well.

273
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,460
He

274
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,810
has been like this for years.

275
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,100
And when he drinks,
he always talks about my mom.

276
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,140
Exactly.

277
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,220
After a few drinks, he told me a lot.

278
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,980
Especially about your mother.

279
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,460
Really.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,810
I felt so bad for him.

281
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,980
He said it's tough

282
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,340
being out there alone.

283
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,140
He missed home,

284
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,690
his wife,

285
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,100
and his daughter. Really.

286
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,930
I... I felt sorry for him.

287
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,100
Mr. Wang,

288
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,620
well,

289
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,570
thank you for all this information.

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,740
But I have to say,

291
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,930
the man you described
definitely isn't my father.

292
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,620
Because my father never drinks.

293
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,340
And my mother left

294
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,220
when I was very young.

295
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,620
So I think

296
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,620
you should try someone else.

297
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,380
What are you doing?

298
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:25,860
What...

299
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,860
What do you want?

300
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,620
What do I want?

301
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,340
Are you messing with me?

302
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,860
You knew I was making it up all along,

303
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,620
didn't you?

304
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,500
Then why didn't you stop me sooner?

305
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,810
You wasted my time!

306
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,500
We're professionals, okay?

307
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,340
We have daily quotas to meet!

308
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,170
Fine.

309
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,860
You like watching performances?

310
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,020
I'll give you a show today.

311
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,220
But one thing.

312
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,740
My acting doesn't come free.

313
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,500
Consider that money my performance fee.

314
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,930
You're overthinking this, Mr. Wang.

315
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,980
I've seen plenty of scammers!

316
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,810
What are you doing?

317
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,220
Give it to me!

318
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,290
Are you trying to steal from me?

319
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,100
Let go!

320
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,620
Stop!

321
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,340
Stop it!

322
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,500
Are you robbing?

323
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,740
I'm recording this.

324
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,740
I've got it all on video.

325
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,980
Maybe you can

326
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,860
perform for the police next.

327
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,570
Who are you?

328
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,930
You said you'd come alone.

329
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,980
Breaking the rules, huh?

330
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,020
I've got it all recorded.

331
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,690
It's all recorded.

332
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,810
You still won't leave?

333
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,460
Her fainting has nothing to do with me.

334
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,570
Are you okay?

335
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,050
Are you alright?

336
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,260
Can you walk?

337
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,810
Let me help you.

338
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,220
Come on.

339
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,890
Up.

340
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,380
It's just a fever.

341
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,980
Some fever reducer through an IV
should wake her up.

342
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,100
Dad.

343
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,220
Dad.

344
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,650
Dad.

345
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,100
No.

346
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,260
It's okay.

347
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,100
Dad.

348
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,500
It's alright.

349
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,890
Dad.

350
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,260
Feng Rui.

351
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,500
Feng Rui.

352
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,170
Feng Rui.

353
00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,980
Feng Rui.

They're scented sachets

362
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,700
made from unique plants
of the snow plateau.

363
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,090
It helps purify the air,

364
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,530
calm the nerves,

365
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,940
and promote well-being.

366
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,180
Shall we each

367
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,460
take one?

368
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,500
One each.

369
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,700
Will this

370
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,460
really keep us safe?

371
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:15,940
Of course.

372
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,810
It's filled

373
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,050
with my energy.

374
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,530
It will definitely keep us safe.

375
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,330
So,

376
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,020
if I'm with you, I'll be safe?

377
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,460
Of course.

378
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,180
Let's swap then.

379
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,460
You take mine.

380

Ms. Wen.

403
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,900
There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

404
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,180
Go ahead.

405
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,420
What do you like about my dad?

I like him

407
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,610
because he's mature, steady,
and responsible.

408
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,770
He really is too steady.

409
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,460
Steady as a rock.

410
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,260
He's so steady
that I've been feeling he's been

411
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,500
a bit down lately.

412
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,530
Maybe he's just busy with work.

413
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,570
We should be understanding.

414
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,570
I totally understand him.

415
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,770
But don't worry.

416
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,500
I've already talked to him.

417
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,020
I told him not to walk around
with a long face every day.

418
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,770
Feng Lexuan,

419
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,660
you sure worry a lot, don't you?

420
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,020
Alright. Go to bed now.

421
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,810

426
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,420
Why didn't you

427
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,770
go to the bridal shop today?

428
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,290

Picking the venue,

434
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,740
She was there both times.

435
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,460
Is she close to Yan?

436
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,260
Or is it because of you?

437
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,050
Mom,

438
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,020
they're colleagues.

439
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,290
What a coincidence.

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,020

546
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,370

547
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,700

562
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,500
Luckily, we have Ms. Dong.

563

any problem can be solved.

564
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,260
So, Yufan,

565
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,050
don't worry.

566
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:56,940
Alright.

567
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,810
Thank you.

568
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,420
Ms. Dong,

569
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,810
my neck hurts a lot too.

570
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,020
Can you help treat it?

571
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,290
Sure.

572
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,370
Ms. Dong,

573
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,570
my lower back here also hurt
from practicing before...

574
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,940
[In Memory of Gao Haotian]

575
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,570
Haotian,

576
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,330
Rui and I are here to see you.

577
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,130
Dad is doing fine now.

578
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,180
You don't need to worry.

579
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,500
Rui

580
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,130
is getting married soon.

581
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,050
It's a shame

582
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,180
you can't see it.

583
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,370
Time flies.

584
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,700
It feels like

585
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,900
you're still with us,

586
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,610
never far away.

587
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,180
Mom,

588
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,020
do you really know Haotian?

589
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,260
Do you know how he really saw you?

590
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,810
With you all here,
I'm of course at ease.

591
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,610
Hey,

592
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,700
fasten

593
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,460
this button.

594
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,180
You should keep your belly covered.

595
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,610
Big belly. Lots of fat.

596
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,260
Dad, Rui is back.

597
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,980
Is Grandpa inside?

598
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,370
He's waiting for you in the living room.

599
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,610
Rui is back.

600
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,180
Rui!

601
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,900
You're back.

602
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,370
Grandpa.

603
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,500
I've missed you so much.

604
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,900
Mom.

605
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,980
Today

606
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,020
we specially prepared

607
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,370
your favorite hometown dishes.

608
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,050
Thank you, Grandpa.

609
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,770
Feng Ming,

610
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,700
have a good drink with your son.

611
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,260
Okay.

612
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,770
Where's Haotian?

613
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,330
He knows you're back.
Said he'd come back for dinner.

614
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,900
Maybe he's held up on the way.

615
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,770
Let's start without him.

616
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,810
Let's welcome Rui's triumphant return.

617
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,610
Welcome home.

618
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,220
Cheers.

619
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,530
Here.

620
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,570
Dad, a toast to you.

621
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,290
You're toasting me?

622
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,460
You can only toast me.

623
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,700
Here.

624
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,570
Rui,

625
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,610
I read the quarterly report.

626
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,530
Excellent.

627
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,850
Really excellent.

628
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,460
Your mom said

629
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,130
you secured a deal

630
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,260
with the largest distributor
in North China.

631
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,500
Yes.

632
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,850
That's truly remarkable, really.

633
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:36,810
Grandpa.

634
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,460
Actually,

635
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,330
I've always had an idea.

636
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,850
Instead of relying

637
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,220
on foreign brands for distribution
in the long term,

638
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,900
why don't we create

639
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,980
our own brand

640
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,330
and brew our own wine?

641
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,290
So we could tap
into the domestic market...

642
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,500
Why are you bringing this up again?

643
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,020
The company is doing just fine as it is.

644
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,460
Here.

645
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,460
Eat.

646
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,020
Dig in.

647
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,530
Stop just talking.

648
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,370
- This.
- Dad.

649
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,700
You like this.

650
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,610
You have it.

651
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,260
Grandpa,

652
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,180
Dad,

653
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,700
Mom,

654
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,130
I've been with the company
for over three years now.

655
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,940
Everything I set out to do
has been accomplished.

656
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,250
My mission is pretty much complete.

657
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,050
So, I'd like to

658
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,090
take a break
from the company for a while,

659
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,170
then go back to school
for my master's degree.

660
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,380
Rui,

661
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,460
I know

662
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,340
you've always dreamed
of working in aerospace.

663
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,500
But the facts prove

664
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,130
you have a real talent for business.

665
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,820
The company
has just gotten back on its feet.

666
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,170
If you leave now,

667
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,500
who's going to help me?

668
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,380
Rui,

669
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,170
I agree with your mom.

670
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,380
Isn't Haotian

671
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,250
still here?

672
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,340
He's actually quite clever.

673
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,170
If we put him in the company
to keep him busy,

674
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,130
he won't have as much time
to go out and fool around.

675
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,090
Absolutely not.

676
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,170
He must never get involved
in the company's affairs.

677
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,460
If he had any aptitude for it,

678
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,130
you wouldn't have had to
wait until today.

679
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,340
Rui!

680
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,980
Why are you so late?

681
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,530
You started eating without me?

682
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,980
Have you lost weight?

683
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:13,820
Of course.

684
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,780
But

685
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,690
you're looking more and more like a CEO.

686
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,130
I told you to come back early.

687
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,900
Traffic jam?

688
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,300
Yeah.

689
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,650
It's fine.

690
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,940
We just sat down.

691
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,020
Have a seat.

692
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,690
Perfect timing.

693
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,420
Dad, let's begin.

694
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,340
Why are you back?

695
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,570
Rui's back. I'm having dinner with him.

696
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,820
You have the nerve
to sit at the same table as Rui?

697
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,250
By family seniority, you're the elder.

698
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,340
Rui is only a few months older than you.

699
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,690
He works himself to the bone
for the company and this family.

700
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,820
We won't even mention

701
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,780
your usual shiftlessness and idleness.

702
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,340
And now this.

703
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,050
Come on.

704
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,780
Tell Rui

705
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,860
how much you lost gambling.

706
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,610
Dad,

707
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,090
don't be mad.

708
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,980
Too ashamed to say it, huh?

709
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,980
Dad,

710
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,300
it was just a slip-up.

711
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,650
Hui, I won't change my car next year.

712
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,980
How dare you spend money?

713
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,570
Did you earn this money yourself?

714
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,570
You have the nerve.

715
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,210
If you were just a good-for-nothing,

716
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,130
I wouldn't complain.

717
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,250
But now you've taken up gambling.

718
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,780
You should be kicked out of this family!

719
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,690
Dad,

720
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,420
you have high blood pressure.

721
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,380
Don't get so mad.

722
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,610
Haotian,

723
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,500
what you did was wrong.

724
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,170
But...

725
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,020
But what?

726
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,380
I haven't even started on you yet.

727
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,780
Eat up.

728
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,460
He's this reckless

729
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,690
because

730
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,130
you're always cleaning up his mess.

731
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,780
An elder sister is like a mother.

732
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,690
You should've disciplined him properly.

733
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,530
And what have you done?

734
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,050
Grandpa,

735
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,460
Haotian just likes trying new things.

736
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,980
It was a momentary impulse.

737
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,020
He won't gamble anymore.

738
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,170
Dad,

739
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,650
the mistake is already made.

740
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,130
Don't scold me today.

741
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,780
Exactly.

742
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,420
Let's just have a pleasant meal.

743
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,820
You good-for-nothing!

744
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,940
Our family has always been

745
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,650
honest and hardworking.

746
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,420
How did we end up
with a disgrace like you?

747
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,900
Wipe that smirk off your face.

748
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,130
Come over here

749
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,300
and apologize to Dad right now.

750
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,940
Yes, Grandpa.

751
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,050
Haotian knows he was wrong.

752
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,020
Please forgive him.

753
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,530
We never should have let your mom
risk her life to have you.

754
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,980
Get out of this house now!

755
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,340
I'll just pretend I never had a son!

756
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:15,980
Get out!

757
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,210
Grandpa.

758
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:16,780
Dad.

759
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,730
Calm down, Grandpa.

760
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,090
Please calm down.

761
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,020
He knows he was wrong.

762
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,300
Grandpa.

763
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:22,820
Haotian.

764
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,170
What are you doing?

765
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,500
Grandpa, calm down.

766
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,340
Dad,

767
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,300
why get so worked up?

768
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,090
Haotian

769
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,690
is still a child.

770
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,170
He'll mature in a couple of years.

771
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,610
Besides,

772
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,300
he apologized.

773
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,530
You have to give him a chance.

774
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,420
Haotian was indeed wrong.

775
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,980
He should reflect properly

776
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,020
and learn his lesson.

777
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,130
Don't say anything
if you don't know what to say.

778
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,500
Did Feng Ming say anything wrong?

779
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,770
Why are you snapping at him?

780
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,210
Haotian is my brother,

781
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,770
the only son of our family,

782
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,610
and the one my mother gave her life for!

783
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,170
He doesn't need
any outsiders commenting.

784
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,380
Our favorite spot.

785
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,570
Where did you get this?

786
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,380
Haotian,

787
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,980
I spoke with Grandpa the other day.

788
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,130
Once the company stabilizes in a while,

789
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,770
I want to go back to school
for my master's degree

790
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,170
and hand the company over to you.

791
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,340
You're not serious, are you?

792
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,170
You know perfectly well.

793
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,460
I didn't join the company willingly.

794
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,090
I was forced by circumstances.

795
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,340
Stop now.

796
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,250
Look at me.

797
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,290
You think I can take over the company?

798
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,290
Even if you're okay with it,
I wouldn't trust myself.

799
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,540
You

800
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,650
keep being the general manager.

801
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,730
Pay me for protection.

802
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,770
I've got your back.

803
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,170
I'm counting on you for my whole life.

804
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,650
Do you remember

805
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,060
when we were kids,

806
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,770
we went to my dad's country home,

807
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,940
- and stole someone else's watermelons!
- Watermelons!

808
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,730
Later, the adults found out

809
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,900
and demanded to know who did it.

810
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,460
You told me not to say anything.

811
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,940
You said it was all your idea.

812
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,210
I still remember
when Grandpa was hitting you,

813
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,650
you kept making faces at me.

814
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,540
Actually, thinking back,
I really regret it.

815
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,770
What is there to regret?

816
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,170
Listening to me is never wrong.

817
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,460
I wasn't afraid of my dad hitting me.

818
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,130
My sister would always protect me.

819
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,170
I know,

820
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,610
growing up, whenever we fought,

821
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,060
your mom must have scolded you a lot.

822
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,210
I wanted to ask you.

823
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,460
Is it exhausting being the good kid?

824
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,690
It's not about whether it's exhausting.

825
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,420
I feel

826
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,170
some responsibilities are mine to bear.

827
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,290
I'm not saying

828
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,900
I have a problem with my mom
always taking care of you.

829
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,060
Forget it. Don't explain.

830
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,170
It's always been like this.

831
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,020
I'm used to it.

832
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,730
Anyway, I don't care
what any of you think.

833
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,900
This is who I am.

834
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,130
I won't change.

835
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,420
Why can't you change?

836
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,210
You're so young.

837
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,060
It's not too late to join the company
or go back to school.

838
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:40,980
And you're so smart...

839
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,650
No matter how accomplished I become,

840
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,980
I'd just be my dad's tool.

841
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,940
What's the point?

842
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,340
All he cares about

843
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,770
is his stupid wine.

844
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,130
If I could study as well as you

845
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,820
and rank
among the top three in the city,

846
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,210
he'd definitely like me.

847
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,570
But unfortunately,

848
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,380
I'm useless.

849
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,980
So he doesn't like me.

850
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,730
A useless tool is definitely unpopular.

851
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,130
But you're different.

852
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,290
At least you have a competent dad

853
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,980
and my sister who loves you.

854
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,290
Not like me.

855
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,170
I've never experienced motherly love.

856
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,130
Haotian,

857
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:18,860
actually,

858
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,690
Grandpa's always cared a lot about you.

859
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,540
You...

860
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,940
He always says

861
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,770
if it weren't for having me,

862
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,730
my mom wouldn't have died.

863
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,900
As if I asked to be born.

864
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,500
I'll always remember

865
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,900
my third birthday, when you all told me

866
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,060
she wasn't my mom.

867
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,290
And no matter how good she is to me,

868
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,980
I can only call her sister.

869
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,820
Maybe that's why

870
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,820
she's so good to me.

871
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,820
Actually,

872
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,540
not having a mom isn't that special.

873
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,060
You just have to swallow
your grievances.

874
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,250
And cry under the covers at night
when you get home.

875
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,090
Forget it. Let's not talk about this.

876
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,570
Don't worry.

877
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,570
Just

878
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,090
go tell my dad

879
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,730
I won't gamble anymore.

880
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,290
There are plenty of fun things
in the world.

881
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,460
This one isn't that great.

882
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,460
Do you trust me that much?

883
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,770
Yes.

884
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,900
