1
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,650
You don't have to be so hostile toward me.

2
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,430
You and Mo Qingchuan

3
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,710
led a hundred crack soldiers
in a sneak attack.

4
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,030
Even with a heavy ambush,

5
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,310
you fought your way out

6
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,150
and made it back alive.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,310
So,

8
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,350
she must still be alive,

9
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,150
right?

10
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,640
Kill me if you want.

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,400
Mr. Chen, you may be unafraid of death,

12
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,680
but what about your sister?

13
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,039
If you dare lay a hand on her,

14
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,170
I'll never let you off, even as a ghost.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,340
Wouldn't it be better to live?

16
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,070
I heard you two have relied on each other

17
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,280
since childhood.

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,789
And now she's pregnant.

19
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,509
Just give in once,

20
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,509
and from then on, you two can live

21
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,440
the life you've always dreamed of.

22
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:49,070
All you need to do
is to lure Mo Qingchuan out.

23
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,070
Simple, isn't it?

24
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,680
General Chen.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
You've got one incense stick's time

26
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,070
to think it through.

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,470
Mr. Zhou.

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,960
Mr. Zhou.

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,750
How's the investigation going?

30
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,010
When can I be released?

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,150
This whole thing is just Xia Qiguang's

32
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,410
baseless accusation.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,060
Even though Cao Ling'an couldn't speak,

34
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,990
he could still

35
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,800
write a confession.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,030
This has absolutely nothing to do with me.

37
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,360
Cao Ling'an

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,490
already took his own life out of guilt.

39
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,710
What?

40
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,430
He left behind a suicide note,

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,150
claiming

42
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,560
full responsibility

43
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,960
and insisting no one else was involved.

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
Then why haven't I been released yet?

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,360
I've received a secret ledger

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,470
detailing your

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,840
embezzlement of military funds

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,800
and bribery.

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,420
The sum involved is so vast

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,620
that it alone warrants a death sentence.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,590
No.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
Mr. Chen, it seems you

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,010
won't be getting out anytime soon.

54
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,800
No,

55
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,560
Mr. Zhou!

56
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,870
Someone's trying to frame me!

57
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,360
You have to help me seek justice,

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,120
Mr. Zhou!

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,590
I've been wronged!

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,120
[Who has Chen Siqi]

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,960
[offended?]

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,240
[This secret ledger from the Suoque Sect]

63
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,360
[is quite the revelation.]

64
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,800
Master,

65
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,079
I'm back!

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,400
Master,

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,910
I hung the ledger I stole

68
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,960
from Chen Siqi's house

69
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,710
on the Ministry of Justice's front door.

70
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,240
The officials were startled
when they came out.

71
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
I only left after I saw Zhou Zheng

72
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,430
take the ledger.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,150
Zhou Zheng

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,590
is a name that stands for uprightness.

75
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,840
Leaving Chen Siqi with him

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
is like lighting a lamp at midnight.

77
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,470
Let's see if his shadow

78
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,870
is straight or slanted.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,150
We can't say if he's righteous or corrupt,

80
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,430
but Zhou Zheng's

81
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,710
dirt poor.

82
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,840
[One steamed bun
and two servings of pickles.]

83
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,520
[He's stingier than even Master.]

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
[Seems there's nothing of value here.]

85
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,520
He's a high-ranking official,

86
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,579
yet this is all he has saved up at home.

87
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,440
He grew up in poverty.

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,120
When he was first appointed
magistrate of Qinnan County,

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,250
he didn't take a penny from the people.

90
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,360
Instead, he used his meager salary
to help the villagers.

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,630
Even after being promoted
to an official in the capital,

92
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,950
he stayed true to his principles—

93
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,880
serving the people
and striving to better the world.

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,070
Rare indeed.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,800
Looks like we've actually
come across a decent official.

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,430
I hope

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,260
he's truly worthy
of being called "decent."

98
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,760
Watch your step, Yan.

99
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,870
Mr. Zhou.

100
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,940
Dear, head back first.

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
I happen to have a few matters

102
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,750
to discuss with Mr. Zhou.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
Alright.

104
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,800
Mr. Zhou,

105
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,570
the steward should have informed you

106
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,950
that the Grand Commandant's Mansion
will be undergoing renovations soon.

107
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm afraid it might disturb
your peace and quiet.

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,070
Why don't you

109
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,920
find another suitable residence?

110
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,850
Thank you for the reminder, Mr. Mo.

111
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,720
However,

112
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,580
I have lived here since childhood

113
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,480
and have no plans to move.

114
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,950
Wait.

115
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,159
Cao Ling'an has been dead
for half a month.

116
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,000
I wonder why Prince Jing's case

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
still hasn't been closed, Mr. Zhou.

118
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,560
Mr. Mo,

119
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,159
are you worried about Chen Siqi?

120
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,250
What makes you say that, Mr. Zhou?

121
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,210
Mr. Mo, you know very well
what I'm talking about.

122
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,420
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

123
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,560
He's indulgent and wasteful.

124
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,020
I wouldn't deign
to associate with such people.

125
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,650
If he has committed a crime,

126
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,560
I urge you, Mr. Zhou,

127
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,040
to uphold the law impartially.

128
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,750
Mm.

129
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,320
Mr. Zhou, you have quite the appetite.

130
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,560
All thanks to you.

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,040
Well, no point in talking
when we clearly don't see eye to eye.

132
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,159
Agreed.

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,870
[He's not here for Chen Siqi,]

134
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,630
[yet he's concerned about
Prince Jing's case.]

135
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,690
[Could it be that Chen Siqi
has some leverage over him?]

136
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,950
[Or perhaps]

137
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,680
[he's the true mastermind]

138
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,140
[behind the Suoque Sect?]

139
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,360
Oh, Master,

140
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,630
I've searched all over the capital

141
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,870
and still couldn't find
any truly good plum wine.

142
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,920
Some were too sour,

143
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,780
some too sweet,

144
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,070
and others just tasted too strong.

145
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,510
This one is the only one

146
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,720
that's barely drinkable.

147
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,430
Try it.

148
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,870
I knew it.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,159
The wine in Qingchuan Town

150
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,560
tastes good no matter the shop,

151
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,480
but in the capital, each one

152
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,340
is terrible in its own unique way.

153
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,130
By the Biluo River, the waters run clear,

154
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,610
with green plums mirrored
in the stream from Qingchuan.

155
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,270
The spring breeze brings a drifting scent,

156
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,480
and blossoms, bright as brocade,
dazzle the eye.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,860
The Biluo River

158
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
in Qingchuan Town

159
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,360
is the purest place in all of Xia.

160
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Master,

161
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,290
I want to go back to Qingchuan Town.

162
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,030
You can't go back yet.

163
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,650
We need to wait a bit longer.

164
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,000
The capital is so boring.

165
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,040
I wonder what Qiguang is doing.

166
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,270
When will he come to keep me company?

167
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,120
It should be

168
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,920
soon.

169
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,440
You may proceed.

170
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,720
You may proceed.

171
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,750
Granted.

172
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,130
You may proceed.

173
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,170
You may proceed.

174
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,240
Qiye, your health improves by the day.

175
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,790
It is time we begin to consider

176
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,670
the matter of your personal rule.

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I am still young and inexperienced.

178
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,520
I must trouble you
to continue governing for now, Mother.

179
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,030
You are the future emperor of Xia.

180
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,280
You should shoulder your responsibilities.

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
Your Majesty is wise.

182
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,390
With Your Majesty's guidance, His Majesty

183
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,360
will surely

184
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,090
become a ruler of great wisdom.

185
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,440
I have only done what little I can.

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,280
Your Majesty,

187
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,960
I have another

188
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
memorial from General Cao Huaitai.

189
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,720
What's the matter with him now?

190
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,200
He's petitioning Your Majesty

191
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,630
to discharge the Young Lord
of Prince Jing's household

192
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,490
from the Black Armored Army camp.

193
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,790
Qiguang

194
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,000
has joined the army?

195
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,960
Yes.

196
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,200
They say it was Prince Jing's final wish

197
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,000
for him to serve the nation
through military duty.

198
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,320
Now, the Young Lord is in the army

199
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,180
doing nothing but menial chores.

200
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,600
Qiguang

201
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,870
is truly filial

202
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,030
to lower himself to such an extent.

203
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,080
However, in the army,

204
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,510
there are widespread complaints.

205
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,080
General Cao believes

206
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,320
the Young Lord
has disgraced the royal family

207
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,960
and demands
his immediate expulsion from the camp

208
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,290
and severe punishment.

209
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
It's just old grudges that haven't faded.

210
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
He's still holding onto
the time when Prince Jing punished him

211
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,640
with fifty lashes back at court.

212
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
I think

213
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,320
we might as well comply with
General Cao's request.

214
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
No need to damage

215
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,780
the sibling bond
between Your Majesty and General Cao.

216
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Sibling bond?

217
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,550
He dared to submit a memorial

218
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,670
against Xia's future Prince Jing

219
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,070
over something so petty.

220
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,550
He's really losing his sense of propriety.

221
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,790
Please calm your anger, Your Majesty.

222
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,120
General Cao is straightforward by nature

223
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,380
and certainly didn't mean to offend.

224
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,000
Since it was Prince Jing's last wish,

225
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm willing to grant Qiguang
what he desires.

226
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,910
Qiye,

227
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
what do you think?

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
I have no objections.

229
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,450
The decision is yours to make, Mother.

230
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,550
Mm.

231
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,240
Junyu,

232
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,510
Qiguang is also of royal blood.

233
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,790
Assign him to a civilian post

234
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,270
within the army.

235
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,590
Your Majesty is wise.

236
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,910
I will

237
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,400
make proper arrangements.

238
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
[The night before
Prince Jing was attacked,]

239
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,910
[he had a secret meeting with Jinchan Xia,
who had returned from Chu.]

240
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,120
[Unfortunately, Xia was]

241
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,150
[severely wounded by spies from Chu
on the way.]

242
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,320
[After the secret meeting
with Prince Jing,]

243
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,650
[he breathed his last.]

244
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,870
[Prince Jing left a message for me,]

245
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,000
[which must be related to the news
Jinchan Xia brought.]

246
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,870
[Feng Shiye.]

247
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,720
[These pieces of information
are intricate and complex.]

248
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,270
[However, the ledger
left by Cao Ling'an]

249
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,270
[directly implicates Mo Junyu]

250
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,730
[as the mastermind
behind the Suoque Sect.]

251
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,320
[But why would Mo Junyu
be willing to take]

252
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,650
[such a risk to assassinate Prince Jing?]

253
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,320
Qiguang,

254
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,750
dinner's ready.

255
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,840
Alright.

256
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,600
Master.

257
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,400
You're back.

258
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,870
Mm.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,790
I've received the appointment letter.

260
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,510
From now on,

261
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,640
I can stay with the Black Armored Army.

262
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
Who hit you?

263
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,040
It's nothing.

264
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,490
Just a minor injury.

265
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,010
Who would dare lay a hand
on the Young Lord in the army?

266
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,910
Cao Huaitai?

267
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,440
Why?

268
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,460
Just some past events.

269
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,150
I'd rather not talk about it.

270
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,080
Inspector,

271
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
a seventh-rank civil official,

272
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,250
is quite a unique position.

273
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,510
Yes.

274
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,670
After being appointed,

275
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,480
I won't have to stay in the camp all day.

276
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,720
Every day, after dawn and dusk,

277
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,120
I can come to
pay my respects to you, Master.

278
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,670
You must all be starving.

279
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,550
Let's eat.

280
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,840
Alright.

281
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,630
Let's dig in.

282
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,790
Master,

283
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
do you have any plans for tomorrow?

284
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,150
Why do you ask?

285
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,750
There's a martial arts competition

286
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,950
in the army tomorrow.

287
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,870
Some merchants who donated to the troops
have been invited to attend.

288
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,440
I noticed that the Cicada Agency
is on the list.

289
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,630
I was wondering if you

290
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,030
received an invitation.

291
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,870
Mm.

292
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,750
Master,

293
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,390
could you

294
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,030
come with me tomorrow?

295
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,150
To me,

296
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,550
joining the army

297
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,480
is a big step

298
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,600
in my life,

299
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,600
and I want you

300
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,550
to be there to witness it.

301
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,750
Tomorrow, Cicada Agency
has some business to attend to.

302
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,390
I'm afraid I won't be able to go with you.

303
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:17,790
Oh.

304
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,600
Alright.

305
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,630
I understand.

306
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,750
Never mind.

307
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,240
Master,

308
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,720
a few days ago,

309
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,160
I met some people at the military camp.

310
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,870
They refused to submit to the Cao family,

311
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,730
and now they're living in misery.

312
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,790
They were

313
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,840
once part of the Mo Army.

314
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,750
Mother used to say,

315
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,080
back then the sky was clear,
the air was fresh,

316
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,410
and the wind was gentle.

317
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,550
But now,

318
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,200
the Cao family's power
looms like heavy clouds,

319
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,390
blocking out the sun and covering the sky.

320
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,120
I'll be officially
joining the army tomorrow.

321
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,780
It may not seem like a big deal,

322
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,560
but it's what I set out to do.

323
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,870
Jiang Kui,

324
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,390
can you take care of
the Cicada Agency's affairs

325
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,590
on your own tomorrow?

326
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,720
After all,

327
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,960
tomorrow is a big day

328
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,790
for Qiguang.

329
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,240
Master.

330
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,970
Let me accompany you tomorrow.

331
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,560
Alright.

332
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,140
Thank you, Master.

333
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
No way.

334
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,270
I want to go too.

335
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,320
As you wish.

336
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,730
[Let's go wild together!]

337
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,360
Congratulations, Young Lord,

338
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,840
on your promotion
to seventh-rank Inspector.

339
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,770
I'm here to collect my new uniform.

340
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,200
Put it on.

341
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,600
Mm.

342
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,090
Admit your defeat.

343
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
Shitou!

344
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,270
Shitou!

345
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,870
Master,

346
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,730
have you finished your business?

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,910
Is there anyone else
willing to come up and challenge?

348
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,970
His name is Shitou.

349
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,670
He's Cao Huaitai's Vice General,

350
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,960
the Military Commandant.

351
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,890
His martial skills are quite good.

352
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,750
Looks like

353
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,630
Shitou has taken the championship again

354
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,480
in this year's

355
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,400
martial arts competition.

356
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,600
I, Shitou,

357
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,360
have fought the northern Liang Clan,

358
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,960
defeated the western Tiele,

359
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,600
and earned great honors
on the battlefield.

360
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,670
I heard that the Young Lord

361
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,200
is determined to join
our Black Armored Army.

362
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,150
Out of care and affection,
the Empress Dowager

363
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,880
appointed him as an Inspector.

364
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,339
The Young Lord has never killed an enemy,

365
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,240
yet now,

366
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,000
our rewards and punishments

367
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,680
are all decided
by the stroke of his brush.

368
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,400
I, Shitou, won't accept that.

369
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,060
I, Shitou, won't accept that.

370
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,680
This doesn't bode well.

371
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,550
Mm.

372
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,000
Today at the martial arts competition,

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,589
I, Shitou,

374
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,680
formally issue a Spearbreaker Challenge
to the Young Lord.

375
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
Do you dare to accept?

376
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,600
A Spearbreaker Challenge?

377
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,510
It's a tradition of the Xia army.

378
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,440
Once the Spearbreaker Challenge is issued,

379
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,750
it's a fight to the death

380
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,680
as a symbol
of bravery and martial prowess.

381
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,790
If you don't accept the challenge,

382
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,790
others will surely think

383
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,830
that when you go to the battlefield,

384
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,630
you're a coward who fears death.

385
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,960
That is an overt stratagem.

386
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,720
Qiguang,

387
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,110
you must

388
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,610
accept the challenge.

389
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:46,790
Yes,

390
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,640
Master.

391
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,830
Good.

392
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,030
At least you're not a coward.

393
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,000
Commandant Gao,
your sincere invitation is hard to refuse.

394
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,480
In military duels,

395
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,570
life and death are not accounted for.

396
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,880
Agreed.

397
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,790
[One wrong move,]

398
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,640
[and it's death or ruin.]

399
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,070
[Can Qiguang win?]

400
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,030
Dawn Break Form II!

401
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,200
[Not bad.]

402
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,790
The Young Lord actually defeated Shitou.

403
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,920
Master,

404
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,030
Qiguang has mastered
the Dawn Break Form II.

405
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,000
Young Lord, your martial skills are superb

406
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,030
and elusive.

407
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,680
I, Shitou,

408
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,680
am truly convinced.

409
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,310
Commandant Gao, you're too kind.

410
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,200
From now on,

411
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,790
I'll be relying on your guidance
in the army, Commandant Gao.

412
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,550
General Cao,

413
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,510
what Xia Qiguang used

414
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,290
seems to be
the Mo family's sword technique.

415
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,110
It's been almost 20 years, hasn't it?

416
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,240
When General Mo Junshan
returned to the capital to report,

417
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,000
he demonstrated it once before the troops.

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,750
I caught a glimpse of it from afar.

419
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,510
The Mo family's sword technique
is said to be hard to master,

420
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,110
requiring exceptional talent.

421
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,960
Therefore,

422
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,750
only a very few direct descendants

423
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,160
are qualified to learn it.

424
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,420
It hasn't spread widely within the army.

425
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,920
I can't believe it.

426
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,960
But

427
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,590
the Mo family is almost extinct.

428
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,330
Xia Qiguang has no connection
with Grand Commandant Mo.

429
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,160
Where did he learn that?

430
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,590
Could it be

431
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,240
from Mo Qingchuan of Chu?

432
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,500
We'll have to ask the Young Lord himself.

433
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,740
Is anyone else willing to challenge?

434
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,430
Since no one is challenging,

435
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:53,960
I'll announce that—

436
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,480
Wait.

437
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,310
I

438
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,450
still have some questions.

439
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,480
It's been days since I last saw you,
Young Lord.

440
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,110
Your martial arts skills
are surprisingly exceptional.

441
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,590
It truly makes me

442
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,770
admire you.

443
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,480
There's one thing

444
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,590
I

445
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,350
am very curious about.

446
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,070
Young Lord,

447
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,110
where did you learn

448
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,100
the Mo family's sword technique?

449
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,920
What?

450
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,960
The Mo family's style
is both graceful and deadly.

451
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,150
It's a peerless art,
rarely seen in this world.

452
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,550
Today,

453
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,750
I can say I've truly
broadened my horizons.

454
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,070
Young Lord.

455
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,440
Inspector,

456
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,030
answer me now!

457
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,110
Where did you learn

458
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,750
the Mo family's sword technique?

459
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,070
[What does he mean?]

460
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,720
["Dawn Break"]

461
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,310
[is a sword technique of the Mo family?]

462
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,790
Aside from Grand Commandant Mo,

463
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,960
only Mo Qingchuan

464
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
has ever mastered it.

465
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,110
Could it be that Mo Qingchuan

466
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,510
taught you those skills?

467
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,240
No.

468
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,110
Then who did?

469
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,510
I did.

470
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,000
Who's that?

471
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,570
Looks like a wealthy merchant
they invited to watch the match.

472
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,350
Let me correct you.

473
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,110
The Mo family's sword technique

474
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,370
is not exclusive to direct descendants.

475
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,720
It just requires talent,

476
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,170
and most people simply don't have it.

477
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,550
But Xia Qiguang has a rare talent.

478
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,030
I value that,

479
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,350
so I taught him.

480
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,110
General Cao, if you have the talent,

481
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,420
I can teach you as well.

482
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Or anyone here.

483
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
After all,

484
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,510
the Mo family's sword technique

485
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,840
is meant to protect our homes and country.

486
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,110
However,

487
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,000
General Cao, you lack both aptitude

488
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,880
and flair.

489
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,750
Who are you?

490
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,240
Humbly speaking,

491
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,920
I am the greatest master in the world,

492
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
the wealthiest woman in the Southeast,

493
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,880
and the head of the Cicada Agency—

494
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,920
Mo Wang.

495
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,200
I see, you're Master Mo.

496
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,790
Then, Master Mo,

497
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,920
where did you learn

498
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,780
the Mo family's sword technique?

499
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,160
This is truly

500
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,000
a nostalgic story.

501
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Long ago,

502
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,550
I crossed paths
with General Mo Junshan by chance.

503
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,440
We hit it off immediately.

504
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,070
So,

505
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,270
he made a copy of the sword manual
and gave it to me.

506
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,640
He confided in me,

507
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,160
saying the Mo family's sword technique
was obscure and difficult to understand.

508
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,360
It was hard to pass on.

509
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,270
It's such a powerful sword technique.

510
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,200
Why have I never heard of it before?

511
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,310
Jiang Kui obtained it by chance.

512
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,000
I heard it has been circulating
in the martial arts world for a long time.

513
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,270
Jiang Kui didn't think much of it,

514
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,330
so we gave it to you.

515
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,620
He told me if I ever met
someone with talent,

516
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,850
I shall pass on
the Mo family's sword technique to them.

517
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,310
[Why did Master lie to me?]

518
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,120
It's truly nostalgic to think about it.

519
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,930
There aren't that many coincidences
in this world.

520
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,590
Now, I suspect

521
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,720
that you

522
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,510
are the traitor, Mo Qingchuan.

523
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,310
I believe the "Mo" in Master Mo's name

524
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,970
is the same
as the "Mo" in Mo Qingchuan, isn't it?

525
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,730
Otherwise, why don't you
dare to show your face?

526
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,080
-[Is Master really Mo Qingchuan?]
-It's just for sunshade.

527
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,720
Go,

528
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,590
bring me the former subordinates
who have met Mo Qingchuan.

529
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,440
Yes, sir.

530
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200
Could it really be Mo Qingchuan?

531
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,110
That traitor actually dares to return?

532
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,960
Is she here spying for Chu?

533
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,510
If it's truly her,

534
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,640
today, you and I will take turns

535
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,030
cutting her to pieces.

536
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,440
General Cao.

537
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,960
Today,

538
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,310
there's a suspected traitor,

539
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,000
Mo Qingchuan, who's infiltrated
our Black Armored Army.

540
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,270
All of you, look carefully.

541
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,680
If anyone exposes her,

542
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,960
a generous reward awaits you.

543
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,270
Cao Huaitai,

544
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,720
I, Mo Wang, am also
a person of some standing.

545
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,590
Today, I've been baselessly suspected

546
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,400
and even lumped together
with the traitor Mo Qingchuan.

547
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,330
It seriously harms my reputation.

548
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,640
If I'm not Mo Qingchuan,

549
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,550
General Cao,

550
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,830
what will you do?

551
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,830
If you're not,

552
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
I will publicly

553
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,160
apologize to you, Master Mo.

554
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,070
You said it yourself.

555
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,240
Well, everyone,

556
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,310
take a good look.

557
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
She took it off.

558
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,550
What does she look like?

559
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,680
Is she Mo Qingchuan?

560
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,160
Do you see clearly?

561
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,590
Is she Mo Qingchuan or not?

562
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,050
Reporting to the general,

563
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,920
she is not Mo Qingchuan.

564
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,320
Humph.

565
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,410
Where did this imposter come from?

566
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,510
This young lady

567
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,830
doesn't even compare to
one-hundredth of General Qingchuan.

568
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,630
That's right.

569
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,110
She's neither as tall as
General Qingchuan,

570
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,400
nor as strong as her.

571
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,550
Really?

572
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,720
Really.

573
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,750
Why are you looking at me?

574
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,790
[I've heard that Mo Qingchuan
is very protective of her own.]

575
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,590
[Yet she shows no reaction.]

576
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,070
You may go now.

577
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,350
Yes.

578
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,030
If the general

579
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,610
needs to summon us,

580
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,830
we

581
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,800
are at your service anytime!

582
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,280
That's right!

583
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,960
That's right!

584
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,480
That's right!

585
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Get lost.

586
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,110
Since

587
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,070
I'm not Mo Qingchuan,

588
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,480
how will you make up for

589
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,560
the humiliation I've suffered,
General Cao?

590
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,880
Well then, Master Mo,

591
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,960
what do you want?

592
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,750
This

593
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,090
will do just fine as compensation.

594
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,110
You dare to hurt me?

595
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,880
Seize her!

596
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,240
The Demoness Jiang Kui is here.

597
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,000
Let's see who dares to make a move.

598
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,270
If you admit your mistake,

599
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,920
you should act like it.

600
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,520
If you want to lay a hand on me,

601
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,430
you'd better think about

602
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,240
whether you'll cut off
the Empress Dowager's source of income.

603
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,000
General,

604
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,480
we are in the wrong here.

605
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,540
Let's just drop it.

606
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,510
It wouldn't do us any good
if the Empress Dowager heard about this.

607
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,310
Get lost!

608
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,550
You're the one who stirred up trouble,

609
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,200
and now you're trying to
smooth things over?

610
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,310
How boring.

611
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,960
I'm leaving.
