00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,320
General Qingchuan,

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,880
surrender.

4
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,320
The Chu will grant you rank and riches.

5
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,350
Why must you persist?

6
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,390
The Mo Army

7
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,390
will not yield a single inch.

8
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,950
Wait.

9
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,750
Stand down.

10
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,980
The Mo Army

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,789
no longer exists.

12
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,640
Empress Dowager Cao has decreed:

13
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,750
the Mo Army's title is revoked.

14

From now on,

you are to be known only as

Pledge loyalty to me,

and I'll let you have your revenge.

19
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,710
Word is, the Chu envoy is
heading to the capital.

20
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,750
They speak of peace,

21
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,820
but it's just a disguised plunder.

22
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,440
Famine and war—

23
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,280
such troubled times.

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,250
Stop crying.

25

If the Chu forcrs comes,

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,540
even the children will be killed.

29
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,090
You've already killed 1,000 people.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,030
You're about to

31
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,820
become the thousand and first.

32
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,630
You can kill one more,

33
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,490
but you cannot kill another 1,000,

or 100,000 again.

Killing you

37
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,530
will be enough.

38
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,610
General, watch out!

39
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,560
I've waded through blood
and fire just to face you here.

40
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,820
Why not take this battlefield as a place

41
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,850
for a calm conversation between us?

42
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,290
What's there to talk about?

43
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,250
Let's talk about how justice
turns a blind eye,

44
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,070
how villains thrive in chaos,

45
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,680
and how heroes

46
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,550
are left with no path to take.

47
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,220
Villains?

48
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,520
Chaos?

49
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,500
When you fought with a death wish,

50
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,459
Qingchuan Town fell in an instant.

51
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,040
You didn't lose to my soldiers;

52
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,950
but you

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,280
lost to the hearts of your own people.

54
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,870
Who

55
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,390
betrayed me?

56
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,360

You'll meet him eventually.

59
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,310
When that time comes, the
earth will bear witness,

60
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,940
the heavens will be the judge.

61
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,240
Maybe then you can seek justice

62
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,550
for yourself.

63
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,150
Justice?

64
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,240
What justice is there

65
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,850
under the rule of power?

66
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,920

to catch fireflies now.

if I get lost in the dark,

just follow the fireflies,

I was worried you had died
somewhere in Xia.

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,710
thirty percent of

193
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,310
what's in this treaty?

194
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,670
Your Majesties,

195
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,640
such a humiliating treaty

196
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,400
must never be accepted.

197
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,070
Your Majesties,

198
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,200
we cannot accept it.

199
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,360
Feng Shiye,

200
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,430
the terms of this peace negotiation

201
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,280
have nearly doubled

202
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,790
compared to last time.

203
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,590
This is truly unreasonable.

204
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,550
Peace negotiations must be
mutually beneficial.

205
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,640
In recent years, Chu's
demand for grain, silk, and
other goods has surged.

206
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,310
In exchange,

207
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,510
our country is willing to help
Xia with the shortage of
soldiers and horses.

208
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,760
How so?

209
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,470
Ten thousand Chu forces can be stationed
along Xia's four borders,

210
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,000
to maintain long-lasting stability.

211
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,360
Absurd!

212
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,790
Allowing Chu forces to enter our borders

213
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,950
is no different from inviting
wolves into the house.

214
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,760
What difference remains
between the people of Xia

215
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,790
and fish on the chopping block?

216
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,190
I, He Zhixiang,

217
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,590
am willing to die today to
advise His Majesty against this!

218
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,510
Mr. He.

219
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,520
Mr. He,

220
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,550
what are you doing?

221
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,790
Prime Minister,

222
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,550
they are all pretending to be asleep!

223
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,830
I want to see if my blood

224
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,590
can wake them up!

225
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,710
Mr. He,

226
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,670
calm down.

227
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,400
We're in this together, aren't we?

228
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,000
We stand with you.

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,660
Who here truly stands with me?

230
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,040
Him?

231
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Them?

232
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,160
Or is it you?

233
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,000
The road to the underworld
is crowded enough already.

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,760
Sir, why do you seek death?

235
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,240
If there were a path to live,

236
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,830
who would choose death?

237
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,550
As it happens, there is a path forward—

238
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,760
a royal marriage.

239
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,790
If by that, the goods and
tribute listed in the treaty

240
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,650
can be reduced by thirty percent.

241
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,920
Naturally, we welcome such a union.

242
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,470
But may I ask,

243
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,930
which of our princesses do
you want to marry?

244
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,370
It's not a princess.

245
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,950
Not a princess?

246
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,950
Then a noble lady?

247
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,160
I, Feng Shiye, the sixth Prince of Chu,

248
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,290
am seeking to marry the general of Xia—

249
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,240
Mo Qingchuan.

250
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,750
Master.

251
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,040
Chu shows great sincerity.

252
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,310
War or peace;

253
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,790
I give you ten days to decide.

254
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,040
Your Majesty,

255
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,950
Empress Dowager,

256
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,690
please consider carefully.

257
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,070
Your Highness, why did you suddenly
propose to Mo Qingchuan?

258
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,430
The Emperor has placed
great hopes on this mission.

259
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,030
At first, I assumed you

260
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,430
raised the price of peace by
thirty percent

261
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,079
as a test.

262
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,839
If Xia accepted,

263
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,079
we'd gain an extra share at no cost.

264
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,920
But now,

265
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,750
to exchange for Mo Qingchuan,

266
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,470
we're missing such a great opportunity.

267
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,920
Is it worth it?

268
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,210
You have achieved remarkable success

269
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,730
in the battle against Xia.

270
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,950
After this battle,

271
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,200
even the Second Prince

272
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,590
can no longer rival you.

273
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,640
But the tides of war shift in an instant.

274
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,600
We cannot afford to grow complacent.

275
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,320
The Mo family has lost three sons.

276
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,920
Mo Junshan is gravely ill and
can no longer rise from bed.

277
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,880
The Mo Army has gone days
without supplies.

278
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
They've resorted to eating warhorses.

279
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,600
Within the time it takes for a
single stick of incense to burn,

280
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,160
news of victory will arrive.

281
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,470
Once this piece falls,

282
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,670
you will

283
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,880
have won the game.

284
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,030
The commander has been slain!

285
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,040
The commander has been slain!

286
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,720
The commander has been slain!

287
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,640
Hurry!

288
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,810
What happened?

289
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,230
How could the commander be killed?

290
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,840
He was ambushed on the
Helian Mountain pass

291
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,240
and beheaded on the spot.

292
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,160
But the Mo family was
supposed to be wiped out.

293
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,080
Who did this?

294
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,770
It's...

295
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,470
Mo Qingchuan!

296
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,560
Mo Qingchuan

297
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,470
wasn't worth it.

298
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,670
You think she wasn't worth trading
for thirty percent less tribute.

299
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,640
But to Xia,

300
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,710
gaining peace through her
was more than worth the price.

301
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,190
Let's hope so.

302
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,470
Once the peace talks are over,

303
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,670
your greater plan

304
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,130
can finally move forward.

305
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,510
Certainly.

306
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,920
Your Majesty.

307
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,840
Su Qi,

308
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,580
what do you think?

309
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,320
Oh, you know me.

310
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,160
I live for stories of heroes and romance.

311
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,120
General Mo

312
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,740
paired with Feng Shiye

313
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,400
is indeed a good match.

314
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,400
She's

315
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,230
bathed in blood

316
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,120
and slain thousands,

317
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,750
and in your mouth,

318
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,800
she's just a pretty name?

319
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,770
You're right. I was careless.

320
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,370
I was shallow in my thinking.

321
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,080
The court

322
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,600
is divided over war or peace,

323
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,640
and Mo Qingchuan's status is sensitive.

324
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,990
Using her for a marriage alliance

325
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,230
may cause an uproar.

326
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,990
Then,

327
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,400
what's your intention?

328
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,080
Su Qi,

329
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,840
do you know why I favor chrysanthemums

330
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,080
above all?

331
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,470
Because

332
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,670
they're beautiful?

333
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,360
In the first year
of Emperor Yongping's reign,

334
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,160
on the day I was named Empress,

335
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,800
during the golden autumn rains,

336
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,710
the Founding Emperor

337
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,880
led me down that path.

338
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,030
It's a path

339
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,560
lined with

340
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,720
golden chrysanthemums,
blazing like clouds at sunset.

341
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,270
It must have been beautiful.

342
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,030
Yes,

343
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,330
it was beautiful.

344
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,730
Even the snow beyond the frontier

345
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
and the waters of Qingchuan Town

346
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,440
couldn't compare to

347
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,090
that glimpse of golden chrysanthemums.

348
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:04,070
[Master]

349
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,490
Is that Qiguang?

350
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,840
[Master]

351
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,480
Yes.

352
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Master,

353
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,470
Feng Shiye arrived last night,

354
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,950
and today

355
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,300
he's at the court...

356
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,830
I would like to ask you,

357
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,000
what is the promise

358
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,980
between you and Feng Shiye?

359
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,760
When you're in Xia,

360
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,800
every three months

361
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,730
you come to my men for the antidote.

362
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,730
Don't blame me.

363
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,560
If not for this,

364
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,180
I'm afraid I might never find you again.

365
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,290
Alright.

366
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,450
Your time in Xia is set for three years.

367
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,530
Do as you will with your
debts and vengeance.

368
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,220
But don't forget that

369
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
once you've slain all your enemies,

370
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,520
you are to marry me.

371
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,140
What do you think?

372
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,020
What is it?

373
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,050
I don't know.

374
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,800
It seems you never asked

375
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,860
how I made it back from Chu.

376
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,500
Was it

377
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,770
Feng Shiye who helped you get back?

378
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,650
Yes, it was.

379
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,150
How ironic.

380
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,800
In my darkest hour, the one who spared me

381
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,510
wasn't my sworn homeland,

382
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,990
but my sworn enemy.

383
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,910
But things are different now.

384
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,730
You have the Mo Army,

385
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,880
you have Jiang Kui,

386
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,710
and you

387
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,320
have me.

388
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,320
Is it really different?

389
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,250
Qiguang,

390
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,900
is it truly different?

391
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,120
When Feng Shiye offered

392
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,840
to trade me for thirty percent
of the tribute,

393
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,010
did you see the look in their eyes?

394
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,210
Do you think the Empress Dowager
would let this chance slip away?

395
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,280
My father and brothers

396
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,490
died on the battlefield.

397
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,480
I was left battered and broken.

398
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,590
But in the end,

399
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,080
I, Mo Qingchuan,

400
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,150
was just a bargaining chip to them.

401
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,940
When Mo Junyu died,

402
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,130
I once rekindled hope.

403
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,560
My father taught me to never
regret the past,

404
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,360
only to stay true to my heart.

405
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,310
But lately,

406
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,040
I can't help but think

407
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,120
if I had known it would come to this...

408
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,850
If I had known,

409
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,780
why did my father and
brothers have to die?

410
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,330
If I had known,

411
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,380
why did my Mo Army have to fight?

412
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,150
If I had known...

413
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,190
Master,

414
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,190
those in power have no justice;

415
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,990
but true justice lies in the
hearts of the people.

416
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,100
Justice?

417
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,660
Justice can't be seen or touched,

418
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,900
but these wounds of mine

419
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,520
burn every single moment.

420
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,290
I'm not afraid of pain,

421
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,050
but why...

422
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,120
Why should I suffer alone?

423
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,450
What can I do

424
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,300
to ease your pain?

425
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,110
Tell me,

426
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,180
I'll do whatever it takes.

427
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,560
You can't help me.

428
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,990
Then can Feng Shiye?

429
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,290
Go.

430
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,300
I still hope there's justice

431
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,970
left in the halls of power,

432
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,170
like you said.

433
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,090
Master.

434
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,160
Go.

435
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,550
Since you're so utterly
disappointed with Xia,

436
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,290
and only harbor hatred,

437
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,840
why not honor the marriage pact?

438
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,220
I agreed to marry you,

439
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,280
but I never agreed to be your pawn.

440
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,620
How could I ever treat you like a pawn?

441
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,550
If you want others

442
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,540
to accept bitter truths willingly,

443
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,450
you have to first give them
something even more bitter.

444
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,380
It's just psychological warfare.

445
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,300
You're using me as bait

446
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,710
and setting a ten-day deadline—

447
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,330
all to retreat now and
scheme for peace later.

448
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,730
I know you too well.

449
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,590
The more you want to win a game of chess,

450
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,630
the stranger your moves become.

451
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,920
But you forgot,

452
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,520
I can always see through you.

453
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,100
Qingchuan.

454
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,190
You know

455
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,120
what I want.

456
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,630
Yes.

457
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,100
You want them buried with the Mo Army.

458
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,650
Then what are you doing?

459
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,950
Has your blade

460
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,090
dulled with time?

461
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,380
Are you just craving peace and quiet now?

462
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,800
You killed Chen Siqi.

463
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,880
You killed Mo Junyu.

464
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,120
Isn't that enough?

465
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,030
Enough?

466
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,510
The real criminals are still

467
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,700
sitting comfortably above it all.

468
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,200
Qingchuan,

469
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,950
matters between two nations take time.

470
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,550
Don't be reckless.

471
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,050
I'm neither human nor ghost now.

472
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,850
I no longer belong to Chu or Xia.

473
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,270
Why should I understand?

474
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,920
I won't marry.

475
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
You're not still clinging to

476
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,600
that boy's talk of justice, are you?

477
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,080
What I think or feel

478
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,640
is none of your damn business.

479
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,870
Qingchuan,

480
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,570
don't go against me.

481
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,820
And what will you do

482
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,110
if I do?

483
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,710
It's not enough.

484
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,230
Not nearly enough.

485
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,410
I've said it before.

486
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,880
What was done to me

487
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,330
will be done to you.

488
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,540
Chen Siqi.

489
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,690
Zhou Zheng.

490
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,960
Mo Junyu.

491
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,160
Empress Dowager Cao.

492
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,930
And you.

493
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,510
Feng Shiye.

494
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,080
Why won't you bow to me?

495
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,500
Even just once would be enough.

496
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,220
You

497
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,340
are

498
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,420
dreaming.

499
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,840
Didn't you want to see me bow?

500
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,950
Why are you afraid to look at me now?

501
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,430
Master.

502
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,230
Feng Shiye.

503
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,450
What a damn nuisance.

504
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
He

505
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,360
is not here truly for peace.

506
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,870
[Opened only by Mo Wang]

507
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,640
Chu is covertly naming

508
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,600
Feng Shiye

509
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,320
as crown prince.

510
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,640
Feng Shiye went to great
lengths to eliminate Prince Jing

511
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,750
just to keep it quiet.

512
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,080
His peace talks

513
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,500
probably have another agenda.
