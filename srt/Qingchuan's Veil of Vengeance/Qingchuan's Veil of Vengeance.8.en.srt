Why is everyone crying?

00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,250

to protect the land of Xia.

Her name is Mo Qingchuan.

She's a heroine too.

12
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,760
If the Mo Army is the sky,

13

then Mo Qingchuan

Greetings, Mr. Li.

Something has happened
to the Cicada Agency.

You have my deepest sympathies.

36
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,260
However,

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,160
you claimed that Mo Wang
is hiding in Prince Jing's Mansion.

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,800
May I ask who told you that?

39
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,140
I'd like to confront
the accuser face to face.

40
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,270
The investigation is still underway.

Mr. Li,

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,690
do you have any other evidence?

46

No.

but more importantly,

because he is a founding hero of Xia.

54
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,650
Mr. Li, you have no evidence
beyond hearsay,

55

You brought Mo Wang
into the mansion last night.

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,290
was very similar to the one
who killed my father.

102

Are you saying
there's a mastermind behind this?

at the Xia royal bloodline.

113

can deter wrongdoers

Fortunately, Ms. Mo was prepared.

137
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,560

to misuse
the Provincial Judicial Office today,

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,800
he might dare to

150

bring the Black Armored Army to
surround Prince Jing's Mansion tomorrow.

151
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,350
This superficial protection
from the Imperial Guard

152
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,560
might deter honorable men,

153
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,270
but it won't stop a madman.

in its power to ensure her safe departure.

It's me,

Fang Du.

170
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,360
The fire mustn't go out.

171
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,220
Keep it burning for twelve hours.

172
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Don't leave it unattended.

173
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Watch it closely.

174
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,210
Alright.

175
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,340

Your wounds haven't healed yet.

177
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,970
I'll do it.

178
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,880
I'll do it.

179
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,050
Then I'll relieve you after six hours.

180
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,200
Okay.

181
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,750
Physician Fang,

182
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,480
why does this medicine

183

keep smelling weirder?

184
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,960
Probably because it contains
a lot of fire-bellied toads,

185
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
eels,

186
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
and tokay geckos.

187
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,210
That sounds disgusting.

188
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,150
It must taste terrible, right?

189
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,130
I've never really cared about the taste.

190
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,930
What matters is that it works.

191
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,000
Well,

192
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,740
if I ever get sick,

193
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,080
can you make me medicine
that actually tastes good?

194
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,360
Of course.

195
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
But,

196
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,420
it's best if you don't get sick at all.

197
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,610
You're right about that.

198
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,840
These next two days will be tough.

199
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,120
I've given her medicine
to help suppress it for now,

200
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
but her cultivation technique is intense.

201
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,510
There's a chance she might lose control.

202
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,000
Whatever happens, don't leave her side.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
Leave it to me.

204
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,550
I have other matters to attend to.

205
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll take my leave now.

206
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,270
Okra.

207
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,970
[What an adorable disciple.]

208
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,880
What did she just call me?

209
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,510
Okra.

210
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,970
Why did she leave so suddenly?

211
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,510
Who knows?

212
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,970
She's the reclusive type,

213
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,820
always wrapped in mystery.

214
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,740
[Eternal Bliss]

215
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,720
Kui,

216
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,600
how did you meet Master?

217
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,120
Trying to get information out of me?

218
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,930
No way.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,790
What?

220
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,390
You think I'm an idiot?

221
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,550
No.

222
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,380
I just wanted to let you know.

223
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,250
I already know that Master

224
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,790
is Mo Qingchuan.

225
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,190
I've suspected it for some time.

226
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,630
So, Kui,

227
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,820
please don't tell her
that I've figured it out.

228
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
Why not?

229
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,770
Since Master chose not to say it,

230
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,640
she must have her reasons.

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,530
So I'll pretend I don't know

232
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,660
and wait until she's ready
to tell me herself.

233
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,190
That makes sense.

234
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,750
Then, Kui, can you tell me

235
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,060
how you and Master met?

236
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,990
Alright.

237
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,560
Master and I

238
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,650
met in a prison in Chu.

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,160
Have you heard of
the Star-Moon Sect in the Misty Forest?

240
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
I have.

241
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,840
It's said to be quite mysterious.

242
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,370
There are all kinds of bizarre stories
about it.

243
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,250
That's right.

244
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,450
The Star-Moon Sect may look like
a religious sect on the surface,

245
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,780
but in truth,
it only has one member—its leader.

246
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,250
My First Master, Hong Yan,

247
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,040
likes to wander around.

248
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,720
She has a fiery temper.

249
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,360
Once, when she was
passing through Qingchuan Town,

250
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,530
she said I had
extraordinary talent and potential.

251
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,980
She insisted on taking me
up the mountain to learn martial arts,

252
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,730
promising I could return home
once my training was complete.

253
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,640
However,

254
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,540
when I returned home,

255
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,870
I found that Qingchuan Town

256
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,790
had fallen under Chu's control.

257
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,330
My parents had been killed
by Chu soldiers.

258
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,390
In a fit of rage,

259
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,170
I stirred up trouble in the town

260
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,190
and killed quite a few people from Chu.

261
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,590
Later, more and more of them
surrounded me.

262
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,200
At first, I thought
I could fight them off,

263
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,720
but to my surprise,

264
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,080
I couldn't.

265
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,490
So I had no choice but to accept my fate.

266
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,840
Then,

267
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,910
why didn't they kill you?

268
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,220
I don't know.

269
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,790
Maybe they wanted to
study my Phantom Steps.

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,080
Anyway,

271
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,510
they caught me.

272
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,570
That's how I met Master in prison.

273
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,070
She was locked up next to me.

274
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,040
Every day,

275
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,970
she was beaten badly.

276
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,100
As for me,

277
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,020
when I parted ways with the First Master,

278
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,780
she told me she'd come back
to check on my progress.

279
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,230
So every day,

280
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,380
I'd recite all the techniques
Master Hong Yan taught me.

281
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,180
Then one day,

282
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,390
Master Qingchuan struck up
a conversation with me.

283
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,850
Guess what the first thing
she said to me was.

284
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,360
What was it?

285
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,200
"You got it wrong."

286
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,550
She said I recited it differently
from the day before,

287
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,550
but exactly the same as two days ago.

288
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,000
Master had an incredible memory.

289
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,950
Eventually, we became prison mates.

290
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,300
We shared many stories with each other.

291
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,080
After that,

292
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,050
she was taken away by a man.

293
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,180
Who?

294
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,100
I don't know.

295
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,720
But,

296
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,650
she said she would come back for me.

297
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,030
She kept her word.

298
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,630
So,

299
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,490
why did you become her disciple later?

300
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,270
Because I couldn't beat her.

301
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,030
Just kidding.

302
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,850
Though Master Hong Yan was formidable,

303
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,910
Master Qingchuan was very good to me.

304
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,730
Most importantly,

305
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,270
we shared the same goal.

306
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,150
Me too.

307
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,900
Of course I know.

308
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,850
Master.

309
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,710
Master.

310
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,550
Master.

311
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,860
You're awake.

312
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
Mm.

313
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,610
Brother,

314
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,180
where did you hide all my candies?

315
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,600
Why are you so quiet?

316
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,000
Master,

317
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,770
what are you talking about?

318
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,440
Father said I can't have too much candy,

319
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,370
so he took away all my plum candies.

320
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,020
Big Brother,

321
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,910
did you hide them for me?

322
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,630
Give them back to me.

323
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
[It seems Master is just rambling.]

324
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,080
It's fine if you don't want to
give me candies.

325
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,670
But when are you going to
teach me Dawn Break?

326
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,600
You're always so hesitant to teach me.

327
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,270
Don't tell me you're afraid I'll master it

328
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,430
and beat you.

329
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,790
[So these are Master's memories.]

330
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,089
[But her brothers]

331
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,569
[have long fallen in battle.]

332
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,280
I promise I'll keep it a secret.

333
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,390
I won't tell Father

334
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,820
that you're the one
teaching me Dawn Break.

335
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,150
Okay?

336
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,910
Pinky swear?

337
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,660
Pinky swear.

338
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,930
Thank you, Brother.

339
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,260
Once I master Dawn Break Form III,

340
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,050
I'll be able to fight
alongside Father and you.

341
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,140
The battlefield is too dangerous.

342
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,100
From now on,

343
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,510
I'll be the one to protect you all.

344
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,350
Master.

345
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,110
Master.

346
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,240
Master.

347
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,040
What's wrong?

348
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,590
Let's go.

349
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,900
[Eternal Bliss]

350
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,440
Let's go.

351
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,680
What's wrong with Master?

352
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,330
[Eternal Bliss]

353
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,830
Wait.

354
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,740
Don't go.

355
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,510
Why?

356
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,750
I tried to subdue her once,

357
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,960
but I couldn't beat her.

358
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,790
If you go in now,
you're walking straight to your death.

359
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,010
Once she starts fighting,
she doesn't recognize anyone.

360
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,000
Then are we just going to
leave her like that?

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,400
We don't have a choice.

362
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,810
Even ten of us together
couldn't take her down.

363
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,250
Let her unleash her fury.

364
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,960
She'll tire out and calm down on her own.

365
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,800
Just be quick on your feet
when she lashes out,

366
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,130
and the rest of the time,
go along with her.

367
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,360
She won't remember any of it afterward.

368
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,050
Does Master

369
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,510
get like this often?

370
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,460
Not really.

371
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,570
She rarely has to use such strength.

372
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
My medicine!

373
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,670
[Eternal Bliss]

374
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,180
Why?

375
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,870
Why?

376
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,270
Why did you betray me?

377
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,870
Why?

378
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,330
Qiguang.

379
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,030
Jiang Kui.

380
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,480
Are you there?

381
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,920
Qiguang is here.

382
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,270
I will always be here.

383
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,290
I will never

384
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,340
betray you, Master.

385
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,960
It's about time.

386
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,490
Qiguang,

387
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,510
Master is awake.

388
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,250
Master.

389
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,560
Master.

390
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,720
Master,

391
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,740
you're awake.

392
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,990
Mm.

393
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,360
Your hand is injured.

394
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,730
It's just a minor wound.

395
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,430
Here's the medicine
Physician Fang prepared for you.

396
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,060
What's wrong?

397
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,990
It's nothing.

398
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,350
Why did you stop drinking?

399
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,550
Don't like the taste?

400
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,790
It's hot.

401
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,820
Do you want to drink it?

402
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,000
Here.

403
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,310
Master,

404
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,910
this medicine...

405
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,270
Physician Fang's medicine
is always like that—

406
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,070
it's weird,

407
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,170
but it works.

408
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,410
Qiguang,

409
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
what happened

410
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,400
after I fainted that day?

411
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,430
When I arrived at Qingxin Cottage,

412
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,690
Jiang Kui was injured,

413
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,960
and you had already lost consciousness.

414
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,400
So I immediately brought you both
back to Prince Jing's Mansion.

415
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,310
Later on,

416
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,510
the Cicada Agency was falsely accused.

417
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,110
The Provincial Judicial Office
and Grand Commandant Mo

418
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,590
tried to take you away,

419
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,960
but I stopped them.

420
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,440
Qi is taking care of the Cicada Agency.

421
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,090
Everything is under control for now.

422
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,860
Did anything unusual happen?

423
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
Master,

424
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,410
what do you mean?

425
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,630
When you went to Qingxin Cottage,

426
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,880
did you see anything?

427
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,140
I didn't see anything out of the ordinary.

428
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,510
Are you sure?

429
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,070
Mm.

430
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,230
Master,

431
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,890
why is Grand Commandant Mo targeting you?

432
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,320
It's not a big deal.

433
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,160
Once the matter with the Cicada Agency
is resolved,

434
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,140
I will personally pay him a visit.

435
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,380
No matter what happens,

436
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,920
no matter who tries to harm you,

437
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,910
I will always be by your side.

438
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,720
Make sure to apply the medicine properly.

439
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,580
Don't let the wound get infected.

440
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,400
Alright.

441
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,160
There's one more thing.

442
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,550
The day I was attacked

443
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,270
was Jiang Kui's birthday.

444
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,740
It was also on her birthday
that she was forced

445
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,130
to part with her family.

446
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,920
She says she wants to
celebrate her birthday,

447
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
talks about the food she's craving,

448
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,810
but every year on that day,

449
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,440
her mood is fragile

450
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,640
like she's walking a tightrope,

451
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,440
afraid that one wrong step
might reopen an old wound.

452
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,470
Once I recover,

453
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,760
let's

454
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,870
celebrate her birthday together.

455
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,190
Oh, right,

456
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,470
she said she wants watermelon this year.

457
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,970
Okay.

458
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,880
How did Master manage to
drink that terrible stuff

459
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,070
with a straight face?

460
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,760
Qiguang, have some watermelon.

461
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,540
Physician Fang,

462
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,500
your cooking tastes much better
than your medicine.

463
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,200
Master,

464
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,630
have some watermelon.

465
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,840
Physician Fang.

466
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,400
I've prepared two portions.

467
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,600
Make sure she takes it every day.

468
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,400
It will help temper the overbearing nature
of the inner power in her body.

469
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,240
But,

470
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,900
she should refrain from
using her inner power anymore.

471
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,590
Once the medicine is finished,

472
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,520
continue with this prescription.

473
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,120
Apply it to the wound daily.

474
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,350
However,

475
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,230
whether your hand can recover

476
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,310
depends on fate.

477
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,000
Thank you, Physician Fang.

478
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,400
No need for formalities.

479
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,680
My work here is done.

480
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,180
It's time for me to return
to the mountains for cultivation.

481
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
Then...

482
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,800
There's no need to call her.

483
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,190
Parting is just a part of life.

484
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,680
There will be a time

485
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,750
for reunion.

486
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,400
She walks the world with a sword in hand,

487
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,260
and her heart is tied to everyone.

488
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,400
Though weighed down by worldly affairs,

489
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,970
[Eternal Bliss]

490
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,790
her spirit remains
as pure as a clear spring.

491
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,070
I seek clarity of mind,

492
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,070
but I dare not compare myself to her,

493
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,690
one who saves others,
even as she saves herself.

494
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,510
I'm leaving.

495
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,400
[Leaving without a word again.]

496
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,600
[Just like always.]

497
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,310
Master.

498
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,110
These are the candies Qiguang gave me.

499
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,070
They're so sweet.

500
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,030
Try some.

501
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,500
How did Qiguang know I like candies?

502
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,270
He's so nice.

503
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,850
But lately,

504
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,790
he's been taking care of you at night,

505
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,330
going to the military camp during the day,

506
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,810
and squeezing in martial arts practice
whenever he gets a break.

507
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,370
I feel he's working much harder than me.

508
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,480
He's really been working hard lately.

509
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,220
He's even more enthusiastic than before.

510
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,730
It's like he has something on his mind.

511
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:48,700
[Eternal Bliss]

512
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,380
Mo Qingchuan.

513
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,310
[It seems]

514
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,910
[he already knows about it.]

515
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,390
[Eternal Bliss]

516
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,510
Master,

517
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,490
wouldn't returning
to the Cicada Agency right now

518
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,710
be too dangerous?

519
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,990
It's time to go back.

520
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,310
Avoiding it will only embolden
our opponents.

521
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,130
This sleeve arrow is small and exquisite.

522
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,340
It can penetrate armor within ten yards.

523
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,970
You can use it for self-defense.

524
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,250
Physician Fang said,

525
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
that unless absolutely necessary,

526
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,700
you shouldn't use
your inner power anymore.

527
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,920
I've become a thorn in someone's side,

528
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,730
yet you've kept me hidden in your mansion.

529
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,590
I'm afraid you've become
an eyesore to them as well.

530
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,560
What are you smiling about?

531
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,810
Yeah.

532
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,030
What are you smiling about?

533
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,760
Don't you know it's dangerous?

534
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,550
I know.

535
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
I just feel that

536
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,830
I can finally

537
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,510
fight alongside Master.

538
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,060
-Master, wait for me.
-Master.

539
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,830
Be careful.

540
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,710
Don't worry, Master.

541
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
Don't worry, Qiguang.

542
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,350
I'm here too.

543
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,650
Greetings, Ms. Mo.

544
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,170
I've long heard of
your reputation, Ms. Mo.

545
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,690
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.

546
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,310
The Mo family is having a private dinner.

547
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,750
We've prepared the old madam's

548
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,830
favorite—Freshwater Braised Fish.

549
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,070
I wonder if you, Ms. Mo,

550
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,420
would honor us with your presence.

551
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,140
I will definitely be there.
