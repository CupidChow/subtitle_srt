1
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,870
[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,600
When the new sovereign

3
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,260
writes the history books,

4
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,150
how will they describe Your Majesty?

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,790
I suppose

6
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,420
it will be just like they did
with Yin Changyan.

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,820
No matter your achievements,

8
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,740
all that will remain are six words—

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,700
"the emperor who killed his mother."

10
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,039
Mo Qingchuan.

11
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,520
Hand over the tiger tally.

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,040
What if I don't give it to you?

13
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,870
kill you.

15
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,660
Mo Qingchuan, have you gone mad?

16
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,740
I just issued a decree

17
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,700
to clear your name and restore your honor.

18
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,500
And this is how you repay me?

19
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,320
A decree?

20
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,160
Is this

21
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,590
what you meant?

22
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,960
-Master!
-Don't come over!

23
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,560
Cao, listen carefully.

24
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,460
It is not that you forgive me my crimes,

25
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,710
but that I condemn you for yours.

26
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,700
First crime:

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,200
seizing power

28
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,920
and appointing only your kin.

29
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,079
Second crime:

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,890
framing the innocent

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,500
and persecuting the loyal.

32
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,420
Third crime:

33
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,070
indulgence in luxury and lust,

34
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,530
treating the lives of the
people as nothing.

35
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,100
Empress Dowager Cao,

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,280
your crimes are beyond pardon.

37
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,900
You think

38
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,160
you can kill me

39
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,250
and just walk away?

40
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,579
Master!

41
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,579
Prince Jing,

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,060
from this moment, our bond
as master and disciple is severed,

43
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,740
just like this.

44
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,290
Master.

45
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,940
I...

46
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,780
General Qingchuan, she

47
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,650
is taking the blame.

48
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,510
This is a capital offense!

49
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,600
Are you not afraid of being
seen as an accomplice?

50
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,260
I, Prince Jing, Xia Qiguang,

51
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,120
have long

52
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,490
harbored resentment

53
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,690
toward the Cao clan's dominance.

54
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,560
At the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet,
I attempted to assassinate her.

55
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,950
My crime is unforgivable.

56
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,750
I beseech Your Majesty to pass judgment.

57
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,720
You want to take the blame for her?

58
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,909
Xia Qiguang.

59
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,110
Whether others see you

60
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,560
as a general or a traitor,

61
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,330
whether your blade turns on
kings or tyrants,

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,720
no matter

63
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,310
where your path leads—

64
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,510
to me,

65
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,660
you'll always be Master Mo Wang of Qingxin Cottage.

66
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,150
Don't forget your hatred.

67
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,370
I

68
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,060
don't believe it.

69
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,870
Master,

70
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,530
the name Mo Wang,

71
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,400
means "Don't
forget Qingchuan", doesn't it?

72
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,270
Prince Jing,

73
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,930
this matter is the one thing

74
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,310
I cannot yield to you.

75
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,300
The traitor Mo Qingchuan

76
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,320
held the Empress Dowager at knifepoint,

77
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,940
attempted treason,

78
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,810
and has been thrown into the death prison.

79
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,610
Your Majesty,

80
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,570
The Empress Dowager is gravely injured.

82
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,300
I have no choice but to
assume this heavy burden.

83
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,500
I fully understand the weight of power.

84
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,820
I only hope for

85
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,500
stability in the court

86
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,020
and peace and prosperity

87
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,909
for the people.

88
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,010
His Majesty has arrived!

89
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,120
General Mo,

90
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,900
the Empress Dowager was gravely injured

91
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,600
and is still in critical condition.

92
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,460
Have you come to hold me
accountable, Your Majesty?

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,430
With the Empress Dowager around,

94
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,290
I will never have a chance to rise.

95
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,670
Thank you, General, for
risking yourself to set the trap

96
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,350
and restore clarity to Xia.

97
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,420
[The capital is shrouded in darkness.]

98
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:55,960
Your Majesty,

99
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,470
[To Mo Wang]

100
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,520
[To Mo Wang]

101
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,160
Internally, the Empress Dowager
monopolized power;

102
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
externally, Chu sought to seize it.

103
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,370
It was Prince Jing who paved
the way for me step by step.

104
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,130
But now

105
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,400
all efforts have come to naught.

106
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,240
It's too slow.

107
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,670
What?

108
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,980
Step-by-step

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,760
won't cut it.

110
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,030
Your Majesty's struggle against
the Empress Dowager

111
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,920
is a battle fought against

112
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,030
overwhelming odds.

113
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,429
A battle against overwhelming odds?

114
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,340
It's just like

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,169
the Battle of Chuanhe.

116
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,799
Do you remember

117
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,130
how the tide was turned back then?

118
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,840
No one in Xia has forgotten.

119
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,440
It was you, General, who rode
alone into ten thousand troops

120
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,500
and took the enemy commander's head.

121
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,900
Are you suggesting...

122
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,470
No, it's not possible.

123
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,790
Duke Zhuang's filial devotion
to his mother

124
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,140
is celebrated throughout history.

125
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,480
If I were to kill my own mother,

126
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,600
not to mention how the
history books would write about me,

127
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,930
would the pure-hearted still support me?

128
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,240
I will complete the unfinished mission

129
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,370
left by Prince Jing.

130
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,910
No matter what slander falls upon me,

131
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,850
I will bear it alone.

132
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,600
I promise,

133
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,240
when the Xia enters a time of peace,

134
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,750
I will restore your rightful title.

135
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,540
Your Majesty, we both know that

136
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,820
I, Mo Qingchuan, must be a traitor.

137
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,530
I must deceive the world.

138
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,510
So why make empty promises?

139
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,190
General Mo's sincere loyalty

140
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,560
is unseen by men

141
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
but recognized by Heaven and Earth.

142
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,930
The Empress Dowager has fallen.

143
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,510
It's Feng Shiye's turn now.

144
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,720
Prince Jing's last letter mentioned that

145
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,130
[To Mo Wang]

146
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,410
Feng Shiye was secretly
made the crown prince.

147
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,410
Surely, because he knew this,

148
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,010
he was silenced.

149
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,600
It is still unknown

150
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,880
how Feng Shiye,

151
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,250
an illegitimate son,

152
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,740
came to hold his position.

153
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,650
Peace talks.

154
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,750
What?

155
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,010
A few days ago,

156
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,250
Golden Cicada came to report.

157
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,330
Young General,

158
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,750
the troop deployments of the Chu

159
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,980
have been fully investigated.

160
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,200
Recently, Feng Shiye's forces

161
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,360
have been training rigorously,

162
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,960
with banners flying day and
night without pause.

163
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,320
Moreover, the supply wagons' tracks

164
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,200
have disappeared near the
western foothills of Helian,

165
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,960
raising suspicion of

166
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
some alliance or secret coalition.

167
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,750
The successful peace negotiation

168
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,390
is a key step in Feng Shiye
being appointed crown prince.

169
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,550
But

170
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,580
why?

171
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,370
Chu forces are gathering at
Helian Mountain.

172
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,790
All the silver tribute from our Xia

173
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,670
will be entirely used

174
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,130
as the first wave of military
funds for his Chu's attack on Xia.

175
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,630
General,

176
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,210
you already have a way to stop him,

177
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,140
don't you?

178
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,870
I will enter Qingchuan Town

179
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,640
under the pretense of a marriage alliance.

180
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,670
After that,

181
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,690
I will clear the path for the Xia army

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,250
and open the city gates.

183
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,240
But only ten people will be
allowed to accompany you in marriage.

184
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,440
That's enough.

185
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,080
Have you thought it through?

186
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,240
Once you go,

187
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,120
it will be difficult to return.

188
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,760
I am a member of the Mo family.

189
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,800
The place where my father
and brothers died

190
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,860
is where I must go.

191
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,010
Feng Shiye is the future King Chu.

192
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,060
Killing him

193
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,200
will secure peace for Xia for ten years.

194
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,480
It's worth it.

195
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,530
The Mo family has always been a line

196
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,420
of loyal ministers and brave generals.

197
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,550
Your Majesty,

198
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,670
to me, "traitor"

199
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,140
is no insult,

200
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,740
and "loyal minister"

201
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,280
is no praise,

202
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,540
because my loyalty

203
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,960
is not to you.

204
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,110
I am loyal

205
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,510
to this land,

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
to the millions of Xia people,

207
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,260
to that pot of green plum wine,

208
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,080
and to myself.

209
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,270
Good.

210
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,380
No matter what,

211
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,240
you are my benefactor

212
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,940
and the benefactor of Xia.

213
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,820
Do you have any wishes?

214
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,790
I have three wishes.

215
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,230
First, to rebuild the Mo Army.

216
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,510
Second,

217
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,410
to employ my cousin Mo Qinglian.

218
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,430
Though he has had a troubled fate,

219
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,830
he is a talented young man

220
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,300
who can be of great use.

221
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,200
Okay.

222
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,940
And the third?

223
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,550
Third, to protect the Cicada Agency.

224
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,910
The Cicada Agency's covert
lines spread throughout the land,

225
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,910
but they will serve as your support,

226
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,040
not a threat.

227
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,920
I promise.

228
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,070
Prince Jing is waiting for you outside.

229
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,280
He

230
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,160
has something to say to you.

231
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,360
Why did you keep the truth
about the assassination attempt

232
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,780
from Prince Jing?

233
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,670
Because

234
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,610
I didn't want him to get involved,

235
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,090
and I wasn't sure

236
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,340
if he would become an
unpredictable factor in the plan.

237
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,580
Once,

238
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,860
in this vast world,

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,150
I saw no path ahead

240
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,550
and no place to return to.

241
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,080
To many, Mo Qingchuan seems to

242
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,070
wear countless faces,

243
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,360
and even I have been lost,

244
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,190
unsure of who I really am.

245
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,870
Whether others see you

246
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,890
as a general or a traitor,

247
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,770
whether your blade turns on
kings or tyrants,

248
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,670
no matter

249
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,320
where your path leads—

250
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,080
to me,

251
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,610
you're always just Master Mo Wang
from Qingxin Cottage.

252
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,630
Yes,

253
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,790
Mo Wang.

254
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,730
Mo Qingchuan,

255
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,040
from beginning to end,

256
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,080
I am just Mo Qingchuan.

257
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,830
I thought I was leading him,

258
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,150
not realizing

259
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,320
it was he who was lighting the way for me.

260
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,700
But

261
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,150
in this world,

262
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,840
everyone has their own path.

263
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,530
Becoming a traitor

264
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,270
is my destined path.

265
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,200
I can only walk alone,

266
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,080
alone to fulfill

267
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,310
my fate.

268
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,720
I want to tell Master,

269
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,320
and Mo Qingchuan,

270
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,360
that if she ever betrays,

271
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,270
it will never be her fault.

272
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,600
My

273
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,050
heart's direction

274
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,850
will never turn back.

275
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,410
I once worried that

276
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,580
if I told him,

277
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,600
he might lose his way.

278
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,140
But he

279
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,680
stayed true to his path.

280
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,430
He did not disappoint me.

281
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,260
You're not alone.

282
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,530
I have promised him that

283
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,180
he will accompany you

284
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,090
as the Prince's envoy to Chu,

285
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,660
to stand by your side
through thick and thin.

286
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,270
Wherever you go,

287
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,150
I'll accompany you, Master.

288
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Master,

289
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,060
let's go home.

290
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,720
Your Majesty,

291
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,740
Feng Shiye requests an audience.

292
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,360
Let him in.

293
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,520
Let him in!

294
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,180
Your Majesty,

295
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,500
Mo Qingchuan's marriage
alliance is stipulated by treaty.

296
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,339
Now that she's imprisoned,

297
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,109
does that mean the treaty
between the two nations is null and void?

298
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,619
Peace talks between the two
nations are of utmost importance,

299
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,740
but Mo Qingchuan has
committed the grave crime of treason.

300
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,319
If she is pardoned or treated leniently,

301
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,900
it will be hard to satisfy the people.

302
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,480
If Mo Qingchuan doesn't marry,

303
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,880
it means Xia has breached
the treaty first.

304
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,440
Once the treaty is void,

305
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,190
which consequence is heavier—

306
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,180
please consider it carefully,
Your Majesty.

307
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,920
Xia will not break its word.

308
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,640
However,

309
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,650
as long as Mo Qingchuan
sets foot on Xia land,

310
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,120
she is a prisoner

311
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,470
and must be escorted away immediately.

312
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,080
You would have my bride

313
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,920
travel in prisoner's garb?

314
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
The Empress Dowager lies
gravely injured in bed.

315
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
If not for this,

316
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,960
I

317
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,790
cannot answer to my people.

318
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,770
Absurd!

319
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,980
She becomes your bride,

320
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,720
the princess of Chu,

321
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,880
only once she arrives in Qingchuan Town.

322
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,750
Feng Shiye,

323
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,190
let's take a step back.

324
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,270
Why let such a trivial matter

325
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,930
bring things to a standstill?

326
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,880
Delays breed danger.

327
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,770
Saving Qingchuan is urgent.

328
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,590
Alright,

329
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,820
let's both take a step back.

330
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,780
You finally came.

331
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,150
It's time to go.

332
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,790
Yes.

333
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,720
Mo Qinglian?

334
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,030
I've been ordered to

335
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,070
join the Vanguard Camp of the Mo Army.

336
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,640
When His Majesty mentioned Qingchuan Town,

337
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,160
I asked to join the envoy.

338
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,000
By the way,

339
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,130
where's Qingchuan?

340
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,570
She's saying goodbye to her mother.

341
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,820
You didn't dare

342
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,710
let me see your wounds before.

343
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,240
But a mother and daughter
are connected at heart.

344
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,190
Where you hurt,

345
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
I feel the pain too.

346
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,480
Now,

347
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
I truly can't see anymore.

348
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
This scar

349
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,340
is from the Battle of Chuanhe.

350
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,070
This one

351
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,640
is from the Battle of Helian Mountain.

352
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,770
And this is from the Battle of
Biluo River.

353
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,000
This is from the Campaign at
Longji Valley.

354
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,030
I can't count them all.

355
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,260
I can't count them anymore.

356
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,920
Mother,

357
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,840
it's all in the past.

358
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,880
It doesn't hurt anymore.

359
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,270
I often

360
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,720
dream of your three elder brothers.

361
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,750
In my dreams,

362
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,150
they're still so young.

363
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,110
Their little arms

364
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,350
are soft and pale,

365
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,520
like lotus roots.

366
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,620
But when I woke up,

367
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,790
I could only touch their memorial tablets.

368
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,700
When they died,

369
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,480
they were just teenagers.

370
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,160
Such beautiful children—

371
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,860
yet not even one of them
was left with an intact body.

372
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,240
Had I known it would come to this,

373
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,080
I should've learned to wield
a sword and a spear

374
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,160
when I was still a maiden.

375
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,920
All those years spent on embroidery

376
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,880
and poetry—

377
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,350
and in the end,

378
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,670
I couldn't even protect a single child.

379
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,040
Mother,

380
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,470
it's not like that.

381
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,760
You are the best mother in the world.

382
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,130
It's I who am unfilial.

383
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,230
I have to leave again.

384
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,850
The first time I saw you ride a horse,

385
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,320
I knew

386
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,310
my daughter

387
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,030
belongs not just to me,
but to Xia.

388
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,620
You are filial to

389
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,800
all the parents in the world.

390
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,750
But,

391
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,750
promise me,

392
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,240
even if there's only a sliver of hope,

393
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,340
come back

394
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,920
to see me,

395
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,620
will you?

396
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,650
Mother,

397
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,670
I promise you.
