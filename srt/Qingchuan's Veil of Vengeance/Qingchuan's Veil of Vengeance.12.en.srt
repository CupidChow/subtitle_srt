1
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,840
[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,910
Your Majesty,

3
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,620
Mo Qingchuan has betrayed our nation
by conspiring with the enemy,

4
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,960
which directly led to
the fall of Qingchuan.

5
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,420
After that, she fled to Chu
to evade justice.

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,350
Your Majesty,

7
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,600
every word I've said

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,640
is true.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,920
General Mo,

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,350
whether I believe you or not
is of no consequence.

11
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,200
What matters is

12
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,230
that you believe in yourself.

13
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:12,120
Do you know

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,280
why I chose you

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
over Mo Qingchuan?

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,200
I have always been loyal

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,740
to Your Majesty.

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,680
Since I was a child, I'd heard

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,620
that the river in Qingchuan Town
was crystal clear—

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,400
so clear the fish looked as if
they were floating in mid-air.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,310
Is that true?

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,350
Your Majesty,

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,430
it is indeed so.

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,950
That's what you say.

25
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,229
That's what everyone says.

26
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,840
But I don't believe it.

27
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,920
When I first met Mo Qingchuan,

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,800
I asked her the same question.

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,070
She hadn't even answered,

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,610
but I already believed it.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,660
When I looked into her eyes,

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,979
I saw the waters of Qingchuan.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
And in that moment,

34
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,110
I knew—

35
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,200
she

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,390
could no longer be allowed to live.

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,180
The waters of Qingchuan

38
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,050
will never reach the capital.

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,289
And you ought to be grateful

40
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,790
because you,

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,690
Mo Junyu,

42
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,030
come from the most disgraced branch

43
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,860
of the Mo family.

44
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,150
General Qingchuan,

45
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,990
you've weathered countless hardships
over the years.

46
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,260
Your merit to the nation
is unquestionable.

47
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,980
I shall grant you a fair judgment.

48
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,579
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

49
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,420
Why don't you tell me

50
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,770
what kind of justice you seek?

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,980
I ask for

52
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,460
Mo Junyu's

53
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,090
life.

54
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,140
What else?

55
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,810
To raise the Mo Army's banner once more.

56
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,300
Anything else?

57
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,420
That's all.

58
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,930
That's all you ask?

59
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,900
That's all

60
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,930
I want.

61
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,660
Your wishes are granted.

62
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,040
Mo Junyu's life

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,130
is yours now.

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,930
Thank you for your great kindness,
Your Majesty.

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,040
[Taiji Hall]

66
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,650
Chen Siqi fell to greed.

67
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,810
Zhou Zheng was blinded by sentiment.

68
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,210
Mo Junyu was consumed by ambition.

69
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,770
Together, they pushed you into the abyss.

70
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,810
But now, your name has been cleared.

71
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,540
And the sword has returned
to its rightful owner.

72
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,520
I, Xia Qiguang, heir to Prince Jing,

73
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,950
offer my respects to you,
General Qingchuan.

74
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,720
Master.

75
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,020
Do you remember

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,820
I asked you to complete two tasks

77
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,420
before taking your revenge?

78
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,580
Mm.

79
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,530
Follow me.

80
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,940
A pawn.

81
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,620
That's all I ever was.

82
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,850
I never thought

83
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,900
that after everything I did for her,

84
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,580
this would be how things turned out.

85
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,500
I was such a fool—blind to it all.

86
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,770
Who

87
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,620
is she?

88
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,970
The Suoque Sect

89
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,820
is steeped in filth and blood.

90
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,580
They live only to take lives.

91
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,950
All who oppose them meet their end.

92
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,380
And who is it that helps cover up

93
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,460
their crimes?

94
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,920
You know that better than anyone,
don't you?

95
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,440
Did she order you to kill Prince Jing?

96
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,500
No.

97
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,730
It was my decision.

98
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,700
Why?

99
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,390
Someone sent me a secret message,

100
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,020
[Prince Jing suspects that Mo Qinglian
is still alive. He's looking into it.]

101
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,900
saying that Prince Jing

102
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,170
had found out Qinglian's whereabouts.

103
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,820
[I see.]

104
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,620
[It was him.]

105
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,700
You don't even know
who sent that secret message.

106
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,260
What if you're just a pawn

107
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,790
being used to kill someone?

108
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,960
I can't take that risk.

109
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,040
Better to kill by mistake.

110
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,580
I've told you everything

111
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,820
you wanted to know.

112
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,290
Just make it quick.

113
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,650
Mo Junyu.

114
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,020
By the grace of the Bodhisattva above,

115
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,250
if you truly repent
for all your sins today,

116
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,090
I might spare your life.

117
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,580
Really?

118
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,900
Three,

119
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,510
two...

120
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,890
I repent.

121
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,810
I, Mo Junyu, confess to colluding with
the enemy and betraying my country.

122
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,020
I falsely accused my niece, Mo Qingchuan,

123
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,280
and caused the deaths of
thousands of patriotic soldiers.

124
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,960
What else?

125
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,140
And...

126
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,820
That's all.

127
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,650
My eye!

128
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,020
And

129
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,180
you killed my father—

130
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,409
your own elder brother, Mo Junshan.

131
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,120
Father loved you all his life.

132
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,820
He gave in to your every whim.

133
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,260
Even though you were mediocre,

134
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,860
he still taught you
with care and devotion.

135
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,060
But never—not even in his worst dreams—

136
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,330
did he imagine that his own brother

137
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,900
would one day raise a blade against him,

138
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,460
and send him to the underworld.

139
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,280
Mo Qingchuan.

140
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,750
You said you'd let me go.

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,930
If you want to live,

142
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,800
then run.

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,550
Mo Qingchuan,

144
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,770
you've gone back on your word.

145
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,050
It's me.

146
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,820
Xia Qiguang?

147
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,170
The jade pendant.

148
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,340
The jade pendant.

149
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,730
My jade pendant!

150
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,120
My jade pendant.

151
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,890
My jade pendant.

152
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,620
Such a pure white jade pendant—

153
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,570
you're not worthy of it.

154
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,340
I'm not worthy?

155
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,620
Mo Qingchuan,

156
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,220
listen to me!

157
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,440
I have no regrets.

158
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,770
I, Mo Junyu,

159
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,710
gave everything to the Mo Army too.

160
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,690
But why is it that everyone...

161
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,380
everyone only ever acknowledges you?

162
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,860
You've never seen

163
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,340
the way people looked at me

164
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,020
when I held the line at Liya Town.

165
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,170
For that one day of glory,

166
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,290
I'd kill your father a thousand times,

167
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,820
or ten thousand times over.

168
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,170
Shut up.

169
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,230
I won't kill you.

170
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,020
But someone else will.

171
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,500
Killing you

172
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,180
would only dirty her hands.

173
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,460
Your remorse means nothing.

174
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,340
What's the use of regret?

175
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,340
What's done is done.

176
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,190
When a person dies, their light goes out.

177
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,290
So don't rest in peace.

178
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,270
Don't move on to the afterlife.

179
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,570
Uncle.

180
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,900
Master.

181
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,740
It's over now.

182
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,330
Master,

183
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,260
he's dead.

184
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,530
From now on,

185
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,570
he is no longer your nightmare.

186
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,380
By the Empress Dowager's decree:

187
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,500
I hold compassion for Mo Qingchuan,

188
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,770
who has suffered injustice
at the hands of vile men.

189
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,380
Her past transgressions

190
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,900
are hereby pardoned.

and is hereby
promoted to Grand Commandant.

He shall continue
to lead the Black Armored Army.

208

and falsely accused meritorious officials,

so he cannot escape punishment.

and past contributions,

five years of imprisonment.

He is hereby
sentenced to death by beheading.

In recognition of Cao Yuyan
and Mo Qinglian's meritorious reporting,

both are granted special pardons

229
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,700

I'll make it up to you.

234
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,900
Why isn't this my usual bone china bowl?

235
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
Grand Commandant Cao
sent someone yesterday,

236
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,860
saying that the bone china bowls
needed for the banquet

237
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,860
were short a few.

238
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,650
So they took the ones from your palace.

239
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,860
He hasn't been Grand Commandant for long,

240
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,720
yet he's already reaching his hands
into my palace.

241
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,570
Never mind.

242
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,260
Take it away.

243
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,340
Yes.

245
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,530
and the Marquis of Wu'an
request an audience.

246
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,870
Let them in.

247
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,220
General Mo,

248
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,340
are you here
about the reconstruction of the Mo Army?

249
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,340
Indeed, I am.

250
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,740
General Mo, you've just returned to court.

251
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,900
You should take some time
to rest and recover.

252
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,380
As for the reorganization of the Mo Army,

253
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,650
I have already discussed it
with His Majesty.

254
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,710
We plan to first establish
the Mo Army's Vanguard Camp,

255
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,060
which will be incorporated
into the Black Armored Army.

256
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,220
General Qingchuan,

257
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,280
please guide us with your expertise.

258
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,420
That said,

259
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,860
since General Mo
has only just returned to Xia,

260
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,070
perhaps it is best to
begin with a civil post,

261
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,020
in order to reacquaint yourself
with military affairs.

262
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,220
You shall serve as

263
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,750
a Military Staff Officer.

264
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,740

will follow Your Majesty's arrangements

267
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,930
without any objection.

268
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,450
As for the position
of Vanguard Camp's General,

269
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,620
I intend to appoint Prince Jing.

270
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,780
Your Majesty,

271
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,570
General Qingchuan has a great reputation.

272
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,380
If I were to be placed above her,

273
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,500
I fear it would be inappropriate.

274
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,050
You have inherited
the title of Prince Jing.

275
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,170
The role of Vanguard General

276
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,860
is well within your ability.

are enlisting to serve the nation.

with training these troops,

00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,650
we must go to war.

376
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,300
I, Cao Huaitai,

377
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,250
stand in favor of peace.

378
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,450
I

379
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,060
stand for peace.

380
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,790
I stand for peace.

381
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,830
I stand for peace.

382
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,780
-I stand for peace.
-I stand for war.

383
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,930
-I stand for peace.
-I stand for war.

384
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,900
I

385
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,340
stand for peace.

386
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,250
What,

387
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,650
does Prince Jing

388
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,930
also stand for war?

389
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,620
My stance matters little.

390
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,540
If Your Majesty has resolved to go to war,

391
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,470
then I shall take up arms and fight.

392
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,550
I have discussed it with His Majesty.

393
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,730
If peace with Chu can be secured,

394
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,210
and war avoided,

395
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,170
it would be a blessing for the people.

396
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,550
I shall obey Your Majesty's will.

397
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,300
I shall

398
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,800
obey Your Majesty's will.

399
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,010
Marquis of Wu'an,

400
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,060
what is your view on this?

401
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,300
I would like to ask you all—

402
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,040
who among you has ever set foot
in Qingchuan,

403
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,580
or tasted the waters of the Biluo River?

404
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,960
Of all here, I know Qingchuan Town

405
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,580
best.

406
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,640
Back then, its waters

407
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,290
ran clear and swift,

408
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,600
a place of true beauty.

409
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,190
Helian Mountain stood in quiet majesty,

410
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,850
and the townsfolk lived in
laughter and peace.

411
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,170
Everything was in harmony,

412
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,700
and all things flourished.

413
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,670
But a year ago,

414
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,840
when I returned from Qingchuan Town,

415
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,860
I found countless bodies of its people

416
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,250
buried beneath the Helian Mountain
iron mine.

417
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,060
In Qingchuan Town,

418
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,790
every household was enslaved
for iron smelting.

419
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,360
Qingchuan Town

420
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,100
has turned into a living hell.

421
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,340
I heard

422
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,780
that the people of Qingchuan

423
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,380
are risking their lives
to flee to Liya Town.

424
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,780
They would rather die
under the hooves of Chu horses

425
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,970
than not return to Xia.

426
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,060
Yet at the same time,

427
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,340
we who hold high positions

428
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,300
turn a deaf ear to their cries for help.

429
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,930
We cling to a hollow peace,

430
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,380
resting easy, unmoved in our sleep.

431
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,340
The people of Qingchuan Town
endure a great calamity;

432
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,580
it pains me deeply.

433
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,340
The Marquis of Wu'an's concern
for the people is admirable,

434
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,580
and I am heartened by it.

435
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,860
However,

436
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,170
this is not yet
a moment of certain victory.

437
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,780
We must not speak of war so lightly.

438
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,210
If the people of Qingchuan Town knew

439
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,970
that their sacrifice

440
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,820
could buy Xia five years of peace,

441
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,340
would that not, in itself,

442
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,540
be a form of honor?

443
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
[By the Empress Dowager's decree:]

444
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,960
[I hold compassion for Mo Qingchuan,]

445
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,170
[who has suffered injustice
at the hands of vile men.]

446
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,780
[Her past transgressions]

447
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,540
[are hereby pardoned.]

448
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,150
[Her title, Marquis of Wu'an,
is reinstated]

449
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,580
[to restore her honor.]

450
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,780
[May Mo Qingchuan
accept this grace with gratitude,]

451
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,650
[uphold the interests of the nation
above all else,]

452
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,060
[and set aside all past grievances.]

453
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,970
Master.

454
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,340
Qi Yun has come to report.

455
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,740
Feng Shiye's delegation

456
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,120
will reach the capital in three days.

457
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,490
Got it.

458
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,780
Master.

459
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,540
Don't follow me.
