1
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,900
[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,750
We've taken the rugged
mountain paths into account,

3
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,750
so why did we still suffer defeat here?

4
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,610
Where exactly was the oversight?

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,150
Cousin, you just took command,

6
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,570
and already lost Helian Mountain.

7
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,760
Even your son was captured as a prisoner.

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,610
The arrogant Chu forces

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,850
dare to demand

10
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,710
we trade an entire city for a man

11
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,670
and mock the Mo family's
inability to lead troops.

12
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,650
What a

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,270
total disgrace!

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,260
This battle

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,810
was my command failure,

16
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,830
but there's no need to be so hostile.

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,660
Hmph!

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,539
The stalemate has dragged on for too long.

19
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:18,850
Though we lost Helian Mountain,

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,980
the Chu forces took heavy casualties.

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,640
News of Junshan's death half a month ago

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,160
is likely out by now.

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,660
Our army's morale is shaky.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,330
If Feng Shiye seizes this
chance to attack,

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,530
Qingchuan Town is in grave danger.

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,940
If Qingchuan Town falls,

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,200
how will we bear the responsibility

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,600
for the tens of thousands of
people in Liya Town?

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,050
It's just one defeat.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,259
Why be so alarmed?

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,150
We'll just fight back.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,410
What worries me is that

33
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,100
tactical errors

34
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,340
could collapse the entire army.

35
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,240
Right now,

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,660
I want to hear

37
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,460
Qingchuan's opinion.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,070
Though our army was defeated,

39
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,000
the Chu forces are not unbeatable.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,410
I see two points:

41
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,770
First,

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,810
the Chu forces just crossed
Helian Mountain;

43
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,560
their troops are exhausted

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,950
and urgently need to regroup.

45
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,630
Second,

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,780
they have yet to fully grasp
the strength of the Xia;

47
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,640
reinforcements could arrive at any moment.

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,329
Therefore,

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,660
despite besieging the city,

50
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,960
Feng Shiye won't launch a rash attack.

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,950
The Helian Mountains are
treacherous and difficult to cross,

52
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,270
and the supply of provisions

53
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,800
has always been a headache
for the Chu forces.

54
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,880
You mean

55
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,280
to cut off their supplies?

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,000
No.

57
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,870
Feng Shiye

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,829
won't make the same mistake again.

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,840
This time,

60
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,900
he will surely station heavy forces
to guard the supplies.

61
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,970
Taking advantage of this opportunity,

62
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,470
you will launch a feigned frontal attack

63
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,740
to distract them.

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,900
I'll lead elite troops to flank
through the Helian Mountains

65
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,829
and strike the main camp directly.

66
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,060
When they rush back to defend,

67
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,990
you'll lead troops to attack.

68
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,260
We'll surely defeat the Chu forces.

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,530
A surprise attack from behind

70
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,610
is indeed risky,

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,700
but if successful,

72
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,690
it will force Feng Shiye to retreat.

73
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,520
After all,

74
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,300
the one stationed at the main camp

75
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,100
is Feng Shiye's dashing father,

76
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,920
King Chu.

77
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,540
Exactly.

78
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,250
What do you mean by "exactly?"

79
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,140
Qingchuan,

80
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,540
do you know that

81
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,860
if the Chu forces detect your march,

82
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,120
you will face a hundred
thousand troops of Chu?

83
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,630
You...

84
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,070
I won't make it back.

85
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,460
Uncle Huaizhang,

86
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,420
I understand.

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,920
I have inherited my father's mission

88
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,270
and lead the Vanguard Camp of the Mo Army.

89
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,750
Bearing the title of vanguard

90
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,350
means leading the troops from the front.

91
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,520
What is there to fear in death?

92
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,590
I agree with the
Vanguard General's strategy.

93
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,420
I agree.

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,490
I agree.
I agree.

95
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,550
I agree.
I agree.

96
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,390
I agree.

97
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,320
I wonder what the Commander-in-chief

98
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,740
thinks of this plan.

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,500
The Vanguard General is
ready to face death.

100
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,640
I

101
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,630
have no objections.

102
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,420
I

103
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,090
accept the order.

104
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,820
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.

105
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,270
I wish Your Majesty peace, good health,

106
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,600
and lasting blessings.

107
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,430
With Yan by my side,

108
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,040
I am naturally at ease.

109
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,800
Why hasn't Junyu come?

110
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,380
Ms. Mo has arrived.

111
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,240
He has caught a cold recently.

112
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,060
He truly couldn't avoid
missing the occasion

113
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,520
and is asking for your understanding, Aunt.

114
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,900
No matter.

115
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,170
Let him rest well and recover.

116
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,180
Ms. Mo is indeed punctual.

117
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,790
You may go now.

118
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,460
On this Dragon Boat Festival,

119
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,900
I've come to take Mother home.

120
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,990
Qingchuan.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,390
you're back.

122
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,950
Mother,

123
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,620
I'm back.

124
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,740
Mother.

125
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,450
Mother.

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,530
It's Qingchuan.

127
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,630
It's Qingchuan.

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,670
Mother.

129
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,200
My child,

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,660
you must have suffered so much

131
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,940
all these years.

132
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm fine.

133
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,270
I'll take you away.

134
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,140
Okay?

135
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,430
Okay.

136
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,150
Okay.

137
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,190
Qingchuan,

138
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,220
it's been a long time since
you've been home.

139
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,500
You see your uncle—

140
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,130
the current head of the Mo family—

141
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,280
and won't even offer a greeting?

142
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,890
Do you deserve one?

143
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,170
You fled alone,

144
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,510
and in one night the Mo family's
legacy was destroyed.

145
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,580
The Mo Army scattered like
rats from a sinking ship,

146
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,240
and everyone spat on our name.

147
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,410
I

148
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,240
sacrificed my only son

149
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,090
to redeem your failure

150
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,980
and win back the emperor's favor.

151
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,360
Otherwise, even your mother's

152
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,460
and father's memorial tablets

153
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,299
wouldn't have a roof to shelter under.

154
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,500
Forget it.

155
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,630
As your uncle,

156
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,120
I never expected gratitude
from the younger generation.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,710
But now that you're back,

158
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,430
all the shame we just managed to wash away

159
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,510
will come flooding back.

160
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,330
You're

161
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,870
truly lacking in sense.

162
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,300
You're like a monkey in a crown—

163
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,430
pretending to be a man.

164
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,270
I could've turned a blind eye
that to the fact

165
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,870
you sneaked back into the capital.

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,850
But you must give me your word—

167
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,150
never return again.

168
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,670
Otherwise,

169
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,040
your parents will live out the
rest of their days

170
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,900
under watch in Grand Commandant's Mansion.

171
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,280
Mother,

172
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,340
don't listen to nonsense.

173
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,360
Let's go.

174
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,490
Guards!

175
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,390
Don't be afraid.

176
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,510
Mo Qingchuan,

177
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,790
have you forgotten who you are?

178
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,480
You are a traitor to the Xia.

179
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,000
Traitor?

180
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,350
Are you talking about yourself?

181
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,760
This Grand Commandant's Mansion,

182
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,910
built on the bones of the
Mo Army and the flesh

183
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,630
and blood of the people of
Qingchuan Town, is quite imposing.

184
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,030
May I ask if you

185
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,260
can sleep peacefully here every night?

186
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,590
I don't understand what you're saying.

187
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,520
If you surrender your arms,

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,780
I might consider pleading for mercy

189
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,130
on your behalf with the Empress Dowager.

190
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,420
You still dare to let me see
the Empress Dowager?

191
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,120
Mo Junyu,

192
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,710
you're just trying to use my
mother as a pawn

193
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,080
to force me out of the capital.

194
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
But my mother is not a pawn,

195
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,850
and you wouldn't dare harm her.

196
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,910
If you try to stop me again,

197
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,310
I will kill you right now.

198
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,800
She is Mo Qingchuan.

199
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,430
Mo Qingchuan,

200
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,900
please spare me.

201
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,920
I offer secrets in exchange.

202
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,890
General Mo Junshan's old
illness suddenly worsened

203
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,240
and became incurable.

204
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,700
It was Mo Junyu

205
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,010
who tampered with the prescription.

206
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,180
Mo Junyu killed General Mo Junshan.

207
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,460
I have the prescription as proof.

208
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,650
I really want to

209
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,670
kill you right now!

210
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,120
Mother,

211
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,410
let's go.

212
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,070
Qingchuan,

213
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,290
can we just

214
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,000
let the past be?

215
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,820
No need to

216
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,270
ask.

217
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,070
Your Majesty,

218
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,790
the birthday tributes from
various provinces and counties

219
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,450
have been stolen by villains.

220
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,720
What?

221
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,030
In the capital itself,

222
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,340
someone dares to act so recklessly

223
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,500
and steal the tributes offered to me?

224
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,750
Preposterous!

225
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,390
Your Highness, calm down.
Calm down, Your Highness.

226
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,160
Master Chen!

227
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,990
Master Chen!

228
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,020
Master Chen!

229
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,950
something terrible has happened!

230
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,170
What kind of place is the
Grand Commandant's Mansion

231
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,520
that it allows such disgrace?

232
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,970
I deserve death.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,400
Master Chen, have mercy!

234
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,510
What is causing such alarm?

235
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,100
The Empress Dowager has ordered

236
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,280
a full-scale extermination of

237
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,340
the Yunwu Village.

238
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,000
What did you say?

239
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,440
Yunwu Village robbed
the Empress Dowager's birthday tributes.

240
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,910
The Empress Dowager is furious

241
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,580
and demands the tributes be recovered

242
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,830
within ten days,

243
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,150
along with the head of the
Yunwu Village's leader.

244
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,270
How could they

245
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,850
possibly do such a thing?

246
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,480
Indeed.

247
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,700
This matter is too suspicious.

248
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,310
It's her.

249
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,430
Don't worry, Ms. Mo.

250
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,170
I will escort the old madam
to a safe place.

251
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,080
Mother.

252
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,240
You must live.

253
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,120
Promise me.

254
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,350
What?

255
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,520
General Cao,

256
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,550
you actually don't know

257
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,200
whom to send to suppress a
mere Yunwu Village?

258
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,390
Raising soldiers for a thousand days,

259
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,360
and yet there's no one capable?

260
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,310
It's said that the terrain of
Yunwu Village is rugged

261
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,590
and hard to conquer.

262
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,410
If it's not done within ten days...

263
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,470
And I need to bring the leader's head.

264
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,420
Who should be sent then?

265
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,590
Who did the Empress Dowager
finally assign to crush the bandits?

266
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,630
It's...

267
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,700
Xia Qiguang.

268
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,640
How could it be him?

269
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,670
If permitted,

270
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,750
I, Xia Qiguang of the Black Armored Army,

271
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,680
am willing to accept this mission.

272
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,990
I really want to

273
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,370
kill you right now!

274
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,650
But you can't die yet.

275
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,690
I will strip your human skin

276
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,070
before the whole world

277
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,720
and reveal the beast beneath.

278
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,550
Granted.

279
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

280
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,910
Congratulations,

281
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,170
Deputy Commander Xia,

282
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,720
you've been promoted two ranks

283
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
and given command of troops.

284
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,900
Thank you, General Cao.

285
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,270
I'd like to see

286
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,670
how long you can hold that deputy post.

287
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,240
Military affairs are pressing.

288
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,270
Ten men.

289
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,830
I can only give you ten men
for the bandit campaign.

290
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,090
Ten men?

291
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,550
General Cao,

292
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,000
are you sending me to die?

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,240
No, no, no.

294
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,220
I simply believe your

295
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,670
martial prowess is unmatched,

296
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,030
enough to fight a hundred alone.

297
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,690
Just a mere Yunwu Yunwu Village—

298
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,619
no need to mobilize the whole army.

299
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,430
Once you die there

300
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,240
and ease the Empress Dowager's wrath,

301
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,990
I'll reap the rewards.

302
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,839
Wouldn't that be splendid?

303
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,640
Or perhaps you want to back out

304
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,440
and report to the Empress Dowager

305
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,099
that you're not up to the task.

306
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,410
Deputy Commander Xia,

307
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,480
are you going or not?

308
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,220
I accept.

309
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,130
But may I

310
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,370
choose the ten men myself?

311
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,050
As you wish.

312
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,450
Keep up.

313
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,030
The Yunwu Village is just ahead.

314
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,360
Let's rest here for now.

315
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,060
And by the way,

316
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,880
we'll wait for someone.

317
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,590
Alright.

318
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,460
Let's rest.

319
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,060
Xia Qiguang,

320
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,510
why did you bring me along?

321
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,930
Naturally, because your
martial skills are impressive—

322
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,930
truly admirable.

323
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,530
Who's there?

324
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,920
Greetings, Ms. Mo.

325
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,650
Please rise.

326
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,160
So the people you summoned

327
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,220
are actually them.

328
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,090
The first thing Young Lord
did upon arriving at camp

329
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,760
was to rescue each of us.

330
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,720
All of us are deeply grateful.

331
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,860
Whether I'm here or not,

332
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
you must all remember this debt.

333
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,260
Protect him

334
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,740
and follow his orders.

335
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,720
Yes.

336
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,770
For this mission,

337
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,100
I will serve as strategist.

338
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,000
Our top priority

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,480
is to rescue someone.

340
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,410
But aren't we supposed to
take the head of the chief of
the Yunwu Village

341
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,470
and retrieve the
Empress Dowager's birthday tribute?

342
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,280
The Empress Dowager's tribute

343
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,420
has already been hidden by me.

344
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,710
Sir,

345
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,110
we've already tightened
security in secret—

346
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,200
no movement on the mountain.

347
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,190
Yes.

348
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,600
It's such an injustice.

349
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,370
Sir,

350
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,440
even with ten lives,

351
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,790
we'd never dare touch the
Empress Dowager's tribute.

352
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,240
This is clearly a setup.

353
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,190
We lost agents at Suoque Sect,

354
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,330
even the elite from
Darknight Pavilion were wiped out.

355
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,050
No matter what,

356
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,240
we must protect Yunwu Village.

357
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,020
This is the map of Yunwu Mountain
provided by Military Affairs.

[Map of Yunwu Mountain]

359
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,560
The village is notorious

360
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,040
and has survived repeated
attempts to destroy it.

361
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,940
It seems hidden in the mist,

362
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,480
leaving no trace to follow.

363
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,440
Yunwu Village

364
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,310
lies between two peaks,

[Map of Yunwu Mountain]

366
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,800
roughly here.

367
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,190
The map is inaccurate.

368
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,960
The Yunwu Mountains
appear to have only one main path.

369
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,190
Both sides are bare rocky cliffs,

370
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,830
with dense forest at the summit.

371
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,700
It's easy to defend but
difficult to attack.

372
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,460
Yesterday,

373
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,440
ten Silver Cicadas infiltrated
Yunwu Mountain

374
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,790
from four directions to

375
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,230
gather intelligence on enemy defenses.

376
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,440
They discovered three hidden paths.

is here,

379
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,120
not at the low-lying spot

380
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,140
[Map of Yunwu Mountain]

381
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,490
marked on the map.

382
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,610
If we attack based on that map,

383
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,180
and archers are lying in ambush above us,

384
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,840
our forces will be annihilated.

385
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,550
Those bastards

386
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,630
clearly sent us to die.

387
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,790
They know we only have ten men,

388
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,920
so they've evenly stationed troops

389
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,180
along all four routes—

390
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,460
tightly guarded,

391
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,610
not a single gap.

392
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,960
I don't quite get it,

393
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,040
Ms. Mo,

394
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,780
the military report said there
are only 200 to 300 bandits
in the village.

395
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,150
Divided into four paths,

396
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,790
that's about 50 to 60 per route.

397
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,410
But we have 24 people—

398
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,590
can't we just take them down
one group at a time?

399
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,420
Indeed.

400
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,630
Everyone is to stay on high
alert for the next few days—

401
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,380
no returning to the barracks.

402
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,480
But, Sir,

403
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,160
there are only a dozen of them.

404
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,070
We have 2,000 elite soldiers.

405
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,230
Isn't that a bit...

406
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,360
Yes.

407
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,440
This whole thing feels off.

408
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,350
There's no tribute for the
Empress Dowager on that mountain.

409
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,800
Could it be that

410
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,010
she knows Qinglian is hidden here?

411
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
He's

412
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,110
stationed 2,000 elite soldiers
on the mountain—

413
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,410
just to

414
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,400
guard Mo Qinglian.

415
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,070
Two thousand?

416
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,740
Two thousand elite soldiers?

417
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,330
This small path leads to the
back of the mountain.

418
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,610
It should be their retreat route.

419
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,040
My plan is as follows.

420
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,490
Then, Master,

421
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,000
when do we take action?

422
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,660
Wait a little longer.

423
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,000
Sir,

424
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,290
they're on the move.

425
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,040
Where are they?

426
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,620
They've set up a camp

427
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,770
on a stone platform near the main path.

428
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,710
What does this mean?

429
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,680
How many of them are there?

430
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,440
Twelve.

431
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,600
Where did the extra one come from?

432
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,850
It seems there's an unfamiliar woman.

433
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,700
She's tall,

434
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,680
with striking presence.

435
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,210
I've never seen her before.

436
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,350
So she has come, as expected.

437
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,310
Sir,

438
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,670
should we wait until they all show up

439
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,310
and capture them in one strike?

440
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,240
Are you sure that

441
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,830
there are only twelve of them?

442
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,030
Absolutely certain.

443
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,440
What can

444
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,270
12 people possibly do?

445
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,030
Mo Qingchuan is cunning in warfare.

446
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,880
She wouldn't show up so easily

447
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
without a hidden move.

448
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:54,960
No.

449
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,340
Let's observe and wait.

450
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,020
Do not reveal our strength.

451
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:00,660
Yes.

452
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,880
I understand.

453
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,190
Master,

454
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,640
please take your medicine.

455
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,650
At this moment, Yunwu Mountain

456
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,780
is clear and bright.

457
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,520
If not for the filth it hides,

458
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,220
it would be truly beautiful.

459
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,010
Master,

460
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,340
a mountain is just a mountain.

461
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,600
Evil people deserve to die,

462
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,860
but the mountain is innocent.

463
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,480
You're right.

464
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,670
No matter who sets foot here,

465
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,820
the mountain remains a mountain.

466
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,790
Just like now, when
treacherous officials disrupt
the government

467
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,390
and evil forces run rampant,

468
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,200
the beautiful landscapes of Xia

469
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
are still worth protecting.

470
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,810
Master,

471
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,200
is that right?

472
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,670
It's been three days.

473
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,270
Why is there no movement?

474
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,120
What trick is she playing?

475
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,490
The Cicada Agency has far-reaching
connections.

476
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,750
Could she be gathering reinforcements?

477
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,200
That's it.

478
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,560
She's waiting for backup

479
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,160
to launch an attack and rescue Qinglian.

480
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,440
If not for this,

481
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,110
why would she put on such an act

482
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,550
to draw my attention?

483
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,290
No, that's not right.

484
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,650
Even if she has reinforcements,

485
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,530
I still have 2,000 elite troops
at my disposal.

486
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,590
What can she do to me?

487
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,880
Now.

488
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,140
Retreat immediately.

489
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,110
Sir, they have retreated.

490
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,370
Retreat?

491
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:15,730
Why?

492
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,500
Perhaps they're worried
there'll be heavy fog tonight.

493
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,780
How do you know this?

494
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,360
Some of our veterans can read the signs.

495
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,430
The sky turning grey,

496
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,130
rising humidity,

497
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,020
and heavier dew all point to

498
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,640
incoming fog.

499
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,300
I fear

500
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,290
they may launch a night raid
under cover of mist.

501
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,300
A foggy night raid?

502
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,810
That's it.

503
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,530
She must've called for more
reinforcements.

504
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,720
Send two skilled men

505
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,650
to lead him out through the
secret passage.

506
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,570
Use the back path

507
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,240
to get him safely down the mountain.

508
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,030
Okay.

509
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,510
Mo Qingchuan,

510
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,090
with no more burdens holding me back,

511
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,340
how about we have a proper fight here

512
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,240
on the Yunwu Mountain?

513
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,260
I'll tear you

514
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,070
to pieces on this Yunwu Mountain.

515
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,950
What are you trying to do?

516
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,370
Ms. Mo,

517
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,120
when do we make our move?

518
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,930
If it gets light,

519
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,610
the fog will dissipate.

520
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,580
Wait a little longer.

521
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,870
Sir.

522
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,790
How is it?

523
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,900
There's no movement at all.

524
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,190
Could she have changed her mind?

525
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,160
Or did we misjudge—

526
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,840
maybe she never planned to
act under cover of the fog?

527
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,240
I don't know.

528
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,030
But the men are exhausted

529
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,090
from standing guard day and night.

530
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,790
Once we succeed,

531
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,010
I'll reward you all handsomely.

532
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,620
Thank you, Sir.

533
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,320
Mo Qingchuan,

534
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,400
what are you waiting for?

535
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,300
The east wind brings fog;

536
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,840
it will gather in the lowlands.

537
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,790
We have about two hours

538
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
to make our move.

539
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,080
Enemy attack!

540
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,040
Enemy attack!

541
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,050
They've finally made their move.

542
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,340
Prepare to surround them.

543
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,100
Yes.

544
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,550
Why are there alerts from
three directions at once?

545
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,030
How many did they bring?

546
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,440
Investigate!

547
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,350
Yes!

548
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,830
Retreat!

549
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,150
Yes!

550
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,460
They only have six people.

551
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,000
Kill them!

552
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,590
Retreat!

553
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,990
Kill them!

554
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,030
Over there!

555
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,620
Kill them!

556
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,730
Kill them!

557
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,760
Retreat!

558
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,630
After them!

559
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,680
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

560
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,760
They're coming!

561
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,770
Prepare to fire!

562
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,450
Yes.

563
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,360
What's that sound?

564
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,880
Hurry up!

565
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,550
They're just ahead.

566
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,330
After them!

567
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,440
Go!

568
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,170
Fire!

569
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,250
Go!

570
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,020
Why are there suddenly so many people?

571
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,820
Are these people friends or foes?

572
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,820
They're enemies.

573
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,750
Fire the arrows!

574
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,780
Hurry!
