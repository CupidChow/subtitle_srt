1
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,229
Are you scratching my itch?

2
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,000
General Qingchuan,

3
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,300
surrender.

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,080
Chu

5
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,810
will grant you rank and riches.

6
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,360
Why must you persist?

7
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,470
The Mo Army

8
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,280
will not yield a single inch.

9
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,630
Not an inch

10
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,960
will we yield.

11
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,800
Snow falling right at the start of Spring—

12
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,400
bad omen for widows.

13
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,310
Heaven is wrathful, and the people suffer.

14
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,080
It's said the northern blizzards

15
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,750
have frozen many to death.

16
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,710
Each day is harder than the last.

17
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
Shh!

18
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,750
Stop beating him.

19
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,470
Please, Your Highness.

20
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,870
The Young Lord knows he was wrong.

21
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,680
Young Lord,

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,329
hurry and admit your fault!

23
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,030
It was my failure in teaching him.

24
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm willing to take the
punishment for him.

25
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,400
Please, spare the Young Lord!

26
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,110
You disgraceful son!

27
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,360
Tomorrow, you will go to the Cao residence

28
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,420
and offer a proper apology in person!

29
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,560
I can't go.

30
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
You!

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,750
Your Highness,

32
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,840
Cao Ling'an

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,310
relied on the Empress Dowager's backing

34
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,280
to forcibly seize the people's land

35
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,630
and even harassed
respectable women in public.

36
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,470
Young Lord stepped in
only because he couldn’t
stand by and watch.

37
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,430
Besides,

38
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,800
you're well aware of the
long-standing feud between our families.

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,310
I think the Young Lord

40
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,750
has already done more than enough.

41
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,750
Xia Qiguang,

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,150
do you know how much
trouble you've caused?

43
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,470
I know.

44
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,040
If he's angry and wants to hit me to vent,

45
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,720
I'll take it

46
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,200
without fighting back.

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,090
But if he wants me to apologize—

48
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,870
absolutely not!

49
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:26,830
You…

50
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,600
Why are you so stubborn?

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,780
Your Highness,

52
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,040
he's new here.

53
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,040
He accidentally broke something

54
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,070
and upset you.

55
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,630
Please show mercy, Your Highness.

56
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,360
Take your punishment yourself!

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,390
Yes.

58
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,360
Hurry, hurry.

59
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,070
Get up!

60
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,870
Yes.

61
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,070
Young Master.

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,190
Xia Qiguang,

63
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,680
do you know what brought the former glory

64
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,920
to our family?

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
I do.

66
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,830
You fought alongside
Emperor Yongping to conquer the realm.

67
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,510
You were not only his brother

68
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,430
but also his strategist.

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,680
Then do you know

70
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,070
why I can only be a
powerless, idle prince?

71
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,480
I do.

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,070
When Emperor Yongping passed away,

73
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,070
Empress Dowager Cao purged the Xia clan

74
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,190
to secure Emperor Zhangping's throne

75
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,680
and stabilize the court.

76
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,310
Your choice to step back

77
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,920
and request a distant fiefdom

78
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,750
was a move to save your life.

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,070
Then do you know

80
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,640
why you were forced to stay
in the capital?

81
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,800
I know.

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,920
Though I am the heir apparent,

83
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm essentially a hostage.

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,830
If you understand all this,

85
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,560
then why can't you keep calm?

86
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,950
Did you, by enduring again and again

87
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,310
and retreating time after time,

88
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,310
truly bring peace and calm to the court?

89
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,800
You...

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,950
Why are you so stubborn?

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,240
Today, the young emperor
has already issued the decree.

92
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,570
The day after tomorrow,

93
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,270
I should set off to return to my fiefdom.

94
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,160
The five-year term has ended,

95
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,070
and this year, Xia and
Chu will resume peace talks.

96
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,000
The capital likely won't be peaceful.

97
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,950
I have given it much thought,

98
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,630
and arranged for a master

99
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,110
to discipline you properly.

100
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,270
A master?

101
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,390
My master, of course.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
Who?

103
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,750
I am Jiang Kui from the
Hidden Mist Forest.

104
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,310
This

105
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,800
is my sword.

106
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,430
It's called Scarlet Bloom.

107
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,630
Greetings, Prince Jing.

108
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
Master has already arrived at
the outskirts of the capital.

109
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
Since things are complicated
inside the capital,

110
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,190
she waits quietly at
Qingxin Cottage in the west,

111
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,360
ready for you to come

112
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
and formally pay respects.

113
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,800
Jiang Kui?

114
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
The Jiang Kui?

115
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,630
That's right.

116
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,560
Rumors in the martial world say...

117
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,430
Is she

118
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,750
insane?

119
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,240
Just kidding.

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,970
Actually, I've mended my ways.

121
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,190
See you tomorrow,

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,190
Junior.

123
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,800
You're finally back.

124
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,310
That's great.

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,450
To think the once-renowned

126
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,920
battlefield strategist of Prince Jing

127
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,650
could draw a map that looks
like chicken scratch.

128
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,190
It should be this way.

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,120
The Qingxin Cottage

130
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,360
is way too remote.

131
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Master,

132
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,870
someone's coming!

133
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,720
Keep going.

134
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
You haven't finished your lesson—

135
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
no slacking off.

136
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,360
Oh.

137
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm Xia Qiguang, heir of
Prince Jing's Mansion,

138
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,840
coming by order of my father

139
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
to pay respects to Ms. Mo.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,870
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

141
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,800
Come in quickly.

142
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,750
Master is cultivating.

143
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,550
Junior, please wait a moment.

144
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,840
I have not yet formally
become her disciple,

145
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
so I cannot accept being called

146
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,200
"Junior" just yet.

147
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,190
You're nothing special.

148
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,200
Don't get on my nerves.

149
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
Why has her aura become so strange?

150
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,750
Jiang Kui,

151
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,270
behave.

152
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,030
Master.

153
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,510
Greetings, Ms. Mo.

154
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,240
No need for formalities.

155
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,730
Please forgive me, Ms. Mo.

156
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,390
Regarding becoming your disciple,

157
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,990
I still have some questions.

158
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,920
You're quite straightforward.

159
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,200
Go ahead and ask.

160
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,320
I guess

161
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,050
my father knows I love martial arts

162
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,320
and insists that I come here
to become your disciple.

163
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,000
May I ask,

164
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,670
Ms. Mo,

165
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,550
is your martial skill truly unparalleled?

166
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,600
To be honest,

167
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,060
it's a bit disappointing.

168
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,390
My apologies, Ms. Mo.

169
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,510
I admire

170
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,750
only those of great martial prowess.

171
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,790
If that is the case,

172
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,570
I must decline this apprenticeship.

173
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,000
Many can show off their fists and blades.

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,320
Few can endure humiliation
as Goujian once did.

175
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,720
Such is the pride of youth— nothing more.

176
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,480
But who could endure it?

177
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,650
The Xia is a land of
propriety and rituals,

178
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,910
while the people of Chu are
wolves in sheep's clothing.

179
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,910
Their ambitions laid bare by
repeated incursions along our borders.

180
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,040
Even Qingchuan Town

181
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,510
was carelessly lost to them.

182
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,360
My lifelong wish

183
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,750
is to become a great general,
like General Mo Qingchuan

184
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,030
to lead troops into battle

185
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,320
and one day

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,440
reclaim Qingchuan Town.

187
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,670
Like Mo Qingchuan?

188
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,480
So

189
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,360
you also aspire to be a traitor
who sold out the country for glory?

190
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,750
Am I wrong?

191
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,270
Mo Qingchuan

192
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,120
was no traitor.

193
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,360
Twelve years ago,

194
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
when Mo Qingchuan returned to
the capital to be named Vanguard General,

195
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,790
I had the honor of seeing her once.

196
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,240
It was the third year of
Emperor Yongping's reign,

197
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,010
her first time on the battlefield.

198
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,960
That same year, Emperor Yongping
passed away,

199
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
and the Chu army marched upon the capital.

200
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,480
General Mo was wounded in battle.

201
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,960
The three sons of the Mo family
all perished in the fighting.

202
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,440
She was

203
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,910
only 15, yet she rode
alone into enemy lines

204
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,750
and took the enemy commander's head,

205
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,630
turning the tide of the war.

206
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,320
Later,

207
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
she led the Mo Army,

208
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,270
defending the borders for
years so fiercely

209
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,000
that bandits dared not invade.

210
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,960
Until...

211
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,260
In the third year of
Emperor Zhangping's reign,

212
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,870
the Chu-Xia war broke out again.

213
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,240
Mo Junshan died of illness
on the battlefield,

214
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,840
and control of the Mo Army fell entirely
to his brother, Mo Junyu.

215
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,390
Mo Qingchuan

216
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,460
was then besieged at Chuanhe Inn,

217
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,910
fighting like a trapped beast.

218
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,030
The enemy general Feng Shiye
tempted her with great rewards,

219
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,630
leading Mo Qingchuan

220
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,080
to abandon her sword and surrender.

221
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,910
She's placed life and death
beyond concern.

222
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,910
You call her a traitor?

223
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,630
Everyone says so,

224
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,480
but I

225
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,200
won't believe it.

226
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,360
What if, one day, you meet her,

227
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,080
and she tells you herself that

228
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,440
she betrayed us?

229
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,390
Xia Qiguang,

230
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,150
answer me.

231
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,750
What if she really did betray us?

232
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,150
She told me herself that she betrayed us?

233
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,920
There's no point in saying more.

234
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,080
Ms. Mo,

235
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,980
since our ways differ,

236
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,480
I take my leave.

237
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,720
What are you doing?

238
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,050
I promised Prince Jing.

239
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,510
Whether you accept it or not,

240
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,040
you'll become my disciple.

241
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,970
The ceremony is complete.

242
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,000
Xia Qiguang,

243
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,440
answer me.

244
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,510
What if she really did betray us?

245
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,390
What if she really did betray us?

246
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,840
If that's really the case,

247
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,630
she must have had no choice.

248
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,000
The city gates have fallen;

249
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,910
Qingchuan Town is lost.

250
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Master,

251
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,100
you're having nightmares again.

252
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,750
I dreamed of Qingchuan Town

253
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,030
and...

254
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,960
What time is it?

255
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,910
It's 9 PM.

256
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,870
By now,

257
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
Prince Jing and the others

258
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
should be arriving at the
capital's outskirts station.

259
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Almost.

260
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,310
Master,

261
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,240
what do you mean?

262
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,300
The capital is shrouded in darkness.

263
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,829
Prince Jing...

264
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,750
That means Prince Jing will
lose his head?

265
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,589
Prepare the horses.

266
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,680
Follow me to the outskirts of the capital.

267
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,400
Alright.

268
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,680
We're not far from leaving the capital.

269
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,960
Let's part ways here.

270
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,440
The Cicada Agency has
been established for many years

271
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
and is now firmly rooted.

272
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,030
Though your heart lies elsewhere,

273
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,720
it would do no harm

274
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,840
to study the art of trade in
your spare time.

275
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,950
This is a scroll detailing
Cicada Agency's methods of business;

276
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,790
there is also a letter within.

277
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,400
Deliver it to Ms. Mo on my behalf.

278
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,440
Yes.

279
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's part ways here.

280
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,030
See you in three years.

281
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,110
Your Highness, rest assured.

282
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,240
I will take good care of the Young Lord.

283
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,800
An ambush! We're under attack!

284
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,660
Father!

285
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,730
Protect Your Highness!

286
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,910
Destroy Prince Jing's Mansion!

287
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,480
Destroy Prince Jing's Mansion!

288
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,400
Charge!

289
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
What's that sound?

290
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,920
What's that sound?

291
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,070
As the cicada ends, may Xia endure.

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,320
Cicada Agency!
Defend Prince Jing's Mansion!

293
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,640
You go first.

294
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,030
Father!

295
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,960
Let's go.

296
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,960
Take Father and leave first.

297
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,200
Yes.

298
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,920
Qiguang!

299
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,110
Father!

300
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,350
Giddy-up!

301
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,790
Giddy-up!

302
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,680
Giddy-up!

303
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,790
Southeast.

304
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,720
Southwest.

305
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,270
Father.

306
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,510
Father!

307
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,960
Please!

308
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,920
Please!

309
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,270
Save my father.

310
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,590
Please,

311
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,680
save my father.

312
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,750
Please!

313
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,440
Please.

314
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,830
Master!

315
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,610
Silver Cicada Chen Yi.

316
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,720
What happened?

317
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,790
Ms. Mo,

318
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,830
I failed in duty.

319
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,790
I couldn't protect Prince Jing.

320
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,920
Get up.

321
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,720
If you dare to move again,

322
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,750
I'll make you wish you were dead.

323
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,350
Ghostblade Liu Bumian

324
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,310
was seized in Xia's eighth year

325
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,910
for slaughtering Liu Manor.

326
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That autumn, you were
sentenced to death by a thousand cuts.

327
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,960
Why are

328
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,350
you here?

329
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,510
Soul-Chasing Blade.

330
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,270
Broken Sword.

331
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:41,960
Bookboy.

332
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,160
I've heard of

333
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,480
a mysterious group rising in
the martial world these past years—

334
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,720
Suoque Sect,

335
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,870
infamous for all manner of evil.

336
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,880
Are you from

337
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,350
Suoque Sect?

338
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
Good.

339
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
How many fighters did you bring?

340
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,630
Almost half our best are out.

341
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,790
It's the Cigu Pill.

342
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,200
I've heard when it takes effect,
it's like scraping flesh from bone.

343
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,310
Is that right?

344
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,370
Open your mouth.

345
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,350
I just gave you a Youdie pill.

346
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,960
Guess

347
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,680
Which pill?

348
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,510
which is stronger,

349
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,720
it or the Cigu Pill?

350
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,400
Now,

351
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
tell me all of your plans.

352
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm reasonable.

353
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,310
I'll give you a way out.

354
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,720
A few days ago, we received orders

355
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,480
to eliminate Prince Jing,

356
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,240
then destroy the body and
erase all traces,

357
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,900
making it look like a robbery.

358
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,640
Good.

359
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,400
Let's go.

360
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,070
Jiang Kui,

361
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,480
leave some clues for the imperial court

362
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,200
to tell them

363
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,110
who did this.

364
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,110
Alright.

365
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,400
How should I leave the clues?

366
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,330
Any way you like.

367
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,680
Master,

368
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,550
is this okay?

369
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,270
Silver Cicada Chen Yi.

370
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:58,830
I'm here.

371
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,110
Set a fire

372
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,640
and burn

373
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,480
them all.

374
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,830
Yes.
