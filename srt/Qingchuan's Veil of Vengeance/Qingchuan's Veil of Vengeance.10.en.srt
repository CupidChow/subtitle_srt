00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,810
[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,550
Mo Qingchuan!

3
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,770
Mo Qingchuan!

4
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,070
Mo Qingchuan!

5
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,430
Mo Qingchuan!

6
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,520
Mo Qingchuan!

7
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,700
Uncle,

8
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,410
how was it?

9
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,460
Good girl.

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,810
You're truly accomplished
at such a young age.

11
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,350
I lost in the martial arts demonstration,

12
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,810
and I couldn't even
beat you in the individual competition.

13
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,170
Mo Qingchuan,

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,289
you are truly the pride of our Mo family.

15
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,180
I willingly

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,570
admit defeat.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,450
Uncle,

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,330
I'm flattered.

19
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,229
I should win at least once.

20
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,330
I will definitely win.

21
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,810
Sir.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,380
Sir.

23
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,580
The enemy has indeed
brought many reinforcements.

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,850
Many reinforcements?

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,640
Yes.

26
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,630
But they've all run into the lowlands.

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,830
They're being shot down by our archers.

28
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,940
Good.

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,730
Kill them all.

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,870
Leave no one alive.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,330
Yes.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,470
We're on the same side!

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,329
Stop fighting!

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,500
Let’s go.
Stop!

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,450
Did you hear them say they're on our side?

36
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,630
I think so.

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,660
I heard it too.

38
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,930
What's going on?

39
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,110
Never mind.

40
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,940
Keep shooting.

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,060
Attack!

42
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,190
Shoot!

43
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,740
Kill! Kill!

44
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,060
Why did it go quiet?

45
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,090
The enemy must
have sent more than ten men.

46
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,130
We've been tricked.

47
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,370
Kill!

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,079
Run!

49
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,360
Sir!

50
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,470
Sir!

51
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,090
The enemy troops are advancing towards us.

52
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,500
What did you say?

53
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,010
The enemy troops
have already broken through.

54
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,310
More than half of our men
are dead or wounded.

55
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,240
Many of our men

56
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,460
have fled in fear.

57
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,180
How many of them are there?

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,090
I don't know.

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,220
We have no idea how many there are.

60
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,980
They're everywhere.

61
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,900
If we're caught,

62
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,680
it's certain death.

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Sir,

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,010
we should flee quickly.

65
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,210
No one is allowed to run away.

66
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,390
Don't run!

67
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't run!

68
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,130
Impossible.

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,470
This can't be happening.

70
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,590
Sir,

71
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,400
if you're found in the mountains,

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,240
you'll never be able to clear your name.

73
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,150
Saving our lives is the priority.

74
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,410
I'm leaving first.

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,720
Mo Qingchuan.

76
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,420
Grand Commandant, you're climbing
the mountain at this hour.

77
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,960
could it be that you're in high spirits,

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,490
out for a morning exercise?

79
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,830
I heard last night that Xia Qiguang

80
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,120
wiped out Yunwu Village
up in the mountains.

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,350
Surprisingly,

82
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,870
the village wasn't
filled with ordinary bandits,

83
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,360
but rather what seemed like two thousand

84
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,920
well-armed soldiers.

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,350
Grand Commandant, why
do you look so displeased?

86
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,080
Could it be that these soldiers

87
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,320
were your private army?

88
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,010
What does it have to do with me?

89
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,200
Don't you dare slander me.

90
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,480
Back then, you seized
the title of leader of the Mo Army.

91
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,260
Now, two thousand elite
soldiers have completely

92
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,890
fallen apart because of just 20 enemies.

93
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,980
You

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,780
truly are a worthless military leader.

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,160
20 men?

96
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,100
Yes, 20.

97
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,380
Mo Qingchuan,

98
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,490
you've gone too far!

99
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Compared to when you single-handedly cost
tens of thousands of soldiers their lives,

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,670
this is nothing.

101
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,310
You...

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,680
Mo Junyu,

103
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,180
those departed souls

104
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,570
are now

105
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,670
crossing deserts and mountains,

106
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,990
returning to their homeland.

107
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,070
They stand around you.

108
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,480
Can you hear it?

109
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,490
Hear what?

110
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,480
Hear

111
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,240
the breath of the dead.

112
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,090
They are watching you right now.

113
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,710
This time,

114
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,440
they will witness your death.

115
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,800
A death

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,460
as helpless as ants crushed by

117
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,090
a collapsing sky.

118
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,040
Farewell.

119
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,230
You...

120
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,320
Let me go?

121
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,980
In this mountain village,

122
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,340
there's actually
a hidden underground prison.

123
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,780
Who's locked up in there?

124
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
Are you

125
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,630
Mo Qinglian?

126
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,690
That's the entire plan.

127
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,970
But if

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,490
he decides to move you,

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
take this medicine.

130
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,590
It will quickly
restore your inner power.

131
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,020
Also,

132
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,690
do you remember how to perform Dawn Break?

133
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,930
I do.

134
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,190
We're almost down the mountain.

135
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,450
Let's rest for a while.

136
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,890
Yes.

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
I am Mo Qinglian.

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Mo Qinglian?

139
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,429
Wasn't he killed by the Chu forces?

140
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,490
Look!

141
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,430
Is that Mo Qinglian?

142
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,000
I think it looks a bit like him.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,300
It really seems to be him.

144
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,510
Wasn't he supposed
to have died in Qingchuan Town?

145
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,870
And who is that woman?

146
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,170
I don't know.

147
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,880
He wasn't
delivered to Luoying Court.

148
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,230
He disappeared.

149
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,860
Disappeared?

150
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,710
Where could he have gone?

151
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,630
Was he taken by Mo Qingchuan?

152
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,750
Go find him.

153
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,910
Go find him quickly.

154
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,720
Go find him right now.

155
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,750
Master Chen!

156
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,670
Master Chen!

157
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,450
Master Chen!

158
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,150
Great news!

159
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,250
Great news!

160
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,870
The young master is still alive!

161
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,490
Many people have seen him.

162
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,310
He was seen riding
a horse through the market,

163
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,110
heading towards
the Grand Commandant's Mansion.

164
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,230
[Grand Commandant’s Mansion]

165
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:55,980
[Grand Commandant’s Mansion]

166
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,580
Father.

167
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,400
Mother.

168
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
I'm back.

169
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,790
Mo Qinglian is back.

170
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,890
Qingchuan,

171
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,550
you're back too.

172
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,060
Uncle Zhou,

173
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,510
should I now call you Chief Scribe Zhou

174
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,510
or Minister Zhou?

175
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,560
Just call me Zhou Zheng.

176
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,870
I bought some
soybean sticky rice cake from Li's,

177
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,170
and some braised beef from Huang's.

178
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,620
Let's have some together.

179
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,330
Alright.

180
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,320
Zhou Zheng.

181
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,600
Thank you for these years,

182
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,330
for taking care of my mother.

183
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,490
It's my duty.

184
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,290
Back then,

185
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,780
the old general treated me

186
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,740
well.

187
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,730
But I've always been puzzled,

188
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,840
why did you help Mo Junyu

189
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,290
conceal the truth?

190
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
Was it for her?

191
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,650
Your feelings for her run so deep,

192
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,060
but perhaps she

193
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,800
never cared.

194
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,550
Do you know?

195
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,230
I know.

196
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,510
I also know

197
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,640
Mo Junyu is not a good match for her.

198
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,540
But even though Mo Junyu

199
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,900
committed such a serious crime,

200
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,350
she's still willing to share the burden.

201
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,510
All I can do

202
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,280
is to keep her safe for life.

203
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,400
Zhou Zheng,

204
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,370
you're different from others.

205
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,640
You care about the people,

206
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,750
and have good intentions.

207
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,130
Your official career
should have been smooth,

208
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,410
living peacefully.

209
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,680
But now you're suffering like this.

210
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,540
Is it worth it?

211
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,380
Perhaps

212
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,890
I'll be cursed by millions,

213
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,480
but my lifelong wish

214
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,000
is just for her happiness alone.

215
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,940
So,

216
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,750
you won't give me

217
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,680
the real Qingchuan battle report,

218
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,620
will you?

219
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,710
Thank you.

220
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,740
Thank you

221
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,770
for giving me the chance to confess.

222
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,190
It was I

223
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,690
who willingly fell from grace

224
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,430
and failed to cherish what I had.

225
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,410
Be as cautious
as you were at the beginning.

226
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,410
Keep your heart true and righteous.

227
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,180
Zhou Zheng,

228
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,130
this opportunity for redemption

229
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,570
wasn't given by me,

230
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,170
but by the vast populace behind you

231
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,860
who pleaded on your behalf.

232
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,270
Mo Junyu...

233
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,110
Mo Junyu is not just her husband.

234
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,420
he's also a sharp blade
in the Empress Dowager's hand.

235
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,490
The Empress Dowager

236
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,920
only cares if the blade can kill,

237
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,700
not whether it's clean or dirty.

238
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,160
As long as the Empress Dowager
wants to protect him,

239
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,730
you can't touch him.

240
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,770
After all,

241
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,920
Mo Qingchuan

242
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
will never be the Empress Dowager's blade.

243
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,190
Qingchuan,

244
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,850
be very careful.

245
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,600
Thank you for the warning, Mr. Zhou.

246
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,470
Let me also remind
you of something, Mr. Zhou.

247
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,660
You only seek to please one person,

248
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,820
but you are not her.

249
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,270
How do you know

250
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,800
she's pleased?

251
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,510
The bandit suppression operation

252
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,840
went roughly like that.

253
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,920
I really didn't expect

254
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,850
that this insignificant Yunwu Village

255
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,010
would have two thousand fierce bandits.

256
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,190
Moreover, the map provided by the
military affairs officer was incorrect.

257
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,380
If it weren't for the help of Mo Wang,
the owner of the Cicada Agency,

258
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,900
who said she
was familiar with the terrain,

259
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,810
this mission

260
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,360
would have been unpredictable.

261
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Mo Wang?

262
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,560
Yes.

263
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,100
However,

264
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,090
Empress Dowager, your
birthday gift has been recovered,

265
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,610
and the rabble of Yunwu Village

266
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,200
has been completely dispersed.

267
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,870
Please review, Empress Dowager.

268
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,870
To help me recover my birthday gift,

269
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,430
Your journey

270
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,070
must have been arduous.

271
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,950
I will surely reward you
generously in the future.

272
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,250
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

273
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,410
However,

274
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,920
I have concerns.

275
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,610
Why did you go to suppress the bandits

276
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,610
with only ten men?

277
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,830
The birthday gift is one thing,

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,900
but if something had happened to you,

279
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,500
how would the world view me?

280
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,740
General Cao has arrived.

281
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,650
Empress Dowager, please calm your anger.

282
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,430
The matter of suppressing
bandits at Yunwu Village

283
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,900
has its reasons.

284
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,830
Please,

285
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
allow me to explain.

286
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,550
A few days ago,

287
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,600
Commandant Gao lost
a martial arts match to the Young Lord.

288
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,390
So he suggested to me that

289
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,690
since the Young Lord's
martial skills are superior,

290
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,320
ten men would be
sufficient to suppress the bandits.

291
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,230
At that time, I didn't anticipate

292
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,180
that there would be so many
bandits at Yunwu Village.

293
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,330
It almost endangered the Young Lord.

294
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,240
Thinking about it now,

295
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,630
it was Commandant Gao

296
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,630
who took personal revenge.

297
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,819
Yes.

298
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,660
However,

299
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,050
I did not seek revenge.

300
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,460
If it were revenge,

301
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,349
I wouldn't have followed the Young Lord

302
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,310
and put myself in danger.

303
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,270
Reckless!

304
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,240
I acknowledge my guilt.

305
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,450
Empress Dowager,

306
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,849
since he shared life and death with me,

307
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,980
on the battlefield,

308
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,310
life knows no
distinction between noble and humble.

309
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,440
We are all comrades.

310
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,280
Please forgive him, Empress Dowager.

311
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,450
Rise.

312
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

313
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,640
You, child,

314
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,850
possess both
filial piety and righteousness.

315
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,350
It's truly rare.

316
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,190
Empress Dowager,

317
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,080
I

318
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,520
have another strange matter

319
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
that I wish to report.

320
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,230
In the mountains,

321
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,460
we discovered someone

322
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,590
who closely resembles
the Grand Commandant's son,

323
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,000
Mo Qinglian.

324
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,510
Is that so?

325
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,280
Yes,

326
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,770
we saw it with our own eyes.

327
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,080
Where is he now?

328
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,610
I'm ashamed to say...

329
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,920
I originally intended to

330
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,310
take him alone
to the Grand Commandant's Mansion

331
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,410
for confirmation,

332
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,360
but Mo Wang
took advantage of my inattention

333
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,730
and knocked me unconscious.

334
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,580
Both of them

335
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,840
have disappeared without a trace.

336
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,940
[Eternal Bliss]

337
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,250
Master.

338
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,040
You're back.

339
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,550
I'm back.

340
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,920
Master.

341
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,230
Were you waiting for me?

342
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,570
Yes.

343
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,310
I'm waiting for you.

344
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,410
Qiguang.

345
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,140
Do you know what Mo Qinglian's

346
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,770
appearance means?

347
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,040
It means

348
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,800
Mo Junyu's hypocritical mask

349
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
will be unveiled.

350
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,140
What else?

351
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,100
It means

352
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,980
the truth about the Battle of Qingchuan

353
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,910
will soon be revealed to the world.

354
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,600
What else?

355
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,270
That's all.

356
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,800
[Eternal Bliss]

357
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,180
Master.

358
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,350
Take your medicine.

359
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,980
It means

360
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,460
I,

361
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,010
Mo Qingchuan,

362
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
should return to the public eye.

363
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,780
Didn't you already know this?

364
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,430
Yes,

365
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,630
I knew.

366
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,250
Why did you pretend not to know?

367
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,280
I...

368
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,420
It's alright.

369
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,820
No need to say more.

370
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,000
Master,

371
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,050
do you remember

372
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,400
when we first met,

373
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,910
you asked me a question?

374
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,810
What if, one day, you meet her,

375
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,870
and she tells you herself that

376
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,610
she betrayed us?

377
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,710
Xia Qiguang,

378
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,710
answer me.

379
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,430
What if she really

380
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,520
has betrayed us?

381
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,520
I've been waiting,

382
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,310
waiting for Mo Qingchuan

383
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,200
to truly return.

384
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,770
I'll answer again.

385
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,830
I want to tell you, Master,

386
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,630
and Mo Qingchuan,

387
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
if she has betrayed us,

388
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,060
it's not her fault at all.

389
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,330
I

390
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,870
will follow my heart

391
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,380
and never turn back.

392
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,560
The moonlight is beautiful tonight.

393
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,950
Why don't I teach you

394
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,330
the Dawn Break Form III?

395
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Master.

396
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,870
Fang Du's medicine is somewhat effective.

397
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,820
Don't worry.

398
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,130
You're all dirty.

399
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,700
Go clean yourself up.

400
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,660
Alright.

401
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,110
Dawn Break Form III,

402
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,760
the most difficult form.

403
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,260
The blade moves like wind
sweeping clouds and thunder roaring,

404
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,260
lightning tearing through the sky.

405
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,680
Its force surges like raging seas,

406
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,120
with crashing waves striking the shore.

407
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,000
One strike,

408
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,510
and mountains and rivers resonate.

409
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,830
This is Dawn Break.

410
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,260
If you want to unleash
the true power of Dawn Break Form III,

411
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,890
you need to diligently
cultivate your inner power.

412
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,580
Yes,

413
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,370
Master.

414
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,600
Come,

415
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,740
try it with me.

[Grand Commandant’s Mansion]

417
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Someone's dead.

418
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,590
Let's go, let's go.

419

[Grand Commandant’s Mansion]

420
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,050
What a bad luck.

421
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,570
So scary.

422
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,650
Let's go.
