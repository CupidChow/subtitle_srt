00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,870
[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,670
Go in!

3
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,190
A bunch of cowards.

4
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,270
Is locking me up all you can do?

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,070
If you have the guts, let me out!

6
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,180
I'll lead

7
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,720
an army of a hundred thousand
and kill you all.

8
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,800
Come on!

9
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,500
Are people from Chu all mute?

10
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,800
Who are you?

11
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,490
Silver silk pastries.

12
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,150
The silver silk pastries from Zhou's shop.

13
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,400
These are from Xia!

14
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,280
Did my parents ask someone to
bring me the silver silk pastries?

15
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,430
Come back!

16
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,250
You know me, don't you?

17
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,670
Come back!

18
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,910
Come back!

19
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,400
Is anyone there?

20
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,530
Is anyone there?

21
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,380
Is anyone there?

22
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,290
Is there anyone who can talk to me?

23
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,950
Father.

24
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,329
Mother.

25
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,220
Qinglian misses you so much.

26
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,800
You’ve sent me silver silk pastries
so many times.

27
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,260
Among the people of Chu,

28
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
you've been quite kind to me.

29
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,070
Since you never speak,

30
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,010
I'll call you Hei.

31
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,400
Your silence

32
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,630
means you agree,

33
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,190
right?

34
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,310
Hei.

35
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,800
Hei.

36
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,600
Do you know the story
behind these silver silk pastries?

37
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,130
When I was little,

38
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,800
I made a mistake

39
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,170
and was punished with confinement.

40
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,870
Father locked me up.

41
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,170
I snuck out to find Mother,

42
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,900
but couldn't find her.

43
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,680
Instead, I found a plate of
silver silk pastries.

44
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,480
I had been hungry for a long time,

45
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,890
and it was the most delicious dessert
I'd ever eaten in my life.

46
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,880
Later, Mother told me

47
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,070
they were from Zhou's shop.

48
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,430
Since then,

49
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,800
whenever I wanted to eat them,

50
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,370
Mother would buy them for me.

51
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,159
Hei.

52
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,710
How about

53
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,230
you help me send a letter to my mother?

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,350
She’s the most graceful

55
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,560
and noble woman

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,159
in the Xia Dynasty.

57
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,480
She loves me the most.

58
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,900
She'll surely give you the best things

59
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,850
and try her best to rescue me.

60
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,590
You really

61
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,400
won't let me go?

62
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,210
Well then.

63
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,450
Actually, I've been thinking
for a long time.

64
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,610
You've been keeping me locked up,

65
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,810
but it's not so bad after all.

66
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,620
At least

67
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,120
you haven't defeated Xia.

68
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm still your bargaining chip,

69
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,330
right?

70
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,900
You don’t dare kill me.

71
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,780
And you don’t dare release me.

72
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
But

73
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,750
being alone

74
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
is just so boring.

75
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,510
How about

76
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,230
you kill me?

77
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,160
Please, kill me!

78
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,630
Hei.

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
Hei.

80
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,920
Hei.

81
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
As expected,

82
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,260
I was rejected.

83
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,830
It doesn't matter.

84
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,370
It's good to be alive.

85
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,120
Just living like this.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,080
Mo...

87
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,520
Qing...

88
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,730
Lian...

89
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,500
Hang...

90
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,050
In...

91
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,290
There...

92
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,110
Seeds.

93
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,750
Sister.

94
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,150
Qingchuan.

95
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,130
You've finally come to rescue me.

96
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm here.

97
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
That's great.

98
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,680
I can finally return to Xia.

99
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,070
Do you want to know

100
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,860
who she is?

101
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,390
Hei.

102
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,940
Mother?

103
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,150
Sister.

104
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,020
Let me ask you a question.

105
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,060
Did we win the battle of Qingchuan

106
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,980
in the end?

107
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
We lost.

108
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,520
This place...

109
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,550
Is this Xia's place?

110
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,030
Yes.

111
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,450
One city for one person!

112
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,510
One city for one person!

113
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,490
One city for one person!

114
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,630
One city for one person!

115
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,720
If we lost,

116
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,630
why am I in Xia?

117
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,350
I understand now.

118
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,130
So

119
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,660
I'm just someone

120
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,010
who can't be seen in public.

121
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,800
Qinglian,

122
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,080
I have something important
to tell you now.

123
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,910
There are heavy guards outside.

124
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,040
I need more time to make arrangements.

125
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,570
Understood.

126
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,480
I’ve been locked up all this time.

127
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,400
I've never seen you.

128
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,520
You're awake.

129
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,870
Hei.

130
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,810
You fainted just now.

131
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,510
Are you alright?

132
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,390
Hei.

133
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,120
I've been thinking.

134
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,280
You come to visit me so often.

135
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,740
Are you suffering inside,

136
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,310
like I am?

137
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,040
It's okay.

138
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,030
Just like the seeds you gave me.

139
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,100
They will bloom someday.

140
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,430
The body was found
under a crabapple tree in the suburbs.

141
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,580
Who killed him?

142
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,680
It was...

143
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,120
Mo Qingchuan.

144
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,740
Her martial arts skills are exceptional.

145
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,110
I was terrified.

146
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,830
I had no choice but to hide.

147
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,120
Grand Commandant.

148
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,440
Will you avenge my brother?

149
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:40,530
[Qingxin Cottage]

150
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,160
Master.

151
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,800
Master.

152
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,760
Master.

153
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,470
So in your heart,

154
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,100
I'm more important than Mo Qingchuan?

155
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,910
Qiguang.

156
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,390
So,

157
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,520
what I feel for Master

158
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,020
is different from

159
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,150
what I feel for Mo Qingchuan.

160
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,930
Master.

161
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,550
Where did you go?

162
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,200
I went to see an old friend.

163
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,130
An old friend?

164
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
A friend I cherish very much.

165
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,270
How come I've never heard

166
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,360
that you have such a friend

167
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,950
in the capital?

168
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,000
In the future,

169
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,560
you two might meet.

170
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,670
Actually, you are like him.

171
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,070
You might get along well.

172
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,660
We are like?

173
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,790
Same age

174
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,790
as me?

175
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,130
A bit older than you.

176
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,460
Then I should call him

177
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,240
Brother.

178
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,180
That would be fine.

179
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,600
Then, Master,

180
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,050
why don’t you bring him

181
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,580
some green plum wine?

182
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,000
Fine.

183
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,170
I'll bring some next time.

184
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,890
But in my eyes, Master is

185
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,390
unlike anyone else.

186
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,510
Qiguang.

187
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,960
Qiguang, tomorrow is my birthday.

188
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,020
-Let’s have dinner together.
-Okay.

189
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
Master,

190
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,780
what's wrong with Qiguang?

191
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,340
Mo Qingchuan,

192
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,550
you've really come back.

193
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,160
Since she chose to hide her identity,

194
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,740
we'll silence her

195
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,800
before the world finds out.

196
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,720
Yes.

197
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,450
My wine is only for Master.

198
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,900
But Master can share it with others.

199
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,450
Angry at Master.

200
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,790
Not angry at Master.

201
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,340
Angry at Master.

202
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,720
Not angry at Master.

203
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,450
Angry...

204
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,190
Angry at Master.

205
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,120
Forget it.

206
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,720
I'm not angry at Master.

207
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, right.

208
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,570
Tomorrow is Kui's birthday.

209
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,880
What should I buy?

210
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,270
The sweet and sour pork ribs you made
are so delicious.

211
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,910
No.

212
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,410
Everything Master makes is delicious.

213
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,250
Alright.

214
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,520
Let's get ready to eat.

215
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,360
Okay.

216
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,330
Oh, right.

217
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,120
Master,

218
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,900
I forgot to buy a watermelon.

219
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,690
The first batch of
this season’s watermelons.

220
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,600
I want some.

221
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,360
Okay.

222
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,550
I'll go with you to buy some.

223
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,320
Okay.

224
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,720
Oh no.

225
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,800
I forgot to bring my purse.

226
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,490
Master, do you have any money with you?

227
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,060
Wait, no.

228
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,740
All your money is with me.

229
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,550
I'll go get it.

230
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,430
Master, wait for me.

231
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,490
I'll be right back.

232
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,310
Jiang Kui!

233
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,210
Master.

234
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,570
Since you're here,

235
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,230
you might as well die here.

236
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,080
Come.

237
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,790
Master!

238
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,540
Don't!

239
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,360
Form I.

240
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,220
Master!

241
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,710
Form II.

242
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,550
Form III.

243
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,080
It's such a powerful sword technique.

244
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,960
Why have I never heard of it before?

245
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
Why have I never

246
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,550
seen Master use the Mo's sword technique?

247
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,160
Why did Master lie to me?

248
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,880
So,

249
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,330
this is the real Dawn Break.

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,720
Master!

251
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,460
Master!

252
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,720
Master!

253
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,880
Master!

254
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,270
Master.

255
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,800
Master.

256
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,490
How are you?

257
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,760
She has old wounds.

258
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,120
We can't stay here long.

259
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,330
Who attacked you?

260
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I don't know.

261
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
Who are your enemies?

262
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,040
Chen Siqi.

263
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,430
Zhou Zheng.

264
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,770
Mo Junyu.

265
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,160
And...

266
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,200
Can you hold on?

267
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,750
Yes.

268
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,430
We can't stay here any longer.

269
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,300
We have to go.

270
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,040
Where to?

271
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,860
Prince Jing's Mansion.

272
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,740
Kui,

273
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,650
sit here.

274
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,550
Come.

275
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,950
Take your medicine.

276
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,230
If one day you meet her

277
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,920
and she tells you herself that

278
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,540
she betrayed us?

279
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,220
Long ago,

280
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,100
I met General Mo Junshan just once.

281
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,150
Now, I suspect

282
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,130
that you

283
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,610
are the traitor.

284
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,720
Mo Qingchuan.

285
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,190
Actually, I was originally a member
of the Mo Army,

286
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,720
with the codename Shuicao.

287
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,240
We'll protect

288
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,330
Cicada Agency together.

289
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,150
Come home with me.

290
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,570
Master

291
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,440
is Mo Qingchuan.

292
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,150
As the cicada dies, may Xia endure.

293
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,400
-Silver Cicada Hai.
-Silver Cicada Shen.

294
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,790
Greetings, Your Lordship.

295
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,720
I have two requests for you both.

296
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,720
First,

297
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,080
find a skilled and

298
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,750
trustworthy doctor.

299
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,640
Second,

300
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,270
protect this place

301
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,720
until I return.

302
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,550
Yes.

303
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,830
Mo Qingchuan not only recovered
her martial skills,

304
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,380
but she's grown stronger than ever.

305
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,160
Yes.

306
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,460
However,

307
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,550
her energy is unstable.

308
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,000
She seems to be severely injured.

309
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,460
Xia Qiguang rescued her
and took her to Prince Jing's Mansion.

310
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,220
We cannot let her fully recover.

311
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,190
Find an excuse

312
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,970
to shut down the Cicada Agency.

313
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,550
Take Mo Wang into custody
while you’re at it.

314
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,960
If she dares to resist,

315
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,750
we'll have a legitimate reason
to imprison her.

316
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,570
Your Lordship.

317
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,000
Jiang Kui has gone to rest.

318
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,630
Fang Du just returned to the capital.

319
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,420
She's inside treating Ms. Mo.

320
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,510
Fang Du?

321
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,110
She is an old friend of Ms. Mo.

322
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,090
The tendons in your hands
are almost completely severed.

323
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,620
It’ll take a long recovery.

324
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,240
I have an old friend
who is a skilled physician.

325
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,170
If we have the chance to meet,
I'll take you to see her.

326
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,950
Understood.

327
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,120
Come in.

328
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,360
The tendons in both hands
were almost completely severed.

329
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,870
Riddled with wounds.

330
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,990
Energy is in complete disarray.

331
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,400
So she suffered so much in Chu.

332
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,020
You must be her disciple.

333
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,750
The Young Lord with severed hand tendons,

334
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,880
Xia Qiguang.

335
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,800
She sent me a message

336
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,260
by pigeon not long ago,

337
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,820
asking me to come back
and treat your hands.

338
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,340
How is she?

339
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,210
Her inner power
is completely destroyed.

340
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,980
She's almost half-crippled.

341
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,270
But I saw Master

342
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,310
use the Dawn Break sword technique,

343
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,970
flowing smoothly like water,

344
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,440
without any sign of
inner power damage.

345
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,670
There are two streams of qi in her body.

346
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,780
One is Dawn Break,

347
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,000
the other is overwhelmingly powerful,

348
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,480
like a phoenix in fire.

349
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,310
It suppresses Dawn Break.

350
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,480
While it heals,

351
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,140
it also corrodes.

352
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,400
However,

353
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,770
there's no perfect method in this world.

354
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,690
If she hadn't sealed
the Shenmen and Yufu acupoints,

355
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,430
this powerful technique

356
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,860
would have torn her body
apart inch by inch.

357
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,480
I’ve known her since we were young.

358
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,640
Everyone thought Mo Qingchuan

359
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,500
was born a martial arts genius.

360
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,830
But few knew

361
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,980
how hard she worked behind the scenes.

362
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,200
She must’ve been desperate

363
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,050
to practice such a destructive technique.

364
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,300
Don't let her use
her inner power again.

365
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,260
Otherwise,

366
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,830
her life will be in danger.

367
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,310
I'll send the medicine the next day.

368
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,160
Mo Qingchuan.

369
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,370
Mo Wang.

370
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,550
Master.
