1
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,960
[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,330
[Qingchuan Town]

3
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,640
Your general's son

4
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,120
has been captured by us.

5
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,850
Stop hiding like a coward.

6
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,160
Come out and fight.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,020
If you're really that scared,

8
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,340
General Feng said

9
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,650
if you open the city gates and welcome us,

10
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,160
we'll return him to you.

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,460
One city for one person.

12
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,370
One city for one person!

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,209
One city for one person!

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,670
One city for one person!

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,460
One city for one person!

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,340
One city for one person!

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,420
Grand Commandant.

18
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,430
I really don't know

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,150
where Master Chen and Young Miss went.

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,400
Two days ago,

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,360
Young Miss mysteriously disappeared.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,910
Master Chen received a ransom demand,

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,470
asking for
one hundred thousand taels of silver.

24
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,700
A ransom.

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
Yes.

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,539
He brought the money
and men to go rescue her.

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,120
After meeting the kidnappers,

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,380
Master Chen's expression was very grim.

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,600
After returning home,

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,860
he sat for a long time
and then left alone.

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,479
He hasn't been seen since.

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,530
Report.

33
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,800
We didn't find Chen Siqi.

34
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,370
Understood.

35
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,810
I thought Mr. Chen and I

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,920
had already gone our separate ways.

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,710
Grand Commandant Mo, you're joking.

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,610
If not for your support,

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,430
how could I have

40
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,120
rose to prominence back then.

41
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,830
Now that I've fallen into the mire,

42
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,280
how can you not lend me a hand?

43
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,570
Your downfall

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,520
is of your own doing.

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,400
Yet here you are,

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,200
which proves

47
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,980
what I have in my hand

48
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,800
is keeping you up at night.

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,150
Get me out of here.

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
Otherwise,

51
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,360
this evidence will soon

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,150
spread all over the capital.

53
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,870
Zhou Zheng is in charge of your case.

54
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,440
There's nothing I can do.

55
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,770
Mr. Chen,

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,860
you'll rot in this prison.

57
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,520
Zhou Zheng.

58
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,600
Mr. Zhou.

59
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,950
Others may not know,

60
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,450
but you and I both know.

61
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,590
If he could bend the rules once,

62
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,760
he could do it again.

63
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,910
From then on,

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,710
he'd be in hot water,

65
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,330
falling into a dark path.

66
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,300
Look at you now.

67
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,360
Why did I ever get tangled up

68
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,050
with such a pesky bug like you?

69
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,520
Get me out of here.

70
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,270
And I'll give you what you want.

71
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,540
And then,

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
you and I

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,910
will be even.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,090
Did he run because of the guilt,

75
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,910
or was he afraid I'd silence him?

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,740
Or perhaps

77
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,970
he's already been targeted by someone.

78
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,050
Secretly search
for Chen Siqi and Chen Amei.

79
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,670
Alive or dead,

80
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,850
bring them back.

81
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,550
Your Lordship.

82
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,600
Come.

83
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,190
As a newly appointed official,

84
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,190
this is not the way to handle things.

85
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,260
General Zhang, do you have doubts?

86
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,190
Zheng Wuyou.

87
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:15,770
Li Mao.

88
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,430
Wang Guohua.

89
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,390
Yang Yi. These four men

90
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,850
are all former members
of the Mo Army's Vanguard Camp.

91
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,440
How can you report all of them

92
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,170
and

93
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,190
transfer them
to the Fleetwind Battalion in one go?

94
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,090
Are they not qualified?

95
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,520
I’ve carefully studied their files.

96
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,080
In terms of martial arts,

97
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,310
they’re top-notch
in combat and lightness skills.

98
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,330
In terms of the military merit book,

99
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,200
they're not inferior to
anyone in the Black Armored Army.

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,540
The structure of the Fleetwind Battalion

101
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,120
is nearly the same as
the Mo Army's Vanguard Camp.

102
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,600
Isn't this perfect for them?

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,460
Your Lordship.

104
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,950
They

105
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,290
constantly got in General Cao’s way.

106
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,360
That’s why they were
never trusted or promoted.

107
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,430
Most officers in the Fleetwind Battalion

108
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,630
are relatives or close to the Cao family.

109
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,360
By doing this,

110
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,600
aren't you clearly going against
General Cao?

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
General Zhang,

112
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,480
Cao Huaitai is
the Empress Dowager's brother,

113
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,280
but my position was also
personally granted by the Empress Dowager.

114
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,000
General Zhang,

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,590
why don't you think carefully

116
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,920
about the Empress Dowager's intentions

117
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,990
in this matter?

118
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,670
General Zhang,
you can report this normally.

119
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,550
There’s

120
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,270
nothing improper about it.

121
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,340
If anything does happen,

122
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,230
I will take full responsibility.

123
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Alright.

124
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,480
Fine then.

125
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
I'll be going now.

126
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,390
Ms. Mo,

127
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,830
are you okay?

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm okay.

129
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,540
Go ahead.

130
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,930
One year ago,

131
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,640
based on your deduction,

132
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,130
we started keeping an eye on Mo Junyu

133
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,490
and Cao Yuyan.

134
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,620
Indeed.

135
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,350
On Mo Qinglian's death anniversary,

136
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,210
Cao Yuyan never visits her grave.

137
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,630
Every month,

138
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,570
she goes to a remote mountain village.

139
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,530
It’s about

140
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,090
six hours from the capital.

141
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,280
If my calculation is correct,

142
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,270
Cao Yuyan

143
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,890
will set out in two days.

144
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Now that
something’s happened to Chen Siqi,

145
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,090
Mo Junyu will quickly become aware.

146
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,110
I don't have much time left.

147
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,030
Oh, right,

148
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,510
a few days ago, Young Lord activated
the Golden Cicada

149
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,170
to request a calligraphy piece
from Zhou Jiusi.

150
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,690
Don't keep an eye on him.

151
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,920
He has his plans.

152
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,060
Yes.

153
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,570
It’s Grain Rain today.

154
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,830
The Empress Dowager
should follow the usual custom,

155
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,030
and hold a family banquet in the palace.

156
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,050
As Grain Rain arrives,

157
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,640
all things are in full bloom.

158
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,450
A toast with you all today.

159
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,120
May our dynasty
be like the gentle spring rain,

160
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,180
bringing lasting prosperity
and enduring blessings.

161
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

162
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,360
I brought a parrot

163
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,320
to keep you company, Auntie.

164
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,830
May Your Majesty's mood
be as bright as the spring breeze.

165
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,800
I wish Your Majesty
good health and longevity.

166
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,780
May you be blessed with eternal fortune.

167
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,390
Long live the Empress Dowager.

168
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,720
Long live the Empress Dowager.

169
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,080
Yan still knows my heart best.

170
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,250
Junyu.

171
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,480
Yan is my precious pearl.

172
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,160
If you don't treat her well,

173
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,100
I

174
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,630
will not spare you.

175
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,950
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

176
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,330
Yan's love for me is as deep as the sea.

177
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,480
I am willing to protect her for a lifetime

178
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,190
and

179
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,450
grow old together with her.

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,250
Your Majesty governs the people

181
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,460
with kindness.

182
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,350
The common people
are able to rest and recuperate,

183
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,040
living in peace and working happily.

184
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,240
Moved by this, I

185
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,480
have specially asked
the renowned artist Zhou Jiusi

186
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,790
for a piece of calligraphy and painting

187
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,120
to respectfully present to Your Majesty.

188
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,140
[Hundred Birds Paying Tribute
to the Phoenix.]

189
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,460
Hundred Birds Paying Tribute
to the Phoenix.

190
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,100
Wonderful!

191
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,750
Good!

192
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
You are truly filial,

193
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,960
and that warms my heart.

194
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,640
I don’t deserve such praise.

195
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,120
I’ve heard Zhou Jiusi
is known for his arrogance,

196
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,809
and he can't be easily swayed.

197
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,809
To obtain this painting today,

198
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,810
the Empress Dowager must be delighted.

199
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,970
Xia Qiguang really does know

200
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,030
how to flatter people.

201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,490
Serve the wine.

202
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,270
This wine

203
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,840
is plum wine from the Chu.

204
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,930
It was rushed to our country

205
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,690
for this auspicious occasion.

206
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,010
It's brewed from the first batch
of green plums.

207
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,800
Chu has shown great sincerity.

208
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,690
Peace for the next five years

209
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,370
may not be far off.

210
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,310
My heart is greatly comforted.

211
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,780
The color is emerald green,

212
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,490
with a fragrant plum aroma.

213
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
Sweet and strong on the palate.

214
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,360
Smooth and deliciously sweet.

215
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,020
It truly is an excellent wine.

216
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,950
It’s intoxicating indeed.

217
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,080
Your Majesty.

218
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,750
May I

219
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,490
shamelessly ask for two more cups?

220
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,250
Although it's good wine,

221
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,230
don’t drink too much.

222
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,980
This plum wine comes from Qingchuan Town,

223
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,250
yet now it's presented
as a gift from Chu.

224
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,350
None of the royals here

225
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,300
seem to notice the oddity.

226
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,540
Qiguang,

227
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,570
why aren't you drinking?

228
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,900
Your Majesty.

229
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,030
I haven't attended a family banquet
for a long time.

230
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,510
I haven't seen this good thing
for a long time.

231
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,570
Please forgive me.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
Though the green plum wine
from Qingchuan Town

233
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,780
is famous across the land,

234
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,600
I’ve never tasted it.

235
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,390
I'd like to take some back
to savor it slowly.

236
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,670
Poor child.

237
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,200
Drink freely tonight.

238
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,480
Later,

239
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,360
I'll give you two more bottles.

240
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,330
Thank you, Your Majesty.

241
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,360
Your Majesty,

242
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,700
please mind the steps.

243
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,620
What are you doing?

244
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,320
General Cao failed to get more wine.

245
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,080
My mother has taught me
to be courteous since I was young.

246
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,040
How about

247
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,310
I give a bottle to you?

248
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,990
We Cao family have everything we want.

249
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,410
Who are you to show off
and act generous with me?

250
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,100
Get lost!

251
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,050
But as a member of the Cao family,

252
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,170
you couldn't even get a jar of wine.

253
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,610
You're asking for death!

254
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,510
Your Lordship,

255
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,630
are you alright?

256
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,810
Your Majesty, please don’t be angry.

257
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,680
I...

258
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,580
didn’t mean to spill the wine you granted.

259
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,790
It was truly because this lad

260
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,170
was disrespectful in his speech

261
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,540
and showed no regard for others.

262
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,480
Junyu,

263
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,680
take him home and look after him.

264
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,870
Make sure he won't
cause any more trouble.

265
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,750
Yes.

266
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,570
I...

267
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,480
take my leave.

268
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,110
Forgive me for causing such a scene,

269
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,360
Your Majesty.

270
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,230
Your hand...

271
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,370
Go and summon the imperial physician.

272
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,010
Yes.

273
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,230
It's nothing.

274
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,560
It's just a minor injury.

275
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,840
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

276
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,120
It's just that...

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,520
this is the first time Your Majesty

278
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,450
specially bestowed a gift upon me.

279
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,320
I cherish them.

280
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,710
Su Qi,

281
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,320
send two more bottles of green plum wine
to Prince Jing's Mansion.

282
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,150
Yes.

283
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

284
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,720
I take my leave.

285
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,570
Su Qi,

286
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,690
what do you

287
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,510
think of

288
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,910
Xia Qiguang?

289
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,380
He’s calm and steady.

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If he had any support from his family,

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,720
how could General Cao bully him like this?

292
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,510
It seems

293
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,400
Huaitai has gone too far.

294
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,800
He only remembers that his surname is Cao,

295
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,600
but forgets

296
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,040
that Xia

297
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,890
is the name of this dynasty.

298
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,430
He dares to treat me like that.

299
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,750
A useless brat.

300
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,640
He has been always trying to
please the Empress Dowager.

301
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,070
Uncle, why do you always
get angry with a young man?

302
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,100
Such a narrow-minded person.

303
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,830
No wonder Auntie dislikes you.

304
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,840
When he was young,

305
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,860
he was suppressed by Prince Jing.

306
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,340
He dislikes his father,

307
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,800
nor can he dislike his son.

308
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,730
It's just jealousy.

309
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,240
Nonsense.

310
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,030
You think I’d be jealous of him?

311
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,380
Ridiculous.

312
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,170
He doesn't deserve it.

313
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
He has sister's trust,

314
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,630
and he has learned Mo's knife skills.

315
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,100
Why should he have all that?

316
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,030
Xia Qiguang learned Mo's knife skills?

317
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,730
Who did he learn it from?

318
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,670
Mo

319
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,200
Wang.

320
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,910
Mo Wang.

321
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,090
Master Mo from the Cicada Agency?

322
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,930
How could she know Mo's knife skills?

323
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,490
Uncle,

324
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,790
are you sure it’s Mo Wang,

325
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,220
and not...

326
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,960
Mo Qingchuan?

327
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,840
I’m sure.

328
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,390
How can you be so sure?

329
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,670
I had someone

330
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,950
check it out.

331
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,390
Master Chen,

332
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,630
the west wing room is ready.

333
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,410
Do you know Master Mo

334
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,030
of the Cicada Agency?

335
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,720
Not really.

336
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,210
She rarely makes public appearances.

337
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,360
But I’ve heard

338
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,980
she’s flashy,

339
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,320
like

340
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,670
the nouveau riche.

341
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,410
Take him away.

342
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,330
Yes.

343
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,150
Do you think

344
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,880
she has returned?

345
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,540
Even if she has truly returned,

346
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,840
just kill her.

347
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,120
Why worry so much?

348
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,790
If it were that simple,

349
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,770
the battle for Commander-in-chief
back then

350
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,220
wouldn’t have been so hard.

351
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,790
Mo Qingchuan

352
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,320
is not just a name,

353
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,110
but a symbol of honor.

354
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,280
She protected
the people of Qingchuan Town,

355
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,060
safeguarded
the iron mines on Helian Mountain,

356
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,330
and even secured

357
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,829
seven years of peace for Xia.

358
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,550
Mo Qingchuan.

359
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,680
I envy her,

360
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,420
but I also fear her.

361
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,750
She's imprisoned far away in Chu.

362
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,480
Even if she really escaped,

363
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
you would surely receive news of it.

364
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,140
I hope she dies of illness in prison

365
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,930
and never returns.

366
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,210
Are you

367
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,990
General Qingchuan?

368
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,810
I knew you would come back.

369
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,760
This is the plum wine for you.

370
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,120
Qiguang.

371
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,610
Master.

372
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,310
This is the green plum wine...

373
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,690
you like.

374
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,860
You’re giving this

375
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,760
to General Mo Qingchuan.

376
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,870
I’m just a shadow guard, Shuicao.

377
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,440
How could I deserve it?

378
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,130
I...

379
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,550
What am I supposed to do?

380
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,870
I am not her.

381
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,500
You admire her so much.

382
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,960
Now that you’ve found out I’m not her,

383
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,440
you look so disappointed.

384
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,720
No.

385
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,440
Master, in my heart,

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,930
you're not someone else's shadow.

387
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
You’re

388
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,020
the only moon.

389
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,840
So in your heart,

390
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,960
I'm more important than Mo Qingchuan?

391
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,550
Why would I have such a dream?

392
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,890
Why hasn’t Junior
come to see you these two days?

393
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,880
I'm starting to miss his carriage.

394
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,100
He must be busy with something.

395
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,870
Alright.

396
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,230
I’m itching

397
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,400
for a fight.

398
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,780
If he wants to come,

399
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,900
he will come.

400
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,400
One is in the southeast.

401
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
Another is in the northeast.

402
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,840
Keep talking.

403
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,530
Don't stop.

404
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,260
Your laugh is too awkward.

405
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,910
I call it hearty.

406
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,160
Heartless Cicada Agency!

407
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,360
Give me back my money!

408
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,230
Jiang Kui, save me!

409
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,680
Spare me, heroine!

410
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,500
Spare my life, Master Mo!

411
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,480
I'll never dare to do it again!

412
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,290
Spare me, heroine!

413
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,130
Spare my life, Master Mo!

414
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,790
I'll never dare to do it again!

415
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,770
Why do you want to kill me?

416
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:23,810
No, no, no.

417
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,310
We're not trying to kill you.

418
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,440
It's just that we two

419
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,830
deposited money in the Cicada Agency

420
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,890
for some interest.

421
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,530
But we lost the receipt.

422
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,810
The manager said

423
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,060
no receipt, no money.

424
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,640
That was all we had.

425
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,540
So we had a wicked idea

426
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,080
to kidnap you

427
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,360
and get our money back.

428
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,720
Why is this manager so inflexible?

429
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,160
Just bring your household registry
to prove your identity,

430
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,620
and you can get your money.

431
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,310
Really?

432
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,210
Yes.

433
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,640
Now get lost.

434
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,440
How can there be such stupid people
in this world?

435
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
With such lousy skills,
they dared to kidnap someone.

436
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,420
It's because Jiang Kui is amazing.

437
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,240
Is that so? I think so.

438
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,340
[Qingxin Cottage]

439
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,940
We're finally home.

440
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,140
It's plum wine.

441
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,440
Master.

442
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,960
This wine...

443
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,080
comes from Qingchuan Town.

444
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,070
Really?

445
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,830
It's really from Qingchuan Town.

446
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,120
Junior gave it to you, didn't he?

447
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,120
Since there's nothing urgent today,

448
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,500
let's go pick him up.

449
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,680
Alright.

450
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,630
[Black]

451
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,580
Junior,

452
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,360
we've come to pick you up.

453
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,840
Haven't seen you for days.

454
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,040
Were you avoiding me?

455
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,800
I never meant to.

456
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,040
Then you're still upset with me?

457
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,470
I wouldn't dare.

458
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,790
It's just that...

459
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,910
I've been a bit confused lately.

460
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,590
If you're not upset,

461
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,460
then come home with me.

462
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,350
Alright.

463
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,570
Hey.

464
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,630
Junior.

465
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,580
Where's your carriage?

466
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,110
I...

467
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,010
don’t usually take one.

468
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,350
So the carriage was prepared
for Master and me.

469
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,850
How is it?

470
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,710
Master Mo definitely
doesn't know martial arts.

471
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,790
She fell with just a push.

472
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,300
She rolled all over the place
when we chased her.

473
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,390
You sure

474
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,160
she wasn’t pretending?

475
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,280
Master Chen,

476
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,360
these two

477
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,050
know how to hide their breath.

478
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,690
They’re experts in stealth.

479
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,530
Unless she’s a top master,

480
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,990
she couldn’t

481
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,270
have seen them coming.

482
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,580
You may go.

483
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,630
Yes.

484
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,500
If she doesn't know martial arts,

485
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,880
then she must’ve learned
Mo's knife skills from somewhere.

486
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,470
It's just for showing off.

487
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,490
We'd better be careful.

488
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,040
I think Mo Wang

489
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,960
is quite interesting.

490
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,220
Not only can she
find the finest luminous pearl,

491
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,380
but also obtain
Mo's knife skills.

492
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,040
Cicada Agency is so powerful.

493
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,100
Why don't we ask her to find
a birthday gift for the Empress Dowager

494
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,640
to please her?

495
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
What do you think?

496
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,700
She's nothing
but a money-grubbing merchant.

497
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,550
Steward.

498
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,100
Invite Mo Wang to dine
at our mansion tomorrow

499
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,450
in the name of
the Grand Commandant.

500
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,090
Master Chen,

501
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,160
Master Mo will surely be delighted

502
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,640
to accept the invitation.

503
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,720
Not going.

504
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,590
Why?

505
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,570
She declined.

506
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,590
That’s what Ms. Mo said.

507
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,660
The Grand Commandant
sincerely invites her.

508
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,690
Please honor us with her presence.

509
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,000
Manager,

510
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,070
please make another trip

511
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,600
and deliver my exact words.

512
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,590
I have already delivered

513
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,450
your message word for word.

514
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
But I’m afraid

515
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,560
you won’t like Ms. Mo’s reply.

516
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,850
What?

517
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,300
Mo Wang indeed lacks discernment

518
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,480
and is extremely rude.

519
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,210
Master Chen,
please don't seek revenge on them.

520
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,310
In this capital city,

521
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,550
there are still people who

522
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,610
don't respect
the Grand Commandant.

523
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,920
Understood.

524
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,630
I’ll have someone

525
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,240
teach them a lesson.

526
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,850
Why does this humiliation

527
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,200
feel so familiar?

528
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,680
Never mind.

529
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,700
Such a fame-seeking individual.

530
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,070
The more attention I pay,

531
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,890
the more emboldened she becomes.

532
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,820
Where's my wife?

533
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,790
Why haven't I seen her today?

534
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,520
Master Chen,

535
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,850
today is the fifth day of the lunar month.

536
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,630
Let her be.

537
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,100
We have more pressing matters.

538
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,070
Chen Siqi's body has been found.

539
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,780
This...

540
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
This month's silver silk pastries.

541
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,500
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

542
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,030
It was nothing.

543
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,610
Ms. Mo,

544
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,540
it's about time to set off.

545
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,290
I’ve bribed the guards heavily.

546
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,510
But...

547
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,670
Do you really want to go in yourself?

548
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,120
Should we...

549
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,570
If it's really him inside,

550
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,350
I want to see him myself.

551
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,220
[No strangers are allowed
to enter Yunwu Village]

552
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,860
It's silver silk pastry again.

553
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,200
Hei,

554
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,000
do you see it?

555
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,400
The seeds you gave me

556
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,400
have bloomed.

557
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,750
After all these years,

558
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,240
why have you never spoken to me?

559
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,400
Are you mocking me?

560
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,960
Or are you also trapped here,

561
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,120
just like me?

562
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,140
Who are you?

563
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,690
Who the hell are you?

564
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,590
Sister.

565
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,440
Qingchuan.

566
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,750
I'll return this prisoner to you.

567
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,440
One city for one person.

568
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,800
How about that?

00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,400
General Mo.

570
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,950
One city for one person!

571
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,750
One city for one person!

572
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,510
One city for one person!

573
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,240
One city for one person!

574
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,030
One city for one person!

575
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,600
One city for one person!

576
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,200
Qingchuan.

577
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,140
You've finally come to rescue me.
