won't your true identity

Ms. Mo, do you think Qiguang
has figured it out?

55

He's starting to suspect.

56
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,930
Then why not tell him the truth?

Someone from the Imperial Prison

195
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,390
delivered a letter to Mo Junyu.

[Grand Commandant's Mansion]

197
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,360
It was a letter from Chen Siqi

198
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,840
to the Grand Commandant.

199
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,590
[Imperial Prison]

200
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,320
This morning,

201
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,270
Chen Siqi was released.

202
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,240
It seems that he served well

203
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
as a touchstone.

204
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,940
But

205
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,480
it's quite surprising that

206
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,200
he's so deeply connected to

207
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,030
Mo Junyu.

208
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,240
Ms...

209
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,320
Ms. Mo,

210
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,440
are you alright?

211
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm fine.

212
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,860
Go on.

213
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,100
Okay.

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,330
News from Chu has arrived.

215
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,390
It's highly likely that Feng Shiye

216
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,280
will lead the Chu delegation

217
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,120

226
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Is this

the badge of the Mo Army's
Vanguard Battalion?

Shuicao?

229

If there really was such a
person in the Vanguard,

230
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,340
there must be a record.

231
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,350
There's really someone named Shuicao.

Greetings, Inspector.

Greetings to the four of you.

235
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,310
I may be a bit presumptuous

236
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,740
in seeking you out today,

237
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,060
but I

238
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,090
wish to inquire about someone.

239
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,850
Please ask.

240
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,480
I'll tell you all I know.

241
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Sir, since you

242
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,700
once served under General Qingchuan,

243
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,360
may I ask if you

244
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,100
knew someone

245
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,600
named Shuicao?

246
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,410
Sir.

247
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,500
Why do you

248
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,910
ask about this?

249
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,040
I happened to hear the name

250
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,880
in passing recently

251
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
and grew curious.

252
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,490
Please rest assured,

253
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,720
I mean no harm.

254
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,240
Shuicao?

255
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,550
Wasn't she standing right next to you

256
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,610
during the martial arts tournament?

257
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,890
I see.

258
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,000
She was General Qingchuan's shadow guard,

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,670
but

260
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,450
due to her special status,

261
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,310
I'm afraid

262
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,310
I can't

263
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,650
reveal more.

264
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,880
So Master's really Shuicao.

265
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,910
It's alright.

266

269
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,080
will remember this.

Yes.

275
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,990

276
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,260

the Mo Army

Alright.

280
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,840
We'll wait for the Young General's return.

281
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,630

285
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,130
He's such a fickle guy, isn't he?

286
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,460
So just because I'm not Mo Qingchuan,

287
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,200
you stop calling me Master?

288
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,420
Exactly.

289
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,990
Why didn't you tell me earlier

290
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,220
that you are Shuicao?

291
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,340
What is there to be proud of about

292
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,440
being the shadow guard of
the traitor, Mo Qingchuan?

293
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Mo Qingchuan is not a traitor!

294
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,480
Master,

295
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,630
what's wrong with you?

296
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,430
It's nothing.

who is seen by the world as a
good official,

303
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,580
is actually protecting Chen Siqi.

304
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,710
I thought there might be an honest one
even among a pond full of crooks.

305
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,490
Qingchuan Town fell;

306
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,510
Mo Junyu

307
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,660
must be a traitor.

308
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,530
He didn't expect me to survive

309
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,530
and fears the truth will come out,

310
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,080
so

311
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,390
he forced Chen Siqi to lure me out.

312
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,030
For some reason,

313
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,440
Mo Junyu did not kill Chen Siqi

314
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,550
to silence him afterward.

315
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
That might be

316
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,960
why he rescued Chen Siqi this time.

317
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,120
However,

318
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,360
I originally thought
Zhou Zheng was deceived,

319
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,630
but it seems that

320
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,080
Zhou Zheng

321
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,700
knew the whole truth about

322
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,670
the Battle of Qingchuan.

323
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
So

324
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,390
he must have a

325
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,990
true battle report of
the Battle of Qingchuan.

326
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,470
Should we go and seize it?

327
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,240
No rush.

328
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,310
Let's deal with Chen Siqi first.

329
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,960
Since

330
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,980
Since Xia's laws

331
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,720
can't do anything to him,

332
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,680
we'll have to punish him

333
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,410
the way the Cicada Agency does.

334
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,680
Jiang Kui,

335
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,569
aren't you curious

336
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,240
how much dirty money
Chen Siqi has embezzled

337
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
since rising to this high position?

338
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,790
I'm very curious.

339
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,960
Chen Siqi,

340
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,530

Find her!

342
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,790
Find her for me!

343
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,920
How can such a person

344
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,380
just disappear like this?

345
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,380
Master Chen,

346
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,820
we have searched all over

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,260
the capital

348
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,670
but really haven't found the young lady.

349
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,670
The other day,

350
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,880
she told the young master

351
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,110
she'd come back to help you
sort out some old clothes.

352
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,790
But she disappeared on her way here.

353
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,090
We've been searching everywhere

354
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,150
and asking around—

355
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,210
almost ready to put up notices.

356
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,590
Then put up notices!

357
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,020
Yes.

358
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,550
Master Chen!

359
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,560
Master Chen!

360
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,730
Master Chen!

361
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,180
Here it is.

362
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,660
If you want to ransom your sister,

363
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,510
bring 100,000 taels of silver notes.

364
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,920
If we don't see the money tonight,

365
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,960
she won't survive.

366
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,880
Once you gather the money,

367
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,410
I'll tell you the location.

368
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,510
Go,

369
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,760
raise the money.

370
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,950
This is 100,000 taels.

371
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,650
Take out all the silver stored

372
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,600
in various private treasuries

373
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,460
and convert it into silver notes.

374
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,720
Okay.

375
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,340
You dare lay a finger on my sister?

376
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,030
I'd like to see

377
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,250
if you have the life to take this money.

378
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,400
Which round is this?

379
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,130
The seventh.

380
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,400
But this time, they only

381
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,110
managed to gather 9,849 taels—

382
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,270
even threw in a gold bracelet

383
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,530
to make it an even 10,000 in silver notes.

384
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,640
He's really raking it in.

385
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,550
Keep waiting.

386
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,880
Yes.

387
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,530
Master Chen,

388
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,300
we've gathered...

389
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,100
We've gathered the full amount.

390
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,280
We've pawned almost

391
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,530
everything of value in the household.

392
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,840
Master Chen,

393
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,310
are you truly going to

394
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,510
hand over all the silver notes
to those bandits?

395
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,270
Master Chen,

396
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,260
I have a bad feeling about this.

397
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,440
I've heard that there will be a blood moon

398
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,740
at midnight.

399
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,640
It's an ominous sign.

400
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,210
Go alone to

401
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,170
the ruined temple west of the city.

402
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,070
Oh.

403
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,110
You're here.

404
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,180
You kidnapped my sister?

405
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,350
Yes.

406
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,150
That's right.

407
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,470
Where is she?

408
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,030
I brought the silver notes.

409
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,960
You get the money

410
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,540
when I see her and you release her.

411
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,960
We agreed you'd come alone.

412
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
Yet you brought a whole bunch of men

413
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,550
waiting outside.

414
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Mr. Chen,

415
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,570
you're not keeping your word.

416
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,830
I'm afraid you won't see your sister now.

417
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,000
You're quite arrogant.

418
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,590
How dare you threaten me?

419
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,750
I'll tie you up right now.

420
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,600
If you don't release her,

421
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,890
I'll make you wish you were dead.

422
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,930
You

423
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,030
wouldn't dare tie me up.

424
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,300
My master

425
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,450
is someone you can't afford to offend.

426
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,760
In this capital,

427
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,750
there's no one I can't afford to cross.

428
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,060
Is that so?

429
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,310
Who?

430
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,310
I have doubts in my heart.

431
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I asked the heavens

432
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,070
why once sworn vows still
linger in my ears,

433
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,280
yet today, an old friend
seems like a stranger.

434
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,920
Why does a bond of brotherhood

435
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,680
fall short when weighed
against mere silver?

436
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,320
Why is loyalty

437
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,920
discarded like worn-out shoes?

438
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Then

439
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,910
you tell me.

440
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,050
General Qingchuan.

441
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,830
Chen Siqi,

442
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,160
I'll only ask once.

443
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
Why did you betray me?

444
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,520
Why did you betray the Mo Army?

445
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,310
Back then,

446
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,540
I was sent by you

447
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,330
to investigate Liya Town

448
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
but

449
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,690
was captured by Mo Junyu.

450
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,350
He threatened me

451
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,590
with my sister and her unborn child.

452
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,770
Before my mother passed away,

453
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,830
she repeatedly urged me

454
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,110
to take care of her.

455
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,920
So,

456
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,480
General,

457
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,710
I had no choice but to betray you.

458
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,830
If you betrayed us just to

459
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,250
protect your sister,

460
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,610
I wouldn't blame you.

461
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,100
But I am puzzled.

462
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,030
How did you

463
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,750
rise to Guard Commander in
just five years?

464
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,480
Because

465
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,600
you tasted the sweetness of
power and wealth,

466
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,550
you turned around and forced Mo Junyu

467
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,150
to help you rise step by step.

468
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,880
Your desire is like a bottomless pit,

469
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,440
and in the end, you became a
complete parasite.

470
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,130
Am I right?

471
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,260
Enough!

472
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,660
You were born into a military family,

473
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,120
and can afford to be noble.

474
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,390
But what do I have?

475
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,920
A lowly life

476
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,000
and a sickly sister.

477
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
A general's success costs countless lives.

478
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,030
Who does not know you, Mo Qingchuan?

479
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,890
But back then,

480
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,580
tens of thousands of people like me
died in Qingchuan Town.

481
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,050
Who

482
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,350
still remembers their names?

483
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,150
Qingchuan was already lost.

484
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,280
I was just going with the flow.

485
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,040
General,

486
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,260
lower your noble head

487
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,210
and look at the state of this world.

488
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,720
Either you prey on others,

489
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,380
or others prey on you.

490
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,960
So,

491
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,500
you have no regrets?

492
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,410
No regrets.

493
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,110
Come on,

494
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,310
General Qingchuan,

495
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,310
let's have another drink.

496
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,830
Come on,

497
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,500
Come on.

498
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,030
Come.

499
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,110
Come on.

500
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,830
Bottoms up!

501
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,550
Nice wine.

502
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,370
Nice wine.

503
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,560
Forget it.

504
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,250
You betrayed the Mo Army.

505
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,980
Write your confession

506
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,000
and I will let your sister go.

507
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,850
As for you,

508
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,640
you must pay with your life.

509
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,500
Don't think about escaping.

510
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,310
You know

511
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
you can't run away.

512
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,660
Mr. Chen,

513
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,470
please go ahead.

514
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,420
[Criminal, Chen Siqi]

515
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,310
Master,

516
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,750
check it carefully.

517
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,070
Give me the silver notes.

518
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,960
You won't need them anyway.

519
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,160
At 3 AM,

520
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,030
by the old crabapple tree in
the city outskirts,

521
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,360
you will see your sister for
the last time.

522
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,430
Master,

523
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,490
it seems he doesn't know

524
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,210
you lost all your martial arts.

525
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,870
I'm still scared to see you.

526
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,300
you've lost all your martial arts skills.

527
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,020
Has Mo Qingchuan lost all
her martial arts?

528
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,560
Was all that just a bluff?

529
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
That makes sense.

530
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,440
Feng Shiye never leaves loose ends.

531
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,680
There's no way he'd let her
keep her skills

532
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,270
and risk a comeback.

533
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,410
Besides, she's clearly out for blood.

534
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,920
Am I supposed to just stick my neck out

535
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,450
and wait to be slaughtered?

536
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,940
Kill her

537
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,120
and take back the confession.

538
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,000
Sister.

539
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,670
Brother!

540
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,650
Brother!

541
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,730
I'm so glad you're alright.

542
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,000
General Qingchuan brought me here

543
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,980
without saying a word.

544
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,240
I thought something had happened to you.

545
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,110
Brother.

546
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,480
You and General Qingchuan
haven't seen each other for years.

547
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,400
You must have a lot to talk about.

548
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,310
How about

549
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,880
I give you two some space?

550
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,360
Sister,

551
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,620
listen to me.

552
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,430
Leave right now.

553
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,310
Don't ask questions.

554
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,240
Don't look back.

555
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,110
Don't return to the capital.

556
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,720
Go quickly.

557
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,200
Brother.

558
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,000
Go quickly!

559
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,160
In the end, you still couldn't

560
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,440
let go of everything.

561
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,590
It took me so much effort to
become Guard Commander.

562
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,870
Why did you come back?

563
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,400
Yes.

564
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,680
I am the Guard Commander.

565
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,640
Mo Qingchuan,

566
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,560
you

567
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,470
are the real traitor.

568
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,990
You're beyond saving.

569
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,490
You want to kill me?

570
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,370
With just a few dozen private soldiers,

571
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,240
what can you possibly do?

572
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,710
Mo Qingchuan,

573
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,250
you've lost your martial arts,
haven't you?

574
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,430
Chen Siqi,

575
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,510
if you had confessed,

576
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,180
I only intended to cripple
your martial arts.

577
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,510
I

578
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,160
gave you a chance.

579
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,640
No!

580
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,510
No!

581
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,030
General Qingchuan,

582
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,830
don't kill me.

583
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,350
I was wrong.

584
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,540
We were once comrades who
shared life and death.

585
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,830
Qingchuan,

586
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,880
let me go.

587
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,240
I'll trade you a secret.

588
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,920
Five years ago,

589
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,270
General Mo Junshan

590
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,480
had a sudden relapse of his old illness.

591
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,790
In fact...

592
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,370
I have the prescription as evidence.

593
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,000
Qingchuan,

594
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,900
I'm begging you!

595
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,510
So,

596
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,390
you should've died long ago.

597
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,310
Master.

598
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,560
Chen Siqi,

599
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,880
for betraying the Mo Army,

600
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,420
is stripped of military rank,

601
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,430
sentenced to capital punishment,

602
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,200
and buried on the spot.
