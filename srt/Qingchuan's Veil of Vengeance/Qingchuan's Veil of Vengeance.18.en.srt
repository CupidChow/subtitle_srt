do you remember the wind at the frontier?

112
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,640
It caressed countless corpses

113
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,190
and lonely graves.

114
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,350

of instruments,

115

I miss that wind more.

116
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,790
I once imagined
that for the rest of our lives,

117
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,440
we would stand side by side,
listening to the wind in the desert,

118
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,370
watching the moon's
reflection sink into the river.

119
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,300
It was indeed a beautiful dream.

120
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,860
Yes,

121
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,440

Feng Shiye,

125
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,140
of course I remember
the wind at the frontier.

126
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,320
I also remember
what sounded along with the wind:

127
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,980
the war drums and horns of the Mo Army,

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,800
the charge and the battle cries.

129
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,280
I still remember what came with the wind:

130
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,440
the fragrance of green plum wine,

131
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,940
children's laughter,

132
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,190
and young girls' songs.

133
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,380
It's been too long,

134
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,750

I would be completely unprepared?

149
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,700
have been a general
who fought on the battlefield,

150
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,980
and also a traitor despised by thousands.

151
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,120
I was once confused about who I am,

152
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,060
but one thing I knew for certain:

153
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,850
I could never be your wife.

154
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,220

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,970
let my sword tell you instead.

156
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,470
Very well.

157
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,470
Love has clouded my judgment.

158
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,450
Let's end this here today.

159
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,690
Your Dawn Break Form III
can no longer harm me.

160
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,100
Then have you seen

161
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,010
Dawn Break Form IV?

162
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,230
There are two streams of qi in her body.

163
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,870
One is Dawn Break,

164
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,940
the other is overwhelmingly powerful,

165
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,340
like a phoenix in fire.

166
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,110
It suppresses Dawn Break.

167
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,040
While it heals,

168
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,830
it also corrodes.

169
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,790
If she hadn't sealed
the Shenmen and Yufu acupoints,

170
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,730
this powerful technique

171
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,400
would have torn her body
apart inch by inch.

172
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,560
Her life will be in danger.

173
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,760
Who am I?

174
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,560
Do you know now?

175
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,170
You've won.

180

182

It's too late.

183
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,660
Take the items and go first.

184
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,260
Yes.

185
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,230
Kill!

186
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,610
If you see her,

187
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,930
give her a candied haw stick for me.

188
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,290
Chase them!

189
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,590
They're over there!

190
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,350
Hurry!

191
