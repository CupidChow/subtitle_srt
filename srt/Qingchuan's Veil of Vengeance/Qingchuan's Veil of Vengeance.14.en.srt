[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,470
Your Ladyship!

3
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,470
Please come down.

4
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,720
Be careful of the child in your belly.

5
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,240
Your Ladyship.

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,400
-To the left. Be careful.
-Your Ladyship.

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,940
Be careful.

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,110
-Come down, Your Ladyship.
-Your Ladyship.

9
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,000
Please come down, Your Ladyship.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,930
Your Ladyship, please be careful.

11
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,410
General Feng,

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,370
Her Ladyship...

13
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,100
Why?

14
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,130
Why not kill me

15
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,229
but choose to kill our child?

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,509
My flesh and blood,

17
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,530
I have the final say.

18
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,020
As for you,

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,840
don't be in such a rush

20
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,210
Your time

21
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,340
has not yet come.

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,870
Let me tell you a story.

23
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,900
Once upon a time,

24
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,780
there was a divine maiden

25
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,000
who fell into the River of the Dead,

26
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,650
devoured by thousands of demons.

27
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,240
Day after day,

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,260
year after year.

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,590
Even when her bones were laid bare,

30
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,210
she survived.

31
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,390
Do you know why she lived?

32
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,360
Because someone
was waiting for her to return?

33
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,079
No.

34
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,290
Because

35
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,910
someone was hoping
she would never return.

36
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,300
So,

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,000
you want to go back?

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,900
The pain I've endured,

39
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,560
those who pushed me into the river

40
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,140
will suffer the same.

41
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,760
What did Your Highness say?

42
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Mo Qingchuan refuses the marriage?

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,730
This is bad.

44
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,520
She's at the height

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
of her reputation in Xia.

46
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,270
If she refuses,

47
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,140
even the Empress Dowager can't force her.

48
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,010
Let alone

49
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,930
offer an extra thirty percent in tribute.

50
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,020
What now?

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,810
If the peace talks fail,

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,320
the Second Prince might seize the chance
to strike back at Your Highness.

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,920
Then

54
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,450
everything the King promised Your Highness

55
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,900
will be for nothing.

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,360
As for Empress Dowager
Cao, I'll handle her.

57
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,870
As for Qingchuan,

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,459
she's just looking for excuses to refuse

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,649
because she still
clings to thoughts of Xia.

60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,770
Fine.

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,790
Let her see clearly

62
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,560
to Xia, Mo Qingchuan

63
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,040
is nothing but a bargaining chip.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,060
It's been three years.

65
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,230
It's time she let go
and returned with me to Chu.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,110
How troublesome!

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
No matter how high

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,820
she climbs in Xia,

69
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,750
To

70
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,159
Chu,

71
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
she's just

72
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,690
a plaything of Your Highness...

73
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,470
Show any more disrespect toward her,

74
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,950
and I'll take your life.

75
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,820
Get lost!

76
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,240
Yes.

77
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,840
I was wrong.

78
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,030
General Qingchuan has returned.

79
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,540
With her commanding the Mo Army,

80
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,880
why negotiate at all?

81
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,630
Exactly.

82
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,110
What good intentions
can Chu possibly have?

83
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,310
Is Xia's food

84
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,860
made for livestock or what?

85
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,130
It's disgusting.

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,840
What did you

87
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,220
mongrels just say?

88
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,340
Move aside.

89
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,670
Behave yourselves.

90
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,920
You...

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,270
General Li.

92
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,870
Think of the bigger picture.

93
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,450
Now that General Mo is back,

94
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,600
you think we fear the people of Chu?

95
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,510
Exactly.

96
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,630
You think Mo Qingchuan

97
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,170
is so great?

98
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,720
She's already His Highness's woman.

99
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,590
Even carrying his child.

100
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,010
Shut your mouth!

101
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,630
What a joke!

102
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,690
Let's go.

103
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,230
I heard General Mo

104
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,980
was defiled by Feng Shiye.

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,180
Impossible.

106
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,040
General Mo should

107
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,070
rather have died than surrendered.

108
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,780
What are you talking about

109
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,580
Mo Qingchuan

110
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,630
defiled by the Prince of Chu,

111
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,430
Feng Shiye.

112
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,890
Who started this rumor?

113
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,490
His deputy, Li Feng

114
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,010
said it himself at Wangyue House.

115
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,480
Lots of people heard it.

116
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,950
[Jinghua Post Station]

117
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,000
Feng Shiye!

118
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,830
What's the matter?

119
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,370
What did you do to my master?

120
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,560
She endured cruel torture in Chu.

121
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,040
Her inner power is ruined.

122
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,590
Did you

123
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,840
force her?

124
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,030
If yes,

125
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,770
so what?

126
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,810
What do you want?

127
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,630
Kill me?

128
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,690
I am an envoy of a sovereign nation.

129
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,840
Yes.

130
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,159
And I will kill you now.

131
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Stop!

132
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,340
Master.

133
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,450
Go.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,720
I...

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
You really think you can defeat him?

136
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,070
Some things in this world

137
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,020
are worth doing even if doomed to fail.

138
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,630
In that way can I...

139
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,390
Is it worth it

140
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,010
for me?

141
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,150
It is.

142
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,380
Go

143
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,270
I must kill him today.

144
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,050
Master.

145
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,600
You're protecting him?

146
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,400
Yes.

147
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,990
He can't die yet.

148
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,340
Why not?

149
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,910
You don't need to know.

150
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,230
Master.

151
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,130
Won't you even

152
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,620
listen to your master now?

153
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,450
Go.

154
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,520
You taught Xia Qiguang
the Mo family's sword technique?

155
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,260
Does he deserve it?

156
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,050
Do you?

157
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,080
Don't touch him.

158
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,440
You already killed his father.

159
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,680
Isn't that enough?

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,450
The one who sent
a secret letter to Mo Junyu

161
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,500
that made him kill Prince Jing by mistake

162
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,330
was you,

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,270
wasn't it?

164
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,890
Prince Jing's assassination

165
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,010
was because Mo Junyu was manipulated.

166
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,160
The only one
who could use Mo Qinglian against him

167
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,170
is you.

168
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,110
You're impressive.

169
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,070
You're the one who's impressive.

You know what I am.

172
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,780
A scoundrel.

173
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,740
A villain.

174
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,930
Trash.

175
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,000
In this world, aside from you,

176
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,070
everyone else is beneath my notice.

177
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,380
Try me if you dare.

178
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,850
I want this one.

179
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,570
Thank you, Sir.

180
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,270
Okay.

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,030
Why are you following me?

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,820
She wants my candied hawthorn?

184
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,850
It's sweet?

185

into assassins.

189
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,660

since childhood

192
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,980
must've been painful.

193

It's okay.

194
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,150

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,810
I will make sure you have
all the candied hawthorn you want.

196
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,870
This one's for you…

197
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:01,090
[Jinghua Post Station]

198
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,170
Tell me her movements these past few days.

199
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,030
Bought food.

200
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,870
Argued with a vendor.

201
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,050
Let the wind blow on her face.

202
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,250
-Hopped across rooftops.
-Enough.

203
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,010
You're following the wrong person.

204
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,870
Your Highness.

205
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,200
This drugged warrior,

206
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,170
though skilled in martial arts,

207
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,570
is not very bright.

208
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,280
Let me go instead.

209
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,030
I will surely

210
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,080
redeem myself.

211
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,750
You?

212
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,650
Mo Qingchuan has exceptional hearing.

213
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,940
Only she can barely manage this task.

214
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,040
Why else

215
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,640
do you think I sent her?

216
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,510
What're you holding?

217
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,360
What is that?

218
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,680
Mu Yun.

219
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
They are the enemy.

220
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,380
You cannot get close to them.

221
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,940
Then why must they be the enemy?

222
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,080
We were born into opposing camps,

223
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,850
destined to meet in conflict.

224
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,600
And who decided this opposition?

225
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,410
Was it you, Your Highness?

226
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,820
Without summons,

227
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,690
you must not act on your own.

228
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,100
Yes.

229
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,050
The birthday banquet is near.

230
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,450
If peace talks between
Chu and Xia succeed,

231
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,290
it will be a double celebration.

232
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,150
Your Majesty.

233
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,740
Regarding the marriage alliance,

234
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,630
what does General Qingchuan think?

235
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,760
I was just about to discuss it with her.

236
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,080
Keep a close eye

237
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,340
on the banquet matters

238
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,140
I've never fully trusted

239
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,240
Grand Commandant Cao's handling

240
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,980
I understand.

241
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,720
I take my leave.

242
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,170
Your Majesty.

243
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,390
General Mo has arrived.

244
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,320
Summon her.

245
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,840
Summon her.

246
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,140
General Qingchuan.

247
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,950
Now that rumors are flying everywhere.

248
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,390
I'm afraid

249
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,190
even if you refuse,
you will still be made to marry.

250
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,560
Then tell me, Your Majesty.

251
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,450
do you believe I should marry?

252
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,600
As a woman,

253
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,920
I don't wish to make things hard for you.

254
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,220
But as the Empress Dowager,

255
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,319
if a marriage contract

256
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,540
could bring about peace...

257
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,780
But Your Majesty,

258
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,150
is that kind

259
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,329
of peace real

260
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,490
or merely a dream?

261
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,990
Why draw such lines?

262
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,750
Even though
you've survived countless battles,

263
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,560
you still don't
understand this battlefield.

264
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,630
Your enemies

265
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,940
are foreign tribes.

266
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,880
But mine

267
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,300
are far more terrifying.

268
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,580
They wear the masks
of loyal ministers and upright officials

269
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,860
and wield the sword of law and ritual

270
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,130
against me, a mere woman.

271
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,060
So

272
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,110
I gave them a choice.

273
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,750
To die in noise

274
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,330
or live in silence.

275
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,550
And now

276
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,410
I can stand beside them

277
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,980
without difference.

278
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,090
The water that's too clear has no fish.

279
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,530
That's what it means.

280
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,060
I understand your words,

281
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
Empress Dowager.

282
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,590
But I

283
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,390
Only wish to live with clarity.

284
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,120
I, Mo Qingchuan,

285
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,180
would rather die under a horse's hooves

286
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,110
than become my enemy's plaything.

287
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,460
I know you care for the people.

288
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,300
But this marriage alliance

289
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,140
is also a way to save the country.

290
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,840
Take me, for example.

291
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,200
Though reviled by thousands,

292
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,200
if I weren't holding court here,

293
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,510
Xia might already be in chaos.

294
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,370
How can the people

295
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,450
be at peace?

296
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,000
In truth,

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,270
you and I

298
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,680
are very much alike.

299
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,320
I

300
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,810
am not worthy
to be compared to Your Majesty.

301
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,770
I cannot change your decision.

302
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,740
But this life

303
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,740
is still mine to decide.

304
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,690
General Mo.

305
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,390
Even if you had power
that reached the heavens,

306
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,390
you are still a woman.

307
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,200
And women

308
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,140
cannot escape marriage.

309
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,750
If you had a marriage contract,

310
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,100
I might be able
to help refuse on your behalf.

311
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,010
What a pity!

312
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But don't forget, Empress Dowager.

313
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,410
To the people,

314
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,410
I am a general first,

315
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,380
and a woman second.

316
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,090
You said you had a way

317
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,530
to stop Feng Shiye from marrying me?

318
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,430
Yes.

319
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,540
What way?

320
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,450
I'll go to the Empress Dowager

321
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,510
and...

322
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,510
And offer her

323
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,200
Prince Jing's title.

324
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,070
She might agree...

325
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,680
Agree to...

326
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,070
Prince Jing's title?

327
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,830
You're willing to give up so much?

328
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,640
In exchange for what?

329
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,780
For...

330
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,000
Say it.

331
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,340
For what?

332
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,780
For marrying...

333
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,370
Looks like we won't

334
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,050
be having perch today

335
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,180
That Mo Qingchuan.

336
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,830
What kind of heroine is she?

337
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,560
No integrity at all.

338
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,480
Exactly.

339
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,500
She and Feng Shiye

340
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,120
already had a child together.

341
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,520
Just a disgraced woman.

342
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,590
Where are you going?

343
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,920
Master.

344
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,410
They're spouting nonsense.

345
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,340
But they're not wrong.

346
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,650
They are.

347
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,460
What's wrong then?

348
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,260
Wasn't it me who endured humiliation

349
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,410
in the enemy's camp?

350
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,720
Wasn't it me who got pregnant

351
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,430
with Feng Shiye's child?

352
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,330
Just a body.

353
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,530
Why all the fuss?

354
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,450
What chastity and purity?

355
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,550
What flawless virtue?

356
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,830
On the battlefield,
I've seen all kinds of mangled limbs.

357
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,310
I don't find them ugly.

358
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,080
I have all my limbs.

359
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,650
Why should I feel shame?

360
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,080
That set of hollow virtues,

361
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,900
you all treat as sacred law.

362
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,740
But don't try to bind me with them.

363
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,950
The world may not know you, Master.

364
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,660
But I do.

365
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,020
If you were truly different from others,

366
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,530
you wouldn't have thought of marrying me.

367
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,140
Rumors can shatter gold.

368
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,440
And slander can grind bones.

369
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,910
I just don't want you

370
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,900
to be hurt by gossip.

371
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,630
I, Mo Qingchuan,

372
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,220
did it, then I did it.

373
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,750
Why fear judgment?

374
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,230
Why care about whispers?

375
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,330
Do I need you to beg the Empress Dowager?

376
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,400
Does it work?

377
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,900
Do you think when your father

378
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,330
begged the assassin to spare his life,

379
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,440
it helped?

380
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,740
You're angry?

381
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,000
Good.

382
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,070
Don't ever let me hear

383
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,830
the word "beg" from your mouth.

384
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,380
Remember.

385
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,210
Nothing in this world

386
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,570
is obtained by begging.

387
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
It's not just for others' opinions,

388
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,290
it's also because

389
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,980
as a soldier of Xia,

390
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
I cannot stand by

391
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,210
and watch a helpless woman be humiliated.

392
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,560
A helpless woman?

393
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,400
Who?

394
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,140
Me?

395
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,190
In my eyes, Master,

396
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,240
you're still a woman.

397
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,460
Still someone who needs protection.

398
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,000
Xia Qiguang.

399
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,960
What are you thinking?

400
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,240
I mean to say...

401
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,460
I mean to say...

402
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,290
Whatever he can help you with,

403
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,560
I can do it too.

404
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,270
Yes.

405
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,830
He is despicable and shameless.

406
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,770
But to deal with villains,

407
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,250
one must unleash a mad dog.

408
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,110
My agreement with him
has nothing to do with you.

409
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,350
From now on,

410
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,000
you need not walk this path with me.

411
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,620
I won't let him

412
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,230
sway your resolve.

413
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,860
Resolve?

414
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,800
What resolve do I have left?

415
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
Master.

416
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,600
Trust me just this once.

417
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,510
What you've lost,

418
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,180
I'll help you reclaim.

419
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,440
If the road ahead is hard,

420
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,270
I'll be your vanguard.

421
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,330
[Qingxin Cottage]

422
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,270
Master went fishing alone,

423
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,080
refused to let me go along.

424
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,710
So dull.

425
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,270
Maybe I should

426
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,960
wander around the palace?

427
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,120
Who's there?

428
00:24:54,430 --> 00:25:01,260
[Master]

429
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,880
If I want sweets in the future,

430
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,310
can I come to you?

431
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,620
That depends on my mood.

432
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm not someone

433
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,110
who gives kids

434
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,970
candied hawthorn for free.

435
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,100
I'm

436
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,990
the kind of person
who makes others tremble in fear.

437
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,680
Already bought the candied hawthorn.

438
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
But she won't come.

439
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,030
Did I scare her off?

440
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,960
At worst

441
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,160
I'll give it to some other kid.

442
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,160
Forget it.

443
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,060
About the marriage alliance,

444
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,500
have Your Majesty come to a decision?

445
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
If General Mo is unwilling to marry,

446
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,250
who can force her?

447
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,480
Waiving thirty percent
of the tribute isn't enough?

448
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,060
Mo Qingchuan is no ordinary woman.

449
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,830
With General Mo present,

450
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,480
the Mo Army remains intact.

451
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,030
Then perhaps

452
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,580
these peace talks are unnecessary.

453
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,270
If negotiations fail,

454
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,030
do Your Majesty truly believe
a mere woman like Mo Qingchuan

455
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,680
can defend the border?

456
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,870
If we can't supply your requested tribute,

457
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,490
then I have no
choice but to believe in her.

458
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,620
However,

459
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,190
if your country could
reduce another twenty percent,

460
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,190
this matter

461
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,580
might still be negotiable.

462
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,290
Why does Your Majesty
favor chrysanthemums?

463
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,490
Your Majesty.

464
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,530
If you grow too greedy,

465
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,810
this may be the last
season your chrysanthemums

466
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,510
bloom in the palace.

467
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,480
What do you mean?

468
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,090
Your Majesty, bad news.

469
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,610
Your...

470
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,600
Your golden chrysanthemum...

471
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,720
Among them,

472
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,330
who is truly Feng Shiye's man?

473
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,310
There are only three days left

474
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,550
until Mo Qingchuan's
departure for marriage

475
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,270
and the signing of the treaty.

476
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,030
This time,

477
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,020
you must give it serious

478
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,130
thought.
