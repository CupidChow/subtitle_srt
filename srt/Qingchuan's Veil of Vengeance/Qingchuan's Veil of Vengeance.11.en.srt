00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,850
[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,070
General Mo.

3
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,790
The people of Chu
have returned the young master.

4
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,280
The young master

5
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,270
has been tortured beyond recognition.

6
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,340
Those cruel beasts from Chu

7
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,030
couldn't conquer Liya Town,

8
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,050
so they brutally killed the young master
and sent him back

9
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,280
in an attempt to demoralize our troops.

10
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,670
Qinglian,

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,590
rest in peace.

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,480
I will avenge you.

13
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,259
Though my son has died,

14
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,640
his spirit remains with Xia.

15
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,070
We fight the Chu invaders together.

16
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,820
We will never retreat!

17
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,650
Never retreat!

18
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,300
Never retreat!

19
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,120
Never retreat!

20
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,259
Never retreat!

21
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:52,920
Never retreat!

22
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,810
Never retreat!

23
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,390
Never retreat!

24
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,460
Never retreat!

25
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,920
Someone with ill intentions

26
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,030
impersonated my son
and returned to the capital,

27
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,590
intending to frame me.

28
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,729
After being exposed,
he committed suicide by hanging.

29
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,240
This matter is of great importance.

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,510
So I've come to report it to Your Majesty.

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,460
Mo Qinglian was found in a bandit den.

32
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,400
So many witnesses.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,360
Could they all

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,079
have been mistaken?

35
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,750
After many years,

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,970
a young man's appearance
can change greatly.

37
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,360
Being mistaken

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,780
is understandable.

39
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,430
Junyu,

40
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,490
I ask you once again.

41
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,720
Was the person who appeared yesterday

42
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,440
Qinglian?

43
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,130
Qinglian...

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,400
Father.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,940
Mother.

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,870
I'm back.

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,530
I want to ask you two,

48
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,010
how could you bear to
imprison me alone for years?

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,990
I want to ask you, Mother,

50
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,230
how could you bear

51
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,590
to see me for years

52
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,560
without saying a word?

53
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,310
Qinglian,

54
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:20,890
I...

55
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,310
Was it because my heroic father

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,750
was afraid the world would know

57
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,810
he was a coward

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,240
who

59
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,190
betrayed the Mo Army

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,400
and Xia for his own glory?

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,240
And made a deal with Chu

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,970
to exchange a city for a person.

63
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,200
You were captured by the enemy.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,840
I...

65
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,730
I did it to save you.

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,470
I'd rather have died.

67
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,300
Guards!

68
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,120
What are you doing?

69
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,490
Don't touch him!

70
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,790
If you want him to live, shut your mouth!

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
Everyone has been mistaken.

72
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,450
Mo Qinglian never returned.

73
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,890
This person

74
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,840
is just an imposter causing trouble.

75
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,040
Seize him!

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,720
Let go!

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,570
Let go of my child!

78
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,510
Let go!

79
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,650
Hide him well.

80
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,060
Let go!

81
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,670
Yes.

82
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,600
I won't let you touch him!

83
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,630
Let him go!

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,510
Let go of my child!

85
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,950
Let him go!

86
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,430
Go!

87
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,860
Qinglian!

88
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,230
I promise,

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,740
once things quiet down,

90
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,620
I'll send Qinglian out of the capital.

91
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,150
You and I are one.

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,970
We've long shared honor and disgrace.

93
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,590
Qinglian...

94
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,120
has long been dead.

95
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,870
Back then,

96
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,800
you retreated to defend Liya Town.

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,870
Though you lost an eye,

98
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,920
your fighting spirit remained unbroken.

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,120
But because of this,

100
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,650
you enraged the Chu forces,

101
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,240
and they sent
Qinglian's corpse in revenge.

102
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,800
You publicly cremated his body,

103
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,430
uniting the troops,

104
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,880
holding out for reinforcements,

105
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,080
and finally defended the town.

106
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,570
In the end,

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,590
it was Qinglian's death

108
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,540
that fulfilled your reputation
for righteousness.

109
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,790
But if Qinglian is still alive,

110
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,840
then all I said just now

111
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,800
was nothing but a story you fabricated.

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,110
Even worse,

113
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,680
you may have colluded with the enemy

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,140
in a city-for-man trade.

115
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,110
I ask you one last time.

116
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,720
Did Mo Qinglian

117
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,670
return?

118
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
The people must have been mistaken.

119
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,310
This is a serious crime of treason,

120
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,350
not only will it implicate Yan.

121
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,040
If this matter is spread as a conspiracy,

122
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,870
it will implicate the entire Cao family

123
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,510
and me.

124
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,780
When that time comes,

125
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,110
you are beyond forgiveness.

126
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,880
Mistaken identity

127
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,570
is the best outcome.

128
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,980
I understand, Your Majesty.

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
I

130
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,450
would never dare lie to you.

131
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,330
[Grand Commandant's Mansion]

132
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,530
Try talking to her again.

133
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,720
I've already told you,

134
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,750
she's not seeing anyone.

135
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,390
Who's there?

136
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,280
It's me,

137
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,250
Zhou Zheng.

138
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,940
I know Qinglian has returned.

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,210
There are some things

140
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,810
that I must inform you about.

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,460
If you don't want to say it, leave.

142
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,240
This matter is of great importance.

143
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,169
Mo Junyu

144
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,600
definitely didn't tell
Empress Dowager the truth.

145
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,200
However,

146
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,980
this matter has become widely known.

147
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Mo Junyu won't be able to contain it.

148
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,550
Moreover,

149
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,260
you should know

150
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,010
how Qinglian came back, right?

151
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,870
Mo Qingchuan?

152
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,700
She will never let this matter

153
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,940
sink into oblivion.

154
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,300
She allowed

155
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,410
Qinglian to appear openly

156
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,200
in the bustling market

157
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,750
is for this very reason.

158
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,700
She's forcing you and the Empress Dowager
to make a choice.

159
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,160
Between Mo Junyu and Mo Qinglian,

160
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,280
you can only keep one.

161
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,690
This matter involves too many people.

162
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,030
The Empress Dowager absolutely
doesn't want this to escalate.

163
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,110
Therefore,

164
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,440
Mo Junyu...

165
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,260
might

166
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,010
kill Qinglian

167
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,530
to save himself.

168
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,910
Zhou Zheng,

169
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,880
can you get me out of here?

170
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,250
Who is it?

171
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,710
I only want to take you away.

172
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,160
Why are you here too?

173
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,780
Who are you?

174
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,350
I'm here on my master's order
to take you away from here.

175
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,030
Also,

176
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,950
Mo Qinglian is imprisoned in

177
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,710
Luoying Court.

178
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,660
Be ready.

179
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,750
It seems

180
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,090
I can only take you away.

181
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,590
Zhou Zheng,

182
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,900
hide yourself well.

183
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,870
You'd better hide well then.

184
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,790
By the way,

185
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,910
you should hide

186
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,040
that person.

187
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,380
Well...

188
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,360
Then how do I...

189
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,900
See you later.

190
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,790
They really left.

191
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,320
Darling,

192
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,360
I've come to see you.

193
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,600
Mo Junyu has gone out.

194
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,360
Cao Yuyan has gone to find Cao Huaitai

195
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,620
and is also heading to Luoying Court.

196
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,670
This road must be like
having his bones scraped

197
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,610
and eating his own flesh.

198
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,970
Find a way to make my uncle

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,860
suffer this pain a little longer.

200
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,440
Yes.

201
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,870
Who is it?

202
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,790
Is it...

203
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,090
Father?

204
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,590
Father,

205
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,140
are you here to take my life?

206
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,480
Uncle Junshan once warned me

207
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,240
that the oath of the Mo Army

208
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,880
is to never yield an inch.

209
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,700
Back then,

210
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,720
I was proud to be one of the Mo Army.

211
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,600
Qingchuan also praised my talent.

212
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,840
I even mastered the Dawn Break Form I.

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,930
I swore to achieve military merits

214
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
and bring glory to the Mo family.

215
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,400
But later,

216
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,940
I learned the truth.

217
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,680
Father,

218
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,830
you colluded with the enemy.

219
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,270
I was conflicted.

220
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,080
I once wanted to defend you.

221
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,320
I told myself

222
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,840
that you did it just to keep me alive.

223
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,350
It was understandable.

224
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,580
But this thought

225
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,320
filled me with shame.

226
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,340
Yet, deep down, I still hoped

227
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,840
that you could turn back.

228
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,850
You would never kill me,

229
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,820
right?

230
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,990
It's really you.

231
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,470
I,

232
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,320
Mo Qinglian,

233
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,210
will be ashamed of you

234
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
for the rest of my life.

235
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,600
Uncle,

236
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,150
please immediately

237
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,220
arrest the man who tried to kill my son

238
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,980
on the spot!

239
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,580
[Master]

240
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,600
It's so cool.

241
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,680
It's time

242
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,090
to temporarily bid farewell

243
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,300
to Mo Wang.

244
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,790
[Master]

245
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
If wishes are like floating clouds,

246
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,910
then obsessions are like flowing water.

247
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,370
The floating clouds will
eventually turn into rain

248
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,930
and descend upon the earth.

249
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,340
Mo Qingchuan.

250
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,770
Su Qi.

251
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,440
What time is it?

252
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,460
Your Majesty,

253
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,770
it's just past 1 AM.

254
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,150
Why are you still up?

255
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,990
You slept early today.

256
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,510
Earlier,

257
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,640
General Cao came by.

258
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,630
What happened?

259
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,080
General Cao

260
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,760
received a distress call
from your niece today.

261
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,820
She said someone was trying to harm her.

262
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,680
When he went to catch the culprit,

263
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,180
but instead saw

264
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,550
Grand Commandant Mo
attempting to kill his own child,

265
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,640
Mo Qinglian.

266
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,280
Chen Siqi.

267
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,190
Zhou Zheng.

268
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
Mo Junyu.

269
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,020
And...

270
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,020
Empress Dowager Cao.

271
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,480
I hear your martial arts training
is showing initial results,

272
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,400
which brings great comfort to our family.

273
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
Keep training with diligence.

274
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,630
Never slack.

275
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,230
Here is a piece of jade

276
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,150
as a reward for your hard work.

277
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,810
May you be

278
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,190
pure

279
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,590
and strong as jade.

280
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,820
Your brother,

281
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
Junshan.

282
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,530
What do you want from me?

283
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,350
Yan,

284
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,630
you still came.

285
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,780
There's nothing

286
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,320
left to say between us.

287
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,910
Yan,

288
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,110
I don't care if I die.

289
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,000
I just wanted

290
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,520
to see you one last time.

291
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,060
People

292
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,340
always realize what they had

293
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,550
only after they've lost it.

294
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,030
Enough!

295
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,640
Mo Junyu,

296
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,920
how could you raise a blade against Lian?

297
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,150
Even a tiger doesn't eat its own cubs!

298
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,120
I want to rip out your heart
and see what's inside!

299
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,790
I don't know what came over me.

300
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,360
I've wronged Qinglian,

301
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,340
and I've wronged you even more.

302
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,940
You were not the one at fault.

303
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,860
I was.

304
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,490
I was blind and foolish.

305
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Back then,

306
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,570
I insisted on asking my aunt
to arrange our marriage.

307
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,800
But

308
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,230
you never loved me.

309
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,240
You even...

310
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,010
despised me,

311
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,950
didn't you?

312
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,770
I...

313
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,540
You married me

314
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,080
only for the Cao family behind me.

315
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,790
I was lying to myself.

316
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,270
It's time to wake up.

317
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,390
No.

318
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,450
No.

319
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,830
No.

320
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,670
Of course not.

321
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,110
Back then, you were like
the moon in the clouds,

322
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,770
while I had achieved nothing.

323
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,580
Everything I strived for

324
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,010
was to ensure you wouldn't be inferior
to other noble ladies.

325
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,250
You once said

326
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,570
husband and wife are one.

327
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,750
I've never forgotten that.

328
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,040
Saying all this now

329
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,240
is too late.

330
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,580
It's not too late.

331
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,270
Of course it's not too late.

332
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,620
If you could just help me
and plead with Zhou Zheng.

333
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,110
As long as he doesn't change his statement

334
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,180
and doesn't hand over
the military report of Qingchuan battle,

335
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,230
there's still a way out.

336
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,660
We

337
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,440
can start over.

338
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,970
You want me to beg him again?

339
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,030
Yan,

340
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,000
as long as we get through this,

341
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I swear

342
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,860
I'll  take good care of you

343
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,200
and Lian.

344
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,160
Alright?

345
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,690
Yan,

346
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,090
poor child.

347
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,810
I know you've suffered.

348
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,200
Mo Junyu has committed a serious crime.

349
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,000
As his wife,

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
you'll inevitably be implicated.

351
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,960
Don't worry,

352
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,380
I won't let anything happen to you.

353
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,060
Thank you, Auntie.

354
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,340
However,

355
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,440
even though he's made a terrible mistake,

356
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,600
since you two got married,

357
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,230
you've been a loving couple.

358
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,510
He's also been loyal

359
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,360
to our Cao family.

360
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,010
Except for that incident,

361
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,160
he

362
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,200
can still be considered reliable.

363
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,950
Our Cao family

364
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,170
shares honor and disgrace together.

365
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Even if you have any grievances,

366
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,640
save it for later.

367
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,250
Understand?

368
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,800
We share honor and disgrace.

369
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,790
Alright,

370
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,410
I'll go in and check on him.

371
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,490
You go back and rest.

372
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,830
Yes,

373
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,800
Auntie.

374
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,730
[Grand Commandant's Mansion]

375
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:13,600
[Grand Commandant's Mansion]

376
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Thank you for

377
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,690
helping us today, Mr. Zhou.

378
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,290
I didn't really help much.

379
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,480
You...

380
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,140
Do you have anything to say?

381
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,390
[Grand Commandant's Mansion]

382
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,420
[Grand Commandant's Mansion]

383
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,260
All you want is
for one person to be happy.

384
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,980
But you're not her.

385
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,420
So how would you know

386
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,680
what makes her happy?

387
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Zhou Zheng,

388
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,350
may I ask you for a favor?

389
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,680
[Taiji Hall]

390
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,110
A few days ago,

391
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,020
Mo Junyu attempted to assassinate
his own son, Mo Qinglian.

392
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,790
It's related to the Qingchuan case.

393
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,790
The Censorate

394
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,960
has received multiple
impeachment memorials

395
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,440
accusing

396
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
the Grand Commandant Mo Junyu

397
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,430
of treason and collusion with the enemy.

398
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,600
Today's court hearing.

399
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,350
Mr. Mo,

400
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,570
do you have anything to say about this?

401
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,160
Your Majesty,

402
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,700
Yan has agreed to help me.

403
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,600
That means Zhou Zheng won't betray me.

404
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,050
As long as I keep denying everything,

405
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,610
there will be no concrete evidence.

406
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,400
Even if Mo Qingchuan shows up,

407
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,030
there's nothing they can do.

408
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,750
Your Majesty,

409
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,350
if Mo Qingchuan returns,

410
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,320
with her military reputation,

411
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,890
it will be difficult to control the army

412
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,310
in the future.

413
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Isn't that right?

414
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,070
Your Majesty,

415
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,030
I beg you.

416
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,280
Loyalty

417
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
is also a rare quality.

418
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,620
Rest assured,

419
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,170
I

420
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,120
will not forget

421
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,790
your dedication.

422
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,070
When my son's body

423
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,160
was returned by the Chu forces,

424
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,720
his face was unrecognizable.

425
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,340
I had no idea

426
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,050
Qinglian was still alive,

427
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,000
nor do I know
how he ended up in a bandit's den.

428
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,680
As for laying hands on him,

429
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,200
it was because he disobeyed me.

430
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,400
I merely wanted to teach him a lesson,

431
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,790
not to kill him.

432
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,180
Summon Mo Qinglian.

433
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,370
Summon Mo Qinglian!

434
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
Mo Qinglian,

435
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,030
all these years,

436
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,740
who held you captive?

437
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,920
And why did Mo Junyu harm you?

438
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,070
Speak the truth.

439
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,270
The relationship between Emperor
and ministers, father and son

440
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,800
has remained unchanged
since ancient times.

441
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,160
Qinglian,

442
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,780
do you intend to collude with outsiders

443
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,780
to frame your own father?

444
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,960
Since childhood,

445
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,270
your studies and martial arts

446
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,630
were all taught by me.

447
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,860
This debt between father and son,

448
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,260
can you ever repay it?

449
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,030
Debt between father and son?

450
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,160
Are you worthy of it?

451
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,480
Yan,

452
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,150
what are you doing here?

453
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,390
I, Cao Yuyan, and Mo Junyu

454
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,180
have long been estranged.

455
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,070
Today in court,

456
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,010
I formally request a divorce.

457
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,890
What did you say?

458
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,520
Lian,

459
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,410
you owe no one anything.

460
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,690
Today,

461
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,270
on behalf of me

462
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,810
and yourself,

463
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,630
speak all that should be said.

464
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,860
Everyone knows

465
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,460
in the Battle of Qingchuan,

466
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,460
I died at the hands of the Chu people.

467
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,750
But they don't know,

468
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,950
the burning of my body at Liya Town

469
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,600
was just a show
he put on for the soldiers.

470
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,200
Because by then,

471
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,440
I had already been
taken away by my parents,

472
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,240
secretly sent to the Xia,

473
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,510
and imprisoned at
the foot of Yunwu Mountain

474
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,010
for five whole years,

475
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,250
never seeing the light of day.

476
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,180
Yan,

477
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,350
is this true?

478
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,830
Absolutely true.

479
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,420
You venomous woman,

480
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,860
spouting lies.

481
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,570
It's all because

482
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,940
your love was unreturned.

483
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,860
So now you seek revenge

484
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,930
to deliberately ruin my career.

485
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,890
My love unreturned?

486
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,570
Mo Junyu,

487
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,910
you're nothing but a pitiful man

488
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,640
living under the glory
of Mo Junshan and Mo Qingchuan.

489
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,350
But I, Cao Yuyan,

490
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,030
was born
in the Grand Preceptor's household.

491
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,550
I am the niece of the current Empress Dowager,

492
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,310
and elder cousin of the Emperor.

493
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,080
Even after I step out of this hall,

494
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm still

495
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,000
a noblewoman envied by all.

496
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,110
This is the Cao Yuyan I know.

497
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,250
Cao Yuyan.

498
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,020
What did you say?

499
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,150
Enough.

500
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,520
This is the imperial court,

501
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,030
not a place for personal disputes.

502
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,590
You...

503
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,170
Apart from the matter of Mo Qinglian,

504
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,920
do you have any other physical evidence?

505
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,370
No.

506
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,170
So it's just her one-sided story.

507
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,420
How can one treat court testimony
like child's play?

508
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,180
All these years,

509
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,140
I have been helping Mo Junyu

510
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,890
cover up the truth about
the Battle of Qingchuan.

511
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,540
For so many years,

512
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,280
I was wrong.

513
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,830
I,

514
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,790
Zhou Zheng,

515
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,050
accept the punishment.

516
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,480
May I ask you for one thing?

517
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,530
At tomorrow's court hearing,

518
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,140
Mr. Zhou, please

519
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,340
reveal the full truth

520
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,980
of the Qingchuan battle.

521
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,350
Mr. Zhou, what were you thinking?

522
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,620
So this is the kind of person he is.

523
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,490
I was

524
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,990
the chief scribe

525
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,970
of Mo Junshan.

526
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,100
During the battle of Qingchuan,

527
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,990
our army had already set a strategy.

528
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,980
An outward feint to lure the enemy,

529
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,550
while General Mo Qingchuan

530
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,140
led troops behind enemy lines

531
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,850
to strike the main camp directly.

532
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,440
Mo Junyu was
to hold Qingchuan Town firmly,

533
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,450
and when the enemy forces
returned to defend,

534
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,510
he would lead a pursuit from the city.

535
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,790
But the moment

536
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,590
General Qingchuan left the city,

537
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,490
the Chu forces circled around

538
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,340
during our troop rotation,

539
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
attacking the unguarded west gate.

540
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,370
It was as if they already knew
our entire defense layout.

541
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,150
Otherwise,

542
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Qingchuan Town
wouldn't have fallen so easily.

543
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,560
At that time,

544
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,780
I had already drafted a military report

545
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,550
intending to report that
there was a spy in our army

546
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,880
who had leaked our military tactics
and city defense plans.

547
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,480
However, Mo Junyu

548
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,200
persuaded me to delay.

549
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,340
In the end,

550
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,110
[Military Report]

551
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,070
I complied with him,

552
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,070
modified the report,

553
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,750
stamped it,

554
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,690
and turned it into false evidence,

555
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,580
accusing General Qingchuan

556
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,590
of being a traitor.

557
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,020
I was truly foolish.

558
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,850
There was such a story behind it.

559
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,380
Afterwards,

560
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,000
Chen Siqi, the Vice General of Qingchuan,

561
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,800
also corroborated this matter,

562
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,680
which solidified the charges.

563
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,620
Even if Mr. Zhou determined
there was a spy,

564
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,070
on what grounds
did you conclude that this spy

565
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,830
was me?

566
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,690
I have no concrete evidence.

567
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,560
I have been deeply trained
by the Mo Army since childhood.

568
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,290
I wanted to win more than anyone else.

569
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,300
As a member of the Mo Army,

570
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,010
I risked my life

571
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,690
for Xia

572
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,540
to protect Liya Town!

573
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,110
That arrow

574
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,950
nearly killed me.

575
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,880
But what about you?

576
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,830
You are

577
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,830
a weak scholar
who can't even carry a load.

578
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,760
And you are

579
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,340
a sheltered woman
who only knows about makeup.

580
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,320
What gives you the right

581
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,510
to question my loyalty?

582
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,840
On what grounds?

583
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,870
I indeed have no right to question you.

584
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,910
But I

585
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,400
just want to remind everyone of something.

586
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,770
Years ago, when the Chu forces
broke into Qingchuan Town,

587
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,690
they burned, looted, and killed.

588
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,240
They were

589
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,310
about to breach Yunqi Mountain

590
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,690
and strike Liya Town.

591
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,550
They even sent Qinglian's corpse

592
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,960
as a provocation.

593
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,070
We held out for days.

594
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,090
But suddenly,

595
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,080
the Chu army started to retreat.

596
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,930
Not long after,

597
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,050
talks between the two nations began.

598
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,750
Sirs,

599
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,720
don't you find this suspicious?

600
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,000
Could it be

601
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,580
that our military strategy worked?

602
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,480
I guess

603
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,960
it was General Mo Qingchuan

604
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,570
who led 800 elite soldiers,

605
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,290
fearless of dangers,

606
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,240
sneaking around behind the enemy,

607
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,840
and successfully launched a surprise attack.

608
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,240
In the end,

609
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,240
forcing King Chu to withdraw his troops.

610
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,639
I am guilty.

611
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,409
I have let down Xia,

612
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,880
let down the Mo Army,

613
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,620
let down the people of Qingchuan.

614
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,840
But most of all,

615
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,389
I let General Mo Qingchuan down.

616
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:33,940
[Chongming Sect]

617
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,050
She disregarded life and death,

618
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,310
fighting fiercely on the battlefield.

619
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,330
And I was the one

620
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,070
who threw the dirtiest accusations

621
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,340
at her.

622
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,480
Who is it?

623
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,550
Please inform them.

624
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:57,960
I am

625
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,220
Mo Qingchuan.

626
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,090
[Chongming Sect]

627
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,080
Mo Qingchuan?

628
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,040
[Order]

629
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:17,090
[Chongming Sect]

630
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,190
Report!

631
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,680
General Mo Qingchuan requests an audience!

632
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,530
General Mo Qingchuan requests an audience!

633
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,020
General Mo Qingchuan requests an audience!

634
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,800
[Taiji Hall]

635
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,660
It's General Mo Qingchuan.

636
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,360
General Mo Qingchuan requests an audience!

637
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,150
Young General Qingchuan has returned.

638
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,070
Let her in.

639
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,680
She really escaped back from Chu.

640
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,110
Qingchuan.

641
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,100
She actually managed to come back alive.

642
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,660
General Qingchuan.

643
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,030
General of the Mo Army's Vanguard Camp,

644
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,190
Mo Qingchuan,

645
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,220
pays respects to Your Majesty

646
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,440
and Empress Dowager.

647
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,550
Rise.

648
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,920
Imperial Censor,

649
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,720
where did the trial leave off?

650
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,700
General Mo,

651
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,070
we were just discussing

652
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,670
how you led 800 elite troops

653
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,920
in a successful surprise attack
behind enemy lines.

654
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,280
That's correct.

655
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,780
Whatever you say is what happened?

656
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,630
It was a battles I fought,

657
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,810
naturally, I have the final say.

658
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,790
However,

659
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,550
this was indeed

660
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,480
the toughest battle I have ever fought.

661
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,840
The enemy was well-prepared,

662
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,280
with heavy troops in ambush.

663
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,150
Luckily I noticed in time.

664
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,690
So,

665
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,920
I changed our course,

666
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,340
confusing them about our army's movements.

667
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,140
Finally, we launched a surprise attack
on the Chu camp,

668
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,200
severely damaging the enemy forces.

669
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,590
However,

670
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,700
in the end, the only survivors were

671
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,720
Chen Siqi and me.

672
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,290
It was bloody and brutal.

673
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,260
Who...

674
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,400
Who knows if you're making this up?

675
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,140
It's all lies.

676
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,910
It's all fake!

677
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,070
You have no proof.

678
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,050
And what if I do?

679
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,960
I took something from King Chu

680
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,710
as a gift

681
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,140
to present to Your Majesty

682
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,480
and Empress Dowager.

683
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,320
This is King Chu's pinky finger,

684
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,520
with the imperial ring
passed down through generations.

685
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,630
Also,

686
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,390
this is Chen Siqi's written testimony.

687
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,570
Is that enough?

688
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,810
Mo Junyu.

689
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,190
If it's not enough,

690
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,800
I have one more piece of evidence
that you cannot refute.

691
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
What?

692
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,960
Me.

693
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,190
A survivor who should
have died in your plot.

694
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,850
And Qinglian,

695
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,860
a child born to face the sun

696
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,920
but imprisoned by you in darkness.

697
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,670
Mo Junyu,

698
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,730
tens of thousands of lives

699
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,160
were extinguished in your grand delusion.

700
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,330
Today, we stand here.

701
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,110
And as long as we breathe,

702
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,560
we are

703
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,520
the overwhelming evidence of your guilt.

704
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,760
No.

705
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,610
It's not true.

706
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,730
It's not true.

707
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,770
It can't be true.

708
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,230
Your dream

709
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,150
ends here.

710
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,340
Your Majesty.

711
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,720
Your Majesty.

712
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,750
Guards,

713
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,920
take Mo Junyu

714
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,290
away!

715
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,110
Your Majesty.

716
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,330
Your Majesty.

717
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,210
Your Majesty!

718
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,910
Your Majesty!

719
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,390
Your Majesty!
