1
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,070
Don't worry.

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
I will take good care of Qiguang.

3
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,920
No!

4
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,680
Great.

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,660
You're finally awake.

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,790
You've been unconscious for over ten days.

7
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,360
Master asked me
to take care of you every day.

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,870
I was about to die of boredom.

9
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,030
Now that you're awake,

10
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,520
you can take care of yourself.

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Right?

12
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,120
Mm-hmm.

13
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,990
That's great.

14
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Stop right there.

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,750
After much consideration,

16
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,630
I've found a master for you.

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,820
Say your goodbyes now.

18
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,280
We'll meet again in three years.

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,000
Good morning, Master.

20
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,630
Ms. Mo.

21
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,840
These past few days,

22
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,090
I've been having
the same dream over and over.

23
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,470
A nightmare.

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,590
My father...

25
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,800
How is he?

26
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,240
My condolences.

27
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,750
Where is he?

28
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,800
I want to see him.

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,420
You can't see him anymore.

30
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,710
I've cremated him.

31
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,640
What gives you the right to do that?

32
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,470
It's just a shell.

33
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,310
Whether buried or cremated,

34
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,710
it's just a show for the living.

35
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,750
Does it matter?

36
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,280
I could have seen him one last time.

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,910
Who are you to make such a decision?

38
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,310
The last look...

39
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,430
You've already seen it.

40
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,560
Did you forget?

41
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,150
Run.

42
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,430
What you should remember

43
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,840
is that one glance.

44
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,120
Xia Qiguang,

45
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,170
you must choose your own path from now on.

46
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,190
If you want to live an ordinary life,

47
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,630
beyond this door lies
a world bathed in spring sunshine,

48
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,829
peaceful and serene.

49
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,950
If you wish to be like your father,

50
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,190
lying dormant in the darkness,

51
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,850
to finish what he left undone,

52
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,720
then stay.

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Think it through.

54
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,310
Once you've made your choice,

55
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,710
there's no turning back.

56
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,090
My father's revenge is not yet complete.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
I

58
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,390
will not step into the spring light.

59
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,430
The murder case at Prince Jing's Mansion

60
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,070
has shocked the entire court.

61
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,000
The current lead the court has

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,270
is that it was done
by a rogue martial arts sect

63
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,600
called the Suoque Sect.

64
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,520
Murder and robbery.

65
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,850
Murder and robbery?

66
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,510
Their original plan

67
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,070
was to disguise it
as a martial world robbery and murder,

68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,360
set fire afterwards,

69
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,750
and destroy all evidence.

70
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,950
I followed the plan,

71
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,420
and this is the result.

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,510
It's been ruled as a robbery and murder.

73
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,310
However, originally,

74
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,830
the Suoque Sect
wouldn't have been discovered.

75
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,240
I made some adjustments.

76
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,680
Are you saying

77
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,070
that behind this incident

78
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,360
there are people from the court?

79
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,920
Yes.

80
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,190
The people of Suoque Sect

81
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,870
are all notorious death row inmates.

82
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,630
They are manipulated
by people from the imperial court.

83
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,830
It's not surprising.

84
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,630
A big fire can cover up all the truth,

85
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,070
including

86
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,850
whether you're alive or dead.

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,870
In the eyes of the world,

88
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,330
you're already a dead man.

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,190
Your enemies are in the open,
while you're in the shadows.

90
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,390
First, recover well.

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,750
Don't wait until you have the chance

92
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,430
to kill your enemies,

93
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,200
only to find you can't
even lift your sword.

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,560
Do you understand,

95
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,360
Xia Qiguang?

96
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,800
Yes.

97
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,720
Thank you.

98
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,220
No need to thank me.

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,810
I'm helping you now,

100
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,500
but you'll have to repay me in the future.

101
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,190
Alright.

102
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,040
You just rushed up here.

103
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,950
Were you trying to hit me?

104
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,510
I wouldn't dare.

105
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,240
Insubordination,

106
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,570
disrespect for elders.

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,159
Considering you're just
recovering from severe injuries,

108
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,090
kneel for two hours as punishment.

109
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,870
What Mo Wang?

110
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,040
She's clearly a demoness.

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Jiang Kui.

112
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,630
Enjoying the show?

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,860
Have you finished today's tasks?

114
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,990
After finishing your tasks,

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,120
simmer this batch of herbs

116
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,650
on low heat for eight hours.

117
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,290
Watch it carefully.

118
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,830
It's a bit expensive.

119
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,310
Oh.

120
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,510
Get well soon.

121
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
I'm exhausted.

122
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,510
How did it go?

123
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,990
Did you become her disciple?

124
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,480
I was forced to kowtow by her disciple.

125
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,510
You must have said something wrong

126
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,909
and offended her, right?

127
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,000
It's not a big deal.

128
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,480
I guess

129
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,800
your master
has accepted you as her disciple.

130
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,730
But I don't want to be her disciple.

131
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,870
Qiguang,

132
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,600
do you know

133
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,270
there are three types
of people in this world

134
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,360
you shouldn't risk your life against?

135
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,430
Geniuses,

136
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,560
madmen,

137
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,220
and death-defying warriors.

138
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,480
Guess

139
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,950
which one she is.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,950
A madwoman?

141
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,040
She's all three.

142
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,120
The Cicada Agency

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,980
rises with her,

144
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,430
and if it falls one day,

145
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,090
it will only be because of her.

146
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,630
But Qiguang,

147
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,920
she is absolutely trustworthy.

148
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,510
Young General,

149
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,000
your martial arts...

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,750
It's fine.

151
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,200
I've been injured,

152
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,130
my inner power has been destroyed.

153
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,320
Those damn Chu people,

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,870
one day when I

155
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,910
return to the Mo Army,

156
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,170
I'll definitely crush them completely.

157
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,410
You really haven't changed a bit.

158
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,030
Long time no see.

159
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,750
Qi Yun.

160
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,150
Qi Yun,

161
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,200
Vice General
of the Vanguard Camp of the Mo Army,

162
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
at your service, Young General Qingchuan.

163
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,720
Rise.

164
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,390
Yes.

165
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,240
As you command, Young General.

166
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,550
Qi Yun.

167
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,050
The title of Mo Army
was abolished four years ago.

168
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,960
There's no need
for such formalities anymore.

169
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,510
Just call me Ms. Mo.

170
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,720
I received your message,

171
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,180
so I left the military camp

172
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
to cooperate with the Cicada Agency

173
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,960
here in the capital,

174
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,440
gathering intelligence
on court affairs in secret.

175
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,080
I've been waiting day after day,

176
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,280
and finally, the day
has come for us to meet in the capital.

177
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,840
This is the handbook
for the Cicada Agency.

178
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,100
Take a quick look at it.

179
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,510
From today on,

180
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,120
you will be in charge

181
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,780
of the capital's main branch.

182
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,450
Understood.

183
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,480
When doing business,

184
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,740
be more approachable.

185
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,390
Don't scare away my customers.

186
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,050
Yes, madam.

187
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,650
Qi Yun, listen to my orders.

188
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,790
I'm here.

189
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,870
I order you to go undercover
at the Cicada Agency in the capital,

190
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,840
gather intelligence,

191
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,720
maintain the business,

192
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,850
and avoid exposure.

193
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,030
This is a military order.

194
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,690
Understood.

195
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,000
Has the news been spread?

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,270
Yes, it has.

197
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,150
Now everyone knows

198
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,750
that the boss of the Cicada Agency

199
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,630
is not Prince Jing,

200
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,750
but someone called Mo Wang,

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,600
the mysterious
number one master in the world.

202
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,670
Very good.

203
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,910
This way, when
the Young Lord returns to the capital,

204
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,720
his identity as an orphan with no support

205
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,960
will surely be deeply
ingrained in people's minds.

206
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,600
The court has already
traced it to Suoque Sect.

207
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,360
They should be
sending troops to arrest them soon.

208
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,160
This is the detailed
intelligence on Suoque Sect.

209
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,720
The day of our
actual return to the capital

210
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,870
is not far off.

211
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,240
My mother...

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,080
How is she?

213
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,360
The old madam

214
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,730
is still being held
at the Grand Commandant's mansion.

215
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,320
If there's a chance,

216
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Young General,

217
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,120
you should go back
and let her know you're safe.

218
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
Mm-hmm.

219
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,910
And while I'm at it,
I'll visit my uncle

220
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,710
who has risen
to the position of Grand Commandant.

221
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,670
Grand Commandant Mo,
you sure have a lot of free time.

222
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,030
Things are so urgent now,

223
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,240
yet you still have
the mood to eat tangerines.

224
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,040
Hurry up and think of a solution!

225
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
What do you mean urgent?

226
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,670
This is a great
opportunity to achieve merit.

227
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,120
If I were you,

228
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,750
I would have already
volunteered to the Empress Dowager

229
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,320
to take down Suoque Sect.

230
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,630
And then what?

231
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,270
Bring them back

232
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,060
so that they can turn me in?

233
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,130
Who said anything
about bringing them back?

234
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,550
Kill them all?

235
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,910
We've spent so much effort
gathering these death row inmates.

236
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,270
Eliminating them all

237
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,630
would be such a waste.

238
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,790
News came from
the Court of Judicial Review

239
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,080
that the area around
the post station was burned to the ground.

240
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,610
Yet, strangely, on a tree next to
Prince Jing's body was carved:

241
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,960
"Suoque Sect was here."

242
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
As if they were
afraid no one would find out.

243
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,440
Suoque Sect

244
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,630
absolutely cannot be allowed to remain.

245
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,080
Who left this clue?

246
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,660
Naturally, someone
is pulling the strings behind the scenes.

247
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,270
This mission of yours, Young General,

248
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,910
can draw the snake out of its hole.

249
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,200
And you can achieve
great merit while you're at it.

250
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,750
It's better than

251
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,240
letting someone else take the credit,

252
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,910
isn't it?

253
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,670
Does it still hurt?

254
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,270
A little bit.

255
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Be honest.

256
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,600
It hurts.

257
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
I can barely move.

258
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,870
The tendons in my hand
are almost completely severed.

259
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,600
You can only let it heal slowly.

260
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,440
I have an old friend

261
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,870
who is a skilled physician.

262
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,390
If we have the chance to meet,

263
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,720
I'll take you to see her.

264
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't worry,

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
it will heal.

266
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,150
Mm-hmm.

267
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,460
Give me your left hand.

268
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,960
Your internal energy has stabilized.

269
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,620
You can start practicing now.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,600
How should I practice?

271
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,270
Left hand.

272
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,110
Jiang Kui.

273
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,320
Accompany Qiguang
to stretch his muscles a bit.

274
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,200
Alright!

275
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,700
Don't break anything.

276
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,320
I can't control it.

277
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
If you can't control it, then don't fight.

278
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,480
Okay then.

279
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,080
Again.

280
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,300
Then I'll use one hand too.

281
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,380
Are you copying me?

282
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,480
He learns quite fast.

283
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,840
If it were my Scarlet Bloom,

284
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,270
you'd be dead already.

285
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,240
It's alright, Qiguang.

286
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,600
You do have talent.

287
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,240
What messy technique are you practicing?

288
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,200
Practice this.

289
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,390
It suits you.

290
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,550
Dawn Break?

291
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,750
Dawn Break has three forms in total.

292
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,870
Dawn Break Form I:

293
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,360
Like dawn piercing through clouds.

294
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,480
The blade moves like the wind.

295
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,550
Dawn Break Form II:

296
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,720
The blade's intent is heavy,

297
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
as if it could cleave
through ten thousand pounds.

298
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,580
Dawn Break Form III...

299
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
Master the first two forms
before we talk about the third.

300
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,910
Such a difficult sword technique,

301
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,570
Qiguang surely
won't be able to learn it either.

302
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,200
Such a powerful sword technique,

303
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,130
why have I never heard of it before?

304
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,960
Jiang Kui obtained it by chance.

305
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,720
It's said to have been circulating
in the martial arts world for a long time.

306
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,030
Jiang Kui doesn't think much of it,

307
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,290
so I'm giving it to you.

308
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,320
That works too?

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,480
Practice well.

310
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Don't go out there and embarrass me.

311
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,320
Mm-hmm.

312
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,630
Thank...

313
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,440
Thank you, Ms. Mo.

314
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,960
This Dawn Break Form I is practiced really...

315
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,720
Poorly.

316
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,030
Qiguang.

317
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,960
Good morning.

318
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,150
Morning.

319
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,790
Left hand.

320
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,120
It can be overcome.

321
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,510
When Master first
forced me to practice the Scarlet Bloom,

322
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,030
I wasn't used to
using my left hand either.

323
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,630
But Master said I was suitable for it,

324
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,550
and insisted that I practice.

325
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,109
After I mastered it,

326
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,040
I found that I could
indeed fight better than before.

327
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,880
Is there a quicker way?

328
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,940
Of course there is.

329
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,579
Practice more.

330
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,310
But your injuries have just healed,

331
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,770
so you need to take it slow.

332
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,680
Oh, right.

333
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,750
Master will be back soon.

334
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,829
I'm going to make breakfast for Master.

335
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,440
Mas...

336
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,440
Ms. Mo has gone out?

337
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,349
Yes.

338
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,069
Master goes to
the bamboo forest every day at dawn

339
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,590
to stretch and exercise.

340
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,750
At this hour,

341
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,280
she should be back
for breakfast and reading.

342
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,350
You don't need to compare yourself to her.

343
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,960
She

344
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,880
is a devil.

345
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,240
Take a break.

346
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,310
In case you get hurt,

347
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,910
my medicine would be wasted.

348
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,680
Thank you.

349
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,400
To be honest,

350
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,210
you have indeed made progress.

351
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,240
Well,

352
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,700
you're still practicing?

353
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Master is back.

354
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,480
Master.

355
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,790
Master, you're back.

356
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,160
Qiguang is not listening.

357
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,510
He's been practicing with the sword
non-stop, disregarding his health.

358
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,590
Let him be.

359
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,070
Master,

360
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,600
you're playing favorites.

361
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,680
Thank you, Master.

362
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,920
After you finish eating,

363
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,320
go pack your belongings.

364
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,880
Alright.

365
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,940
Where are we going?

366
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,750
Suoque Sect.

367
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,350
You'll naturally be coming along.

368
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,160
But tonight,

369
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,560
get some good rest first.

370
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,000
We'll set out at dawn.

371
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,590
Okay.

372
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,960
Hya!

373
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,550
Hya!

374
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,920
Hya!

375
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,790
Hya!

376
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,510
Why aren't they here yet?

377
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,240
They should be
delivering the medicine by now.

378
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,350
Master,

379
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
when do we make our move?

380
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,960
The person hasn't arrived yet.

381
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,290
Let's wait a bit longer.

382
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,810
Then let's have a late-night snack first.

383
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,720
Alright.

384
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,920
Master.

385
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,510
Here.

386
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,790
You should eat too.

387
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,120
What are you staring at?

388
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,590
Mm.

389
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,880
The night Prince Jing got into trouble,

390
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,030
I caught a live one.

391
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,750
The Suoque Sect is controlled by poison.

392
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,480
They need antidote regularly.

393
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,350
Today

394
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,270
is not only the day of the court's arrest,

395
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,400
but also the day
for Suoque Sect to receive the antidote.

396
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,610
What a coincidence.

397
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,160
Ms. Mo, you want to see

398
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
if the person sent by the court today

399
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,680
is good or evil?

400
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,920
That's right.

401
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,740
Someone's coming.

402
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,790
What you just said,

403
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,000
what does it mean?

404
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,680
Father's death

405
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,310
must be accounted for
throughout the court and the country.

406
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,920
Since the court has sent people to arrest,

407
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,070
if everything is normal,

408
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,670
we don't need to take action.

409
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,510
But if under the guise of arrest,

410
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,550
they actually intend to silence people,

411
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,350
then the person sent by the court

412
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,680
is the one manipulating Suoque Sect,

413
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,310
the evil guy behind it all.

414
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,640
Cao Ling'an?

415
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,730
You know him?

416
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,110
The Young General of the Black Armored
Army's Fleetwind Battalion.

417
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,030
So it's him.

418
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,920
Ms. Mo, do you know him too?

419
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,640
I don't.

420
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,250
Just making conversation.

421
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,240
The Xia Kingdom
is truly rotten to the core.

422
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,400
Go, Jiang Kui.

423
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,310
Be careful.

424
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,510
Qiguang,

425
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,510
let me show you my Phantom Steps.

426
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,920
What impressive movement skills.

427
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,030
In terms of movement,

428
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,000
ordinary experts

429
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,200
can't even touch the hem of her clothes.

430
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,110
Darn it.

431
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,310
Two people were actually prepared.

432
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,480
Fortunately, I poisoned them in advance.

433
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,830
What a nuisance.

434
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,960
Who's there?

435
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,790
Who are you?

436
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,310
I'm your great-aunt, punk.

437
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,480
Kill her.

438
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,680
Oh,

439
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,480
trying to sneak
attack your great-aunt, are you?

440
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,640
Who are you?

441
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,200
Xia Qiguang?

442
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,960
I see.

443
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,290
He's the one
controlling everything behind the scenes.

444
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,590
And who is she?

445
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,000
Xia Qiguang,

446
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,750
I'm here on the Empress Dowager's orders

447
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,200
to supervise
the case of Prince Jing's murder.

448
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,330
Since you're alive,

449
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,880
come back with me

450
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
and explain the situation
to the Empress Dowager.

451
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
We should not delay.

452
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,830
Now,

453
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,030
come with me.

454
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,510
Why did you target my father?

455
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,790
I don't understand what you're saying.

456
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,200
Qiguang,

457
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,680
do you want to try

458
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,140
how well you've practiced
your left-handed sword technique?

459
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,270
Xia Qiguang!

460
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,330
You dare to use me for sword practice?

461
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,510
Mobilize your qi,

462
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,070
use Dawn Break Form I.

463
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Dawn Break Form I,

464
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,960
like morning light
piercing through clouds.

465
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,890
The sword's force is like the wind.

466
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,750
No, no, no,

467
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,510
Xia Qiguang,

468
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,550
let's talk this over.

469
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,440
It was you who gave the order

470
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,510
to kill my father.

471
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,070
Qiguang.

472
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,000
He can't die yet.

473
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,830
Cao Ling'an.

474
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,030
Ambushed and killed Prince Jing's family.

475
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,290
Did you give the order?

476
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,400
No.

477
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,200
How much silver

478
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,460
does it take to bribe a serious criminal?

479
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,480
Ten thousand taels.

480
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,310
So many people.

481
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,680
All that shiny silver.

482
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,160
You came here to silence them all.

483
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,550
Lord Cao, your heart

484
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,680
must be shattered.

485
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,880
Yes.

486
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,400
You're the one
who's behind the Suoque Sect?

487
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,680
Yes.

488
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,510
Just you?

489
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,920
Who else is behind this?

490
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,920
The Suoque Sect matter has come to an end.

491
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,480
My next step is to go to the capital.

492
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,920
What about you?

493
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,790
But Qiguang,

494
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,160
she is absolutely trustworthy.

495
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,790
I beg you, Ms. Mo.

496
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,720
Take me as your disciple.

497
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,310
Since I've already promised Prince Jing.

498
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,720
When we were at Qingxin Cottage,

499
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
you were already my disciple then.

500
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,590
Get up.

501
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,240
Now I really have a junior brother.

502
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,240
Call me senior sister.

503
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,790
Se-senior sister.

504
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,640
Yes.

505
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,070
Master, Master, Master.

506
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,880
Go on.

507
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
However, Qiguang,

508
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,000
about your revenge,

509
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,730
you need to put it aside for now.

510
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,750
Why?

511
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,960
If you go now,

512
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,790
you're sharpening
the knife for your enemy.

513
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,110
After accomplishing two things,

514
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,350
we'll discuss revenge again.

515
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,400
First,

516
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,480
gain the Empress Dowager's trust.

517
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,200
Succeed Prince Jing's title.

518
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,350
Second,

519
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,410
take the position
of the Black Armored Army's General.

520
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,440
About the second thing,

521
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,200
is there room for negotiation?

522
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,110
Why?

523
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,550
This Black Armored Army

524
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,310
is just occupying
the position of the Mo Army

525
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,680
in the capital.

526
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,680
Look at this so-called Cao Ling'an,

527
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,480
the Young General of the Black
Armored Army's Fleetwind Battalion.

528
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,830
It's truly nauseating.

529
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,920
What a military force looks like

530
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,880
can be determined by its commander.

531
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,350
Isn't that right?

532
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,590
Yes.

533
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,310
Master.

534
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,590
Master.

535
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,680
There are no clues left inside.

536
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,160
And only this little
bit of silver notes hidden.

537
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,680
How shabby.

538
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,410
It doesn't matter.

539
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,310
I still have quite
a few people to deal with.

540
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,150
Since there are no clues.

541
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,200
We might as well
use this Young General as a pawn.

542
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,460
Let's just implicate someone at random.

543
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,030
As for such a filthy place,

544
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
burn it down.

545
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,730
Proceed according to plan.

546
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,270
We'll meet again in the capital.

547
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,750
Yes, Master.

548
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,070
Let's go.

549
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,920
It's been 12 years.

550
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,400
The last time I came back,

551
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,030
I rode on horseback
along the imperial road,

552
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,290
and the emperor personally welcomed me.

553
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,110
But now...

554
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,310
Wasn't the Prince
Jing's Mansion wiped out?

555
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,170
How is it that the heir
to Prince Jing is still alive?

556
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,880
Could it be that Prince Jing
wasn't killed in a robbery after all?

557
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,200
Qiguang,

558
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Cao Ling'an dares not speak further.

559
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,680
It means the person behind him

560
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,480
is more terrifying than death itself.

561
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,240
People like that are rare beyond counting

562
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,720
in the Xia Kingdom,
