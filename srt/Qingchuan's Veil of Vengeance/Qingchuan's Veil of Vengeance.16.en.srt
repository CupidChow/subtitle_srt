[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,920
One.

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,640
Two.

4
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,560
Step back.

5
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,030
Everyone, keep practicing.

6
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,240
Your Highness.

7
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,210
Lately, our brothers

8
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,410
have been training hard, haven't they?

9
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,000
Wuyou,

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,310
you were once sidelined

11
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,620
and suppressed by the Cao faction,

12
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,210
yet you made a comeback.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,610
Why?

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,860
Because I have been waiting.

15
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,039
Waiting for what?

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,680
For the sword to be unsheathed—

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,210
to serve the nation
with unwavering loyalty.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,610
There's no need to wait any longer.

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,050
The moment has come.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,289
What can I do?

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,150
There's a high-risk mission.

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,570
Are you willing to take it on?

23
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,390
Yes,

24
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,140
I will serve the country

25
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,140
until death.

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
But,

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,840
is the General aware of this?

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,240
I don't want her

29
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,520
to get dragged into it.

30
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,950
Qiguang.

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,400
What's wrong?

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,930
Are you still mad at Master?

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,620
I'm not mad at her.

35
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,490
Then you must be feeling frustrated—

36
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,840
burning with rage

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,560
and fists itching for action.

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,520
That's my cue to step in.

39
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,520
These past few days,

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,110
I've dug up seven more corrupt officials.

41
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,980
Why don't

42
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,710
you come with me?

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,170
I'll take my leave, Kui.

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,030
Qiguang,

45
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
Master asked you to come by tonight.

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Is Master

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,950
doing well?

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,430
She's fine.

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,000
What could possibly be wrong?

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,840
Why don't

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,540

[Qingxin Cottage]

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,280
Qiguang,

54
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,480
if time could turn back,

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,380
where would you want to return to?

56
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,800
Twelve years ago—

57
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,990
the moment I first saw you

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,500
when you entered the capital.

59
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,960
And then?

60
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,870
I'd tell you

61
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,030
all of Mo Junyu's plots.

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,030
So you wouldn't have to endure

63
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,560
everything that followed.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,829
Twelve years ago...

65
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,380
[Mo]

66
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,329
Back then,
everything still felt untouched,

67
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,260
and the sun was just about to rise.

68
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,440
But looking back now,

69
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,220
what lingers in my memory
isn't the roar of the crowds

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,290
nor the joyful laughter.

71
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,140
Instead,

72
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,760
it's a pair of eyes.

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,920
I remember.

74
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,380
Of course I remember.

75
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,250
Eyes that bright

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,560
were rare.

77
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Master.

78
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,860
Time can't be turned back.

79
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,170
Mo Qingchuan belongs to the past.

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,960
Heroes always rise with the times.

81
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,870

82
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,410
from now on,

83
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,280
you are the hero of Xia.

84
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,720
For the rest of my life,

85
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,500
all I want is to live in peace.

86
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
As long as you're happy,

87
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,980
I don't care

88
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,300
if I'm a hero or not.

89
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,290
I will always,

90
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,010
always be by your side.

91
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,590
With me here,

92
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,120
you don't have to marry Feng Shiye.

93
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,280
Don't be silly.

94
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
You're young and accomplished.

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,490
One day, you'll marry someone suitable.

96
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,320
There are many suitable women for you
in the capital.

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,750
But I don't want to marry them.

98
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,370
I only want—

99
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,010
Master,

100
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,150
I've bought them back.

101
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,810
I've bought everything back.

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,690
Why did you two start drinking without me?

103
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,670
Master,

104
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,909
here's your bundle.

105
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,230
Look,

106
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,670
how thick these soles are.

107
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,520
They're durable and waterproof.

108
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,160
Master,

109
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,330
why don't you get a pair too?

110
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:10,870
The road ahead

111
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,930
is long.

112
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,210
You'll need good shoes to get through it.

113
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,480
Where are you going?

114
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,280
We're going to travel around Xia
for a few days.

115
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,340
After I go to Chu with Feng Shiye,

116
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,580
I'm not planning on coming back.

117
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,200
So I figured
I'd take one last look around.

118
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,520
Master,

119
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,690
are you really going to marry him?

120
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,990
Yes.

121
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,159
There's no longer

122
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,800
a place for me here.

123
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,250
Only in Chu

124
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,690
can I find a little peace.

125
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,670
Back then, you helped me.

126
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,750
You said one day,

127
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,190
you'd let me repay you.

128
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,690
Now I've become Prince Jing.

129
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,610
I command the Vanguard Camp.

130
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,130
Master,

131
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,510
don't you want

132
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,250
that repayment anymore?

133
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
No, I don't.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,390
From this moment on,

135
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,830
you owe me nothing.

136
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,570
But why must it be Feng Shiye?

137
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,660
Why him, of all people?

138
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,840
In all the world,

139
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,020
who besides him

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,630
would even dare to marry me?

141
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,310
Of course there are someone else.

142
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:36,890
There's...

143
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,220
Xia Qiguang,

144
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,570
that's enough.

145
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,670
I've made up my mind.

146
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,159
You should go now.

147
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,140
[Master]

148
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,810
Qiguang,

149
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,150
I know you're anxious,

150
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,830
but try not to be.

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
In the next few days,

152
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,090
I'm going on a trip with Master.

153
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,160
While she's in a good mood,

154
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,960
I'll try to persuade her for you.

155
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,290
When are you leaving?

156
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,690
Well,

157
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,320
the day after tomorrow before dawn,
I suppose.

158
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,680
Qiguang,

159
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,140
actually,

160
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,110
you should be happy for her.

161
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,409
Her life hasn't been easy,

162
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,470
but

163
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,690
at least she's found some good fortune.

164
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,240
Good fortune?

165
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,400
Yes.

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
In this world,

167
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,630
how many people

168
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,530
truly know what they want?

169
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,520
Master once said,

170
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,030
"To seek benevolence and attain it—

171
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,380
that alone is a blessing."

172
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,360
[Chongming Gate]

173
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,650
[Chongming Gate]

174
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,350
Master,

175
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,780
are you sure about this?

176
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,960
Mm.

177
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,200
We

178
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,480
told Qiguang
we're just going on a trip tomorrow.

179
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,390
Isn't that a bit too cruel?

180
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,920
One traitor is enough—and that's me.

181
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,080
You were the one
who said he could be of use,

182
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,460
but now you're the one
who can't bring yourself to use him.

183
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,390
We can't let him find out anything,

184
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,420
or get involved.

185
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,350
Alright.

186
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,310
Taking down the Empress Dowager

187
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,170
will be the grandest mission
I've ever attempted.

188
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,600
Tomorrow is Your Majesty's birthday.

189
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,500
Just look at the sheen
of this dark blue-gray eyebrow powder—

190
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,440
elegant and refined.

191
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,900
And this box of rouge—

192
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,750
freshly tributed from Youlan—

193
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,660
its color

194
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,170
is rich, yet not overly showy.

195
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,390
As for this jade chrysanthemum hairpin,

196
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,600
it represents longevity and blessings.

197
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,490
Nothing could be more fitting.

198
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,260
Help me put it on.

199
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,760
Your Majesty,

200
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,450
Prince Jing and General Cao have arrived.

201
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,440
Summon them in.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,280
You may all leave now.

203
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,670
Yes.

204
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,670
Su Qi,

205
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,760
oh Su Qi.

206
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,920
From a lowly night watchman eunuch,

207
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,370
he's climbed his way up
to become the lamp-lighting eunuch.

208
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,490
After years of scheming,

209
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,860
Feng Shiye

210
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,080
really has planned things thoroughly.

211
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,990
Why not have that servant

212
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,800
arrested now, Your Majesty?

213
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,540
No need to rush.

214
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,870
These past few days,

215
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,450
he's been bribing people around me.

216
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,660
I'd like to see

217
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,500
what kind of show

218
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,130
he's putting on.

219
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,840
Who knows—

220
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,550
we might just gain something unexpected.

221
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,700
I summoned you here today

222
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
to discuss preparations

223
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,660
for tomorrow's birthday celebration.

224
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,350
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

225
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,320
I have already

226
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,240
stationed layers of guards
throughout the palace.

227
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,170
No one would dare to cause trouble.

228
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,710
To seek benevolence and attain it—

229
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,200
that alone is a blessing.

230
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,440
You have a good taste, sir.

231
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,700
Look how thick these soles are.

232
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,560
They're durable and waterproof.

233
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,190
I want a pair.

234
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,030
Master.

235
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,290
Indeed.

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,730
If she can live well from now on,

237
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,060
who am I to stand in her way?

238
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,790
This is...

239
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,700
her reply?

240
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,590
[Reply]

241
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,890
[I, Mo Qingchuan, humbly offer this token
in honor of Your Majesty's birthday,]

242
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,150
I shall sincerely take part
in the celebration

243
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,090
[wishing you enduring health
and boundless joy.]

244
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,020
and offer my heartfelt wishes
for Your Majesty's joy.

245
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,590
Isn't Master leaving on a trip tomorrow

246
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,990
Why would she

247
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,220
agree to attend
the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet?

248
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,150
Master,

249
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,500
here's your bundle.

250
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,530
[Mo Qingchuan]

251
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,990
This is...

252
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,290
[Mo Qingchuan, died on September 21st,
in the 5th year of Yanping, Xia]

253
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,420
September 21st.

254
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,250
Isn't it the Empress Dowager's birthday
tomorrow?

255
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
Why are you here?

256
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,970
I have something to take care of.
I'm leaving.

257
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,200
Mas—

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,600
You're attending
the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet,

259
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,800
yet you're carrying thoughts of death.

260
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,960
What exactly are you planning?

261
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,700
I told you yesterday.

262
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,320
You don't owe me anything anymore.

263
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
My affairs

264
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,740
are none of your concern.

265
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,630
Go.

266
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,600
Let go.

267
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,440
Let go!

268
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,770
I said let go,

269
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,230
Xia Qiguang!

270
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,800
Mo Qingchuan,

271
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,180
you liar!

272
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,400
I can accept
not being your destination in this life.

273
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,110
I can watch you walk away.

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,260
I can live out this lifetime

275
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,390
without ever calling your name again.

276
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,680
But you

277
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,910
never meant to live.

278
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,320
You never

279
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,570
wanted to survive.

280
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,870
You lied to me.

281
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,120
You made me think

282
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,000
it was just a simple journey.

283
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,120
But you planned all along
to leave me nothing but your corpse.

284
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,240
Mo Qingchuan.

285
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,040
How could you

286
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,390
be so cruel?

287
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,330
You can do anything else,

288
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,360
but you can't

289
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,670
die.

290
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,349
I'm begging you.

291
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,750
If you want to stop me,

292
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,030
kill me now.

293
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,650
Or do it tomorrow,

294
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,110
at the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

295
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,960
You've sworn your loyalty to Xia,

296
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,500
but in just four hours,

297
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,890
I'll stand against it as a traitor.

298
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,830
Master, have you

299
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,000
made up your mind?

300
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,310
Do you know why I took the alias, Mo Wang?

301
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,860
It's to never forget my hatred.

302
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,090
So what do you think,

303
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,750
have I made up my mind?

304
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,010
Dawn is breaking.

305
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,580
Jiang Kui,

306
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,740
let's go.

307
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,950
It's time to signal Su Qi?

308
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,870
So,

309
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,350
why did you choose the alias, Mo Wang?

310
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,850
What do you think

311
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,080
I should be called?

312
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,150
Demon King.

313
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,070
It's just a name—

314
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,300
picked at random.

315
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,160
Who's setting off fireworks at this hour?

316
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,850
Strange indeed.

317
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,010
Oh, and you two—

318
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,480
once the Empress Dowager
finishes breakfast,

319
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,290
we'll accompany Her Majesty

320
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,480
to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

321
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,020
This early?

322
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,880
There won't be anyone there yet.

323
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,720
Her Majesty's birthday celebration

324
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,350
is sure to be full of noise and bustle.

325
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,290
The Empress Dowager prefers tranquility.

326
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,150
It's best to go there first
for some peace and quiet.

327
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,250
What's wrong?

328
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,800
Is there any problem?

329
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,080
No.

330
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,380
As long as you say so,

331
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,830
the Empress Dowager will surely agree.

332
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,700
Indeed.

333
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,350
After all,

334
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,410
you are the person
the Empress Dowager trusts the most.

335
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,880
Your Majesty,

336
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,950
the Empress Dowager

337
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,550
has gone
to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

338
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,960
Got it.

339
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,190
You may leave.

340
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,590
Yes.

341
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,110
Su Qi,

342
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,460
you truly understand me.

343
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,680
This is indeed

344
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,810
the most peaceful place in the palace.

345
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,070
Worried that you might be tired today,

346
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,550
I had the imperial chef

347
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,000
prepare a bowl of nourishing tonic soup.

348
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,620
Would you like to have it now?

349
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,240
Yes.

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,510
How thoughtful of you.

351
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,210
Bring it in.

352
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,020
What is there to fear?

353
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,040
The real show is just beginning.

354
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,440
Speak.

355
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,890
Who sent you?

356
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,950
The one you don't dare mess with.

357
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,130
Quite arrogant, aren't you?

358
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,800
Kill her.

359
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,280
The palace guards

360
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,460
have all submitted to Heaven's will.

361
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,230
I humbly request Your Majesty

362
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,670
to retire in peace.

363
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,840
Xia Qiguang.

364
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,430
Are you staging a rebellion?

365
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,920
No.

366
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,950
I am merely following
the mandate of Heaven

367
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,020
and the will of Xia's true ruler.

368
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,500
Mother.

369
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,590
Qiye.

370
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,460
I never thought

371
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,730
that the child I raised with my own hands

372
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,830
would grow into a wolf cub.

373
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,420
Now he's biting
the very hand that fed him.

374
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,170
Empress Dowager Cao
unjustly killed the loyal Minister He.

375
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,540
She kneeled before Chu,

376
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,020
signing a treaty that shamed our nation.

377
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,670
Today, she has lost
all support from the people.

378
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,760
Cao Huaitai,

379
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,880
you're pointing your sword at His Majesty.

380
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,530
Are you rebelling?

381
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,440
You're the one who's rebelling.

382
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,690
Let me tell you,

383
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,400
Xia

384
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,070
has been teetering
on the edge for a long time.

385
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,350
If not for the Empress Dowager
holding things together,

386
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,980
you wouldn't even be standing here today!

387
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,830
If the Empress Dowager hadn't shown mercy,

388
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,480
your Xia family

389
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,720
would've been replaced
by the Cao family long ago.

390
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,260
Grand Commandant Cao,

391
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,440
mind your words.

392
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,270
Shut up!

393
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,880
I only call you "Your Majesty"

394
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
because you're the Empress Dowager's son.

395
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,290
Otherwise,

396
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,140
even if you were the Emperor,
I still wouldn't acknowledge you.

397
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,190
Don't be afraid, Sister.

398
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,360
I'm here.

399
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,310
What do you want, my son?

400
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,200
The tiger tally.

401
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,350
If I refuse to hand it over,

402
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,330
what will you do?

403
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,160
Kill me?

404
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,160
Even if

405
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,530
you succeed today,

406
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,680
once the people's anger fades,

407
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,680
the upright officials
will come to see the truth—

408
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,500
that the one they supported

409
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,480
is nothing but a ruthless tyrant

410
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,640
who didn't even spare his own mother

411
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
and a cunning man

412
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,400
who kept silent for more than ten years
under my reign.

413
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,040
If you dare to make
even the slightest mistake,

414
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,690
they will turn on you without mercy.

415
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,930
Even

416
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,210
my mistakes

417
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,550
will be blamed on you.

418
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,440
In the future,

419
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,810
if someone more suited
for the throne appears,

420
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,150
they'll cast you aside

421
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,730
and support him instead.

422
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,990
For example,

423
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,330
Prince Jing,

424
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,790
Xia Qiguang.

425
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,680
When the new ruler

426
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,350
writes history,

427
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,030
how do you think you'll be remembered?

428
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,880
I suppose

429
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,980
it's just like Yin Changyan—

430
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,790
no matter how great your deeds,

431
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,350
only six words will remain:

432
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,480
"The monarch who killed his mother."
