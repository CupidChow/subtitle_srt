1
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,950
General Qingchuan.

2
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,870
Thanks.

3
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,480
Much appreciated.

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,350
Once again, congratulations
to General Chen

5
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,680
on your promotion to Guard Commander.

6
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,150
Take care, everyone. Safe travels.

7
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,789
Brother.

8
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,150
You've had too much to drink.

9
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,950
Sister.

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,039
Life's been getting better and better.

11
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,550
Everything I promised Mother back then...

12
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,120
I've done it.

13
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,870
Yes, Brother.

14
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,759
Oh right.

15
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
I've got something good.

16
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,870
Black jade from Hetian,

17
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,350
worthy of being a family heirloom.

18
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,950
Tribute,

19
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,200
as a gift to celebrate
the birth of Sanbao.

20
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,280
Cicada Agency in the capital

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,520
has reopened today.

22
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,640
Special offers,

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,310
credit with
only a five-percent interest rate!

24
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,840
All you merchants and shopkeepers,

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,370
don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime chance!

26
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,970
Qi Yun's adapting better than expected.

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,190
Who is this “Mo Wang” character
that popped out of nowhere?

28
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,680
Who cares.

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
What are your
conditions for getting a loan?

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,000
Easy now.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,910
One at a time!

32
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,470
These past couple of days

33
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,079
have worn me out.

34
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,190
Jiang Kui,

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
come here and help identify people.

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,430
Alright.

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,030
Chen Siqi,

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,970
once Vice General
of the Mo Army's Vanguard Camp.

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Straightforward

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,120
and skilled in martial arts.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,310
Now the Guard Commander,

42
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,910
holding a fourth-rank post.

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,280
This man...

44
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,930
May need to be eliminated.

45
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,750
Understood.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,180
Zhou Zheng,

47
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,150
once a chief scribe under
the Mo Army's Commander-in-chief.

48
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,360
Known for his integrity.

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,400
Fond of sweets.

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,960
Now Left Inspector
of the Ministry of Justice,

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,490
holding a third-rank post.

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,310
This man...

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,310
Observe him further.

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,800
Mo Junyu,

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,200
former Deputy Commander of the Mo Army.

56
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,450
Beside him is his wife, Cao Yuyan,

57
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,590
daughter of the Grand Preceptor,

58
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,450
and niece to Empress Dowager Cao.

59
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,710
Mo Junyu is famously devoted to his wife.

60
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,910
They had a son,

61
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,640
Mo Qinglian.

62
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,520
But later,

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,240
he died in
the 12th year of the Xia calendar,

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,770
at the Battle of Qingchuan.

65
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,080
Mo Junyu

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,360
was a renowned hero of the Xia Kingdom.

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,310
This man

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,430
must be killed.

69
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Understood.

70
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,560
All key personnel are in position.

71
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,160
The Empress Dowager
and His Majesty arrive.

72
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,480
Dragon.

73
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,830
Phoenix.

74
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,120
Jackal.

75
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,800
These three  rule the fate of Xia.

76
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,600
Above Suoque Sect,

77
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,680
who is it that blots out the sky?

78
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,510
Empress Dowager.

79
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,430
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,020
Xia Qiguang, heir to Prince Jing,

81
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,290
seeks audience.

82
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,400
Granted.

83
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,520
The Prince Jing case

84
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,560
was not some random robbery,

85
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,120
but a deliberate act

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,260
from within the court.

87
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,250
Things are about to get interesting.

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,950
Cao Ling'an?

89
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,600
Didn't he lead
the elite Black Armored Army

90
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
to purge Suoque Sect?

91
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,510
Cicada Agency,
following the Golden Cicada Order,

92
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,870
has captured Cao Ling'an

93
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,870
and delivered him to Your Lordship.

94
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,360
Rumor has it Cicada Agency

95
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
has gathered
forces from the martial world.

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,070
Money moves even ghosts...

97
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,480
Not surprising.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,310
I narrowly escaped

99
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,920
and, in pursuit of the truth,

100
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,750
invoked my father's Golden Cicada Order

101
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,550
to place a bounty on Cao Ling'an.

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,040
I respectfully ask Empress Dowager

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,830
and Your Majesty

104
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,760
to allow me to present my findings.

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,560
Granted.

106
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,820
This matter

107
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,880
begins with Suoque Sect.

108
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,390
Cao Ling'an,
Young General of the Fleetwind Battalion,

109
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,800
was under orders
from Chen Siqi, Guard Commander.

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,950
For years, they used
their court connections

111
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,560
to save

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,480
death row criminals
guilty of heinous crimes.

113
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
You slander me!

114
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,290
Forgive me, Empress Dowager.

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,680
Continue.

116
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,120
Chen Siqi and Cao Ling'an

117
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,040
secretly formed Suoque Sect.

118
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,800
They used poison
to control the death row inmates,

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
eliminated political opponents in court,

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,360
and committed robbery and murder
among the common people.

121
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,510
Their crimes

122
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,040
are too numerous to record.

123
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,190
Cicada Agency
rose to fame in recent years.

124
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,190
Chen Siqi coveted my father's assets,

125
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,240
and so he struck

126
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,230
against Prince Jing's Mansion.

127
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,240
I...

128
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,920
a escort guard of Cicada Agency

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,920
tracked down Suoque Sect's location,

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,800
and found Cao Ling'an

131
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,480
in a bloody fight with his own men.

132
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,830
Both sides were badly injured,

133
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,600
which allowed us

134
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,930
to capture Cao Ling'an.

135
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,270
This ledger

136
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,120
contains records
of poisons purchased and used

137
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,560
by Chen Siqi and Cao Ling'an

138
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,890
to control Suoque Sect.

139
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,080
The others in prison

140
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,000
are all listed criminals.

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,870
Their cause of death was poisoning.

142
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,270
The poison matches
that noted in this book.

143
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,420
Empress Dowager, I beg you
to investigate thoroughly.

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,920
Say something.

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,950
Speak!

146
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,560
What does any of this have to do with me?

147
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,510
You poisoned him to silence him?

148
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,190
Empress Dowager.

149
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,950
I've no idea why he can't speak.

150
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Empress Dowager.

151
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,320
If this Suoque Sect

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,270
truly exists,

153
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,750
I fear

154
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,240
its influence runs deep.

155
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,360
If mishandled,

156
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,030
it could stir public outrage.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Empress Dowager,

158
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,750
this case is shrouded in mystery.

159
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,510
Only one person can cut through the murk

160
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,570
and bring clarity.

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Who?

162
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,870
Zhou Zheng,

163
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,790
Left Inspector of the Ministry of Justice.

164
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,630
Mr. Zhou would be perfect.

165
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,670
Indeed.

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,750
Zhou Zheng.

167
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,030
Present.

168
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,390
I appoint you
to lead the Ministry of Justice

169
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,990
in investigating this case,

170
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,480
to bring peace

171
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,680
to Prince Jing's soul in the afterlife.

172
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,770
As you command.

173
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,440
Guards.

174
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,880
Take Chen Siqi to the Imperial Prison.

175
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Empress Dowager!

176
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,550
Your Majesty!

177
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,080
I've been framed!

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,670
Let me go!

179
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,150
Let me go!

180
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,440
Empress Dowager!

181
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Empress Dowager!

182
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm innocent!

183
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Let me go!

184
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,370
My jade pendant!

185
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,240
Zhou Zheng.

186
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,880
Mo Qingchuan was the reason
Qingchuan Town fell.

187
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,220
The evidence is clear.

188
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,510
Witnesses:

189
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,790
Mo Junyu,

190
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,440
Chen Siqi,

191
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
Zhou Zheng.

192
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,730
If you're free in the coming days,

193
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,720
drop by Mr. Zhou's estate,

194
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,300
see what fun things you might find...

195
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,980
As you command.

196
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Empress Dowager.

197
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,950
I acted beyond my station

198
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
in investigating the case,

199
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,030
but I only sought the truth,

200
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
to honor my father's memory.

201
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,720
I beg your forgiveness.

202
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,150
It is only right for you

203
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
to clear your father's name.

204
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,010
What crime is there in that?

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,150
The new head of Cicada Agency, Mo Wang,

206
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,030
has brought offerings for Prince Jing.

207
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Greetings, Empress Dowager

208
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,640
Your Majesty.

209
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,150
Rise.

210
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

211
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,870
Cicada Agency's Southeast main branch

212
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,910
offers an Eternal Lamp for burial.

213
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,500
Thank Master Mo for me.

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
This luminous pearl
is of excellent quality.

215
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,150
Even the palace likely has few like it.

216
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,240
Quite impressive.

217
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,910
Young Lord.

218
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,960
Prince Jing played a vital role

219
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,240
in founding Cicada Agency.

220
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,000
There are six

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,750
special Golden Cicadas in total,

222
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,750
representing all Cicada Agency holdings.

223
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,320
With the one in your hand,

224
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
now we have three.

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,330
I'll return them to their rightful owner.

226
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,750
Before leaving the capital,

227
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,240
my father entrusted me with a task.

228
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,200
This spring, heavy snow in the north

229
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,240
left countless refugees.

230
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,840
It caused Empress Dowager much concern.

231
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,750
My father

232
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,390
wished to donate his entire fortune

233
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,320
to ease Empress Dowager's burden.

234
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,000
Master Mo brings

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,510
ten luminous pearls at once...

236
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,720
Then these three Golden Cicadas

237
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,050
must be worth a fortune.

238
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,320
Allow me

239
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,720
to remind Your Lordship.

240
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Even as a token,

241
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,600
a Golden Cicada

242
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,320
can be exchanged

243
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,850
at any Cicada Agency branch

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,320
for silver drafts or saved

245
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,150
to earn monthly profits.

246
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,400
If transferred to another,

247
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,150
Cicada Agency will sever all ties

248
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,840
with Prince Jing's Mansion.

249
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,240
My mind is made up.

250
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,360
In remembering my parents,

251
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,240
I've come to see all things as fleeting.

252
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,120
I, Qiguang,

253
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,030
offer all three Golden Cicadas

254
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,600
to Empress Dowager,

255
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,200
and only ask

256
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,790
to remain in the capital for mourning,

257
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,250
to find a measure of peace.

258
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,530
Please grant this wish, Empress Dowager.

259
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,030
Such filial piety.

260
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,910
As a mother myself,

261
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,910
how could I refuse?

262
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,910
You may remain
in the capital for three years.

263
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,360
Once the mourning period ends,

264
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,890
you shall inherit the title

265
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,480
and depart for your fief.

266
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,630
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

267
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,390
He weathered a great upheaval

268
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,550
and held his tongue.

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,150
Now, with Cicada Agency's aid,

270
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,390
he's earned the Empress Dowager's favor.

271
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,720
This heir

272
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,960
is no ordinary man.

273
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,390
Your Lordship, please wait.

274
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,000
Qiguang is so poor.

275
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,510
I heard

276
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,200
his mother passed long ago.

277
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,630
He's all alone now.

278
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,550
Master,

279
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,910
what are you thinking about?

280
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,510
Now that Prince Jing is gone,

281
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,150
the strings tied to the palace

282
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,610
must now rest in his hands.

283
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,570
But offering the cicadas today

284
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,450
was a strong first step.

285
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,870
Qiguang is so pitiful,

286
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,910
all alone,

287
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,480
and you're still thinking

288
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,080
about how to use him, Master?

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,530
He chose this path himself.

290
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,120
Rather than cry with him,

291
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,790
let's walk with him.

292
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,790
No wonder Cicada Agency

293
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,960
has managed
to spread across the entire Xia.

294
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,200
It's able to gather

295
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,720
so many top-grade luminous pearls.

296
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,320
Junyu,

297
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,910
the Empress Dowager
values her upcoming birthday highly.

298
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,840
Why don't we

299
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,630
reach out to that person?

300
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,960
Perhaps Cicada Agency can help us find

301
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,720
some rare treasures

302
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,080
to please Empress Dowager.

303
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,440
Junyu.

304
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,030
I understand.

305
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,340
Anything else?

306
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,840
No.

307
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm full.

308
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,250
Enjoy your meal.

309
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,390
Xia Qiguang confronting Chen Siqi

310
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,630
was clearly a show of force.

311
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,840
He bears a grudge.

312
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,130
Who's that powerful person

313
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,720
behind him?

314
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,870
You're back.

315
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,550
Mm.

316
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,390
Read it.

317
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,240
Mo Wang,

318
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,320
from Liya Town in the southeast.

319
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,390
Lost her mother young,

320
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,550
and was sent by her father

321
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,000
to study on Mount Lingxi.

322
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,150
Said to be talented and clever,

323
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,480
but always considered herself ugly,

324
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,410
and kept her face veiled for years.

325
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,870
Three years ago,
she descended from Mount Lingxi,

326
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,840
and took as disciples:

327
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,670
Bai Liang, the most infamous
rake in the land;

328
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,930
Qiu Yin,
second-ranked lightning fist;

329
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,360
and Jiang Kui,
the deadliest enchantress.

330
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,270
She calls herself

331
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,530
the world's greatest eccentric master.

332
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,840
After taking over Cicada Agency,

333
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
she now claims

334
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,360
to be the richest person in the southeast.

335
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,870
Utterly ridiculous.

336
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,310
How could such a self-promoting fraud

337
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,400
possibly win Prince Jing's favor?

338
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,640
Cicada Agency...

339
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,589
Was practically gifted to her.

340
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
Mother,

341
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,640
why investigate her?

342
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,680
Because of Xia Qiguang, of course.

343
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,000
Why do Your Majesty

344
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,960
Cao Ling'an was

345
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,830
poisoned mute?

346
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,400
When he left Prince Jing's estate,

347
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,720
Qiguang secretly handed me

348
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,920
the ledger tracking

349
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,050
Cao Ling'an and Suoque Sect's trades.

350
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,480
That filth pit of an organization

351
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,200
might be tied to numerous ministers.

352
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,110
If that ledger hadn't come to me,

353
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,160
Xia would

354
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,790
have suffered dearly.

355
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,350
I thought Xia Qiguang

356
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,960
was being guided

357
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
by a master hand.

358
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,640
But it seems

359
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,110
I was mistaken.

360
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,030
Then…

361
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
How will you deal with Ling'an?

362
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,750
He's still your cousin.

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,110
How is he in prison?

364
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,160
They say he wails day and night,

365
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,560
writing blood-soaked pleas of innocence.

366
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,480
Such noise is unacceptable.

367
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,000
Best not wake

368
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,350
what should not be awakened.

369
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,400
Inside is a letter.

370
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,880
Deliver it to Ms. Mo for me.

371
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,590
Yes.

372
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,720
Could this letter

373
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,920
have something to do with Father's death?

374
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
The whistle.

375
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,100
It can control the Silver Cicada.

376
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,830
Steward Li entered
our mansion five years ago.

377
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,030
Perhaps following him

378
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,830
will lead us to the true culprit.

379
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,400
No.

380
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,350
I promised Master

381
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,640
to fulfill two tasks
before seeking revenge.

382
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,830
One must never break a promise.

383
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,310
As a disciple,

384
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,210
I must never defy my master.

385
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,160
Qiguang.

386
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,550
Master.

387
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,510
Did you succeed in staying in the capital?

388
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes.

389
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,750
Master.

390
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,440
This is the letter my father

391
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,480
left for you.

392
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,070
I'm going to offer
incense at Prince Jing's memorial.

393
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,550
And just like that,
the three Golden Cicadas are gone.

394
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,960
My heart hurts so much.

395
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,610
It's not easy robbing the rich, you know.

396
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,970
The wealth of Cicada Agency

397
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,200
was built through
plundering corrupt officials?

398
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,790
Exactly.

399
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,930
We only target the corrupt.

400
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,720
They all have hidden vaults.

401
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,830
Some of them are absolute parasites.

402
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,760
Silver piled high like mountains.

403
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,720
Cicada Agency is hailed
as the richest in the southeast.

404
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,650
Imagine how many
corrupt officials they had robbed.

405
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,350
But with all these major cases,

406
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,550
how come I've never
heard a single one reported?

407
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,210
Would anyone dare to speak up?

408
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,640
Let me tell you,

409
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,920
honest officials are always poor.

410
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,680
Besides,

411
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,400
they're all afraid of me.

412
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Ever heard the phrase
“spend money to stay alive”?

413
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,550
Scary,

414
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,400
huh?

415
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,300
Back when\Byour father retreated to Lingzhou,

416
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,030
people mocked him for being a royal

417
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,240
who avoided the sharp edge
of imperial in-laws' power

418
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,000
And when he founded Cicada Agency,

419
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,070
they ridiculed him again,

420
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,240
saying he turned
to business out of desperation.

421
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,440
But in just ten years,

422
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,000
Cicada Agency
spread its roots across the imperial court

423
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and deep into the martial world,

424
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,460
without anyone noticing.

425
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,240
To endure what others cannot

426
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,750
is the path to greatness.

427
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,030
That

428
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,830
was your father.

429
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,160
But Father, you kept

430
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,400
enduring and retreating,

431
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,260
did that bring peace to the court?

432
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,080
You...

433
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Why are you so stubborn?

434
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,400
There were actually ten Golden Cicadas

435
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,960
that served as the token of Cicada Agency.

436
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,820
Prince Jing held six, I held four.

437
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,960
These three

438
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,880
were meant to be

439
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,540
your inheritance.

440
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,680
We'll protect

441
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,150
Cicada Agency together.

442
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,680
But Master,

443
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,960
even though
the Empress Dowager has allowed me

444
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,160
to stay in the capital,

445
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,920
she's

446
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,750
deeply wary of royals

447
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,150
holding military power.

448
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,170
She'll never let me join the army.

449
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,240
Rules

450
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,720
are made to be broken,

451
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,650
aren't they?

452
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,720
Tomorrow, go sign up for the military.

453
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,350
Wear mourning robes when you do.

454
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,440
Who's this guy
trying to enlist wearing mourning clothes?

455
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,400
Best if your eyes are a little teary.

456
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,130
Make people feel sorry for you.

457
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,750
Yes,

458
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,270
if you can cry out loud, even better.

459
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,110
I can't cry at all.

460
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,590
Then if you can't cry,

461
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,000
just shout your identity loud and clear.

462
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,110
Make a scene.

463
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,800
Let the whole world know.

464
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,580
Gentlemen.

465
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,330
I'm here to enlist.

466
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,920
I wish to serve
under the Black Armored Army.

467
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,720
Name.

468
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,690
Xia Qiguang.

469
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,160
Heir to Prince Jing?

470
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,350
I, Xia Qiguang, heir to Prince Jing, wish to fulfill

471
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,030
wish to fulfill my father's dying wish,

472
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,690
serve my country with my life,

473
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,440
and live up to my youth.

474
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,110
Has the heir to Prince Jing lost his mind?

475
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,970
Your Lordship,

476
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,400
you can't join the army!

477
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,550
Why not?

478
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,570
Well...

479
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,880
There's no law in Xia

480
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,110
that says a prince's
heir can't enlist, is there?

481
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,000
Gentlemen,

482
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,030
why stop me

483
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,370
from honoring my father's final wish?

484
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,260
Your Lordship,

485
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,350
you simply can't.

486
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,960
This is beyond our authority.

487
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,760
Please leave.

488
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,030
If they stop you,

489
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,350
use the most effective
form of communication in Xia.

490
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,920
If you can't beat them, join them.

491
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,510
Got it?

492
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,030
Come on.

493
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:10,790
Bro.

494
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,750
I know the rules.

495
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,570
Just bend them a little,

496
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,110
I'm only enlisting.

497
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,830
It's not exactly breaking the law.

498
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,310
If anyone asks,

499
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,750
just say

500
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,830
I, the heir,

501
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,960
coerced you into it.

502
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,440
There was absolutely no bribery involved.

503
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,270
I swear.

504
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,550
Your Lordship's filial piety
and loyalty move heaven and earth.

505
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,680
We are in awe.

506
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,720
Register him.

507
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,100
Your Lordship,

508
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:34,970
please.

509
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,290
You seem quite familiar with the process.

510
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,140
Everyone, stay sharp!

511
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,160
Your Lordship.

512
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,490
Why don't I handle that?

513
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,510
Focus!

514
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,840
You all look half-dead.

515
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,420
Start over and do it right!

516
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,160
Centurion!

517
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
He's the heir to a prince,

518
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,510
why is he doing my job?

519
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,680
He's lost it!

520
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,680
I got it, I got it, I got it!

521
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,590
Let me do it!

522
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,350
I'll do it myself!

523
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,440
I'll do it myself.

524
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,680
Enough!

525
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,580
Put it down.

526
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,750
Stand still.

527
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,880
Put the kettle down.

528
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,970
Your Lordship,

529
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,370
what exactly are you trying to do?

530
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,960
Can't you find
something else to occupy your time?

531
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,030
Anything.

532
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,680
Just stop bothering me.

533
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,770
Yes, sir.

534
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,700
Whatever the Centurion
assigns, I'll do it.

535
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,790
Run.

536
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:35,720
Run!

537
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,530
Yes, sir.

538
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,280
Go, go, go!

539
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,000
Yes, sir!

540
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,350
Shitou.

541
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,680
Did you see that?

542
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,030
The heir

543
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,590
just poured tea for me!

544
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,660
What kind of world is this?

545
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,920
He even washed

546
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,550
everyone's clothes this morning.

547
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,310
A noble like that

548
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,010
joined under the pretense of filial duty.

549
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,960
What's he really after?

550
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,060
Say no more.

551
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,400
General Cao is here.

552
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,960
General Cao!

553
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,510
I've heard

554
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,680
Xia Qiguang has joined the army.

555
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,350
Yes, sir.

556
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,240
Go.

557
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,310
Go bring him here.

558
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,000
Yes, sir.

559
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,840
Xia Qiguang reporting
to General Cao as ordered.

560
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,240
Enter.

561
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,490
Yes, sir.

562
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,660
Greetings, generals.

563
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,960
The two of you may leave.

564
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,930
Yes, sir.

565
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,680
Xia Qiguang,

566
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,160
didn't you always look down

567
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,560
on my Black Armored Army?

568
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,270
What makes you lower yourself

569
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,270
to step into my barracks now?

570
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,510
This is the Black Armored Army.

571
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,550
When I speak,

572
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,200
you answer.

573
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,500
I will answer whatever General Cao asks.

574
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,920
But it seems, General,

575
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,030
you're venting more than questioning.

576
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,960
Still putting on airs?

577
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,070
You used to look
down on the entire Cao family.

578
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,670
Now you shamelessly cozy up?

579
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,510
You think I don't know what you're up to?

580
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
To endure what others cannot

581
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,190
is the path to greatness.

582
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,590
That

583
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,650
was your father.

584
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,110
Many can show their might in battle,

585
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,670
few can endure the humiliation of Goujian.

586
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,640
If my master endured,

587
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,140
and my father endured,

588
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,480
then so can I.

589
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,510
Sir!

590
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,270
Sir!

591
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,240
Speak.

592
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,640
At the funeral, Xia Qiguang

593
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,000
presented three Golden Cicadas

594
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,310
to the Empress Dowager.

595
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,590
Just two of them

596
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,320
solved the crisis in the north.

597
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,830
The Empress Dowager was quite pleased.

598
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,630
At the moment,

599
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,310
he's riding high in the court.

600
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,070
Might as well

601
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,160
let it go.

602
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,200
Cao Huaitai,

603
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,400
you'd better hold

604
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,680
onto that command of yours.

605
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,270
Forget it.

606
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,960
For the Empress Dowager's sake,

607
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
I'll spare your life.

608
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,070
Go clean the stables.

609
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,950
Don't be an eyesore here.

610
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,640
As you command.

611
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,200
Hurry up!

612
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,350
If you delay the completion,

613
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,030
General Cao won't be pleased.

614
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,400
Move!

615
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,170
Move faster!

616
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,510
Haven't you eaten?

617
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,160
Move!

618
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,590
Faster!

619
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,440
Go!

620
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,920
What are you slacking off for?

621
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,380
Move it.

622
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,750
Bro,

623
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,400
why are there

624
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,790
laborers in the capital?

625
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,480
Laborers?

626
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,610
Your Lordship,

627
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,030
those aren't laborers.

628
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,790
They're former Mo Army soldiers.

629
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,590
Stubborn fools, the lot of them.

630
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,030
They offended General Cao,

631
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,690
so besides regular training,

632
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,350
they're also forced
to do all the dirty, backbreaking work.

633
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,070
What's the point of all this suffering?
