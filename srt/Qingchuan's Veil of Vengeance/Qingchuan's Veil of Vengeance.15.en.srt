1
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,820
[Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance]

2
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,120
Mo Qingchuan!

3
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,789
At this very moment back then,

4
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,230
what were you thinking?

5
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,470
You show up in my dreams like this,

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,289
do you think I'd feel guilty?

7
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,170
Golden bricks.

8
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,500
Glazed tiles.

9
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,479
The phoenix perches high in Qiwu Palace.

10
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,530
I will not become like you.

11
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,840
The capital

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,190
will never become another Qingchuan.

13
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,870
Confucius speaks of benevolence.

14
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,350
Mencius speaks of righteousness.

15
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,710
But those are all just empty words!

16
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,479
That path to death,

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,770
go walk it alone.

18
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,080
Xia

19
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,470
will never sink with you.

20
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,470
Kill.

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,080
Your Majesty,

22
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,600
you had another nightmare.

23
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,520
Su Qi.

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,750
Send my order.

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Chu and Xia shall begin peace talks.

26
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,480
Mo Qingchuan,

27
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,520
by imperial decree,

28
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,040
will be married off.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,030
By the emperor's decree,

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,630
Mo Qingchuan is granted the title
of Princess Huayao,

31
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,700
betrothed to Prince Feng Shiye of Chu.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,520
This matter is of great importance.

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,910
The princess is expected to
fulfill her duty

34
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,420
to promote friendship
between our two nations.

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,630
Respect this.

36
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,440
General Qingchuan,

37
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,120
receive the imperial decree.

38
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,240
Prince Jing, what is the meaning of this?

39
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,720
Your Majesty, please grant me one request.

40
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,490
How

41
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,690
is Master?

42
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,620
Are you here to congratulate me?

43
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,110
No.

44
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Then it's on behalf of your Xia,

45
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,350
to comfort me, the tribute?

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,560
Master,

47
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,100
I...

48
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,500
Didn't you always want to know

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,510
what deal I had with Feng Shiye?

50
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,050
He promised to kill all my enemies,

51
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,280
and I would marry him in return.

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,909
But now,

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,580
he's allied with my enemies,

54
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,720
used me as a pawn

55
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,900
and manipulated me at will.

56
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,080
So I will...

57
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,130
turn the whole game upside down.

58
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,260
Master,

59
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,190
what are you planning?

60
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,640
I, Mo Qingchuan,

61
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,640
once led thousands of troops

62
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,790
to crush enemy camps.

63
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,880
I once charged alone

64
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,880
and took an enemy general's head.

65
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,550
But now,

66
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,250
even if all I have left is a broken body,

67
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,870
even if a thousand stand in my way,

68
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,990
nothing can stop me

69
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,130
from killing them.

70
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,790
Master,

71
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,880
Doctor Fang Du said

72
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,510
you can't use
your inner power easily anymore.

73
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,890
Forgive me,

74
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,360
but I can't let you leave.

75
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,970
You're stopping me?

76
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,870
Yes.

77
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,650
The Empress Dowager is guilty.

78
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,220
But she holds great power.

79
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,040
If anything happens to her suddenly,

80
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,050
internal chaos

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,090
will drag Xia down.

82
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,550
Then,

83
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,620
enemies from all sides
will seize the chance.

84
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,240
Xia will...

85
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,040
Do you think I care about that?

86
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,060
Step aside!

87
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,090
Master,

88
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,110
please wait a little longer.

89
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,170
-I will...
-I've waited long enough.

90
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,950
Long enough to see clearly.

91
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,950
Justice

92
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,580
has never come by waiting.

93
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,200
Mo Junyu!

94
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,750
If that's the case,

95
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,160
Master's name

96
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,970
will be together with him

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,490
recorded in the annals
of traitors by the court historians.

98
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,520
Does that

99
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,620
not matter to you?

100
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:33,920
Guards!

101
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,730
The Vanguard Camp of the Mo Army
has surrounded this place.

102
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,140
If you want to leave,

103
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,690
you'll have to step over their

104
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,900
and...

105
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,530
my corpses.

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
Master!

107
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,870
You've really grown up.

108
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,910
Prince Jing.

109
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,120
The one I once saved with my own hands,

110
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,890
has become the blade turned against me.

111
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,320
Master, please don't.

112
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,750
Qiguang,

113
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,060
just give in for once.

114
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,510
In terms of personal relationships,

115
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,120
I am your disciple.

116
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,070
In terms of duty,

117
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm a citizen of Xia.

118
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,130
And more importantly,
I'm Prince Jing who protects the people.

119
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,060
No matter from which perspective,

120
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,100
I cannot allow you to leave.

121
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,070
Prince Jing,

122
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,310
come.

123
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,150
Use the Dawn Break I taught you

124
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,490
to kill me.

125
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,280
Take my head

126
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,020
to claim your reward
from the Empress Dowager

127
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,530
and to report that

128
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,990
the traitor Mo Qingchuan
has been executed!

129
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,170
What?

130
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,670
You want to take the blame
for the Empress Dowager?

131
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,400
No.

132
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,070
Qiguang disobeyed Master

133
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,010
and should be punished.

134
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,080
Very well.

135
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,090
Don't!

136
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,970
Do you think I will show mercy?

137
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,460
Master,

138
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,920
I have ordered

139
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,470
that if this door is opened,

140
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,820
no matter who it is,

141
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,850
released the arrows

142
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,410
and kill him.

143
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,550
Fine.

144
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,200
Dying at the hands of the Mo Army

145
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,370
would be a fitting end.

146
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,200
The Breakthrough Unit of
the Mo Army's Vanguard Camp

147
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,060
awaits General Mo's inspection.

148
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,630
These brothers

149
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,100
have all enlisted
because of General Mo's reputation.

150
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,870
They were just standing guard outside.

151
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,400
They were so excited
that they dared not move.

152
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,220
Knowing General Mo has returned,

153
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,340
my grandma sold our only cow

154
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,220
for me to join the army.

155
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,000
This armor I'm wearing

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,270
was worn by my father when he fought

157
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,230
alongside the old General Mo.

158
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,660
He told me to ask if you still remember

159
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,910
Cui, the cook.

160
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,130
It's okay if you don't remember.

161
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,290
His son is here.

162
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,450
Zhang‘s son is here.

163
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,520
Li‘s son is here.

164
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,430
Wang‘s son is here too.

165
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,970
Zhao‘s son is here too.

166
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,000
Song‘s son is here too.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,080
Yin‘s son is here as well.

168
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Lv‘s son has arrived too.

169
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,550
I am Song.

170
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,680
General Qingchuan.

171
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,450
Master...

172
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,400
Your arrow

173
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,810
hit the bullseye.

174
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,500
[Mo's Mansion]

175
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,270
Prince Jing,

176
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,930
is it true

177
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,470
that Her Majesty is sending the General

178
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,830
to marry into Chu?

179
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,370
It's trash.

180
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,430
It's not as good as our Chu's wine.

181
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,660
Not as good as...

182
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,080
Not as good as our Chu's wine.

183
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,170
You old fool!

184
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,180
Are you blind?

185
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,530
Please, Sir, spare my life.

186
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,690
Spare me.

187
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,550
What an obedient dog.

188
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,190
That's right.

189
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,280
Yes.

190
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,930
That's how you should beg for mercy.

191
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,710
Scum from Xia.

192
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,080
You...

193
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,480
You're asking for death!

194
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,010
Murder!

195
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,190
Murder!

196
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,950
[[Mo's Mansion]

197
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,320
Murder! Murder!

198
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,320
Xia‘s slaves should all die.

199
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,850
All of them.

200
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,390

201
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,750
Shitou.

202
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,730
You killed him?

203
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,810
Pah!

204
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,660
Out of my way.

205
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,290
Don't block my path.

206
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,720
Stop!

207
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
What's going on?

208
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,590
The murderer is here.

209
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,020
In broad daylight,

210
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,070
committing murder,

211
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,420
this is outrageous!

212
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,280
He

213
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,850
seems to be from Chu.

214
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,550
So what?

215
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,310
Can't we arrest him
for committing a crime in Xia?

216
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,440
Young master,

217
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,280
please calm down.

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,510
We're just minor officers.

219
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,340
It's not up to us
whether he's arrested or not.

220
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,850
You'll have to wait.

221
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,830
Feng Shiye's Vice General
committed murder in public?

222
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,030
Yes.

223
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,140
Should

224
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,350
we arrest him?

225
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Your Majesty.

226
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,410
I understand.

227
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:22,710
[Chongming Gate]

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,760
Mr. He,

229
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,520
you're here early today.

230
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,240
It's not time for court yet.

231
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,820
Then I'll wait here.

232
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,610
Mr. He,

233
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,160
it seems you have good news.

234
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,890
It's a blessing for our country.

235
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,390
[Chongming Gate]

236
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,690
Mr. He.

237
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,800
Your Majesty,

238
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,080
it's me.

239
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,300
At this hour,

240
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,060
shouldn't you be paying respects
and discussing affairs with Mother?

241
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,300
Since the founding of our dynasty,

242
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,390
it's always been the duty of
ruler and ministers

243
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,140
to discuss matters in the morning.

244
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,780
But now the Empress Dowager
meddles in all affairs,

245
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,980
refusing to let Your Majesty take power.

246
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
Mr. He...

247
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,290
Her Majesty is

248
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,220
trying to follow the path of Yin Fu,

249
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,490
bringing chaos to court,

250
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,820
like a hen crowing at dawn?

251
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,360
Your Majesty is now fully-fledged.

252
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,180
Why must you continue to endure this?

253
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,630
Mr. He, watch your words.

254
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,020
I and other loyal ministers and generals

255
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,180
are willing to stand with Your Majesty

256
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,400
to fight against Xia traitors together.

257
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,190
Who are you calling traitors?

258
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,970
Mr. He.

259
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,790
Do you realize your mistake?

260
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,100
Mr. He.

261
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,010
He Zhixiang stirs up conflict

262
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,670
with ill intentions.

263
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,750
I sentence him to 80 floggings

264
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,270
to teach him to
watch his words and actions.

265
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,300
The Prime Minister seems to have thoughts.

266
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,760
Please feel free to speak.

267
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,240
I have heard.

268
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,440
Last night, a soldier was killed
by the Chu people.

269
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,589
The people are outraged.

270
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,829
Negotiating peace at this time

271
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,400
would go against the will of the people...

272
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,750
Prime Minister,

273
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,480
I have just one question.

274
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,849
If war breaks out
between the two countries,

275
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,829
are you

276
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,839
prepared to die for your country?

277
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,790
Stop!

278
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
Mr. He.

279
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,000
Mr. He.

280
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Mr. He.

281
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,590
The teachings of Confucius and Mencius

282
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,740
are such profound wisdom!

283
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,330
But today,

284
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,220
there is no justice.

285
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,810
Why don't we see sages
coming to save the world?

286
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,910
I'd rather be

287
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,690
a Centurion

288
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,260
than a scholar.

289
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,020
I beg Prince Jing

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,030
to save

291
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,310
Xia.

292
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,180
Mr. He.

293
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,080
Mr. He!

294
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,920
You...

295
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,960
You...

296
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,820
He Zhixiang defied the court.

297
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,640
Death is what he deserved.

298
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,290
Do you want to follow in his footsteps?

299
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,000
Sign the peace treaty immediately.

300
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,750
Agree to all of Chu's terms.

301
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,210
My decision is final.

302
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,530
There's no need for further discussion.

303
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,340
[Peace Treaty Between Chu and Xia]

304
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,040
[Peace Treaty Between Chu and Xia]

305
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,610
Wait.

306
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,860
What?

307
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,240
Prince Jing,

308
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,800
do you have any objections?

309
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,910
I

310
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,740
have no objections.

311
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,970
Have you really thought this through?

312
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,290
This step

313
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,480
leaves no turning back.

314
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,490
Yes.

315
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,370
What do you mean by this?

316
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,150
I beg Your Majesty
to grant me one request.

317
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,640
Please, Your Majesty,

318
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,320
take over the government.

319
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,180
Mr. He has just died.

320
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,800
Prince Jing,

321
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,240
aren't you afraid
of following in his footsteps?

322
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,160
I am not afraid.

323
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,410
The Empress Dowager's birthday banquet

324
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,730
is the perfect opportunity.

325
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,610
Cao Huaitai's Thunderbolt Army

326
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,680
is no match for my Vanguard Camp.

327
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:43,880
But

328
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,620
if it fails...

329
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,540
If it fails,

330
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,960
I alone will bear the consequences.

331
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,100
Your Majesty,

332
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,320
from beginning to end,

333
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,580
knows nothing of this.

334
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,420
But

335
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,880
she is still my birth mother.

336
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,760
I understand.

337
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,090
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

338
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,910
Filial piety is the foundation
of being human.

339
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,740
I will only force her to yield power.

340
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,680
I won't harm her.

341
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,030
I'm Golden Cicada Zhou.

342
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,490
Greetings, Young General Qingchuan.

343
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,520
Reporting to the Young General,

344
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,580
Chu's troop deployment

345
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,240
has been fully investigated.

346
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,580
The peace treaty has been settled.

347
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,720
Qingchuan,

348
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,880
it's time for you to
return to Chu with me.

349
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,100
Thanks to you,

350
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,330
I've finally seen clearly

351
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,250
what I mean to Xia.

352
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,110
Do you want the Empress Dowager dead?

353
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,540
Of course.

354
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,130
She's of no more use to me.

355
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,390
If you want her life,

356
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,780
I'll help you take it.

357
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,570
However,

358
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,410
once you take that step,

359
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,520
there's no turning back.

360
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,620
What's left for me to turn back to?

361
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,150
Do what you need.

362
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,010
I'll take care of everything.

363
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,260
Really?

364
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,980
What's this?

365
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,550
My hidden piece near the Empress Dowager.

366
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,720
He'll help you.

367
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,360
Who is it?

368
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,500
Su Qi.

369
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,470
Thank you.

370
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,500
Once all is settled,

371
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,620
let's return to Qingchuan together.

372
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,520
I know you've taken the alias Mo Wang

373
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,140
to remember our promise.

374
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,990
I haven't forgotten either.

375
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,220
Why hasn't Master returned yet?

376
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,460
Mas...

377
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,830
Master.

378
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,140
Prince Jing, showing up late at night
in my fiancée's residence

379
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,620
is inappropriate.

380
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,390
I came to tell Master

381
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,330
that I've found a way.

382
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,250
You don't have to marry him.

383
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,920
No need.

384
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,810
Qiguang.

385
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,430
Master.

386
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,580
I'm tired.

387
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,790
I can't meet your expectations

388
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,870
to be the Mo Qingchuan I once was.

389
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,720
Leaving this place

390
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,320
would be a relief for me.

391
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,430
Wouldn't it?

392
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,100
Master.

393
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,480
I...

394
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,300
You should go.

395
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,260
Why do you keep him by your side?

396
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,080
I just wanted to see

397
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,940
the Mo Qingchuan of the past
through his eyes.

398
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,940
Nothing more?

399
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,760
What else?

400
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,370
Alright.

401
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Whatever you say,

402
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,400
I believe you.
