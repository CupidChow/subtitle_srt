1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,839
What can comfort us more

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,042
than a bowl of warm broth

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,879
after another long day?

4
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,884
The moment we take a sip,

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,053
the furrows in your brow disappear.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,954
Your forehead relaxes

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,622
and your lips curl into a smile.

8
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,393
Many Koreans say,

9
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,961
"I can't have a meal without broth."

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,963
A typical Korean meal

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,965
centers on the bowl of broth.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,170
For us, it's more than
just a bowl of broth.

13
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,973
It gives us comfort and strength.

14
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,942
It's a way of life.

15
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:01,494
In the past, soups were more of a means
to make a meal tastier.

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,996
HAM YON-JI, ACTRESS

17
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,598
But there's a greater variety of broth,

18
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,934
and each type has become more distinct.

19
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,071
I think the era of independence
for broths has come.

20
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,482
GAPYEONG

21
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,085
-Wow, it's so cold.
-It's been a while since I saw snow.

22
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,319
-Yes.
-Yes.

23
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,288
The snow looks so pretty.

24
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,290
I love the sound of stepping on snow.

25
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,525
I think if we eat dakbokkeumtang
when it's snowing,

26
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,760
it will taste even better.

27
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:34,694
It would be delicious.

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,130
The location is amazing to start with.

29
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,500
FOOD TASTES BETTER
ON A COLD, SNOWY DAY

30
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,937
People may think that
dakbokkeumtang is a modern dish,

31
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,605
but in a cookbook from 1924,

32
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,475
The Greatest Modern
Joseon Recipe Book says

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,277
that it was a famous local dish
from Kaesong.

34
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,681
In those days,
instead of adding chili powder,

35
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,417
they probably made the dish
using a clear broth.

36
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,486
That's why dakdoritang
was also called doritang.

37
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,490
There was a separate category
called doritang.

38
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,630
Wow, that must be glory-bower I smell.

39
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,600
-Wow, it's so cool here.
-Wow, it's…

40
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,703
It feels like we stepped
into another world.

41
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,139
Wow, the walls are decorated so nicely.

42
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,007
It's really beautiful.

43
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:21,908
It's so gorgeous.

44
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,676
-The smoke…
-It's like an art gallery.

45
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,245
-Yes.
-It feels like a gallery.

46
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,446
PINEWOOD LOGS

47
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,019
A PICTURESQUE VIEW
OF LOGS AND CAULDRONS

48
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,654
Feels nice in front of the fire.

49
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,556
-It's romantic.
-It is.

50
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,124
It feels like we're going camping.

51
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,860
I've never been to a restaurant
like this before.

52
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,863
You haven't been to a lot of places, huh?

53
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,033
I've never been to a place
without tables like this.

54
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,135
This place was very popular
10 years ago, too.

55
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,437
-Was it like this 10 years ago too?
-Yes, it was.

56
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,940
I think they've been here for 30 years.
Sir, how old is this restaurant?

57
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,943
-It's 32 years old.
-Right, 32 years.

58
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,012
Was it like this from the beginning?

59
00:02:59,078 --> 00:02:59,913
Of course.

60
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,414
We started out in the boonies.

61
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,017
It used to be located at the top
of the mountain on an unpaved road.

62
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,019
I remember that.
So you came back then, too.

63
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,854
I remember now.

64
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,522
You'd drive on an unpaved road,

65
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,225
and then go up the mountain
for over 10 minutes.

66
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,627
Then, there was a stream in front
of the place.

67
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,529
People still went there.

68
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,467
-Are you Min Gi-nam, the owner?
-No, my wife is the owner.

69
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,870
I just tend to the fire
and get free food in exchange.

70
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,940
So your wife is the owner, Min Gi-nam.

71
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,007
THE REAL OWNER

72
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,078
Wow!

73
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,613
What a show!

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,415
Wow!

75
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,616
Wow!

76
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,254
Young people these days
would love this place.

77
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,789
Gotta take a picture.

78
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,024
Where is my phone?

79
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,260
Wait, wait.

80
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:49,762
LOOKS GOOD

81
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,130
DAKBOKKEUMTANG
BY HUH YOUNG-MAN

82
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,565
When I first came here,

83
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,001
they were charging over 20,000 won
10 years ago.

84
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,070
It was expensive, but with huge servings.

85
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,705
-There's so much chicken.
-There is.

86
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,107
Is this one or two chickens?

87
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,943
I don't know things like that.

88
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,179
You're the best. You're awesome.

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,915
Man in charge of the fire.

90
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,853
How did you come up with this idea?

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,988
This?

92
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,623
It wasn't a new idea.

93
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,624
It wasn't?

94
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,692
My mom used to make buchimgae using this.

95
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,428
I remembered her doing that.

96
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,397
So I thought, "I should use this."

97
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,032
And I tried cooking in this.

98
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,703
I lived deep within the mountains.

99
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,305
In the spring, I'd get herbs.

100
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,407
And in the fall, I collected acorns.

101
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,909
Occasionally, a stranger would pass by.

102
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,646
They needed to eat,
but had no place to eat.

103
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,648
They'd ask us to cook chicken.

104
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,816
And so I decided,

105
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,852
I'll give them something I'd eat.

106
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,086
So I cooked this.

107
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,022
Somehow, the word spread.

108
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,261
For the seasoning, I used gochujang,

109
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,464
garlic, spring onions, and chili powder.
That's how I made it.

110
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,969
My mom was an only child and so am I.

111
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,772
And so I have soy sauce
that's been passed down

112
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,241
from my grandmother
and it's over 100 years old.

113
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,843
It's over 100 years old now.
We have a special soy sauce.

114
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,412
THIRD-GENERATION SOY SAUCE
RICH IN TASTE

115
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,650
DAKBOKKEUMTANG

116
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,156
Take a spoon and try the broth.

117
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,360
START WITH HOT AND SPICY BROTH

118
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,264
INSTANT NOODLES, A DELICACY
IN DAKBOKKEUMTANG

119
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,169
It's a little different from dakdoritang.

120
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,871
-Yeah.
-I get why it's called maeuntang.

121
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,273
It's not sweet, huh?

122
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,542
-Usually, it's sweet like tteokbokki.
-Yes.

123
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:46,846
The dish is changing into something
that's either too spicy or too sweet.

124
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,182
-But this isn't sweet.
-It's just spicy.

125
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,084
Why is it called dakbokkeumtang?

126
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,554
Bokkeum refers to a stir-fried dish
while tang refers to a stew.

127
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,190
The former doesn't have broth.
The latter does.

128
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:01,127
Usually, when broth is added to meat,
they call it a stew.

129
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,529
-Not soup.
-Stew just sounds better.

130
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,199
When it's called a stew,
it seems fancier, too.

131
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,234
-It does.
-It seems that way.

132
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:13,473
DAKBOKKEUMTANG HAS THE APPEAL
OF STIR-FRY AND STEW

133
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,376
-Let's get more broth.
-I agree.

134
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:22,515
Leave the extra broth here.
It's disappearing very quickly.

135
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,016
What's in this stock, sir?

136
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,920
I don't know anything.

137
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,956
I don't know anything.

138
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,191
He didn't know
how many chickens there were.

139
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,495
He is very well-trained.

140
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,067
"Honey, don't tell them anything.
Just tend the fire."

141
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,668
I'M JUST HERE FOR THE FIRE.

142
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,805
The stock is made with
whole chickens, including feet.

143
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,342
The stock tastes more flavorful
because of the chicken feet.

144
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,745
The collagen in chicken feet
all becomes part of the broth.

145
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,180
It tastes better.

146
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,217
I also add castor aralia, eleuthero,
jujube, and Mongolian milk vetch.

147
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,187
I boil them in a cauldron.

148
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:07,093
STOCK IS BOILED FOR SIX HOURS

149
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,762
I guess you like chicken.

150
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,930
I like chicken.

151
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm eating fast because the broth
is reducing quickly.

152
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,006
HOMEGROWN CHICKEN
WITH HOT SPICES

153
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,981
-The drumsticks are gone.
-Soo-young ate them all.

154
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,049
I ate three.

155
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,751
I shouldn't eat so much.

156
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,190
The chicken is so tender, ma'am!

157
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,224
It's not tough.

158
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,126
Oh, my gosh, that's spicy!

159
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,395
This should be called
spicy chicken maeuntang.

160
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,233
-We need more stock.
-Let's make fried rice with this.

161
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,135
FRIED RICE AT THE END

162
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,170
I don't think I ever ate dakbokkeumtang,

163
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,106
and then stir-fried rice
into the leftover broth.

164
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,375
In our country,
we always add rice at the end,

165
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,244
regardless of whether
it's a stew or a soup.

166
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,681
FRIED RICE, DESSERT FOR KOREANS

167
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,517
We're making nurungji now, right?

168
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,486
After the rice goes through
a Maillard reaction,

169
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,488
it is deglazed.

170
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,523
And that tastes so savory.

171
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,232
We're digging deep.

172
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,900
DIGGING INTO THE CAULDRON

173
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,203
Whenever I look at a fire,

174
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,539
I always wonder what paint colors
I should use

175
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,675
to recreate what I'm seeing at the moment.

176
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,312
-But there's no such color.
-No, there isn't.

177
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,348
That's how beautiful it is.

178
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,251
I think this flame could be
this restaurant's biggest charm.

179
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,487
It looks perfect right now.
It's beautiful.

180
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,423
I can't see it from here, unfortunately.

181
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,294
My legs are extremely warm,
but I'm enjoying the view.

182
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,764
#IrresistibleMoment
#BeautifulFire

183
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:56,068
The thing I crave the most
on a cold winter day

184
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,304
is a bowl of spicy stew.

185
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,874
You can gather
three or four of your good friends

186
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,276
and satiate your hunger.

187
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,546
A dish you can enjoy with your friends is

188
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,414
dakbokkeumtang.

189
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,849
THE JOY OF SHARING FOOD
WITH FRIENDS

190
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,221
UIJEONGBU

191
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,724
This wasn't here before.

192
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,359
But there is a budae jjigae street now.

193
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,161
There is a street now.

194
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,130
A UIJEONGBU LANDMARK
BUDAE JJIGAE STREET

195
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:28,034
BUDAE JJIGAE STREET
IN THE HEART OF UIJEONGBU

196
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,237
MORE THAN A DOZEN BUDAE JJIGAE
PLACES ON ONE STREET

197
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,473
Hello.

198
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,175
Hello!

199
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,643
-Let's sit here.
-Where?

200
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,744
Let's sit.

201
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,281
Sir, when did you first come here?
Your cartoons are on the wall.

202
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,651
-20 years ago.
-You came here 20 years ago?

203
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,154
Back then, this was
the only restaurant here, right?

204
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,389
I think there were two or three more.

205
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,427
THE ORIGINAL UIJEONGBU
BUDAE JJIGAE RESTAURANT

206
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,530
My grandmother was the founder.

207
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,899
She opened the restaurant in 1960.

208
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,069
She was a street vendor at first.

209
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,904
And after that,

210
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,007
Koreans working in the US Army bases

211
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,142
brought her different ingredients

212
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,011
like ham and sausage.

213
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,113
At first, she made it a stir-fried dish

214
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,484
so people could eat it
while they drank alcohol.

215
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:24,023
But her regulars wanted
something with broth, like stews.

216
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,093
So she added ham, sausage, gochujang,

217
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,530
kimchi, and other ingredients.
And she boiled them in broth.

218
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,733
People loved it.

219
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,103
And she continued to sell the dish
known as budae jjigae.

220
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,038
You just use regular water.

221
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,640
This isn't water.

222
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,743
And it's not beef stock.
It's a vegetable stock we made.

223
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,177
Really?

224
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,680
VEGETABLE STOCK, THE SECRET
TO BUDAE JJIGAE BROTH

225
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,882
One of the basic ingredients is scallions.

226
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,418
We also add onions and spring onion roots.

227
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,322
We add an assortment of vegetables

228
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,491
and we boil them for over
two and a half hours.

229
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,127
So our budae jjigae is a stew

230
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:05,097
made with vegetable stock
that tastes clean and simple.

231
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,033
UIJEONGBU BUDAE JJIGAE
HAS A CLEAN, REFRESHING TASTE

232
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,502
To be honest,

233
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,438
it's my first time eating
Uijeongbu-style budae jjigae.

234
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,041
I heard the ones from Uijeongbu
have lighter broths.

235
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,410
And so you can taste the kimchi more.

236
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,844
And the ones from Songtan

237
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,515
add cheese, bacon, and baked beans.

238
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,184
-And they add more ham too.
-They add a lot.

239
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,921
So I'm used to eating budae jjigae
made with thick beef bone broth.

240
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,156
SONGTAN BUDAE JJIGAE,
THICK AND DEEP FLAVOR

241
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,758
I'm looking forward to tasting this.

242
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:40,099
UIJEONGBU BUDAE JJIGAE

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,968
A pot full of boiling-hot budae jjigae.

244
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,438
With onions.

245
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,506
And kimchi.

246
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,078
Plus ingredients like sausage and ham.

247
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,848
HAM AND SAUSAGE
YIELD THE STEW'S TASTE

248
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,783
You can't forget about the ramyeon.

249
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,387
You add the ramyeon

250
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,923
and it starts boiling.

251
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,358
The sound is appetizing.

252
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,862
I would eat the ramyeon first.

253
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:15,301
Then I would grab some ham
and put them on top of the white rice.

254
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,004
After that, I would mix
the rice with the broth.

255
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,806
PERFECT WITH STEAMED RICE

256
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,275
Then I would eat a spoonful
of the ham and rice.

257
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,147
I'm so hungry!

258
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,181
OH, I'M SO HUNGRY!

259
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,758
-This is delicious.
-The noodles are great.

260
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,628
I'm really enjoying my sausage right now.

261
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,830
Your ham slices are thick.

262
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,800
It's always been like that
since my grandmother made it.

263
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,568
It looks like a very generous serving.

264
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,105
CANNED HAM, A MAIN INGREDIENT
IN THE 62-YEAR TRADITION

265
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,943
SAUSAGES, A MAIN INGREDIENT
IN THE 62-YEAR TRADITION

266
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,381
HAM AND SAUSAGE
THICKENS THE BROTH

267
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,217
Do you know the difference
between sausage and ham?

268
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,654
Isn't sausage stuffed into a casing
made of skin or intestines?

269
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,222
Yes, that's right.

270
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,457
What do they stuff it with?

271
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,427
Ground pork.

272
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,662
Is it salted?

273
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,264
Salted…

274
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,732
They salt the ham.

275
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,367
Ham is the one they salt?

276
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,969
You know sausage is a French word?

277
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,039
The word comes from a term
that means to season with salt.

278
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,310
SAUSAGE: SAUCISSE IN FRENCH,
SALSUS IN LATIN, MEANING SALTED

279
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,523
The ham is very flavorful and savory too.

280
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,125
It's perfect.

281
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:50,362
It's a dish with an aftertaste
that lingers for a long time.

282
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,464
Without the ham and sausage,

283
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,899
this would be a kimchi stew.

284
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,368
But they completely change the flavor.

285
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,970
-You're right.
-That's amazing.

286
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,641
My American friends find it
very fascinating that Koreans eat Spam.

287
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,845
It probably represents
the painful history of war to them.

288
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:09,181
Canned foods were a vital part
of World War II.

289
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,150
They went wherever the US Army went.

290
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,485
They needed to supply
the soldiers with protein.

291
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,721
So they gave the soldiers ham.

292
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,723
Many ham dishes were developed.

293
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,227
During the Korean War, Uijeongbu and
Songtan budae jjigaes were made.

294
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,597
During the Vietnam War, they made
a Vietnamese stir-fried ham dish.

295
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,398
And in Okinawa,

296
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,101
the Okinawa chanpuru

297
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,636
and Spam musubi were invented.

298
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,907
This dish holds

299
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,977
a very significant position in our diet.

300
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,812
The fish cake stew.
I mean, the budae jjigae.

301
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,817
It's a dish we eat as often as stir-fried
pork or kimchi stew for lunch.

302
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,921
Working professionals eat budae jjigae
at least once a week for lunch.

303
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:54,326
I think budae jjigae is Korea's
first fusion dish.

304
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,330
It's been 70 to 80 years
since the dish was invented.

305
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,401
Even though the ingredients
weren't originally from our country,

306
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,104
it's still recognized as a Korean dish.

307
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,006
It's a part of our cuisine.

308
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,309
That's what budae jjigae is.

309
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:14,246
THAT'S BUDAE JJIGAE

310
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,250
SEOUL

311
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,519
MAPO-GU, SEOUL

312
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,656
In the past, Mapo wasn't this vibrant.

313
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,691
I have many memories down this street.

314
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,093
I was here often
to write stories for my comics.

315
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,563
Oh, so this is where you wrote.

316
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,468
Even in the past, there were many
restaurants for working professionals.

317
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,003
There are many jumulleok restaurants here.

318
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,039
Jumulleok. Mapo's original jumulleok.

319
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,308
The real original and
the original's original.

320
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,076
-They cook on big grills.
-Right.

321
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,144
And they grilled meat.

322
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,079
Where to, today?

323
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,414
-Kimchi stew.
-Kimchi stew.

324
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,615
Kimchi stew.

325
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,152
This is a dish you can't just pass by
when you're working.

326
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,787
The best lunch menu!

327
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,757
When you ask Koreans
what their favorite stew is,

328
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,994
the most common responses will probably be

329
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,229
kimchi stew or soybean paste stew.

330
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,734
When pork and slightly sour kimchi are
cooked together,

331
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,570
the flavors neutralize each other

332
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,806
to create a specific flavor.

333
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,307
Kimchi stew is very delicious.

334
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,376
-Hello.
-Welcome.

335
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,377
KIM JUNG-SOOK,
CEO OF KIMCHI STEW RESTAURANT

336
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,079
How many years has this been running?

337
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,247
Oh, it's been about 50 years.

338
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,515
50 years?

339
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,950
50-YEAR KIMCHI STEW RESTAURANT

340
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,953
Goodness, you're a veteran
resident of Mapo.

341
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,991
-You've seen the development of the area.
-I witnessed everything.

342
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,728
-I fed all those construction workers.
-I see.

343
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,062
I fed them all.

344
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,833
When people discuss what to eat for lunch,

345
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,168
kimchi stew or stir-fried pork
are always good.

346
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,236
-Always.
-Right.

347
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:48,640
That's right. Koreans love kimchi
and rice. We can't live without them.

348
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,975
You need to eat all three.

349
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,613
We don't add any jeotgal to our stew.

350
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,349
When you add jeotgal,
you can smell it in the stew.

351
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,619
It messes with the flavor.
So we don't use that.

352
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,324
Pork neck. The best grade.

353
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,092
Our servings are generous.

354
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,963
We don't try to conserve ingredients.
We don't hold back.

355
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,634
If you like our food and you eat a lot,
we give you everything you want.

356
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,339
PORK BONE BROTH
SIMMERS FOR FOUR HOURS

357
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,878
You can eat meat.

358
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,012
And vegetables too.

359
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,515
It's spicy so it's good
for your hangover too.

360
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,551
It has the two flavors Koreans love,
spicy and refreshing.

361
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,388
Kimchi stew has everything,
including meat and broth.

362
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,764
-It looks so good!
-Does it?

363
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,399
Yes!

364
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,003
A red stew,

365
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,206
stir-fried pork with a lot of meat,

366
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,541
yellow gyeranmari,

367
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,476
and white rice.

368
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,079
Doesn't your mouth water
just looking at these things?

369
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,781
-What a feast.
-It is.

370
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,084
Everything is big at this restaurant.

371
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,719
Their kimchi slices are big too.

372
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,392
I'm going to take a picture.

373
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,461
This is what I wanted.

374
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,462
This is it.

375
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,598
KIMCHI STEW ON THE TABLE
BY HAM YON-JI

376
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,900
You two take pictures. I'm going to eat.

377
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:22,968
GYERANMARI FIRST

378
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,571
You can't. There's an empty space now.

379
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,639
#MrHuh #TookAPiece #Gyeranmari

380
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,509
Wow, this kimchi stew.

381
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,077
THE RICH AND THICK TASTE
OF KIMCHI STEW

382
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,084
-It's so savory.
-It's so good.

383
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,790
The kimchi is perfectly ripe.

384
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,959
-It really is.
-This is a hangover stew.

385
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,060
This is amazing, ma'am!

386
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,795
It's really delicious!

387
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,765
If you cut meat this big for the grill,

388
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,635
-I know.
-I scold them.

389
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,004
"How are you supposed to eat
something so big?"

390
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,641
I prefer my boiled meat
to be sliced into thick pieces.

391
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,377
THICK CUTS OF PORK NECK
TASTE BETTER

392
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,382
It's so thick for stir-fried pork.

393
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,319
THICK PIECES FOR STIR-FRIED PORK

394
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,255
We should cut this up.

395
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,923
This looks delicious though.

396
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,659
I wonder if the customers here
have big mouths.

397
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,965
It's so good.

398
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,801
This stir-fried pork is great.

399
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,738
It tastes like braised pork neck
marinated in gochujang.

400
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,673
STIR-FRIED PORK GOES WELL
WITH KIMCHI STEW

401
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,642
May I eat one now?

402
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,280
I didn't try the gyeranmari yet.

403
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:53,625
SOFT AND SAVORY GYERANMARI

404
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,600
-Try this.
-This?

405
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,702
We need to eat this.
They used this kimchi.

406
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,736
They cooked this.

407
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,905
It's perfectly ripe.

408
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,641
Try it as a wrap.

409
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,312
It's so good.

410
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,813
We usually do this.

411
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,281
It tastes like soda.

412
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,216
AS REFRESHING AS A SODA

413
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,318
We usually eat it in a wrap like this.

414
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,890
Their kimchi is delicious.

415
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,526
It's so good. I'm so happy.

416
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,828
I can't eat this alone.

417
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,632
But I usually make this in my studio
and share it with my assistants.

418
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,334
It's never this good.

419
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,335
You're right.

420
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,904
Kimchi stew tastes better at a restaurant.

421
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,273
Homemade ones aren't the same.

422
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,710
It doesn't taste good
when the kimchi is too fresh.

423
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,212
You need cook it for at least 50 minutes.

424
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,580
Gotta take your time.

425
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,048
That's a long time.

426
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,151
You know kimchi stew is relatively modern?

427
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,588
Just a 100 years ago,
kimchi stew didn't have

428
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,557
the type of kimchi we use today.

429
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,626
Cabbages weren't as big back then.

430
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,060
But Joseon cabbages were like

431
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,496
eolgari cabbages and bomdongs.

432
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,266
Their leaves weren't as tightly packed.

433
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,136
A scientist named Woo Jang-choon
bred tightly packed cabbages.

434
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,273
And he created a new species
called "kimchi cabbage."

435
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,742
KIMCHI CABBAGE:
TIGHTLY PACKED CABBAGE FROM KOREA

436
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,977
You should take pride as Koreans.

437
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,116
Soo-young, you're like an encyclopedia.

438
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,985
Do you know the lactic ferment
used for kimchi?

439
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,454
Lactobacillus kimchi.

440
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,722
I'm serious.

441
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,624
Lactobacillus kimchi.

442
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,760
-Wow!
-That's the scientific name.

443
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,897
The rice bowls tell you
what kind of person the owner is.

444
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,668
-This rice bowl isn't the typical one.
-Really?

445
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,138
The standard ones
are usually 9 cm by 5 cm.

446
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,573
That's the Korean standard.
That was determined in 1973.

447
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,310
This is a different size.
It's much taller.

448
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,978
It has more rice.

449
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,350
What type of kimchi stew do you like?

450
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,787
Isn't kimchi stew the best with pork?

451
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,788
KIMCHI STEW WITH PORK

452
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,190
I think my family usually makes it
with back ribs.

453
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,525
That's very good, too.

454
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,026
Pork neck also.

455
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,996
KIMCHI STEW WITH BACK RIBS

456
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,432
-You boil it for a long time.
-My family uses anchovies.

457
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,833
Kimchi stew with anchovies.

458
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:20,672
KIMCHI STEW WITH ANCHOVIES

459
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,274
Kimchi stew with saury.

460
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,977
KIMCHI STEW WITH SAURY

461
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,279
Kimchi stew with tuna.

462
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,815
KIMCHI STEW WITH CANNED TUNA

463
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,149
Kimchi stew with mackerel.

464
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:34,820
KIMCHI STEW WITH MACKEREL

465
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,556
Kimchi here is really…

466
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,624
It's their biggest treasure.

467
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,060
When I eat good food like this,

468
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,364
I am so glad that…

469
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,431
GLAD TO BE BORN KOREAN

470
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,134
-I'm grateful I was born a Korean.
-Me too.

471
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,703
You can't find such food anywhere else
in the world.

472
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,538
Unless you didn't know this existed,

473
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,042
it'd be cruel to not be able to eat this.

474
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,143
FLAVORS FOUND
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD

475
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,587
I think Korean cuisine
is continuing to change.

476
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,757
Even soybean paste stew
isn't how it used to be.

477
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,059
It's following the trend.
They add beef brisket.

478
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,194
Soups are changing with the trend.

479
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,664
They're becoming spicier, richer,

480
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,401
and stronger in flavor.

481
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,673
MAPO-GU, SEOUL

482
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,275
What is this building?

483
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,712
Sangam-dong used to be
a quiet neighborhood.

484
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:34,980
I think this is the place.

485
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,248
Here?

486
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,950
I think we're going to eat
something delicious.

487
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,753
Thank you.

488
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,555
What is this restaurant known for?

489
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,125
Soybean paste stew with beef brisket?
Let's try it.

490
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:51,596
Beef brisket paired with alcohol
used to be a luxury from 20 years ago.

491
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,366
Before we grilled the thicker meat,

492
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,302
we would briefly grill this
and it would be ready to eat.

493
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,203
Right.

494
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,505
It's popular now.

495
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,873
They're even putting it in stews.

496
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,210
BEEF BRISKET GOES
FROM THE GRILL TO STEWS

497
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,846
Soybean paste stew with beef brisket

498
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,549
has probably been popular
for 20 years now.

499
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,386
Before that, no one ever thought
about adding

500
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,822
beef brisket to soybean paste stew.

501
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,425
SAVORY BEAN PASTE STEW
WITH FLAVORFUL BEEF BRISKET

502
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,961
But the savory broth of soybean paste stew

503
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:28,233
and the fat from the beef
complement each other.

504
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,069
And that's probably why
it became so popular among customers.

505
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,042
BEAN PASTE STEW WITH BEEF BRISKET

506
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,812
I'll serve the lady first.

507
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,082
Been a while,
soybean paste stew with rice.

508
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,350
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

509
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,252
I love this. This is it.

510
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,753
So this is the beef brisket.

511
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,256
The beef brisket makes it special.

512
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,925
-It's more savory.
-Yes, because of the fat.

513
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:57,929
Wow.

514
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,168
Rice, stew, and side dishes.

515
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,207
This is so good.

516
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,076
This stew is spicy and refreshing.

517
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,744
It's spicy.

518
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,581
Koreans can't live without this.

519
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,516
Yes, you're right.

520
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,917
This is our soul food.

521
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:22,220
They say Koreans have been
eating this since the Samhan Period.

522
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,589
When people ate greasy food,

523
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,758
it prevented it from
becoming too overwhelming.

524
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,793
During the Joseon Era,

525
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,196
they started to use it in various dishes

526
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,331
because this is protein

527
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,800
and they wanted to consume protein.

528
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,939
What kind of stock do you prefer
to use to make this?

529
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,641
Anchovy stock.

530
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,443
-You need anchovies.
-Right.

531
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,879
I add everything
to the anchovy stock all at once.

532
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,581
And I boil it.

533
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,550
Bean paste stew used to be darker.

534
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,553
You're right. I love that.
It's dark and barely sweet.

535
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,723
But this stew tastes like
it's a bowl of the latest trend.

536
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,294
A flavor that young people love,
and the meat looks great.

537
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,395
BEAN PASTE STEW EVOLVES
WITH THE TIMES

538
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,663
When I travel,

539
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,299
I crave soybean paste stew
for some reason.

540
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,936
If I move overseas,
I'm going somewhere with broth.

541
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,837
MAY MOVE TO A COUNTRY
THAT HAS BROTH

542
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,640
What else are you known for?

543
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,075
Our tripe gomtang is popular.

544
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,209
Is that right?

545
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,845
Unlike other places, ours is spicy.

546
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,115
People usually associate gomtang
with a clear broth.

547
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,117
But ours is a red, spicy broth.

548
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,054
So men in their 30s and 40s
really love it.

549
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,455
I see.

550
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,728
If I were to smell this
after a day of drinking--

551
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,029
It'd be the best.

552
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,664
Yes, it'd be the best.

553
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,766
This is incredible.

554
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,368
This must be their main dish.

555
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,270
TRIPE GOMTANG

556
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,474
Making tripe gomtang
is a very tricky process.

557
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,612
First, the intestines have to be boiled.

558
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:58,783
For the dadegi sauce,
we use a fat called beef suet.

559
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,485
We extract the beef fat.

560
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,422
Then we add chili powder,
followed by salt and pepper.

561
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,024
And we add the usual seasoning.

562
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,426
That thick sauce is called dadegi.

563
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,998
Among the intestine soups
with clear broth,

564
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,200
there's Naju-style gomtang.

565
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,303
Our soup is a bit more savory
and spicier than that.

566
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,507
SAVORY INTESTINES
AND HOT SPICES COMBINE

567
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:33,084
MARINATED INTESTINES
GO INTO A TTUKBAEGI

568
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:37,555
TOPPED OFF WITH AN EGG

569
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,824
The intestine soup is very red.

570
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,896
UGH, COUGH, COUGH.

571
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,765
-You like that, huh?
-It's refreshing.

572
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,735
-The broth is great.
-Right?

573
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:55,240
-What is this?
-It's a cow's first stomach.

574
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,575
-Which one is that?
-The first stomach.

575
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,743
This, I don't know.

576
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,546
Ma'am, would you mind
explaining the parts to us?

577
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,816
The intestines in this soup are

578
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,585
hongchang, gopchang, and tripe.

579
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,690
-We use a mix of these three…
-Hongchang, gopchang, and tripe.

580
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,560
It's delicious.

581
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,130
Egg yolk mixed into the broth.

582
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,165
This looks so good.

583
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,969
Is it good?

584
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,971
A bottle of soju?

585
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,507
OH, THE DILEMMA…

586
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,609
-No, I can't drink today.
-Not today?

587
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,680
It's been a while since I ate
something I like so much.

588
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,415
An expert made this.

589
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,450
It's just what I like.

590
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,886
TRIPE GOMTANG CALLS FOR RICE

591
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,557
CAN'T PUT THE SPOON DOWN

592
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,292
My hands have a mind of their own.

593
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,128
My brain is saying, "Hey, stop eating."

594
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,263
But my hands keep moving.

595
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,302
Oh, no. I shouldn't see this.

596
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,636
-Why?
-Why?

597
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,738
Gotta eat sungnyung.

598
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:04,275
People say that you should never eat
nurungji and Peanut and Squid Snack

599
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,510
because you can't stop.

600
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,347
It's kind of like
Yangpyeong hangover soup.

601
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,216
It also tastes like yukgaejang but not.

602
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,418
-It has its own unique flavor.
-Yes.

603
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:17,055
Overall, they made all the dishes
very trendy.

604
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,458
Even when it comes to food,

605
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:24,095
chefs have to always be one step
ahead of the trend.

606
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,131
Okay.

607
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,366
To Netflix.

608
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,236
THE BROTH MEAL ENDS
WITH SUNGNYUNG

609
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,806
WOW.

610
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,509
A SURE SIGN OF A FULL TUMMY

611
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,144
You seem like you had a drink yesterday.

612
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,782
BUAM-DONG, SEOUL

613
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:49,587
Other countries have dishes
where you dip the meat in broth

614
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,925
like hot pot, sukiyaki, shabu-shabu,
and such dishes.

615
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,861
We're different. We add
all the ingredients to make broth.

616
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,664
We make the stock
and we drink the broth first.

617
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,099
And that's how jeongol was created.

618
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,234
Many countries may cook the meat in water.

619
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,805
While some countries focus on the meat,
we focus on the broth.

620
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,875
OUR NEIGHBORS LOVE SOLID FOOD,
BUT KOREANS LOVE BROTH.

621
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,578
If you look here,
they have a full-course meal.

622
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,646
A full-course meal?

623
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,714
Never seen a dumpling course meal.

624
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,183
Hello.

625
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,250
-Hello.
-Hello.

626
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,385
Hello.

627
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:23,788
We've never seen
a dumpling course meal like this before.

628
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,790
When you eat dumplings,

629
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,326
you don't eat just a bowl of dumplings.

630
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,262
In the past, we used to set
a table full of dumplings.

631
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,499
But people don't eat a whole feast
like that now.

632
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:38,336
There is a limited number of dishes,
but it's a full-course meal.

633
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,676
These are handmade vegetable dumplings.

634
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,045
Don't they look like
Florence Nightingale's nursing cap?

635
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,513
You're right.

636
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,186
It has no meat, but it's still delicious.

637
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,287
It has cucumbers.

638
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,523
The mushrooms taste like meat.

639
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,692
I've never tried dumplings

640
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,127
that only have vegetables before.

641
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,729
It's as if meat is in it.

642
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,231
No.

643
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,667
Hoped you'd say yes.

644
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,970
Thanks for that.

645
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,442
We use beef and shiitake mushrooms
to make pyeonsu.

646
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,444
Cucumbers give it a crunchy texture.

647
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,714
Then we make it into
a square or a cylinder

648
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,682
and these are called mi dumplings.

649
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,121
The dumplings are square-shaped.

650
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,289
This is pyeonsu.

651
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,390
Pyeonsu?

652
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,259
How did they make the dumplings
look so pretty?

653
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,031
My gosh.

654
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,633
No meat in this, either?

655
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,201
-This has meat.
-It does.

656
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,102
It does?

657
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,970
It has no tofu.

658
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,572
So it has a clean flavor.

659
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,647
It's like a pot from the old TV show,
"Today's Dish."

660
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:56,547
You're right.

661
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,854
The traditional dish is dumpling soup.

662
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,356
Jeongol is a dish that
was developed from that.

663
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,925
It has more variety.

664
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,395
It's a dish that many people
can cook and eat together.

665
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:15,133
First, we place a piece of cabbage
on the bottom of the pot.

666
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,902
This will prevent the dumplings
from sticking to the bottom.

667
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,638
And then we add the seasoned
suyuk from the stock…

668
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,179
and the dumplings.

669
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,050
And then we add minari or spring onions.

670
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,085
It tastes even better with fish jeon.

671
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,353
And for the toppings,

672
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,655
we add colored dumplings on the top.

673
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,358
Then we add hot broth and boil everything.

674
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,495
DUMPLING JEONGOL
WITH VARIOUS INGREDIENTS

675
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,966
The color of the ingredients

676
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,102
below the glass lid looks beautiful.

677
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,071
I love that we can continue

678
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,174
to cook the food at the table.

679
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,676
-Do you know how jeongol got its name?
-I don't.

680
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,612
The helmets that soldiers used to
wear in the past

681
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,982
were called jeonrip or jeonriptu.

682
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,283
They were made of iron.

683
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,151
They flipped them over to cook food.

684
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,853
So they cooked this dish in the helmets.

685
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,822
Gol means "to mix."

686
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,991
So when you combine the two words,
you get jeonriptugol.

687
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,826
Shortened, the word is jeongol.

688
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,027
JEONRIPTUGOL: SOLDIERS
COOKED FOOD IN THEIR HELMETS

689
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,163
That's the origin of the dish.

690
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,131
It's boiling over.

691
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:25,169
DUMPLING JEONGOL

692
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,005
I can smell the flank and brisket stock.

693
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,639
It has fish jeon.

694
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,074
And minari too.

695
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,577
-It almost looks like sinseollo.
-You're right.

696
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,012
Would you like some broth?

697
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,449
Goodness, that's refreshing.

698
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,685
It's flank and brisket stock.

699
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,623
5:00 A.M.

700
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,128
Dumplings shouldn't have
multiple strong flavors.

701
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,197
So for the stock, we only use
flank and briskets.

702
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,867
The broth is savory and deep.

703
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,136
BEEF FLANK AND BRISKET STOCK
HAS A DEEP TASTE.

704
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,038
We season with sea salt,

705
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,241
homemade soy sauce,
and water, so four ingredients.

706
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,745
We usually make our jang
at the start of a new year.

707
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,249
It's the most important and basic task
at our restaurant.

708
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,886
First, making the meju is most important.

709
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,154
We add red chili pepper.

710
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,656
And we also add charcoal.

711
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,893
And after 50 to 60 days,
we check on the jang.

712
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:25,396
And so one of our most important tasks
for the year is done.

713
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,033
Adding the jang signals
the start of that day's broth.

714
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:37,074
DELICIOUS STOCK IS MADE
WITH DELICIOUS SOY SAUCE

715
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,910
I really love this.

716
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,111
I love it, too.

717
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,713
Sir, this is the stock
that the kings used to eat.

718
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,282
This is a king's meal.

719
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,453
-May you rise from a noble to a king.
-To the palace.

720
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,021
From a noble's house to a palace.

721
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,725
This dish is dumpling soup.

722
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,060
I love dishes like this.

723
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,863
DUMPLING FROM JEONGOL
WITH WARM BROTH

724
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,967
I love mild dumplings cooked in
flank and brisket broth like this.

725
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,569
I prefer mild ones over spicy.

726
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,605
-This has meat in it.
-Yes, this has a lot.

727
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:12,877
A flavor we all know.

728
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,880
But you can't taste this
in commercial products.

729
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,515
I have to try the flank and briskets.

730
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,684
-I love it.
-Me too.

731
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,288
Gosh.

732
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:27,725
Try this.

733
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,161
This dumpling is the same color
as your outfit.

734
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,563
Sir, would you like the green one
or the yellow one?

735
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,831
-Yellow.
-Yellow.

736
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,534
I'll add the noodles now.

737
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,302
Even the noodle plating looks great.

738
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,337
It's so pretty.

739
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,373
NOODLES INTO JEONGOL

740
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,844
What kind of noodles are these?

741
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,479
They're just flour noodles.

742
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,414
I see.

743
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,717
It doesn't taste like what we usually eat.

744
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,318
A FULL POT, AS THOUGH
THE NOODLES WERE ALREADY IN IT

745
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,558
Why does it taste so savory?

746
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,059
-It's savory.
-It's savory.

747
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,903
This is so relaxing to eat.

748
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,806
I realized that jeongol is a dish
that helps you relax.

749
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,108
I feel at ease.

750
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:23,948
CALM ENERGY FROM A MILD BROTH

751
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,485
We can only enjoy such luxury
in the winter, not when it's hot.

752
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,289
Our lives are like food.

753
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,823
It's synergy at work.

754
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,791
HUMANS AND FOOD WORK IN SYNERGY

755
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,161
You gather various ingredients together
to make a dish.

756
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:42,099
I wonder if humans can also get along

757
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,837
and create a harmonious society like this
with a little selflessness.

758
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,175
I think this pot sets the standard.

759
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,478
I love that a jeongol's ingredients
determine how good the dish is.

760
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,249
I believe that a good dish focuses
on the ingredients rather than the recipe.

761
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,017
You're very particular.

762
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,288
A man of details.

763
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,260
PYEONGCHANG-DONG, SEOUL

764
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,003
Today feels different from the other days…

765
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,340
You're right. The vibe is different today.

766
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,675
-Okay, let's have a seat.
-Yes.

767
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,677
-Hello.
-Hello.

768
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,279
-Today, it's very…
-You're late today.

769
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,580
I'm a little late today.

770
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,849
We're at a very nice restaurant today.

771
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,052
We usually go to old restaurants
to eat soup dishes.

772
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,288
But today, we're at a hotel.

773
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,691
It feels very elegant.

774
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,967
-Hello.
-Hello.

775
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,836
Hello.

776
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,544
Broth usually refers to the liquid
in which all the ingredients

777
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,914
are boiled in to create a dish.

778
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,284
But I wanted to show that

779
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,653
the broth alone

780
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,590
could be a dish that we can enjoy.

781
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,526
The overall theme of the course meal is

782
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,461
"the independence of broth."

783
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,565
All we did is drink broth
for the past two, no, three months.

784
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,768
-That's all we've been having.
-So I hear.

785
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:28,706
-Is it some kind of broth today too?
-It's another dish with broth today.

786
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:29,840
Why do we have these?

787
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,909
I know, right? I think we only need this.

788
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,077
You need those.

789
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,078
-Really?
-We do?

790
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,913
-Are we slicing up broth?
-Yes.

791
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,883
It's a dish that requires
a fork and a knife for the broth.

792
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,718
The soup must have solid ingredients.

793
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,719
How fascinating.

794
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,087
Something's coming.

795
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,522
Already?

796
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,293
Wow.

797
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,227
Wow.

798
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,530
WHAT IS THIS DISH?

799
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:53,831
Wow.

800
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,566
You've never seen anything
like this before, right?

801
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,467
CHOPPED SEAWEED SOUP

802
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,868
Is this a broth too?

803
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:58,869
It is.

804
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,475
I made seaweed soup.

805
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:10,081
The idea is for people to taste
the original flavors but with a twist.

806
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:13,050
What I wanted to add was texture.

807
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,385
SEAWEED SOUP WITH A NEW TEXTURE

808
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,954
This technique is called spherification.

809
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,956
The broth is made into a sphere

810
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,893
and that is slightly hardened
on the surface.

811
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,565
You can use a knife or fork

812
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:31,135
to eat it with the seaweed and beef.

813
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,904
When you use a spoon to eat this,

814
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,841
you can taste the rich flavor

815
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,478
of a beef seaweed soup.

816
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,148
Pop the yolk-shaped broth.

817
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,884
Mix it well and then try it.

818
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,622
Unbelievable.

819
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,559
This is something people
would come to try.

820
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,661
Foreigners would find this
very fascinating.

821
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,863
Wow, it looks amazing.

822
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,472
It tastes like steamed cheongpo.

823
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,609
The black stuff surrounding it is seaweed.

824
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,644
This is good.

825
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,216
Savor the texture.

826
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,454
How is it? The seaweed soup?

827
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,922
-It's delicious.
-It's good?

828
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,792
It's a delicious bowl of seaweed soup.

829
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,493
-It's good.
-Very well cooked.

830
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,932
-What'll be next?
-We'll be full just from broth.

831
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,443
1, 2, 3. Ta-da!

832
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:46,710
-What is this?
-What is it?

833
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,745
It's foam.

834
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,879
It's foam.

835
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:54,552
FOAM SOYBEAN PASTE SOUP

836
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,554
I used soybean paste

837
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,391
to make a dish that's foamy
like a cappuccino.

838
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,629
After making a savory bowl of
soybean paste stew,

839
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:09,834
I strain that and add a protein

840
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,336
called lecithin.

841
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,637
Then I beat it to make it foamy.

842
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,705
By making it foamy,

843
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,676
people can enjoy the strong flavor
of soybean paste

844
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:23,047
and the soft texture of the foam
as it goes into their mouths.

845
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,449
They can savor the rich flavor
of soybean paste

846
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,886
in a simple yet new and interesting way

847
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,522
through this soybean paste stew.

848
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:35,793
There are different textures
when it comes to food.

849
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,662
A foam like this allows people

850
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,298
to enjoy the softest

851
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,400
and smoothest texture you can eat.

852
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,736
We may be used to

853
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,505
the flavor of soybean paste.

854
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:51,008
But to Westerners, it can be
a very strong flavor.

855
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,610
The aroma is incredible.

856
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,913
I never imagined that soybean paste
could have such an amazing aroma.

857
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,221
I understand
what "broth texture" means now.

858
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,023
The broth's texture.

859
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,893
He only made it foamy,
but it feels completely different.

860
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,194
It tastes different too.

861
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,031
The broth has bubbles
just like our economy.

862
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,566
THE BROTH HAS BUBBLES
JUST LIKE OUR ECONOMY

863
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:23,541
POLLACK STEW EATEN AS CHIPS

864
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,075
Is this some kind of broth too?

865
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,477
-I don't think it is.
-This time,

866
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,680
-I made the broth into chips.
-Yes?

867
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,048
-This?
-Yes.

868
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,349
-Chips.
-Yes.

869
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,420
-This is broth?
-Try it, sir.

870
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,158
One of the most popular dishes

871
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,127
is fresh pollack soup or seafood soup.

872
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,162
POLLACK STEW, LOVED BY KOREANS

873
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:49,700
I used the fresh pollack stock
to make chips.

874
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,504
I made it like a biscuit.

875
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,539
BAKED IN THE OVEN
TO MAKE THE BROTH CRISPY

876
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,877
When you eat just the biscuit,

877
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,346
the flavor can be slightly strong.

878
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,949
But even just a bite

879
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,318
will allow you to taste

880
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,787
the very rich flavor
of a fresh pollack soup.

881
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,889
And when you eat

882
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,224
the radish and grilled fish

883
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,460
that are served with the chips,

884
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,463
you will be able to enjoy

885
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,399
a pot full of fresh pollack soup
that was boiled for a long time.

886
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,139
It's seasoned well with salt.

887
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,341
CRUNCH

888
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,345
Yum, this is delicious.

889
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,880
Why don't you try all three together?

890
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:38,816
Like this.

891
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:49,760
I am starting to have
a lot of questions about broth now.

892
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:53,697
-"Do I really know what broth is?"
-Life is full of mysteries.

893
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,869
CRUNCHY SAMGYETANG

894
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,838
Wow, it's so pretty.

895
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,174
Those are chips made from samgyetang.

896
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,711
SAVORY SAMGYETANG MADE
INTO CRISPY CHIPS

897
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,781
I added this on top.

898
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,455
IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS

899
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,359
All kinds of textures are exploding
simultaneously in my mouth!

900
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,698
When I eat samgyetang,

901
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,101
I love how smoothly
it goes down my throat.

902
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,804
But I thought that it might be great

903
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,906
if there was some crunch to it too.

904
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,308
I take the samgyetang broth

905
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,311
and the chicken and blend them

906
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,815
to turn the mix into a crispy chip.

907
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,517
That is added to the dish.

908
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,518
You break that up

909
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,853
eat everything together.

910
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,589
The chip itself tastes like samgyetang

911
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,726
so it will taste like
a concentrated samgyetang

912
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,128
with an interesting texture.

913
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,697
That's what this dish is.

914
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,735
This is too pretty.

915
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,173
-Wow.
-Do we finally have noodles?

916
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,210
This is broth.

917
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,480
I'm not falling for that now.

918
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,449
I know what to draw today.

919
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,885
I made all kinds of dishes.

920
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,556
This is like a big blockbuster.

921
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,725
YUKGAEJANG KALGUKSU

922
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,293
Yukgaejang kalguksu.

923
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,061
I put the broth in the noodles.

924
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,730
I created this dish because

925
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,432
I thought it'd be interesting for people

926
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:38,168
to feel like they're eating
a soup while eating noodles.

927
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,505
After making a delicious pot of
yukgaejang…

928
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,911
I use a long syringe and insert the broth
into a long tube

929
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,749
to make it into a jelly.

930
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,052
By doing that,

931
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,354
I can make the jelly in the form
of a noodle.

932
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,892
YUKGAEJANG BROTH
MADE INTO JELLY NOODLES

933
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,263
I made the chili oil into a powder.

934
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,599
And that can be sprinkled
on the top at the end.

935
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,868
When you mix everything together,

936
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:14,538
you'll feel like you're eating
a spicy and refreshing bowl

937
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,840
of yukgaejang kalguksu.

938
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,714
All these dishes taste so good.

939
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,915
They're all delicious.

940
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,717
The savory flavor is so concentrated.

941
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,219
The last dish is gukbap.

942
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,220
Will we get rice too?

943
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,388
It's gukbap.

944
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,190
But it's a gukbap without rice.

945
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,326
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?

946
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,562
Does he think we're fools?

947
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,774
-What is this?
-Tapioca pearls?

948
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,643
GUKBAP WITHOUT RICE

949
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,215
The broth from the gukbap

950
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,617
is used to make

951
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,820
many small balls that look like caviar.

952
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,688
I wanted to recreate the broth

953
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,958
to look like the rice in gukbap.

954
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:13,130
Some people add kkakdugi or kkakdugi juice

955
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,965
to the gukbap when they eat.

956
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,167
So I diced up some kkakdugi

957
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,669
and added them to the bottom.

958
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:24,174
DIFFERENT LOOK
BUT THE SAME TASTE OF GUKBAP

959
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,815
It even has kimchi in the middle.

960
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,156
This tastes the best
out of all the dishes.

961
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,998
So this is why it's called gukbap.

962
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:53,036
GUKBAP REBORN BY A NEW IDEA

963
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,673
I was so shocked that day.

964
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,309
"This is nothing like the broths
that I know."

965
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,345
It was really fun. It really was.

966
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,080
It was a fun experience.

967
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:07,751
"But broths taste best
when they're in their original form."

968
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,721
That's what I thought
after trying those dishes.

969
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,390
We tried nearly
all of the soups in the nation.

970
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,858
I know there are more.

971
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,894
But we ate all the famous ones.

972
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,097
There are probably many lesser known soups

973
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,066
in places that we don't know.

974
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,136
Some random island
probably has unknown dishes.

975
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:27,070
You're right.

976
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,973
I'm finally getting an idea
of what a soup is.

977
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,609
I think I know how to enjoy a broth now.

978
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,112
And I learned just how important
this is to me.

979
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,815
Recently, I haven't been eating any soups.

980
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,183
But through this program,

981
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,821
we ate soups

982
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,857
that warmed up our bodies

983
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,593
so I've grown fond of soups.

984
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,665
In the 18th century,

985
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:59,403
when our Joseon kings ate,

986
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:04,408
they had 64 different kinds of soups.

987
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,878
But we don't know most of them now.
We don't even remember them.

988
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,715
MANY TYPES OF BROTHS ARE
NO LONGER REMEMBERED

989
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,818
But I think that we should at least know

990
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,454
that they existed.

991
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,891
I hope that many of those dishes
will be recreated

992
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,562
so that we can continue the tradition.

993
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,931
I didn't know we had
so many soups in the country.

994
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,299
There is such a variety.

995
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,568
And based on each region's
characteristics,

996
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:35,105
different soup dishes were developed

997
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,541
using ingredients and recipes
from that region.

998
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:41,845
It was very fun to experience
all that too.

999
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,414
It made me wish

1000
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,818
that I had more opportunities
to encounter these dishes often.

1001
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:51,054
To be honest, I thought only people

1002
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,824
older than 30 or 40 liked broth.

1003
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,093
But it's not just for older folks.

1004
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,629
Kids eat ramyeon with triangle gimbap
at convenience stores.

1005
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,232
And they'll probably want broth
even when they're older.

1006
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,901
This shows that

1007
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,738
all generations love broth.

1008
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,374
There's a saying that Koreans
need rice to carry on with life.

1009
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,477
A thought occurred to me
while we were on this gukbap trip.

1010
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,713
Soup is actually what kept us going.

1011
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,817
Soup is the great force
that makes us eat rice.

1012
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,253
Because we had soup,
we had the strength to carry on.

1013
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,655
Take gukbap as an example.

1014
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:26,923
It's soup and rice.

1015
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,860
It made me think that

1016
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,561
soup is what empowers us.

1017
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:45,509
THE POWER OF BROTH,
ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE PEOPLE

1018
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:29,386
