1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,905
What can comfort us more

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:08,875
than a bowl of warm broth

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,779
after another long day?

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,851
The moment we take a sip,

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,953
the furrows in your brow disappear.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,622
Your forehead relaxes
and your lips curl into a smile.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,961
Many Koreans say,
"I can't have a meal without broth."

8
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,965
A typical Korean meal
centers on the bowl of broth.

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,003
For us, it's more than
just a bowl of broth.

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,973
It gives us comfort and strength.

11
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,942
It's a way of life.

12
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,727
The ferment in kimchi is called

13
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,028
lactobacillus.

14
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,064
There's more myoglobin…

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,698
Frankfurt wurst…

16
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,400
You're a walking encyclopedia.

17
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,703
RYU SOO-YOUNG, A CLEVER FOODIE

18
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,641
It's so good.

19
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,910
It gets my blood flowing.

20
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,778
My fatigue washes away.

21
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,681
All your problems go away
with this one bowl.

22
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,216
HAM YON-JI, A CHEERFUL FOODIE

23
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,186
I'm from a noble family.
I never mix rice with broth.

24
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,554
I never run in the rain.

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,989
The slight fishy taste is the charm.

26
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,291
It's the best.

27
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,026
The fishy taste is a type of flavor.

28
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,094
HUH YOUNG-MAN, A STRICT FOODIE

29
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,233
This time we're on a broth journey.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,134
RYU SOO-YOUNG, ACTOR

31
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,270
Certain regions are birthplaces of broth.

32
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,506
Other cities are known for certain types.

33
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,209
We'll visit each site.
But first, we went to Jeju Island.

34
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,443
LET'S GO ON A BROTH JOURNEY

35
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,882
JEJU ISLAND

36
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,988
JEJU, A BEAUTIFUL GEM IN THE SOUTH

37
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,257
THE AZURE SEA AND THE ISLAND'S
TALE OF UNIQUE BROTHS

38
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,826
Whenever I go to Seogwipo,

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,628
I go to this restaurant…

40
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,530
FIRST UP, GOURMET HUH'S
SHORT-LISTED HANGOVER SOUP HOUSE

41
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,232
…for my morning hangovers.

42
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,266
SEOGWIPO

43
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,667
The broth is so good.

44
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,802
-Radish soup?
-Red tilefish.

45
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,770
A red tilefish radish soup?

46
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:18,838
-That's new.
-You never tried?

47
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:19,806
Nope, never.

48
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,275
I haven't even tried cutlassfish soup.

49
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,444
I haven't tried anything
we're having today.

50
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,246
You're the ideal cast member.

51
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,314
HAM YON-JI, THE IDEAL CANDIDATE

52
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,215
It's so good.

53
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,885
The slightly fishy taste is its charm.

54
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,188
-It's not for everyone, is it?
-Difficult to make.

55
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,423
-A gourmet menu.
-Might be an acquired taste.

56
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,825
LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: HIGH
GOURMET MEAL, CUTLASSFISH SOUP

57
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,095
JEJU, THE CITY OF SEAFOOD

58
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,230
Jeju is an island, so it's seafood heaven.

59
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,400
Octopus, conch, sea cucumber, abalone.

60
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,037
Cast your fishing rod, you catch fish.

61
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,742
Red tilefish was always considered
a specialty.

62
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,076
THE RED TILEFISH, JEJU'S BEST FISH

63
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,678
Especially, cutlassfish.

64
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,813
Mainland people always grill them.

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,549
ANOTHER REGIONAL PRODUCT
THE SILVER CUTLASSFISH

66
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,084
But Jeju Islanders make broth out of them.

67
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,888
SAHMBO RESTAURANT

68
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,926
How did you find this place?

69
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,930
Locals who have been here
for 10 generations.

70
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:17,997
Ten generations?

71
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,832
Since the Age of Goryeo?

72
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,135
Red tilefish radish soup

73
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,538
might taste too fishy
to those with sensitive taste buds.

74
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,408
-Radishes are in season now.
-Right.

75
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,509
RADISH, JEJU'S WINTER TREAT

76
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,078
It's kimchi-making season.
Because radishes are in season.

77
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,146
What would you like?

78
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,314
Red tilefish radish soup.

79
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,217
I'll order cutlassfish soup instead.

80
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,120
It's not on the menu. The radish soup.

81
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,122
People order it,
even though it's not on the menu.

82
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,357
KANG HEE-NYEON
RESTAURANT OWNER OF 37 YEARS

83
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,959
-Really?
-Yes.

84
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:46,960
Everyone knows.

85
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,695
-They just know, huh?
-Yes.

86
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,563
Why isn't it on the menu?

87
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,701
It used to be that only locals
ordered it here.

88
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,204
Do you have any other hidden menus?

89
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,540
The stuff you eat among yourselves?

90
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,661
The radish soup looks good.

91
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,729
RED TILEFISH RADISH SOUP

92
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,163
-Give me some broth.
-All right.

93
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,636
There's pumpkin in the cutlassfish soup.

94
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,371
It looks amazing.

95
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,640
It looks fresh.

96
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,042
CUTLASSFISH SOUP

97
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,211
Are these scales in the broth?

98
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,382
When they're caught in nets
they rub against each other.

99
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,051
So their scales completely rub off.

100
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,322
They come fully scaled
if they're caught by fishing rods.

101
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,792
They're called silver cutlassfish.

102
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,670
A SPECIAL SOUP IN JEJU,
KNOWN FOR CUTLASSFISH

103
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,341
That's good.

104
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,942
This reminds me of my mother.

105
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,611
It's good.

106
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,879
It is good.

107
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,147
It's not fishy.

108
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,582
It's perfect for hangovers.

109
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,153
You always mix rice with broth.

110
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,256
Yeah, I like how the soup

111
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,092
thickens with the rice.

112
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,295
FULL-ON CONNOISSEUR MODE

113
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,164
How's it this good?

114
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,899
It's so good.

115
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,400
SOUP THAT'S TASTIER WITH RICE

116
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,637
The taste of fat in the fish
is infused well into the broth.

117
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,173
It's a different flavor
to when you grill it.

118
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,676
Seogwipo cutlassfish
is tasty in the winter.

119
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,679
The fish swim down to Seogwipo
because of the cold.

120
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,147
That's why…

121
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,717
I'm sure a Seogwipo local said that.

122
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,984
It's possible.

123
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,519
They migrate here.

124
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,890
I think the red tilefish
is the king of all fish.

125
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,560
Jeju suddenly seems appealing, no?

126
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,261
-Yes.
-Everyone should come here.

127
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,529
You know,

128
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:07,100
I think discovering a new dish
is making me feel pretty excited.

129
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,202
Finally, I've succeeded.

130
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,838
People who love to drink will love this.

131
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,308
That's right. Perfect for hangovers
and drinking sessions.

132
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,510
HANGOVER REMEDY
AND ALCOHOL PAIRING

133
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,779
I'm emptying this bowl pretty quickly.

134
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,680
Yes.

135
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,617
A TASTE THAT'S HARD TO RESIST

136
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,119
It's so good.

137
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,558
SAHMBO RESTAURANT

138
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,227
How do you make the broth?

139
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,428
The cutlassfish soup?

140
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,663
-The heads.
-The heads?

141
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:42,602
THE SECRET INGREDIENT:
THE CUTLASSFISH HEAD

142
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,005
What about…

143
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,573
That's made separately.

144
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,642
Just with water?

145
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,577
Yes, the fish is still fresh.

146
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,346
-Is that so?
-Water and radish.

147
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,981
-Seasoned with salt?
-Yes.

148
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,048
SALT, THE FINAL TOUCH

149
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,652
The salt decides what kind of dish
it will become.

150
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,987
-The salt?
-Yes.

151
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,289
The broth will darken with soy sauce.

152
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,323
Right.

153
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,493
The difference between
Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do dishes

154
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,729
depends on the usage of salt.

155
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,798
Gyeongsang-do and Gangwon-do
don't use much.

156
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,201
There are many salt ponds
across the west and south coast.

157
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,836
AN ABUNDANCE OF SALT
AT JEOLLA-DO AND THE WEST COAST

158
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,671
I think it's ultimately the salt.

159
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,676
QUALITY SALT, A FUNDAMENTAL
FACTOR IN KOREAN COOKING

160
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,249
When I usually say this,
people go, "That's right!"

161
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,551
But your reactions are…

162
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,319
No, we're…

163
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,825
This is good.

164
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,892
THE BEST! THE BEST!

165
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,563
This one tastes good.
But this has a sophisticated taste.

166
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,899
This broth reminds me of my hometown.

167
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,267
It's been a while.

168
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,273
Cutlassfish soup isn't generally popular

169
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,510
but people who live by the sea
know its taste.

170
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,681
Instead of green pumpkins,
yellow pumpkins are used.

171
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,151
But they don't betray the taste.

172
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,020
IT'S SO VERY TASTY

173
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,456
GUEOM-RI

174
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,258
The waves are big today.

175
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,360
Yeah, they sure are.

176
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:18,798
Watching the windy scenery
in a silent car is charming too.

177
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,001
Now we're headed towards
a famous seafood ramyeon house.

178
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,104
Seafood livens up a ramyeon dish.

179
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,405
Right?

180
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,508
People take many photos these days.

181
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,577
I hear Jeju ramyeon has octopus in it.

182
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,081
I think they add photogenic garnish.

183
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,551
We're here, right there.

184
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,187
Wow!

185
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,589
The wind!

186
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,559
It's so windy.

187
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,863
How refreshing!

188
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,739
Here.

189
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,808
Thank you.

190
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,479
Wow, it's so windy out there.

191
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,516
"Octopus ramyeon: Limited to 70 servings."

192
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,518
Only 70 servings a day.

193
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,391
For every serving,

194
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,092
we include one Jeju crab…

195
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,130
JEJU CRAB,
NO. 1 INGREDIENT IN SEAFOOD RAMYEON

196
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,431
…some mussels,

197
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,499
some abalone,

198
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,702
and some local octopus.

199
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,104
We used to serve chopped octopus

200
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,541
but we thought about serving them whole.

201
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,243
So we tried it out…

202
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,580
and it looked great.

203
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,149
That's how we began serving
octopus ramyeon.

204
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,119
THE SEA OF JEJU IN ONE POT

205
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,122
-Oh, my!
-Your order is served.

206
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,425
That's huge. It's so much.

207
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,629
OCTOPUS SEAFOOD RAMYEON

208
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,365
It's so weird to see the abalone moving.

209
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,100
I want to take a picture of this.

210
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,068
Look at this.

211
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,470
It tries to escape if you press it.

212
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,039
Because it's hot.

213
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,107
SLURP

214
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,178
Did you raise your chopsticks
before your elders?

215
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,480
How dare you!

216
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,850
SO PLAYFUL

217
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,854
FIRST BITE OF THE CHEWY OCTOPUS

218
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,690
The octopus is really good.

219
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,292
It's steamed well.

220
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,027
This is amazing.

221
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,996
Ma'am, what kind of crab is this?

222
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,464
A Jeju grab, a moon crab.

223
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,933
-A moon crab?
-Yes, it's a Jeju crab.

224
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,501
This is a solid crab.

225
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,802
It's pretty bulky.

226
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,909
Now this is savory.

227
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,379
The guts are savory.

228
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,446
MUCH MORE SAVORY THAN OTHER CRABS

229
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,648
-Yes.
-It's good.

230
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,317
The broth is spicy.

231
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,854
SIPPING THE SPICY BROTH

232
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,524
It's between a ramyeon
and a spicy fish stew.

233
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:03,596
It's not just ramyeon broth, but there's
a hint of ramyeon in the seafood broth.

234
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,930
It's not a simple ramyeon.

235
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,899
This doesn't taste homemade either.

236
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,534
Definitely, you're right.

237
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,003
Ma'am, the clam broth is great.

238
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,138
The mussel? Yes.

239
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,874
Using seafood stock was tastier
than just using water.

240
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,942
OH JI-HYEON - SEAFOOD RAMYEON
HOUSE OWNER OF 7 YEARS

241
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,514
These ingredients should be enough.
But you still made stock?

242
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,084
We really put extra effort
into making good stock.

243
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,454
We include dried pollack heads

244
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,123
large-eyed herrings, dried shrimps

245
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,993
kelp, garlic, and katsuobushi.

246
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,928
We include all these ingredients

247
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,331
then we simmer everything for three hours.

248
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,101
Did you add ramyeon powder?

249
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,437
We add our stock.

250
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:48,808
Then proportionately add
about half of the powder.

251
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,110
You don't put in that much.

252
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,019
I can see why the noodles are al dente.

253
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,621
So they don't get overcooked.

254
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,292
-So it's just right when it's served.
-Right.

255
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,200
See, they know what they're doing.

256
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,436
When you boil this just a bit,
it's soft to chew.

257
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,805
Where's my abalone?

258
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,040
Isn't that mine?

259
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,108
No, it's mine.

260
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,476
I only have one.

261
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,577
Oh, here it is.

262
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,518
In every way, this dish caters
to the younger generation.

263
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,552
That's right.

264
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,254
It's filled with seafood,

265
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,790
which Jeju is known for.

266
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,059
Plus, the stimulating taste of ramyeon.

267
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,128
It's fun to eat such a variety.

268
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,429
A FUN DISH TO EAT

269
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,098
Sir, is ramyeon soup a broth?

270
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,867
Ramyeon without broth

271
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,735
isn't ramyeon.

272
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:50,636
Isn't that so?

273
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,506
Yes, ramyeon without its soup is…

274
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,609
I think this can be considered as a broth

275
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,079
as we usually mix rice in it.

276
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,383
Whichever ramyeon you buy,
the noodles are similar.

277
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,218
Rather than the noodles,

278
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,154
we focus on the broth.

279
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,722
Is it spicy? Is it savory?

280
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,557
I think it depends on that.

281
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,795
Anywhere else in the world,
brothless ramyeon is the most popular.

282
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,197
But it's the opposite in Korea.

283
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,933
Ramyeon broth doesn't discriminate.

284
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,838
If you add the right amount of water,
the broth will taste right.

285
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,173
The satisfaction you get

286
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,242
is the same, no matter your age, gender,
or class.

287
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,580
SOUTH KOREA, WORLD'S NO. 1
IN INSTANT RAMYEON CONSUMPTION

288
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,455
SEONGEUP FOLK VILLAGE

289
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,191
Now, this is Jeju.

290
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,359
You can't see this on the mainland.

291
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,394
Correct.

292
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,664
These aged and mossy stone walls.

293
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,432
-Right.
-It's so pretty.

294
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,467
Compared to apartment walls…

295
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,735
PLEASED TO MEET YOU ALL

296
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,504
It's 300 years old.

297
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,005
Wow, the wind.

298
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,341
It's as if time has stopped
in this village.

299
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,242
Yes.

300
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,646
The locals still live
in the Seongeup Folk Village.

301
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,950
Preserving the characteristics
of Jeju folk-style houses.

302
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:15,321
So, in this village,
you feel like you're in Jeju the most.

303
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,557
There's smoke coming out of that house.

304
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,093
Which makes you realize people live there.

305
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,394
That's a lot of smoke.

306
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,165
-Hi, there.
-Wow!

307
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,833
It's quite smoky here.

308
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,868
Wow, the smoke.

309
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,036
-Hello.
-Hello.

310
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,304
It stings, right?

311
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,272
The gas, gas.

312
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,473
Gas, gas.

313
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,941
YANG YONG-JIN, LOCAL CHEF
ME TOO, GAS GAS

314
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,576
Sir, you look familiar.

315
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,847
Like you've popped out of a comic book.

316
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,883
-From a Korean comic book.
-Yes.

317
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,987
Sir, do you not have a ventilation system?

318
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,923
Usually, houses in Jeju
don't have stovepipes.

319
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,291
-Why?
-There are no stoves.

320
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,760
Jeju is the hottest and most humid place
in Korea.

321
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,264
Jeju uses this smoke
so insects can't nest indoors.

322
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,164
I see.

323
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,635
COUGH! COUGH!

324
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,937
Apart from the insects

325
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,506
the smoke might even chase people out.

326
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:12,511
Our mothers suffered through all of this
to feed their children.

327
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,047
-My eyes are watery.
-Yeah.

328
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,449
Tears continue to--

329
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,051
Are you getting emotional?

330
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,052
I'm tearing up.

331
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,922
What have you been preparing?

332
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,990
In Jeju, when we treat guests,

333
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,059
whether it's a feast or funeral,

334
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,461
or a major family event, like a wedding,

335
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,931
it's tradition to boil pork.

336
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,365
JEJU MARRIAGES START
WITH ONE PIG

337
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,970
For weddings,
we boil four to five pigs per house.

338
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,905
When you catch a pig

339
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:44,610
it's traditionally divided into 12 parts.

340
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,379
From the head to the neck

341
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,815
to the loin to the hock.

342
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,352
Next is the ribs,
from which you make pork galbi.

343
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,388
Then the belly, which we call samgyeopsal.

344
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
Also, the first three spare ribs.

345
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,127
EACH PIG IS DIVIDED
INTO 12 PARTS

346
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,029
Then you boil the meat all day.

347
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,266
Even the intestines
and other internal organs.

348
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,035
PIG INTESTINES AND BLOOD
ARE ALSO VALUABLE

349
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,271
They boil for a couple days, right?

350
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,173
It's called the Illwetjanchi.

351
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,275
It starts with the village wives,

352
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,777
who begin sewing blankets together.

353
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,181
Then, they bring their homegrown beans
and make tofu.

354
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,854
The feast itself is not a week long.
They need a week, right?

355
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,122
-Yes.
-To prepare.

356
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,257
The pig is caught
three days before the wedding.

357
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,493
That's when the feast begins.

358
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,196
After boiling the pig,

359
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,898
you eat the steaming hot pork
on the board.

360
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,467
-That's called dombegogi.
-Right.

361
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,068
-Wow!
-Oh, wow!

362
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,203
This should be

363
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,238
cut into thick pieces

364
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,041
because it's soft when it's still hot.

365
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,676
So it isn't tough to chew.

366
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,911
You should try this.

367
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,680
I can't wait to eat it.

368
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,382
-I want to eat it.
-It looks amazing.

369
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,784
Do you want one now?

370
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,029
HIS FACE SAYS IT ALL

371
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,231
Your timing couldn't be better.

372
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,400
It's so chewy.

373
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,669
So moist.

374
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,038
-Yes.
-It's moist.

375
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,373
This isn't like any other pig meat.

376
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,375
It's like quality tenderloin steak.

377
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,044
-That's it!
-At a fancy place.

378
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,944
Right!

379
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,579
-A fancy restaurant.
-Yes!

380
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,381
It's so good.

381
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,516
This bone

382
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,984
is called the jeopjjakppyeo.

383
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,352
This only used to be

384
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,121
given to brides.

385
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,092
The end of ribs is typically tough to eat.

386
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,127
-But this is different.
-It's not tough.

387
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,295
Wow! It's so tender.

388
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,530
JEOPJJAKPPYEO
THE MOST TENDER MEAT

389
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:48,067
When you chew it, it melts in your mouth.

390
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,738
During feasts

391
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,607
even if you catch two, three, four pigs

392
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,676
the villagers would visit the house

393
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,912
for three days, three meals a day.

394
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,181
So you need a couple hundred portions.

395
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,251
To feed a couple hundred,
you can't make thick broth.

396
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,821
So this goes in to increase its quantity.

397
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,757
Boiled pig meat, suyuk dishes

398
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,160
contain a seaweed called a gulfweed

399
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,328
to increase its quantity.

400
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,864
It needs to be simmered

401
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,532
only for 10 minutes.

402
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,775
Not three, one at a time.

403
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,277
FIREWOOD,
ESSENTIAL TO MAKING A GOOD BROTH

404
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,682
-Where did you learn to fan the fire?
-Have the side dishes.

405
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,685
THE FIRE GROWS AND RISES.

406
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,388
Right before you eat

407
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,824
add buckwheat flour to thicken it.

408
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,060
Buckwheat is seen everywhere in Jeju,

409
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,796
so it was added into all sorts

410
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:51,964
of pork-based broths.

411
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,200
Adding buckwheat flour at the end
is a must.

412
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,005
In Korea, we have
the rice-in-broth tradition.

413
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,509
Sharing the same broth with others
for a couple days

414
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,578
means you're family.

415
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,580
One could say that it creates

416
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,083
a sense of community.

417
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,286
It contains many ingredients.

418
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,355
It looks tasty.

419
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,658
These herbs look like grapes.

420
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,096
GULFWEED SOUP

421
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,231
The last garnish is what's special.

422
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,534
Sour kimchi. To season the dish.

423
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,434
-The broth?
-Here?

424
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,536
-With the kimchi?
-Yes.

425
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,104
You use this for seasoning.

426
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,607
Kimchi as seasoning.

427
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,845
This is the deepest flavor

428
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,747
I've ever smelled.

429
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,717
The depth fills the bowl.

430
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,655
Actually, it has an unfamiliar taste.

431
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,556
Yes.

432
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,890
-It's unfamiliar.
-Of course.

433
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:55,160
Its simplicity is its charm.

434
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,330
While it's refreshing,

435
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,731
it has an unusual taste,

436
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,233
but it's so delicious.

437
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,037
When we were young, we saw this broth

438
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,705
and knew we were eating meat.

439
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,307
Making this meant

440
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,676
there was an event and there was meat.

441
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,511
We knew there'd be a festivity

442
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,946
or a party of some sort.

443
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,949
We live in such individualistic times,

444
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,586
so imagining a three-day feast
of so much mingling

445
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,821
is heartwarming.

446
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,056
It's incredibly fun.

447
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,125
GAMUN JANCHI,
A FIVE-DAY JEJU WEDDING FESTIVITY

448
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,203
I doubt the women in the kitchen
thought it was all fun and games.

449
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,173
Want to fry jeon for three days?

450
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,444
Pretty tough.

451
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,513
On Jeju Island,

452
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,416
we catch all sorts of squid from the sea.

453
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,519
We make muchim with that.

454
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,188
It's so good.

455
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,357
-This…
-So tender.

456
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,393
This would win first place
at a global salad contest.

457
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,195
I really think so.

458
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,698
Minari, cucumber, squid,
the combination of these textures…

459
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,069
Optimizing the natural flavor

460
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,740
is Jeju's way of cooking.

461
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,345
-This dish is red in Seoul.
-Yes.

462
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,482
Seoul squid muchim seem inelegant

463
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,617
-compared to this.
-I agree!

464
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,085
Those look cheaper.

465
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,487
This is classy.

466
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,155
-This…
-It's great.

467
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,626
Jeju locals often eat yukgaejang.

468
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,497
Every household has brackens at hand.

469
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:42,167
We need them for ancestral rites
and other traditional rituals.

470
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,503
So, you boil pork

471
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,204
until it becomes crumbly.

472
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,375
Then you add brackens and continue boiling

473
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,911
until it blends together.

474
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,914
That's what we call Jeju-style yukgaejang.

475
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,717
JEJU YUKGAEJANG
WITH BRACKENS AND BUCKWHEAT

476
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:02,921
If gulfweed soup had this cool feel
of solitude…

477
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,223
You been lonely?

478
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,224
-Wow.
-Impressive.

479
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,559
Wow, that's poetic.

480
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,230
This one feels plentiful.

481
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,366
Yes, this is certainly thicker.

482
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,134
Gulfweed soup feels lonely, huh?

483
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,436
Oh, that's…

484
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,272
I can feel our ancestral wisdom.

485
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,741
Sharing with many to avoid boredom.

486
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,743
-While having enough for everyone.
-Yes.

487
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,313
You can make a feast for everyone
in the village with a single pig.

488
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,981
We witnessed that today.

489
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,418
You eat everything except the pig's fur.

490
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,486
That's correct.

491
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,421
Leaving no trace.

492
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,224
If you took the fur
and scattered it into the wind,

493
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,593
nobody would know the pig was missing.

494
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,261
You waste nothing.

495
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,230
-You're very thorough.
-Very.

496
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:49,534
We catch a pig,
and nothing is thrown away.

497
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,971
Making it easier to share
by boiling pork stock.

498
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,039
PIG SUYUK

499
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,175
We use any leftover from the pig
to make blood sausage,

500
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,443
which is also called suae.

501
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,747
PORK FAT OR LARD

502
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,549
Lard was used to make this japchae.

503
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,886
I've never tried japchae
fried with pig fat.

504
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,890
Jeopjjakppyeo broth for brides.

505
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,593
Agangbal broth, for mothers with newborns,

506
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,161
that's made with pig's feet.

507
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,165
Because pigs symbolize fertility
and everyone breeds them,

508
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,901
pigs were often used
for special occasions.

509
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,404
HUH YOUNG-MAN, CARTOONIST

510
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,708
Since food is so precious in Jeju,
the locals seem to share

511
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,878
by boiling food in a big iron pot.

512
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,147
Boiling soup

513
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,316
symbolizes our love for broth,

514
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,087
but it's a way to share
without discrimination.

515
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:46,591
The Jeju locals' culture of sharing
and economic quality

516
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,494
is exemplified at that folk village.

517
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,096
JEJU BROTH, FOOD TO SHARE

518
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,966
TONGYEONG

519
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,702
Various island food cultures

520
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,505
was further developed in Tongyeong.

521
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,374
It was a self-governing province

522
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,477
with a 300-year history
since the Joseon Era.

523
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,580
A city which combines
the three cultures from the

524
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,850
Jeolla, Gyeongsang,
and Chungcheong Provinces.

525
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,052
THE TONGYEONG JOURNEY BEGINS

526
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,821
There isn't a single wave.

527
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,925
You can see islands, mountains, and hills.

528
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,427
You want to trace the outlines
with a pencil.

529
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,263
TONGYEONG CABLE CAR

530
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,768
Wow, how picturesque.

531
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,071
-Hey, Yon-ji.
-Good day, sir.

532
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,840
We've traveled far to get here.

533
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,675
Hello, sir.

534
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,944
Seeing you here feels different.

535
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,515
So this is the observatory.

536
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,150
If you're scared of heights…

537
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,885
THE PRIDE OF TONGYEONG:
THE 461M ALTITUDE CABLE CAR

538
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,253
The floor is--

539
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,421
It's scary.

540
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,223
Why is it shaky?

541
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,524
I don't like this place.

542
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,159
It's so scary.

543
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,828
-Sir, look at the islands.
-There's a lot.

544
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,396
How many are there?

545
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,499
They say 5,700.

546
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,566
5,700?

547
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,968
No, 570.

548
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:03,902
570?

549
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,505
Well, there are so many.

550
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,207
So I naturally expected it to surpass 500.

551
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,076
5,700.

552
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,312
-It's beautiful.
-Really beautiful.

553
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,082
I guess this is why it's called Naples.

554
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,050
The Naples of Asia.

555
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,052
Meaning, it's that beautiful.

556
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,090
I can see why from up here.

557
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,091
The ocean is still.

558
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,959
The islands totally block the wind.

559
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,062
Its conditions are quite ideal
for farming.

560
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,731
-Yes.
-It's filled with seafood.

561
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,466
That's expected.

562
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,535
I'm pretty excited.

563
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,906
FRESHNESS IS EVERYWHERE
IN TONGYEONG

564
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,409
HELLO!

565
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,150
WHERE WILL THEY GO TO TASTE
THE SPECIAL BROTH OF TONGYEONG?

566
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,352
Sir, this is an art village.

567
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,720
Yeonmyeong Art Village.

568
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,022
It's true.

569
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,290
We're all artists, too.

570
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,959
No wonder it's pretty.

571
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,696
We're here to meet Mr. Lee Sang-hee.

572
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,298
I think he's there.

573
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,265
Hello.

574
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:08,934
Hello, come on in.

575
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,001
-Hi.
-Hi.

576
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,403
Nice to meet you, sir.

577
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:12,771
Hello.

578
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,472
I see some mussels there.

579
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,908
Yes, I boiled

580
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,110
and skewered these yesterday.

581
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,179
-They're quite big.
-It's so big.

582
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,281
Is this farmed or organic?

583
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,182
It's organic.

584
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,685
I don't use farmed mussels.

585
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,922
Hapja is an islander's dish.

586
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,290
TONGYEONG'S PRIDE
ORGANIC MUSSELS

587
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,427
It's just island culture.
Each island boils them differently.

588
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,362
I heard from grandmothers

589
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,898
that excessive cleaning
will lessen its flavor.

590
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,134
The tiny shell-like things on the shell

591
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,537
are live organisms that should be kept

592
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,706
because they make the broth flavorful.

593
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,442
You just need to remove
foreign substances.

594
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,618
Excessive boiling will shrink

595
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,286
and toughen the mussel.

596
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,189
When the steam trickles down the pot lid

597
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,157
is when you should stop.

598
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,493
The mussels will be too tough
if you don't.

599
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,003
ORGANIC MUSSELS ARE BOILED AND ARE PLUMP

600
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,684
Then you skewer them five each
and dry them for ancestral rites.

601
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,419
That's called a mussel ogajaebi.

602
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,654
Five per one skewer.

603
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,161
-This is it.
-It's wonderful.

604
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,229
TODAY'S SPECIAL VIEW

605
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,131
This is unbelievable.

606
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,532
You live here?

607
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,001
I don't live here.
I'm just enjoying my life.

608
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,804
-I love it.
-For real.

609
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,205
THE TONGYEONG OCEAN
RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES

610
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,907
I'm de-stressed already.

611
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,976
THE SEA LIES BEFORE THEM IN TONGYEONG

612
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:03,248
So, these were used during rites long ago,
but the elders ate them with drinks.

613
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,315
CHARCOAL-BROILED MUSSELS

614
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,352
They smoked them on charcoal fire.

615
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,924
MUSSEL OGAJAEBI BY RYU SOO-YOUNG

616
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:14,859
YUM

617
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,728
YUM

618
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,431
YUM

619
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,734
They're so good.

620
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,936
So good.

621
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,871
The moment I ate it

622
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,574
it burst and all the juices--

623
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,242
-It oozes out.
-That's right.

624
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,844
The outer layer is dry and chewy,

625
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,579
-but the juices, pop.
-Pop!

626
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,613
-The juices pop.
-Pop!

627
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,282
-Chewy and moist.
-Correct.

628
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,284
You're awfully silent, sir.

629
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,455
No, it's like I'm watching youngsters
hosting mukbangs.

630
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,290
While we stay silent.

631
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,160
When you simmer mussels
in large iron pots,

632
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,262
the broth tastes amazing.

633
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,833
The mussel broth is then
simmered for five hours.

634
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,134
After that,

635
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,236
you start on the hapja extract broth.

636
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,704
-The king of all broths.
-Yes.

637
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,240
You'll only need one spoonful.

638
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,375
I didn't create that for this.

639
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,977
I create this every winter

640
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,046
to make that.

641
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,952
Sir, this is hapjajeotguk.

642
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,857
That's such a dark color.

643
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,725
A slight dash will do.

644
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,761
-It's thick.
-Why is it so thick?

645
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,930
This is hapjajeotguk.

646
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,299
HAPJAJEOTGUK, A RICH SAUCE MADE BY
SIMMERING MUSSEL BROTH FIVE TIMES.

647
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,568
An island food culture must be preserved

648
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,936
by islanders themselves.

649
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,905
But no one is interested.

650
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,208
Taking some interest in this

651
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,677
will only enrich our diet.

652
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,914
ORGANIC MUSSELS (HAPJA)

653
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,418
When making hapjajeotguk, using firewood

654
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,789
allows its aroma to blend in

655
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,725
giving it a slightly smoky scent.

656
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,032
Boil the mussels in the iron pot

657
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,333
then take it out…

658
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,138
and use the broth

659
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,708
to boil it exactly the same way.

660
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,411
You repeat this five times.

661
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,113
You're making it five times.

662
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,650
It's the wisdom of our ancestors.

663
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,654
They couldn't eat it because they had
to sell it to the mainland.

664
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,523
Mainlanders will then take it as medicine.

665
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,691
IMPOSSIBLE PROCESS WITHOUT EFFORT

666
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,595
This is the broth
from the organic mussels.

667
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,530
Its color and concentration

668
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,899
will become like hapjajeotguk,

669
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,301
if you continue simmering it.

670
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:41,039
UNTIL THE CLEAR MUSSEL BROTH
DEEPENS IN COLOR

671
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,743
MUSSEL BROTH AFTER SIX HOURS

672
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,313
A PRECIOUS MEDICINE
AND TASTE OF THE OCEAN

673
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,083
The color of this broth is quite dark.
It's as good as any soy sauce.

674
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,686
HAPJAJEOTGUK

675
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,361
The scent is very strong.

676
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,395
The smokiness.

677
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,365
When making muchim or mussel soup

678
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,067
you only need this.

679
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,737
Its flavor was the strongest
condiment I tried.

680
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,340
I wanted to make it at home,

681
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,875
and I actually did.

682
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,309
I simmered three kilograms of it

683
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,378
and got three tablespoons.

684
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,880
Three tablespoons.

685
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:26,384
HAPJAJEOTGUK MADE BY RYU SOO-YOUNG

686
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,520
Do Tongyeong locals these days
eat hapjajeotguk?

687
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,257
They don't know.
People below their 50s don't know.

688
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,691
THE DISAPPEARING TASTE OF TRADITION

689
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,427
My hometown is Yeosu,
but I've never heard of it.

690
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,562
This hapjajeotguk.

691
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,636
-It's sweet.
-It's so tasty.

692
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,803
This is so valuable.

693
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,138
How exciting.

694
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,608
-Here's an apron.
-All right.

695
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,676
OFFICIAL TONGYEONG MEAL-MAKING SESSION

696
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,977
-It's an haengjuchima.
-Yes.

697
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,646
It suits you, sir.

698
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,381
-Right?
-It really does.

699
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,448
PLEASED

700
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,118
We'll be making the flounder seaweed soup.

701
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,986
I bought these this morning.

702
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:02,887
BROTH WITH FRESH FLOUNDER

703
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,523
What amazed me about Tongyeong at first

704
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,226
was while other regions
create various dishes with fish,

705
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,228
they make soup with fish.

706
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,430
They boil stew, make stir-fries,

707
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,432
and dry them for steamed dishes.

708
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,466
All kinds of ways.

709
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,269
FLOUNDER IS SAVORY BECAUSE IT IS FATTY

710
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,273
The characteristic of
the Tongyeong cuisine is

711
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,008
they thinly slice everything.

712
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,678
It seems they're considering others.

713
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,279
They aren't trying to be fancy.

714
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,115
We don't need fancy.
We're realistic people.

715
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,319
Good, right?

716
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,988
-It's so good.
-It's really good.

717
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,057
A TASTE OF THE SEA IN A MOUTHFUL

718
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:41,960
It's simple to make.

719
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,294
Just add seaweed and fish.

720
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,998
Tongyeong elders and former residents

721
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,134
all seem to miss this dish
when I mention it.

722
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,870
This was their childhood.

723
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,806
They probably had this
in their everyday lives.

724
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,174
TONGYEONG'S SOUL FOOD
FISH SEAWEED SOUP

725
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,478
Tongyeong cuisine almost always adds
fish soy sauce.

726
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,381
This will complement the aroma.

727
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,351
To enjoy the natural flavors
of the seaweed or fish,

728
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,586
you only need two condiments.

729
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,221
Fish soy sauce and hapjajeotguk.

730
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,523
So, just fish, seaweed, and seasoning.

731
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:20,565
FLOUNDER SEAWEED SOUP

732
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,034
We've prepared a couple more.

733
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,335
Horaegi.

734
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,670
HORAEGI, BABY OCTOPUS AND BOBTAIL SQUID

735
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,138
Seasoned horaegi is called

736
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,506
-horaegi jeotgal.
-Horaegi.

737
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,341
TAP

738
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,709
So a baby octopus is--

739
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,411
SWATTING AT UNINVITED GUESTS

740
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,682
-You surprised them.
-I caught it.

741
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,583
APRON CAUGHT OFF GUARD

742
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,051
I did catch the fly.

743
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,320
You normally use fish soy sauce here.

744
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,589
Jeotgal as a side dish.

745
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,194
I've never tried that.

746
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,865
Tongyeong cuisine often uses
sesame oil and sesame seeds.

747
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,269
This is for Tongyeong locals or
people who live by the sea.

748
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,673
HORAEGI JEOTGAL

749
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,643
Only Tongyeong locals eat this.

750
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,879
-Crab muchim.
-Crab sashimi.

751
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,749
-Crab sashimi.
-This can be cooked in various ways.

752
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,885
FRESH CRAB MUCHIM, ONLY IN TONGYEONG

753
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,321
-Tongyeong locals before…
-It looks so good.

754
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,623
…ate this like dessert.

755
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,391
It's aged with cheongyang red pepper.

756
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,161
Mix it with Asiatic pear, onion
and soy sauce.

757
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,362
Pear, onion, soy sauce.

758
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,198
Tongyeong elders say,

759
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,399
"Oysters are like yuzu."

760
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,534
YUZU

761
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,602
You dig out the flesh of yuzu.

762
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,971
You're using the peel, not the fruit?

763
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,840
Yes, this is the best part.

764
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,810
YUZU PEEL AS A BOWL

765
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,912
It's so sophisticated.

766
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,916
Wow!

767
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,050
YUZU OYSTER

768
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,518
That is awesome, so awesome.

769
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,587
-It's so pretty.
-In 10 to 20 minutes

770
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,489
the juice will seep into the oyster.

771
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,825
Let's accompany the seaweed soup

772
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,860
with sea squirt bibimbap.

773
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,794
Sea squirt bibimbap.

774
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,663
The sea squirt is organic.

775
00:34:58,729 --> 00:34:59,564
-Organic?
-Yes.

776
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,699
It's in season now.

777
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,834
ORGANIC SEA SQUIRT

778
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,435
We have to try that.

779
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,736
THE KNOB OF THE SEA SQUIRT

780
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,705
You remove the mud from the knob.

781
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,440
You need to clean it once.

782
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,408
It's salty.

783
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,346
WHAT IS THIS MYSTERIOUS TASTE?

784
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,714
Do you like sea squirts?

785
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,116
DENIAL

786
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:20,551
No?

787
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,752
It's an acquired taste.

788
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,788
How can you not like sea squirt?

789
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,357
I'll change your mind today.

790
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,759
Actually, I can't eat it, either.

791
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:29,994
What?

792
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,096
WHAT NOW?

793
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,297
You're a comedian.

794
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,565
Scratches head.

795
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,402
I eat one or two when I have to.

796
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,204
I don't know why it's good.

797
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,673
You're so funny.

798
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,745
THE MEAT INSIDE SEA SQUIRTS SMELLS
LIKE THE SEA

799
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,247
You usually slice this.

800
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,448
But we'll dice it today.

801
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,816
Is that a sea squirt mash?

802
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,584
Those who aren't fond of this

803
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,721
usually eat it seasoned in bibimbap.

804
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,991
Marinate it with fish soy sauce.

805
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,493
FISH SOY SAUCE FOR SEAFOOD DISHES

806
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:12,136
SEA SQUIRT BIBIMBAP

807
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,838
Thank you.

808
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,039
Thank you for the food.

809
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,073
I've tried my best.

810
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,909
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

811
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,544
Koreans are good mixers.

812
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,822
The crunchiness makes it so tasty.

813
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,125
The mash makes it easier to eat.

814
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,593
It's so good.

815
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,195
The ocean…

816
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,064
THE TASTE OF SEA FILLS THE MOUTH

817
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,232
This is a female crab.

818
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,038
-The broth is more flavorful now.
-Yes.

819
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,941
The flounder is tasty.

820
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,912
I see why Koreans say fish is like meat.

821
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,180
-It's meat broth.
-Agreed.

822
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,716
No fishy taste at all.

823
00:36:58,783 --> 00:36:59,784
You're right.

824
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,321
Do you like soup?

825
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,591
Even when we have jjigae,
we have soup, too.

826
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,491
Right.

827
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,660
Our spoon culture is interesting.

828
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,431
Japan, Southeast Asia, and China
use chopsticks.

829
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:17,001
It's written, "Only Korea uses a spoon
for rice and soup."

830
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,970
And that's incredible.

831
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,871
We say sujeo,
which mentions the spoon first.

832
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,173
SUJEO, A KOREAN CUISINE MUST HAVE

833
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,808
We savor each spoonful.

834
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,043
I think our culture is incredible.

835
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,045
A meal without broth is…

836
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:28,946
You're right.

837
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:29,981
You need the soup.

838
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,282
-I agree.
-I need it.

839
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,483
It's still true.

840
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,285
We say broth is refreshing.

841
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,320
We say it's refreshing in hot springs.

842
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,855
-That's true.
-Oh, refreshing.

843
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,658
We say it's refreshing
when our foe falls down.

844
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,726
That's true.

845
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,160
-I feel refresh--
-Oh, that.

846
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,495
Yes, that phrase.

847
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,831
Even when eating a spoonful of broth.

848
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,333
THE HOT AND REFRESHING
TASTE OF BROTH

849
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,035
In Tongyeong,

850
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,572
I realized
that the ingredients are everything.

851
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,840
With good ingredients

852
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,609
your sincerity easily comes through.

853
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,679
Tongyeong is filled with
such sincere dishes.

854
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:02,580
Nothing fancy.

855
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,548
Only good ingredients.

856
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,550
You inspire others with that.

857
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,753
That's what I remember eating.

858
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:17,361
NEW FLAVORS OF TONGYEONG,
A CITY OF BROTH

859
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,431
-Ttukbaegi meals are popular…
-Yes?

860
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,267
…in cities by the ocean.

861
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,268
Oh! I'm excited.

862
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,936
Hello.

863
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,106
This looks good.

864
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,477
It smells good.

865
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,046
Wow, look at that!

866
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,814
-Oh, wow!
-Is that it?

867
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,449
It's like a mountain.

868
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,885
A SHOCKING IMAGE OF TTUKBAEGI

869
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,154
We must carefully dismantle it.

870
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,122
SEAFOOD TOWER

871
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,391
We sell seafood ttukbaegi.
It's different every day…

872
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,292
GO SU-CHAN
OWNER FOR 12 YEARS

873
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,896
…with eight or more ingredients.

874
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,231
Scallops,

875
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,167
clam,

876
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,436
Manila clam, mussel,

877
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,670
murex.

878
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,674
We buy them cheap

879
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,710
so we provide large portions.

880
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,513
Washing won't get rid of all the sand

881
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,115
so we check them all.

882
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,019
We clean one clam at a time
before we put it in.

883
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,358
We put them in one by one,

884
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,226
and it's made fresh upon order.

885
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:31,702
SEAFOOD TTUKBAEGI

886
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,003
What do I do?

887
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,105
This is crazy.

888
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,873
I guess I'm not going home today.

889
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,343
I thought, "Let's die eating."

890
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,378
It felt like that.

891
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,214
Layers and layers of scallops.

892
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,751
It'll collapse at the first misstep.

893
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,489
Wow.

894
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,424
TACKLING THE MOUNTAIN OF SEAFOOD

895
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,625
There's a conch.

896
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,394
How is this so good?

897
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,895
ORGANIC CONCH

898
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,664
People these days
don't consume the intestines.

899
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,333
Right, these intestines.

900
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,968
Similar to abalone intestines.

901
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,437
We used to eat it all.

902
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,839
It's flavorful.

903
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,241
Like abalone intestines.

904
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:13,310
This place makes their dish fun to eat.

905
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,512
Yes.

906
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,680
The scallop is intact.

907
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,918
This is such a healthy treat.

908
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,154
I'm digging into the bottom of the bowl.

909
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,622
I can see the broth now.

910
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,791
It tastes like soybean paste.

911
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:27,691
Sir!

912
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,460
How did you make the broth?

913
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,361
The broth.

914
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,364
It's actually a secret.

915
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,434
Just tell us the basic ingredient.

916
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,272
HIDDEN IN THE SEAFOOD SOUP

917
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,074
IS THE SECRET TO THE BROTH.

918
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,410
This broth was created by using

919
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:50,314
crabs, shrimp, and more.

920
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,655
Combined with the broth
that comes from simmering seafood.

921
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,191
THE SCENT OF SEAFOOD STOCK

922
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,033
Whoa, that's good.

923
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:15,973
Very refreshing.

924
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,208
It's charming.

925
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,943
Perfect for hangovers.

926
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,178
My first impression of Tongyeong

927
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,048
will begin with broth

928
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,083
and end with this

929
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,552
clam tower broth.

930
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,489
Complementing a seafood stew with broth

931
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,058
confirms that we're really
a nation of broth.

932
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,061
Very few countries will

933
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,497
present a dish like this.

934
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,398
-They'd just steam it.
-Exactly.

935
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,601
That was quite shocking.

936
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,874
JEONJU

937
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,309
The low skyline relaxes me.

938
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,577
JEONJU HANOK VILLAGE

939
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,947
As much as we love broth,

940
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,483
there's a long history on it.

941
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,751
HAM YON-JI, ACTRESS

942
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,522
I was curious what broth
might have been like 5,000 years ago.

943
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,357
So we went searching

944
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,893
for the broth within our history.

945
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,097
You may enter. You may enter.

946
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,164
TRADITIONAL CUISINE
RESTORATION RESEARCH CENTER

947
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,699
Oh, my.

948
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,201
It's like a painting.

949
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,469
It's so pretty inside.

950
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,804
There are two ladies

951
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,773
-in the yard.
-How beautiful.

952
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,778
Hello.

953
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,446
-Hello.
-Hello.

954
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:32,216
It feels like we traveled back
in time 200 years.

955
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,952
What were you doing?

956
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,321
We were boiling a soup

957
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,156
called hyojonggaengi.

958
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,658
-Hyojonggaeng?
-In Joseon Era

959
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,160
noblemen needed this soup

960
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,396
for their hangovers.

961
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,299
It was prepared
at the Gwangju Namhansanseong Fortress.

962
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,267
Servants would walk 24 kilometers

963
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,237
to deliver this hangover soup to them.

964
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,506
So we're preparing that broth now.

965
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,174
10 kilometers?
Almost 15 kilometers on foot?

966
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,075
It's 24 kilometers.

967
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,510
-24 kilometers?
-Yes.

968
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,947
Wouldn't it get cold by then?

969
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,349
To keep it warm, what they did was

970
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,084
put this into a pot

971
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,485
wrap it with a cotton blanket

972
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:09,587
load it onto a carrier

973
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,456
-and delivered it by dawn.
-By morning.

974
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,625
Yes, the thick pot

975
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,827
would keep it hot.

976
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,362
-Amazing.
-Wow.

977
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,830
Korea's first delivery service.

978
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:20,831
That's right.

979
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,000
Would you like to see?

980
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,672
It's like a cabbage soup.

981
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,674
This is amazing.

982
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,576
HYOJONGGAENG

983
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,813
It smells like

984
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,449
a really tasty hangover soup.

985
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:42,186
This is more like a healthy hangover soup.

986
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,420
Yes, healthy.

987
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,122
It neutralizes the hangover.

988
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,757
So you can drink again

989
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,026
upon recovery.

990
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,195
-The original hangover soup.
-Yes.

991
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,466
The name Hyojonggaeng

992
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,868
uses the character hyo which means dawn

993
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,070
the jong meaning bell
the gaeng meaning soup.

994
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,238
GWAK YU-GYEONG
TRADITIONAL CUISINE RESTORER

995
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:05,576
A hangover soup must be
flavorfully balanced and mild.

996
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,312
So the ingredients are parboiled first

997
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,047
to milden up the taste.

998
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,116
The harsh tastes are filtered out.

999
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,453
We want a refreshing taste.

1000
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,621
It's a bean paste soup

1001
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,390
but it can't taste strong

1002
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,592
as it'll overpower everything else.

1003
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,129
So we boil galbi

1004
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,664
along with abalone

1005
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,465
and sea cucumber.

1006
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,769
It's not your average hangover soup.

1007
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,637
It's a healthier version.

1008
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,876
HYOJONGGAENG HAS THE FLAVORS
OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA

1009
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,512
We prepared some stew.

1010
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:46,116
We serve tea and dessert
as a welcome treat.

1011
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,019
This is called nadantangbyeong,

1012
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,055
which means dessert.

1013
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,122
Nadantangbyeong.

1014
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,791
Nadan is the small dumpling.

1015
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,759
If you try it

1016
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,595
you'll taste meat inside.

1017
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,897
-Oh, my.
-Sounds good.

1018
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,665
Why don't we eat this anymore?

1019
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,467
A BROTH THAT REQUIRES DEVOTION

1020
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,736
This is too precious to eat.

1021
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:06,770
Thank you for this.

1022
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:07,971
-Yes.
-Yes.

1023
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,206
The small dumplings.

1024
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,244
They're flavorful.

1025
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:18,082
I thought this was meat broth
but maybe not.

1026
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,385
The broth is made only of beef.

1027
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,521
But to achieve its light and simple taste,

1028
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,623
we added some anchovy stock.

1029
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,625
The chewy tteok

1030
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:32,296
and minced meat combined

1031
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,399
creates a beautiful taste.

1032
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,802
I hope this becomes popular again.

1033
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,137
Now that I've had this,

1034
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,740
I feel like a nobleman.

1035
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,043
Lord Heo's food is always best.

1036
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,513
I appreciate your words.

1037
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,249
I look forward to more invitations.

1038
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,052
THERE'S MORE

1039
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,286
What are those?

1040
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,521
All those dishes.

1041
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:01,525
We recreated the yeolgujatang.

1042
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,962
It's a royal hot pot,
and it's also called sinseollo.

1043
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:06,930
Sinseollo is the name of the food

1044
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,932
and the dish which contains it.

1045
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,668
YEOLGUJATANG (SINSEOLLO)
A STEW THAT ENTERTAINS THE LIPS

1046
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,337
First up, beef.

1047
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,905
This is beef.

1048
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,509
This was already used for the broth.

1049
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:22,246
Korean cuisine
isn't for discarding used ingredients.

1050
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,047
They're reused.

1051
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,016
It's not like the Western stock.

1052
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,553
This is from the cow.

1053
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,988
It's called cheonyeop.

1054
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,457
It's the cow's third stomach.

1055
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,192
It creates a milky broth.

1056
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,560
Very sophisticated.

1057
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,828
Also, this is

1058
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,397
a crab nureunjang,

1059
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,733
which is fried with egg whites.

1060
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,035
This only exists

1061
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,171
in Seo Yu-gu's historical recipes,

1062
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,973
Jeongjoji yeolgujatang.

1063
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,076
I wondered if they were fish eggs.

1064
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,478
Crab eggs sound delicious.

1065
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,379
Crab eggs?

1066
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:56,480
Yes, crab eggs.

1067
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:57,648
Called nureunjang.

1068
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,550
A valued ingredient.

1069
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:01,084
The color is great too.

1070
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,757
HAEHWANGJIDAN: CRAB EGGS WITH EGG WHITES

1071
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,760
Gray mullet.

1072
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,661
-What?
-What?

1073
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,728
-Yes.
-Yes.

1074
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,464
Noblemen always had this
on their ancestral rites table

1075
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,434
because of its neat and thick scales

1076
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,903
and nice-looking exterior.

1077
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,871
-That's true.
-Yeah.

1078
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,973
They were picky about how it looked.

1079
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,686
Can't catch any gray mullets

1080
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:36,920
It's trouts actually.

1081
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,722
-Oh?
-This is a gray mullet.

1082
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,824
Schubert's song was--

1083
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:41,892
It was for trouts.

1084
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,927
It's a translation error.

1085
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,063
Creating confusion between the two.

1086
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,098
-I find out after 43 years.
-All this time.

1087
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,166
That's for trouts.

1088
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,368
We use gray mullets.

1089
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,170
I'm glad I learned something.

1090
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,773
This is gyeongjong cabbage,

1091
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,875
or Joseon cabbage.

1092
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,743
It has a long stem.

1093
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,178
It stands tall.

1094
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:06,483
-Very sweet. And flavorful.
-The cabbage we eat is from China.

1095
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,818
That's right.

1096
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,353
This is a white radish.

1097
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,621
A turnip.

1098
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:12,589
During the Joseon Era,

1099
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:13,757
turnips were preferred

1100
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,026
over the common radish we eat.

1101
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:20,163
People usually see pictures of sinseollo

1102
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,233
but they never get to see it put together.

1103
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,936
It's like history is unfolding
before our eyes.

1104
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,838
This is really--

1105
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,673
It's amazing.

1106
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,041
This is picturesque

1107
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,010
how it's put together.

1108
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,180
BEEF STOCK

1109
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,486
YEOLGUJATANG, MADE WITH 25 INGREDIENTS

1110
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:43,954
This is called suhwagije,

1111
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,957
where the elements of water and fire

1112
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,525
combine and communicate.

1113

GWAK MI-GYEONG
TRADITIONAL CUISINE RESTORER

1114
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,228
This was usually presented at feasts.

1115
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,296
YEOLGUJATANG

1116
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,999
Other dishes would cool down
and become oily.

1117
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,169
But only this kept its original state.

1118
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,371
There are records of it.

1119
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,310
A TABLE FROM THE JOSEON ERA

1120
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,313
CLAM FRY

1121
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,082
-Would you like to try?
-Yes, where do we start?

1122
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,150
BOSSAM KIMCHI

1123
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,918
When we observe our elders,

1124
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,286
we see them sit

1125
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,921
then taste the broth.

1126
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,523
After that

1127
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:20,991
they begin with the side dish

1128
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,759
or the rice.

1129
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,195
So this is it.

1130
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,431
The taste has depth.

1131
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,368
All sorts of delicacies are in it.

1132
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:32,602
It's so good.

1133
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:33,870
-Is it really?
-Yes.

1134
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,505
-Are you being polite?
-Honestly.

1135
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:36,940
-Really?
-Yes.

1136
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:43,013
HYOJONGGAENG, HANGOVER REMEDY
FOR JOSEON ERA NOBLEMEN

1137
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,815
This probably prepared them

1138
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,216
for more drinks.

1139
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:47,718
More drinking, yes.

1140
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,286
They knew how to live.

1141
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,320
For real.

1142
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,056
-Sinseollo.
-Sinseollo.

1143
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,825
My first sinseollo.

1144
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,259
I've tried a simple one before

1145
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,928
but none so formally prepared.

1146
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:04,868
The crab eggs are here.

1147
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,203
-So honored.
-Crab eggs.

1148
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,372
Yeah, what an honor.

1149
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,073
The curious crab eggs.

1150
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:14,444
Don't expect a strong taste.

1151
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,279
Expect a light, refreshing

1152
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,514
and flavorful taste.

1153
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,017
It's so classy.

1154
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,586
Each of these flavors are distinct.

1155
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,621
It's interesting to pick and choose.

1156
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,360
Lord Heo, the perfect method is
one glass per bite.

1157
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,528
Let's raise our glass.

1158
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,097
What a pairing.

1159
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,732
It keeps it interesting.

1160
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,734
-A bottle or two, easy.
-Yes.

1161
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,903
Yeolgujatang means

1162
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,472
to joyfully satisfy one's mouth.

1163
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,975
It's that kind of food.

1164
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,910
Koreans like

1165
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,513
to boil everything on the table.

1166
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,715
They even grill meat on tables.

1167
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,518
I think that was the beginning of it all.

1168
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,621
The Joseon Era gas burner is sinseollo.

1169
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:58,755
That's right.

1170
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,661
It's getting cold now.

1171
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,264
ANOTHER JOSEON ERA BROTH

1172
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,231
Let me open this.

1173
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,132
Ta-da.

1174
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,400
-Wow!
-Wow!

1175
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,235
The color is great.

1176
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,940
The corbina is adorned in color.

1177
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,310
CORBINA JOCHI

1178
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:23,613
Jochi is the royal term
for the word jjigae.

1179
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,115
If this jochi term is used,

1180
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:29,252
the corbina will be treated with much care

1181
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,289
so the jochi always
accompanied formal meals.

1182
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,524
It's a kind of side dish

1183
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,460
in the form of a luxury jjigae.

1184
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,097
Rather than the stomach,

1185
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,366
the intestines were extracted
through the gills.

1186
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,634
So it's intact.

1187
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,137
A sliced stomach isn't a pleasant look.

1188
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,705
It's amazing they did that.

1189
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,640
Wow!

1190
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,645
-The broth first.
-The broth.

1191
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,781
You previously tasted

1192
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,382
soft and refreshing tastes.

1193
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,051
This one will be saltier.

1194
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,120
CORBINA JOCHI
A SALTY SIDE DISH AND WARM BROTH

1195
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,788
I need to mix rice in.

1196
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,356
I agree.

1197
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,092
I never expected corbinas

1198
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,461
to taste this soft and creamy.

1199
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:14,498
It's filled with flavor.

1200
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,833
This is a jjigae rather than a soup.

1201
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,235
-Yes.
-A corbina jjigae.

1202
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,202
-Jochi.
-Yes.

1203
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,706
Jijim, jjigae, jochi all have

1204
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,207
the same meaning.

1205
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:28,111
These words contain deep meaning
relevant to Korean cuisine.

1206
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,012
These words.

1207
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:33,717
SUNGNYUNG, THE CONCLUSION TO A BROTH MEAL

1208
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,521
The nurungji spoon is different.

1209
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:41,458
Yes, Westerners have dessert spoons
at their tables.

1210
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,959
It feels foreign in our cuisine.

1211
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,329
Koreans love broth.

1212
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:48,565
We use spoons for the rice.

1213
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,667
We then use the same one for jjigae.

1214
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,503
-Right.
-Then, for a fish stew like this.

1215
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,872
We use it for the entire meal.

1216
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:59,809
They are finished off
with sungnyung or nurungji.

1217
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,545
-Right.
-So this nurungji

1218
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:05,015
presumably comes from our stew culture.

1219
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:06,349
NURUNGJI, FROM KOREA'S BROTH CULTURE

1220
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,452
This pot provided us with

1221
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,222
a very satisfying dish.

1222
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,858
I'd say today was very meaningful.

1223
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,894
This was enjoyed by our ancestors,

1224
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,930
and it represents our roots.

1225
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,999
I think I got to experience
the absolute best

1226
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:26,303
of all the delicacies they got to enjoy.

1227
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,606
I don't think
I'll ever forget this experience.

1228
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,741
THE 5,000 YEAR HISTORY
MEETING THE ORIGIN OF BROTH

1229
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,511
KOREA, A NATION OF BROTH

1230
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,647
There are many types of soup.

1231
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,249
Its categories are

1232
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,150
soup…

1233
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,118
BEAN SPROUT SOUP

1234
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,286
DUMPLING SOUP

1235
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,055
…gaeng, a vegetable broth,

1236
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,389
which has less water,

1237
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,524
THE MEANING OF GAENG
HYOJONGGAENG

1238
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,392
hwak, meat broth.

1239
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,961
Jochi is a broth dish, too.

1240
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,662
Jjigae likewise.

1241
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,731
THE MEANING OF JJIGAE
SOYBEAN PASTE JJIGAE

1242
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,833
Suk, broth made by long simmer.

1243
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,734
Like baeksuk.

1244
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,636
Po, broth with tofu in it.

1245
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,171
Like Yeonpotang.

1246
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,708
Depending on the ingredient
and the volume of broth,

1247
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,977
there are tons of categories.

1248
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:07,877
As you can see,

1249
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,613
Koreans love broth.

1250
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,617
I can't finish a meal without broth.

1251
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,685
This is engraved deeply

1252
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,587
in my bones,

1253
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,557
this broth culture or our nation.

1254
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:23,860
The relationship between
our people and broth

1255
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,062
is like destiny.

1256
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,433
BROTH IS LIKE DESTINY FOR KOREANS

1257
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,003
Oh, look!

1258
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:33,903
Wow!

1259
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,339
But I finished the fried egg.

1260
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,240
What now?

1261
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,842
That was essential.

1262
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:39,743
Oh, my.

1263
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,648
What are we eating after ramyeon?

1264
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,017
Jeopjjakppyeoguk and meat noodles.

1265
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,018
Weren't you asleep?

1266
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,121
People cross-dress these days.

1267
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:54,224
Imagine Soo-young wearing a women's skirt.

1268
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:56,059
It's filling already.

1269
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,161
It's a birthday cake. Get some candles.

1270
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,129
Happy birthday…

1271
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,964
