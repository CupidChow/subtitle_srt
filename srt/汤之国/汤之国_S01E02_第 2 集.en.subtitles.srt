1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,939
What can comfort us more

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,975
than a bowl of warm broth

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,979
after another long day?

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,851
The moment we take a sip,

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,986
the furrows in your brow disappear.

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,655
Your forehead relaxes
and your lips curl into a smile.

7
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,961
Many Koreans say,
"I can't have a meal without broth."

8
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,564
A typical Korean meal
centers on the bowl of broth.

9
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,137
For us, it's more than
just a bowl of broth.

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,973
It gives us comfort and strength.

11
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,942
It's a way of life.

12
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,328
Broth and rice are the basics
of Korean cuisine.

13
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,064
Mixing the two creates gukbap…

14
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,365
HAM YON-JI, ACTRESS

15
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,701
…which is a simple dish
that is inseparable from Koreans.

16
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,138
When you think gukbap,
pork gukbap first comes to mind,

17
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,974
which then reminds you of Busan.

18
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:19,112
BUSAN

19
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,914
That's why we went to Busan.

20
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,887
Created after the Korean War
this is one of the bigger markets.

21
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,823
It's my first time at Kkangtong Market.

22
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,996
Wherever you go in the world,

23
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,499
markets are good tourist spots.

24
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,969
Markets are filled with liveliness.
I feel the energy of the place.

25
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,370
TRADITIONAL MARKET
BUSTLING WITH ENERGY

26
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,275
It's good.

27
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,710
Busan odeng is the best.

28
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,847
It sure is good.

29
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,150
-I had this when I was a student.
-Right.

30
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,852
I remember my student days too.

31
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,453
Is it there, sir?

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,354
Here.

33
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,522
So it's this house.

34
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,656
Just by the corner.

35
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,691
It's really big.

36
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,359
-Hello.
-It's at the market entryway.

37
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,362
There's pyeonyuk by the entrance.

38
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,430
-Hello.
-Hello.

39
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,698
Hello.

40
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,932
She's pouring broth.

41
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,467
That's amazing.

42
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,704
Hello. You're actually using
the toryeom technique.

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,273
TORYEOM, THE REGULAR APPLICATION
OF HOT BROTH ON RICE TO HEAT IT

44
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,142
Your wrist must hurt.

45
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,676
How long have you done this?

46
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,944
So much meat.

47
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,247
Over 20 years, maybe 25 years.

48
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,448
That's amazing.

49
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:36,022
A GUKBAP HOUSE THAT SHOWS
TRACES OF ITS 25 YEARS

50
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,426
I'm excited for the food.

51
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,728
The aroma…

52
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:48,301
PORK GUKBAP

53
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,402
Hello.

54
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,303
Hi.

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,437
You're so beautiful.

56
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,739
JEONG JEONG-A, OWNER OF
A PORK GUKBAP HOUSE OF 54 YEARS

57
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,806
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

58
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,008
I want pork gukbap.

59
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:55,975
-Me too.
-Okay.

60
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,710
-The mixed dish for me.
-All right.

61
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,612
Should I have pyeonyuk or suyuk?

62
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,580
How do they differ?

63
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,082
-Half-and-half, please.
-All right.

64
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,551
Oh, that's it.

65
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,420
How long has this place been here?

66
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,791
My parents started this place.
So it's been over 50 years.

67
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,726
You're the veteran of this market.

68
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,128
That's right.

69
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,164
You've been in this spot for 50 years?

70
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,832
Yes, right here.

71
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,501
Wow, amazing.

72
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,037
4:00 A.M.

73
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,940
Every day at dawn,

74
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,008
we trim the meat

75
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,643
that we bring from the farm.

76
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,914
We start with the leg bones and the head

77
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,749
and boil it the old-fashioned way.

78
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,887
About 15, 16 pigs fit into one pot

79
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,655
so we use three pots.

80
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,091
Meaning, around 50 pigs.

81
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,160
Then we repeat the process.

82
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,828
So 100 pigs in total.

83
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,868
A HUNDRED PIG HEADS
IN A DAY'S WORTH OF BROTH

84
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,971
Look over there, sir.

85
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,205
-Pig heads.
-Yes.

86
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,007
-I've never seen this.
-Me either.

87
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,446
I hear that if you boil
then dry the pig heads

88
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,214
its texture changes.

89
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,317
DRYING BOILED PIG HEADS
FOR ONE HOUR

90
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,687
-I heard something too.
-What's that?

91
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,825
That Busan locals have pork gukbap broth
coursing through their veins.

92
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,860
-I heard that.
-They really love this dish.

93
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,330
If you ask Busan locals,
"What should I eat in Busan?"

94
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,132
-"Pork gukbap."
-Correct.

95
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,002
This morning, I went to one
of the public bathhouses here.

96
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,438
Someone over there
was telling me about pork gukbap.

97
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,540
The locals have specific preferences.

98
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,044
So some places use chicken feet,
some only use pork,

99
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,413
some use only bones, and others use beef.

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,248
They all use different stock.

101
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,317
But locals have
their personal preferences.

102
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,554
Apparently, there are
around 300 kinds of gukbap.

103
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,790
-300?
-Pork gukbap?

104
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,425
I looked it up online

105
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,129
and there are 700 pork gukbap places
in Busan.

106
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,500
If that's true, there's a pork gukbap
place every 1.1 kilometer.

107
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,769
-Every 1.1 kilometer?
-Yes.

108
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,405
-That's the number of cafés in Seoul.
-You're right.

109
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,408
SOMUNNAN PIG GUKBAP
BONJEON PIG GUKBAP

110
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,475
BUSAN PIG GUKBAP

111
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,151
I'm almost done.

112
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,686
Maybe one more minute?

113
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,756
I'm pretty good with timing.

114
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,894
When I boil meat, I want it to be tender

115
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,065
and hot enough for a ttukbaegi bowl.

116
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,499
That's when I serve it up.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,170
You get a feel for it
when you do this every day.

118
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,806
You need to have a sense for it.

119
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,212
BUSAN STYLE PIG GUKBAP

120
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,647
It's here.

121
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,215
It's presented beautifully.

122
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,583
It's so pretty.

123
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,852
You add unseasoned chives here?

124
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,287
-Yes.
-So that's why.

125
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,621
Hope you enjoy.

126
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,956
-Yes.
-Thank you.

127
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,958
The man at the bathhouse suggested…

128
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,426
BY HUH YOUNG-MAN

129
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,363
…that I don't mix the sauce with the broth
before taking the first sip.

130
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,064
So don't mix the sauce yet?

131
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,833
-Taste the broth first.
-Correct.

132
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:11,838
That's so good.

133
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,606
-It's good.
-Right?

134
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,174
-Like baeksuk, huh?
-Exactly.

135
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,809
You wouldn't know without looking.

136
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,878
-I agree.
-It's like chicken baeksuk.

137
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,979
-Yum.
-It's so good.

138
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,447
BROTH WITH A CLEAN TASTE
LIKE CHICKEN BAEKSUK

139
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,685
The ear is fatty and chewy but flavorful.

140
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,886
EAR MEAT

141
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,655
The tongue meat is all lean meat…

142
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,723
JEONG JEONG-A, OWNER OF A PORK
GUKBAP HOUSE OF 54 YEARS

143
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,058
…so it has a light taste.

144
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,128
The cheek area is chewy

145
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,964
but oily because there's some fat there.

146
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,167
The nose feels like
you're chewing on collagen.

147
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,069
It's very chewy.

148
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,977
You think this would be good with soju?

149
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,946
I wasn't going to say anything.

150
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,151
-One bottle of soju, please.
-This early?

151
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,852
Soju is a morning drink.

152
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,523
Yes, Busan.

153
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,857
Busan!

154
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,627
-It's a crime not to drink with this.
-I agree.

155
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,828
It's a serious mistake.

156
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,264
This dish calls for at least one bottle.

157
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,412
A DISH THAT'S EVEN TASTIER
WITH DRINKS

158
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,217
Soju tastes sweet with this broth.
Oh, dear.

159
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,320
Suyuk is served.

160
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,155
This much is a half portion?

161
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,924
Which is the tongue meat?

162
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,158
It's here.

163
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,259
PORK SUYUK PLATTER

164
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,362
This here, is the cheek meat.

165
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,530
-One question.
-Sure.

166
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,667
-Can I order more broth?
-Of course.

167
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,870
Apologies, he eats a lot sometimes.

168
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,738
He usually doesn't eat this much.

169
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,440
This isn't like him.

170
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,610
Let's try the cheek meat.

171
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,112
This is expensive meat.

172
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,181
You know pasta carbonara?

173
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,017
Italians make carbonara
with pork cheek meat.

174
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,486
They use ham made from this.

175
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,920
It's called guanciale.

176
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,655
It's a very flavorful area.

177
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,535
The more you chew…

178
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,504
AN EXPLOSION OF TASTE
PORK CHEEK MEAT

179
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,671
Even the fat is tasty.

180
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,406
Here's a reason to live a long life.

181
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,108
What's that?

182
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,577
There's so much to eat.

183
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,681
This is so good.

184
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,116
The cheek meat.

185
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,154
I always think in metaphors.

186
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,357
Seolleongtang and gomtang
are like asphalt.

187
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,225
This is an unpaved road.

188
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,261
It's unrefined,

189
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,731
but it represents the tastebuds
of the locals.

190
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,234
That's how I described it in my cartoon.

191
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,903
-In Sikgaek.
-I remember it.

192
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,138
"Like a young rebel speeding
on an unpaved road."

193
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,206
Yes, a young rebel.

194
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,108
"THE TASTE OF A YOUNG REBEL
SPEEDING ON AN UNPAVED ROAD", FROM SIKGAEK

195
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,743
You have many regulars?

196
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,144
Yes, of course.

197
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,581
People miss their mother's
home cooking, made with love,

198
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,317
and some people still come
and tell me that.

199
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,351
The merchants here.

200
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,353
THE ONE SATISFYING MEAL
FOR BUSY MERCHANTS

201
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,888
Our regulars consist

202
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,391
of merchants in the vicinity

203
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,226
and delivery people.

204
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,499
During difficult times in the past,

205
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,603
this was the one hot bowl
they could eat until they were full.

206
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,704
Plus, it was cheap.

207
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,707
After a tiring day of work,

208
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,109
they'd come here at the end of the day

209
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,179
and have a hot bowl of gukbap.

210
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,248
"A gukbap bowl of happiness."

211
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,350
That's what they say.

212
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,890
The reason pork gukbap
is adored by Busan locals

213
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,260
is because it warms the soul.

214
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,096
How comforting it must be.

215
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:03,569
DAEGU

216
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,739
This is Daegu!

217
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,542
I think it's warmer here than Busan.

218
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,311
Daegu is famous for its hot weather.

219
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,281
-Geographically, Daegu is a basin.
-They call it "Daefrica."

220
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,784
Since the Joseon Era,

221
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,587
Daegu's cattle market was always
well-developed.

222
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,423
They have something called mungtigi,

223
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,225
a dish made with only fresh meat.

224
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,328
They also have jjimgalbi.

225
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,998
It's a very spicy dish.
A quite famous one.

226
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,065
SPICY GALBIJJIM

227
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,470
The city of Daegu is a basin.
It gets very hot and very cold.

228
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,705
So, the weather affects their cuisine.

229
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:43,509
DAEGU, THE HOLY LAND
OF BEEF DISHES

230
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,910
-Is it here?
-Yes.

231
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,413
Recently in Daegu,
makchang has become popular.

232
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,782
-Right.
-Daegu is known for yukgaejang.

233
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:50,816
-We're here.
-Hello.

234
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,251
-Welcome in.
-Hello.

235
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,454
YUKGAEJANG - 8,500 WON

236
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,390
Yukgaejang is your signature dish?

237
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,290
-Right?
-Yes.

238
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,259
-Yukguksu sounds good.
-Yukguksu.

239
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,595
Instead of rice in yukgaejang

240
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,130
it comes with noodles.

241
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,398
It's also good.

242
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,136
-We'll have yukgaejang.
-Yes.

243
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,704
Three orders of yukgaejang then?

244
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,208
You mentioned yukgaejang places
are disappearing in Seoul.

245
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,444
I just can't seem to find one in Seoul.

246
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,513
Probably because a lot of effort

247
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,181
goes into making yukgaejang.

248
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,317
Do you think that's the reason?

249
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,087
I reckon it was a very famous soup.

250
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,122
This cookbook
is from the early 20th century.

251
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,591
-Yes.
-The first edition of how to make soup…

252
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,659
Yes.

253
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,727
…has yukgaejang.

254
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,829
Here.

255
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,864
It's on the first page.

256
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,300
Next is gomguk, then mixed seafood stew.

257
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,635
Then fish stew.

258
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,637
The knee, crucible, beef rib,

259
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,273
tripe, stomach, intestine, and pancreas.

260
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,175
They mix all these parts

261
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,444
with chives and other ingredients,

262
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,012
and boil them for some time.

263
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,613
It says here,

264
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,450
"Soup comes after rice.
It is the main side dish.

265
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,453
A table without soup
is like a face without eyes."

266
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,389
Wow.

267
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,124
That's how important soup was.

268
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,093
Daegu had a ritual
called gyeongsang gamyeong…

269
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,194
RYU SOO-YOUNG, ACTOR

270
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,830
…so for ancestral rites or guests,
they had to cook a cow.

271
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,965
That's why yukgaejang,

272
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,134
a spicy beef stew, was created.

273
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,838
The origin of the yukgaejang we eat today
was called the Daegu stew,

274
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,241
which tells us that yukgaejang
originated in Daegu.

275
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,979
Yukgaejang follows
Daegu's traditional style.

276
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,949
We simmer beef leg bones for 24 hours

277
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,651
and 365 days a year.

278
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,353
After boiling them,

279
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,423
we put diced radish into another pot.

280
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,794
There, we add flank and brisket meat
and pour the broth on top.

281
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,931
Once it's boiled, you add green onions.

282
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,903
Green onions are a must in yukgaejang.

283
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,007
Daegu is well-known for its green onions.

284
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:59,578
These onions are grown
by the Nakdong River.

285
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,349
If you add a lot of green onion,

286
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,785
it'll blend in with the radish

287
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,487
and create an organic sweetness.

288
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,657
NATURAL SEASONINGS, CREATING SWEETNESS
GREEN ONION AND RADISH

289
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,694
We've been in business for 60 years
and yet, our recipe hasn't changed.

290
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,430
JU MI-SUK, OWNER OF A TRADITIONAL
YUKGAEJANG PLACE OF 59 YEARS

291
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,700
I learned a lot from my mother-in-law.

292
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,869
She scolded me often.

293
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:31,510
A STUBBORN TASTE
PRESERVED IMPECCABLY FOR 60 YEARS

294
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,612
It's here.

295
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,247
It looks tasty.

296
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,751
It smells great.
This is totally different from Seoul.

297
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,819
YUKGAEJANG

298
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,987
The combination of snow-white rice

299
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,824
and fiery red yukgaejang

300
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,458
excites me.

301
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:47,726
It's so pretty.

302
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,130
I haven't seen such red in a while.

303
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:56,435
YUKGAEJANG SPICED UP
WITH RED PEPPER OIL

304
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,641
I'm surprised to see that there are
no brackens.

305
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,479
Oh, dear.

306
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,281
It's delicious.

307
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,986
The green onion makes the dish.

308
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,354
It's good.

309
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,823
-Green onion…
-Its sweetness is in the broth.

310
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,927
In Seoul, the meat is shredded.
You would never see this up there.

311
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,996
A DAEGU STYLE YUKGAEJANG
WITH CHUNKS OF BEEF

312
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:28,634
I also prefer the sliced meat
over the shredded.

313
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,535
It's satisfying.

314
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,271
Yes, it gives you the satisfaction
of eating meat.

315
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,740
If you shred it,

316
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,810
its texture will change.

317
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,746
Once you boil it in a pot for a long time,

318
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:45,050
it'll lose texture, become thinner,
and lose its taste.

319
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:50,389
Chewing bulkier chunks
makes it juicier and more flavorful.

320
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,924
It'll taste meatier.

321
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,998
HARMONY BETWEEN
SPICY YUKGAEJANG AND WHITE RICE

322
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,181
The green onion is dancing in my mouth.

323
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,251
The juice from the meat,
and the green onion is exuding.

324
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,423
-We're tasting the original yukgaejang.
-I agree.

325
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,894
KOREAN BEEF SUYUK PLATTER

326
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:29,962
This looks great.

327
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,239
-Let me add some sesame oil.
-It's so chewy.

328
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,874
Oh, my! It's so good.

329
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,043
I find this tasty.

330
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,678
It melts in your mouth.

331
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,745
AUTOMATIC SHOULDER DANCE

332
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,316
-The thinly sliced suyuk makes it fancy.
-Yeah.

333
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,318
How classy.

334
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,555
All these dishes
contain domestic meat, right?

335
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,990
Yes, all domestic.

336
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,992
Shouldn't you raise the price of suyuk?

337
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,226
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN

338
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,361
-It's cheap.
-We should.

339
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,262
And?

340
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,066
My husband loves to drink
with bigger portions of food.

341
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,168
So you can't.

342
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,836
He gets angry at small portions.

343
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:15,240
Also, the locals love this dish.
They won't eat it if it's too expensive.

344
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,775
I see what you mean.

345
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,948
Wow, look at this.

346
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,117
-Oh, dear.
-So this is it.

347
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,452
Why is it so yellow?

348
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,687
-It's chijaguksu.
-Chijaguksu.

349
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,190
It looks so tasty.

350
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,192
Look at the color.

351
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,693
-Pretty, right?
-Yes.

352
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,761
Great color.

353
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,231
Yukgaejang and kalguksu
are already famous.

354
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,366
They are famous.

355
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,267
So I wasn't expecting thin noodles.

356
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,738
Oh, wait, wait.

357
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,280
YUM

358
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,616
YUM

359
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,351
YUM YUM

360
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,020
Can you eat quieter?

361
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,989
Now, I have to eat it because of you.

362
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,062
-So good.
-It is good.

363
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,833
I'm just surprised
that I haven't tried this before.

364
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:19,938
Ma'am.

365
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,574
Why is yukgaejang famous in Daegu?

366
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,044
Daegu is hot, and it's not by the sea.

367
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,312
KIM YEONG-HWA, OWNER OF
A TRADITIONAL YUKGAEJANG PLACE OF 59 YEARS

368
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,747
There's nothing else to eat.

369
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,550
So we cook various dishes with beef.

370
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,186
I heard Daegu used to breed many cows.

371
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,089
Yes, a lot of cows and cow markets.

372
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,192
But we don't have fish.

373
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,128
So we use cows instead.

374
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,064
How long have you worked here?

375
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,698
Almost 50 years.

376
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,666
Wow.

377
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,003
-You've been in business since 1964?
-Yes.

378
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,873
So this place is preserving this menu

379
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,975
while others are disappearing.

380
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,051
Koreans consider this

381
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,554
a bowl of energy for restoration.

382
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,589
Wherever you go in Korea,

383
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,192
yukgaejang is everywhere.

384
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,761
It represents Korean cuisine

385
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,995
in my opinion.

386
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:23,535
YUKGAEJANG, A KOREAN DISH
FOR ENERGY RESTORATION

387
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:29,308
JEONJU

388
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,944
JEONJU HANOK VILLAGE
LARGEST HANOK VILLAGE OF 700 HANOKS

389
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,546
JEONJU SOUTHERN MARKET

390
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,616
I like the market's rustic look.
The weathered feeling.

391
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,986
I feel like I've traveled back in time.

392
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,889
What is Jeonju famous for?

393
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,457
Jeonju is famous for…

394
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,859
-Bibimbap.
-Bibimbap.

395
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,160
Jeonju bibimbap.

396
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,228
JEONJU BIBIMBAP

397
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,900
-Hanjeongsik.
-Hanjeongsik.

398
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,836
With a bottle of makgeolli,
you get a load of side dishes.

399
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,906
-Like the Tongyeong dajji house.
-Yes, it's similar to that.

400
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,809
We must have moju in Jeonju, right?

401
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,511
-Moju?
-What is moju?

402
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,646
MOJU, A MAKGEOLLI DRINK WITH GINGER
JUJUBE, CINNAMON, AND MEDICINAL HERBS

403
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,849
Koreans love to drink.

404
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,586
So what they need on the next day
is a hangover soup,

405
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,957
and Jeonju is famous
for its bean sprout gukbap.

406
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,161
It's dizzying how many bean sprout
gukbap places there are.

407
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,564
Nice to meet you.

408
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,865
-Likewise.
-Likewise.

409
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,101
I've never seen this at a gukbap place.

410
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,406
That's used for sushi.

411
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,143
For one, I like bean sprouts.

412
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,746
So when I see that gukbap,

413
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,348
I want it to make look tasty.

414
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,616
HUH YOUNG-MAN, CARTOONIST

415
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,352
I want to put an egg in
and some pickled shrimp.

416
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,388
Then its taste is transformed.

417
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,123
It also tastes refreshing.

418
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,458
A bowl that'll make you

419
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,861
forget the drinks you had last night.

420
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,498
It's a very important dish
for avid drinkers.

421
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,702
You can choose the level of spiciness.

422
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,104
We have mild, normal, and spicy.

423
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,072
-Peppers…
-Normal.

424
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:07,973
Okay, normal.

425
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,141
-With pepper.
-Normal.

426
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,442
Two normal, one spicy.

427
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,311
-One spicy?
-Spicy for men.

428
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,751
You can't eat it.

429
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,520
Really? Is it that spicy?

430
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,721
Normal is better.

431
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,024
-Normal is better.
-Then, that's what I'll have.

432
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,761
-Is that the amount of pepper?
-Yes.

433
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,196
Then I'll go with normal.

434
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,097
All right.

435
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,333
That's a big hammer.

436
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,535
You should've prepared beforehand.

437
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,071
Why noisily prepare everything now?

438
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,507
To show it to you.

439
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,544
It must be made on the spot
for the fresh vegetable juices.

440
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,079
So we don't pre-crush it.

441
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,414
We crush it when there's an order.

442
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,785
Soo-young, you're a good cook,
so you'd understand.

443
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,421
The vegetables taste best
when prepared on the spot.

444
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,457
People use pre-crushed garlic.

445
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,492
That diminishes the taste.

446
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,595
I didn't work here at first.

447
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,430
My mother began this alone.

448
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,066
First, we couldn't match
each other's pace.

449
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,736
But now, we don't have to say anything.

450
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,973
We're looking for the right timing.

451
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,942
Looking for what must be done.

452
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,977
What's needed and what needs to be done.

453
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,179
Signalling prevents mistakes

454
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,981
and synchronizes our movement.

455
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,917
While Mother prepares the rice,
I prepare the vegetables.

456
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,553
When the rice and bean sprouts are ready,

457
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,122
that's when I pour the sauce.

458
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,659
We move together from the first order.

459
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,361
Everything depends on the order,
whether it's mild or normal.

460
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,330
JIN SEUNG-GWON RUNS A BEAN SPROUT
GUKBAP PLACE OF 44 YEARS

461
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,499
We provide according to what's needed.

462
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,969
If we don't work in sync
or make it spicy rather than mild,

463
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,804
then everything will go wrong.

464
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,573
We consider what's needed
and check the timing.

465
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,310
We prep everything before we open,
so each order is served in a minute.

466
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,211
O JEOM-RYE, RUNS A GUKBAP
PLACE OF 44 YEARS

467
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,113
BEAN SPROUT GUKBAP
IS SERVED IN 1 MINUTE

468
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,749
-That was quick.
-That's so quick.

469
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,618
I should've timed it.

470
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,686
We weren't ready.

471
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,388
That was quicker than a hamburger.

472
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,956
I used to work at McDonald's,

473
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,392
and it's quicker than their hamburger.

474
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,161
Wasn't it less than 30 seconds?

475
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,863
We serve as our customers sit.

476
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,701
It's served even before
our seats are warmed.

477
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,169
BEAN SPROUT GUKBAP

478
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,007
The benefit of a one-item menu?

479
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,308
-Right.
-Right?

480
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,278
-You get ready mentally when we sit down.
-Yes.

481
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,246
I come from a noble family.

482
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,348
Yeah?

483
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,319
We usually don't mix rice into soup.

484
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,253
No way.

485
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,257
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."

486
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,425
Correct.

487
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,363
Noblemen mix rice into soup
faster than anyone.

488
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,401
How do I eat the poached egg?

489
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,236
Mix the broth in.

490
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,838
It'll be delicious.

491
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,775
Five spoonfuls onto the egg.

492
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,010
HOW TO EAT POACHED EGG
ONE: ADD FIVE SPOONS OF HOT BROTH

493
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,512
Six for better taste.

494
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,480
Six?

495
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,381
I'll do seven.

496
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,982
-Oh, my.
-It's too much.

497
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,053
Let me shred some dried seaweed
for the pretty girl.

498
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,454
Break the yolk.

499
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,689
This is fun.

500
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,890
Yes, it is.

501
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,993
Gourmet restaurants
usually teach us how to eat.

502
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,128
-Yes.
-This is similar.

503
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,729
It's tastier if you know.

504
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,197
Should I drink or use a spoon?

505
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,967
Use a spoon. Savor the taste.

506
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,368
Slowly savor it.

507
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,404
I'm waking from my hangover.

508
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,241
Don't let it wake you.
Enjoy the buzz as long as you can.

509
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,112
The egg soup tastes so clean and light.

510
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,248
-It's so good.
-Very good.

511
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,583
They're two different dishes.

512
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,752
-Yes, that's why--
-Two dishes in one go.

513
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,887
-Yes.
-For real.

514
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,623
Why do you recommend eating the egg first?

515
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,324
You'll be intaking fiber.

516
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,294
So it's to line your stomach beforehand.

517
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,264
-Like an egg on naengmyeon?
-Yes, correct.

518
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,232
You're considerate of your customers.

519
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,133
That's right.

520
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,802
It tastes better warm.

521
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:57,936
It's very savory.

522
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:58,870
It's so good.

523
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,773
This is a nutritious breakfast.
Very nutritious.

524
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,075
My stomach feels protected.

525
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,745
I should've had more to drink
if I knew I'd come here.

526
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,247
This is warmed up?

527
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,182
Yes.

528
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:16,555
THE TORYEOM PROCESS
TO WARM THE RICE

529
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,996
It's so tasty.

530
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,765
The normal is perfect.

531
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:27,833
It's just right.

532
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,000
-Just right.
-Certainly.

533
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,869
This is spicy enough.

534
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,171
This doesn't need pickled shrimp sauce.

535
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,507
It's seasoned well.

536
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,177
-Wow, it's good.
-So good.

537
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,078
Spicy enough.

538
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,514
What's this sourness?

539
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,649
We added some kimchi.

540
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,952
Why is there cuttlefish?

541
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,653
For protein.

542
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,189
These bean sprouts seem smaller.

543
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,557
Our local bean sprouts.

544
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,326
Jeonju is famous for these?

545
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,628
Water here is rich in iron.

546
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,631
JEONJU'S TASTY BEAN SPROUT
DUE TO QUALITY WATER

547
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,534
What I hear is that people
ate a lot of bean sprouts

548
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,903
because of the water here.

549
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,671
JEONJU BEAN SPROUT
STANDARD OF SAFETY

550
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,643
People want good bean sprouts.

551
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,946
So the increasing demand
enables its further development.

552
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,882
This isn't gourmet food.

553
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,552
You can enjoy it easily
because It's easily accessible.

554
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,525
-Merchants at markets need quick fixes.
-That's right.

555
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,927
This is Korea's fast food.

556
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,029
-Oh, yeah.
-Korean fast food.

557
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:31,930
It really is.

558
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,366
It comes out as quickly as fast food.

559
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,567
Sit, and you're served.

560
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,975
I reckon gukbap was
the number one fast food of Joseon.

561
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,015
Out of all global fast foods with soup,

562
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,851
I believe this is the fastest to cook

563
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,220
and the tastiest.

564
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,321
They need to eat fast

565
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,089
to go back to work quickly.

566
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,724
By mixing rice into soup,

567
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:03,528
they just drink out of the bowl
and quickly get back to work.

568
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:08,099
It saves time,
and it's tasty and energizing.

569
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,302
That's what gukbap is about.

570
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,479
TRADITIONAL MARKET TOURS
ARE ALWAYS FUN

571
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,518
SSANGHWA TEA, A JEONJU SPECIALTY

572
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,954
SSANGHWA TEA
A HEALTHY TEA WITH MEDICINAL HERBS

573
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,388
Want to mix in rice?

574
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,524
We mix rice into any liquid.

575
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,827
THIS IS IT

576
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:36,928
Where to now?

577
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,096
-This time…
-Yes.

578
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,764
-…blood sundae.
-Blood sundae?

579
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,634
We usually put glass noodles
in blood sundaes.

580
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,802
Right, glass noodles.

581
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,038
This place adds a lot of pig blood

582
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,707
so it's this reddish color.

583
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,041
Oh, wow.

584
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,509
A red-blood sundae.

585
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,544
Hello.

586
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,612
-Hello.
-Hello.

587
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,580
BLOOD SUNDAE GUKBAP

588
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,182
What are we eating?

589
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,250
Special, normal, or the head?

590
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,320
I want the special.

591
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,622
Special for men.

592
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,990
Again with the "men" thing.

593
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,359
-I want the normal.
-Special for men.

594
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,326
-Normal.
-Okay.

595
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,794
-Me, too.
-Normal blood sundae.

596
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,430
-One large blood sundae.
-No, let's eat small.

597
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,165
-No, large is better.
-Large?

598
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,567
Madam, we'd like…

599
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,569
Don't shout, she's right there.

600
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,537
Apologies for shouting.

601
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,439
I thought you were outside.

602
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,642
These are baby chives.

603
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,011
One special and two normal.

604
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,279
And one large blood sundae, please.

605
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,649
You find blood sundaes in Seoul
at bunsik houses

606
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,851
stuffed with glass noodles.

607
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,820
I thought those were blood sundaes.

608
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,055
There are various kinds.

609
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,124
The North Korean-style blood sundaes.

610
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,226
NORTH KOREAN-STYLE SUNDAE, PORK DAECHANG
FILLED WITH GLUTINOUS RICE AND SEONJI

611
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:44,696
Jeju blood sundaes.

612
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,065
TRADITIONAL JEJU SUNDAE
FILLED WITH BUCKWHEAT AND SEONJI

613
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,234
-There they are.
-This is it.

614
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,335
These look good.

615
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,471
That is an exquisite color.

616
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,106
These are made from makchang.

617
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,011
Why is it called a blood sundae?

618
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,980
It's made with blood.

619
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,619
This originally included
only blood and green onions.

620
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,320
KIM SUN-JA
RUNS A SUNDAE HOUSE OF 38 YEARS

621
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,455
Methods have changed.

622
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,257
We tried many ingredients,

623
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,393
and we went through many failures

624
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,529
so certain ratios have been created.

625
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,931
A lot of blood goes in,
a two to three ratio.

626
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,934
Two for blood and three for sauce.

627
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,504
We also add the end of makchang
and some daechang too.

628
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,440
That's our usual recipe.

629
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,141
We stuff everything ourselves.

630
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,476
Then we boil.

631
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,746
This process is necessary
to create these sundaes.

632
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:40,385
BLOOD SUNDAE TAKES 11 HOURS TO MAKE

633
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,021
This is my first blood sundae.

634
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,656
It differs regionally.

635
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,927
Does this taste different?

636
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,196
There isn't much makchang.

637
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,097
Only this much.

638
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,432
The rest is the thinner ones.

639
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,700
Thinner ones, yes.

640
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,402
Sir, take the tastiest bit.

641
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,471
-There's more, you eat.
-The makchang.

642
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,840
Let me add some pickled shrimp.

643
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,078
I love this.

644
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,780
Do you like it?

645
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,216
I think I enjoy the smell of pork fat.

646
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,084
The pork fat smell is strong.

647
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,754
I don't know if I'm fond of it or not.

648
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,655
It's okay, it doesn't smell.

649
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:21,226
Usually, we put sesame seeds
into chili pepper paste.

650
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,461
Mix, dip, then wrap it in sesame leaf.

651
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,265
Then add some chives
and some garlic if you like garlic.

652
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,634
-Okay, let me try this.
-See if you like it.

653
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,769
-All right.
-Sure.

654
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,275
The lettuce wrap
blends everything together.

655
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,843
Right, the sesame leaf.

656
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,545
This makes it much tastier.

657
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,080
This alone is good too.

658
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:47,352
HOW TO MAKE SUNDAE GUKBAP BROTH

659
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,855
I've made sundae gukbap for 37, 38 years.

660
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,292
When making gukbap,
broth is my first priority.

661
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,995
A thick and tasty broth

662
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,429
makes a tasty gukbap.

663
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,799
This is pork bone.

664
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,768
Not just any pork bone but the legs.

665
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:07,205
I boil only the knee bones

666
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,940
for a total of eight hours.

667
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,375
Same with the intestines.

668
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,243
I boil everything,

669
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,012
rub it with my hands,

670
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,014
wash and soak it in water

671
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,183
to cool it down,

672
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,984
and separate everything.

673
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,319
Even with the slicing,

674
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,555
it can't be too small or too big.

675
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,824
Everything must be done just right.

676
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:32,430
A WARM BOWL OF BROTH
THAT MELTS THE HEART

677
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,301
You should add more chives.

678
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,468
-Should I?
-Yes.

679
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,003
I like its subtle taste.

680
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,172
I guess that's why
there's little seasoning.

681
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,908
It's stuffed to the brim
and I didn't even add rice.

682
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,512
The bowl is filled with meat.
Wow, unbelievable.

683
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,414
You put all the rice in?

684
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,381
Yeah.

685
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,150
Do you like to mix rice?

686
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,952
Right, you said you don't.

687
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,921
-Because you're nobility.
-Nobles don't mix rice.

688
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,724
I don't even run in the rain.

689
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,192
Really?

690
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,663
We weren't even allowed
to lift our soup bowl.

691
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,866
We couldn't speak during meals.

692
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,344
It tastes so clean.

693
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,012
If you add rice,

694
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,649
the starch makes it thicker.

695
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,885
You don't like it starchy?

696
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,554
I prefer it thicker
when the rice starts blending in.

697
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,889
THE SAVORY QUALITY
OF RICE IN THE BROTH

698
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,824
Since you ask, I think I like it.

699
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,692
Really?

700
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:39,497
I think I prefer gukbap over
eating soup and rice separately.

701
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,032
Isn't there a separate gukbap?

702
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,470
But that's like saying,
"warm iced Americano."

703
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,805
It can't exist.
How can gukbap be separate?

704
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,074
The gukbap in Daegu seemed tasty.

705
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,809
But I needed to keep my dignity.

706
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,444
So I ate them together but separately.

707
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,149
Out of all kinds of gukbap

708
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,418
which do you enjoy eating most?

709
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,920
I like bean sprout gukbap.

710
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,187
Yukgaejang.

711
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,522
-Yukgaejang.
-Yukgaejang.

712
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,224
For me, sundae gukbap.

713
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,495
Just across from
broadcasting stations at Yeouido,

714
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,597
there was this place
called Hwamok Sundaeguk.

715
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,332
It was a really old place.

716
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,135
So having sundaeguk
from my early 20s,

717
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,202
I became addicted.

718
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,438
So when I think gukbap,
I think sundae gukbap.

719
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,607
My actor friends took me there.

720
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,343
I don't think anybody hates sundae gukbap.

721
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,211
-I agree.
-Right, it's rare.

722
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,352
Seolleongtang has little meat.
Galbitang is expensive.

723
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,888
But gukbap that's cheap but filling

724
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,691
is sundae gukbap,
which is comfort food for me.

725
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,192
For less than 10,000 won.

726
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:46,531
Sundae gukbap is the one and only
gukbap with that much meat.

727
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,867
In our culture, we can ask
for more broth, which is filling.

728
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,570
I eat sundae gukbap when I'm most hungry.

729
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,607
It's very satisfying,
and your belly and your heart feel full.

730
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,977
I think that's what gukbap is.

731
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,716
A GENEROUS BOWL OF WARMTH
SUNDAE GUKBAP

732
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:11,456
SEOUL

733
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,324
SEONGBUK-GU, SEOUL

734
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,427
I ate gamjatang in university.
It was expensive for me.

735
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,762
It was a party food.

736
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,898
If the upperclassmen were
at a gamjatang place,

737
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,500
the lowerclassmen wanted to go.

738
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,236
Each person would be holding a bone
and be sucking on it.

739
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,205
It was a lot to eat.

740
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,807
That's why it's usually found
next to universities.

741
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,144
I feel younger on Daehak-ro.

742
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,246
The atmosphere helps.

743
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,048
There's youth in the air.

744
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,083
The energy is different.

745
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,084
I think it's here.

746
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:40,985
Is it here?

747
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,287
It's been a while seeing gamjaguk

748
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,056
instead of gamjatang.

749
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,658
Wow, it's been running since 1958.

750
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,762
Wow, it really is an old store.

751
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,630
-Hello.
-Hello.

752
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,434
Considering it's a gamjaguk house,

753
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,935
it's very tidy.

754
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,005
Hello.

755
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:01,939
-Hello.
-Hello.

756
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,608
-Hi.
-You're the owner?

757
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,176
Yes, third generation.

758
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,145
Wow, the third generation.

759
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,713
You're more handsome in person.

760
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,248
Thank you.

761
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,315
So this year marks--

762
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,417
The 65th year.

763
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,085
-The 65th year.
-Yes.

764
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,586
That's amazing.

765
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,989
When my grandparents owned this,

766
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,091
they cooked it in large pots

767
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,895
and scooped it up one order at a time.

768
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,696
ORIGINAL GAMJAGUK
WITH CLEAR BROTH

769
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,934
After the '70s and into the '80s,
other gamjaguk houses appeared…

770
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,036
LEE HO-GWANG, THIRD-GENERATION OWNER OF
TRADITIONAL GAMJATANG PLACE OF 65 YEARS

771
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,338
…so it became commercialized.

772
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,007
And its name changed to gamjatang.

773
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,943
It was the same food
but its name kept changing

774
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,913
that it became known as a stew.

775
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,748
That's the name that spread.

776
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,718
THE PROSPERING RESTAURANT INDUSTRY
CHANGE FROM GAMJAGUK TO GAMJATANG

777
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,887
Where was the old store?

778
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,557
By the market.
It's a four to five minute walk.

779
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,594
A SIMPLE GAMJATANG PLACE
OPENED IN ONE CORNER OF A MARKET

780
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,730
My father liked to write
so he wrote these and stuck them on walls.

781
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,399
FATHER'S WALLPAPER WRITINGS
FROM 60 YEARS AGO

782
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,934
We can't remove them.

783
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,603
But the bits that were removed,

784
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,873
I brought them here as keepsakes.

785
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,075
That was a wonderful idea.

786
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,311
It's admirable really.

787
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,681
Seeing this makes me emotional.

788
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:21,419
Like I'm being reminded
of the father-son relationship.

789
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,455
I feel like tearing up.
It makes me emotional.

790
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,959
About the menu.

791
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,728
"Great, best, very, what if".

792
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,963
-Yes.
-What's that?

793
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,433
If you look there,
the pots, they're labelled.

794
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,501
You're right.

795
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,237
-It's demonstrated well.
-Yes, it indicates the size.

796
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,838
What should we order?

797
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,975
WILL HE ORDER A LARGE AGAIN?

798
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,576
Let's order just enough.

799
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,312
This place serves large portions
so "what if"?

800
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,647
-What if.
-What if?

801
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,282
What if.

802
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,850
-What if?
-What if.

803
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,889
From the neck, back, to the tailbone,

804
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,390
we use the pig's spine in full.

805
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,525
The main ingredient.

806
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:08,499
The meat on the neck bone is chewy.

807
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,902
The backbone area has less fat

808
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,803
and the tailbone has even less

809
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,071
but it's more chewy.

810
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,908
We use pig leg bones for our broth.

811
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,010
Boiling them for 24 hours

812
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,013
creates the best color and taste.

813
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,218
We follow the first generation's
exact cooking method.

814
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,788
We mix the backbone, and neck bone broth

815
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,358
and the leg bone broth
on a one-to-one ratio

816
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,360
to make our special broth.

817
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,298
For three months, we add rape blossoms.

818
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,134
Sesame leaf, glass noodles,
grounded garlic,

819
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,037
a mixture of onion and pepper,
red pepper powder

820
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,371
and perilla seed powder.

821
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,507
Then some potatoes too.

822
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,542
We use Gangwon-do potatoes

823
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,977
and often regional ones.

824
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,048
People talk about "potato bones,"
but that's a misnomer.

825
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:00,151
The deliverers just started calling
our order of bones

826
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,986
"potato bones".

827
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,388
Hence, the nickname "potato bones".

828
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,227
"What if" is served.

829
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,797
What if we had "What if"? That's so big.

830
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:13,864
GAMJATANG

831
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,666
-You're trembling.
-I'm fine.

832
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,370
Rather than dried radish greens,

833
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,138
-you use sesame leaf.
-Yes.

834
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,740
It's our main ingredient.

835
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,141
ANOTHER INGREDIENT, SESAME LEAF

836
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,083
From December to February,
we add rape blossoms.

837
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,417
RAPE BLOSSOM, A WINTER TREAT

838
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,620
-The flower?
-Correct.

839
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,221
RAPE BLOSSOM, FLOWER IN JEJU
THAT BLOOMS IN SPRING

840
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,457
For three months a year,
its taste and texture are good.

841
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,360
It has a sweetness.
So we use them for three months.

842
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,731
We haven't seasoned everything,

843
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,267
so you have to mix the sauce in.

844
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,068
This looks good.

845
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,204
Let the broth reduce as you eat.

846
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,907
So you have to pour the broth like this.

847
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,743
It smells fantastic.

848
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,649
I'm curious about the rape blossoms.

849
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,151
I've never boiled rape blossoms.

850
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,320
They don't usually sell it, right?

851
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,126
It has blossomed in my mouth.

852
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,402
Liar, it's still winter.

853
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,807
Today is a cloudy day,

854
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:33,244
there's a light drizzle, and I can't tell
if we need an umbrella.

855
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,814
-Yes.
-This atmosphere suits this broth.

856
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,350
GAMJATANG IS JUST PERFECT

857
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,851
It's very good.

858
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,460
-The taste of pork leg bone broth.
-So good.

859
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,368
He uses quality meat.

860
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,370
Sir, the meat has a dark color.

861
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,706
You get dark meat
only around the neck bone.

862
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,575
The dark meat you see in gamjatang.

863
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,610
It tastes better than chicken legs.

864
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,079
The reddish meat.

865
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,714
The red areas taste even better.

866
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,283
These areas contain more myoglobin
so it's more tasty.

867
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,051
MYOGLOBIN - PROTEIN
WHICH PRODUCES REDDISHNESS IN MEAT

868
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,619
The bones taste amazing.

869
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,854
-Right?
-Yes.

870
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,858
Yon-Ji sure knows how to eat.

871
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,436
You're really enjoying that.

872
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,704
I eat like this now.

873
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,577
But before, I sucked on it
until nothing was left.

874
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,012
I was in college
during the Asian Economic Crisis.

875
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,514
Gamjatang was a luxury.

876
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,949
One senior treated us.

877
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,584
He was returning from the military.

878
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,252
He'd call us, so we'd all go.

879
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,787
There were only a few bones.

880
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,889
So we asked for more potatoes.

881
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,758
We kept adding broth.

882
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,762
We stir-fried five bowls of rice.
We ate like that.

883
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:02,266
A portion this size
would be eaten by 7 or 8 people.

884
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,235
Yeah, that's what you would've done.

885
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,336
One cup of soju each.

886
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,072
This dish seems to be filled
with memories.

887
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,975
What's the age range of your customers?

888
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,610
It varies.

889
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,546
From students to seniors.

890
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,981
Families come together.

891
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,450
The first, second, third generation.

892
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,987
At one point, people booked for parties
of 50 to 60 people.

893
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,555
KOREAN STEWS
TRANSCEND GENERATIONS

894
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,924
A lot of university students came.

895
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,059
We'd like to stir-fry the rice.

896
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,495
-Two bowls.
-Two bowls, it is.

897
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,963
Out of all rice dishes,

898
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,366
I think gamjatang fried rice is the best.

899
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,168
Let's make the perfect fried rice.

900
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,369
It's quite a show.

901
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,272
The performance is important.

902
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,474
Creating the Maillard reaction on rice.

903
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,209
MAILLARD REACTION: CARBOHYDRATES
AND FIRE CREATE FLAVOR

904
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,644
It looks so tasty.

905
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,646
As it becomes soft by the time we eat.

906
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,881
What am I doing here?

907
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,483
-I'm doing what?
-What?

908
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,851
What do you think I'm doing?

909
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:54,785
I don't know.

910
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,454
They do this for you now these days.

911
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,455
Like this.

912
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:58,923
You mix in with the nurungji.

913
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,758
-Into a heart.
-Yes, into a heart.

914
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,527
HEART

915
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,728
Gotta make a heart.

916
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,797
Fried rice has to be heart-shaped.

917
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,332
-Can I eat?
-Yes, please.

918
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:13,971
It's good.

919
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,907
-It'll be gone in no time.
-Yeah.

920
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,909
You'll eat everything eventually.

921
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,044
You can't stop, right?

922
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,545
-It's good.
-This is tasty.

923
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,414
I could drink three bottles of soju.

924
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,716
I agree.

925
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,652
I shouldn't be drinking.

926
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,321
Oh, we shouldn't.

927
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,623
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

928
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,893
THE CHARM OF GAMJATANG
WHICH CALLS FOR DRINKS

929
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:48,706
LIVE SIMPLY, THERE IS LOVE
IN A BOWL OF RICE

930
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,076
THE CENTER OF KOREA, SEOUL

931
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,312
Seoul is the most developed city in Korea.

932
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:59,450
Many old restaurants
of taste and memories exist.

933
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,085
Speaking of old restaurants,

934
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,320
there's a dish you can't leave out.

935
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,488
That's seolleongtang.

936
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:10,628
This side has the vintage look,
but that side is very modern.

937
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,796
THE COMBINATION OF TRADITION
AND MODERNITY

938
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,498
-Here?
-This way.

939
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,668
Hidden treasures are found in alleyways.

940
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,207
Look at the ttukbaegis.

941
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,377
-They built a wall out of them.
-Ttukbaegi.

942
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,013
Look at this sign. It's so vintage.

943
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,581
THE OLD SIGN IS EVIDENCE
OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME

944
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,150
-Hello.
-Hello.

945
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,552
The kitchen is a furnace.

946
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,721
The kitchen is unique.

947
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,858
It's not a normal kitchen.
It's like a furnace in the past.

948
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,660
AN OLD-FASHIONED FURNACE KITCHEN

949
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,264
This is lower, and this is higher.

950
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,333
Why is that?

951
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,002
This is much lower.

952
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,905
-It doesn't suit you.
-No.

953
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,208
-Hello.
-Hello.

954
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,109
Yes, hi.

955
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,344
-May I ask?
-Sure.

956
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,346
Is this table for children?

957
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,781
It's low but this is high.

958
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,483
-The round thing is missing.
-One is missing.

959
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:11,622
People in the '70s and '80s
were physically smaller.

960
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,924
I heard the carpenter
adjusted it to their height.

961
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,492
THE '70S REGARD
FOR SHORTER PATRONS

962
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,827
So that table is lower.

963
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,596
Guests' heights were considered.

964
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,364
-Right.
-Your mother was amazing.

965
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,667
That's why you've been
in business for this long.

966
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,304
-The wood is peeled.
-Where the bowls have been placed.

967
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,839
It's the remnants of time.

968
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,742
This is quite charming.

969
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,477
You feel the history.

970
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:34,578
I think it's great.

971
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:38,248
You rarely get to experience
eating in such an atmosphere.

972
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,891
PLASTIC ORDER TAGS
FROM 50 YEARS AGO

973
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,795
My mother established this place
right here, in 1972.

974
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,198
KIM GYEONG-HO, OWNER OF
A SEOLLEONGTANG PLACE OF 50 YEARS

975
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,167
The Noryangjin Fish Market
used to be here.

976
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,769
Since it was close by,

977
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,138
I've heard many people worked at dawn.

978
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:05,676
They would come here
for warm broth and some meat.

979
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:09,380
I heard there used to be many
seolleongtang places.

980
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:16,053
When I first came,
our regulars were in their 60s or 70s.

981
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,256
But the age range varies now.

982
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,160
Grandfathers, sons, and grandsons,
they all come to eat here.

983
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,962
A NATIONAL DISH AMONG GENERATIONS

984
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,202
-Look at the kimchi.
-The kimchi is…

985
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,571
I should tear it with my hands.

986
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,807
Like how you do with squids.

987
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,243
It looks good.

988
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,612
The fresh cabbage looks good.

989
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,946
Smells good.

990
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,349
You have to have good kimchi with stew.

991
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,850
-I agree.
-Yeah.

992
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:47,751
I'm curious.

993
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:50,621
Wow.

994
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:52,923
This…

995
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,426
It tastes fancy.

996
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,827
-It is.
-Yes.

997
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:58,962
It explodes in your mouth.

998
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,265
I make beef stock.

999
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,434
I use the flank and brisket.

1000
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,135
On a monthly basis,

1001
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,971
I use one and a half tons
of flank and brisket.

1002
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,908
For leg bones, I use Hanwoo beef.

1003
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:14,344
By the end of lunch,
we add the beef leg bones.

1004
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,414
Then we boil it until noon the next day,

1005
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,883
so for 22 hours.

1006
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,319
Long ago, someone used to sleep here.

1007
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,122
They'd check the broth and wake at dawn

1008
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,559
to add some water and work all night.

1009
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:32,830
Before we open,
we add bloodless flank and brisket,

1010
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,900
then the knee cartilage, then the tail,
which creates the thick broth.

1011
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,036
A DEEP AND RICH TASTE
CREATED WITH CARE

1012
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:43,373
Apparently, the smell used to spread
up to five kilometers from here.

1013
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,442
I heard someone followed the smell here.

1014
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:52,683
The current method we use
was passed down by my mother.

1015
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:57,955
Using good quality flank and brisket
and making it with care

1016
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,990
creates good broth, I believe.

1017
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,159
THE SEOLLEONGTANG RECIPE
PRESERVED FOR 50 YEARS

1018
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,062
SEOLLEONGTANG

1019
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,730
It looks good.

1020
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:09,767
There's so much meat.

1021
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:10,667
It's heavy.

1022
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,671
The way it's presented is beautiful.

1023
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,119
This bowl is on another plane.

1024
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,254
It's so different.

1025
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,322
Seolleongtang comes from Seoul.

1026
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,525
"Seoul noblemen are picky."

1027
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,327
I think that phrase
could've started with this.

1028
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,329
The broth.

1029
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,497
The meat.

1030
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:41,932
Even the kimchi.

1031
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,170
Everything is up to par. It's perfect.

1032
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:47,070
I agree.

1033
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,106
They would've had this since the past.

1034
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,441
Noblemen sure have good taste.

1035
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:57,548
NOODLES ARE A MUST FOR SEOLLEONGTANG

1036
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,317
Sir, the noodles are plentiful.

1037
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,152
I've never seen this much in here.

1038
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,587
Right, they add so little.

1039
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,390
-Some people only want noodles, no rice.
-Right?

1040
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:07,691
It's a noodle stew.

1041
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,431
The noodles are seasoned.

1042
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,568
-Noodles are made along with salt.
-I see.

1043
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:22,306
A SATISFYING TASTE

1044
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,012
Do you want kkakdugi water?

1045
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,047
The water.

1046
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,115
Sir, can we have kkakdugi juice?

1047
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,384
Kkakdugi juice.

1048
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,352
Cuckoo.

1049
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,387
-Cuckoo.
-Cuckoo.

1050
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,656
THE HIGHLIGHT OF SEOLLEONGTANG
THE KKAKDUGI JUICE

1051
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,024
How many spoons?

1052
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,593
-Trust me.
-All right.

1053
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,596
I'm adding this
because I know its original taste.

1054
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,231
THE SWEET, SPICY AND REFRESHING
KKAKDUGI JUICE

1055
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,932
I wanted to see how it would change.

1056
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,442
I think I failed.

1057
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,546
Why? The sour taste is good.

1058
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,281
I find this charming too.

1059
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:08,352
What's the difference between
seolleongtang and gomtang?

1060
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,286
Seolleongtang…

1061
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:10,420
CURIOUS

1062
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,022
…is boiled casually.

1063
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,192
Then gomtang is boiled carefully?

1064
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,461
Gomtang is boiled carefully.

1065
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,862
Carefully.

1066
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:19,963
How carefully?

1067
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,633
According to what I've read,

1068
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,302
the most accurate to tell
the difference is this.

1069
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,938
If beef leg bones are used,
then it's a seolleongtang.

1070
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,273
SEOLLEONGTANG USES THE BONES

1071
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,843
If the broth is made with meat,
then it's a gomtang.

1072
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,177
GOMTANG USES THE MEAT

1073
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:40,817
100 years ago, weren't there
100 seolleongtang places?

1074
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:44,588
Every vicinity had slaughterhouses.

1075
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:49,626
When they caught anything,
the nobles only ate the meat.

1076
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:53,263
Whereas the remainder,
like the bones, they didn't eat.

1077
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:58,268
So, they were given as payment
to those who slaughtered the animal.

1078
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,437
Then what?

1079
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:04,374
They needed to make money,
not receive more meat.

1080
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:09,913
That's why they developed
seolleongtang and gomtang.

1081
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,649
We came all the way to Seoul station.

1082
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,452
-Let's have one more thing.
-Sure.

1083
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,520
One dogani-tang.

1084
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:17,421
-Dogani-tang?
-Yes.

1085
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,191
This is made with
knee cartilage and tendons.

1086
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,996
We boil it for about an hour.
If the meat is tough, we boil again.

1087
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,903
Oh, it's soft.

1088
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,838
We have to add something.

1089
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,074
Collagen calls for some alcohol.

1090
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,376
To cleanse the oiliness in your mouth.

1091
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:40,477
GIVE

1092
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:41,712
AND TAKE

1093
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,113
One bottle of soju, please.

1094
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,049
You need one glass of this.

1095
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,617
After you had a salty spoonful,

1096
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,088
you cleanse your palette with soju.

1097
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,190
If it gets salty again, another shot.

1098
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:04,668
Gomtang was a nobleman's dish.

1099
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:05,969
Yeah, it was for noblemen.

1100
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,772
Seolleongtang was for commoners.

1101
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,376
It grew with the joys and sorrows
of commoners.

1102
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,945
That's its charm.

1103
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,182
When I think seolleongtang,
I think of franchises.

1104
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,652
That's why I think it has survived well

1105
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,723
and adapted to the times better
than all Korean dishes.

1106
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,859
That's my opinion.

1107
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,060
Seolleongtang, galbitang?

1108
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:31,361
-Seolleongtang.
-Me, too.

1109
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,596
Me, too.

1110
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,731
-It's a heartier dish.
-Yes.

1111
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,700
-I love the milky broth.
-Yes.

1112
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,668
SEOLLEONGTANG, THE ONE BOWL
KOREANS LOVE MOST

1113
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,906
WHAT IS BROTH TO KOREANS?

1114
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,742
Broth has comforted

1115
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:50,313
and strengthened our nation
for a long time.

1116
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,516
A meal without broth

1117
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,818
is unimaginable to us.

1118
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,687
The rice in broth tradition
courses through our blood.

1119
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,357
It's a part of our culture.

1120
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,226
We have broth when we're
in our mother's womb.

1121
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:08,298
A pregnant mother eats seaweed soup

1122
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,566
to nurture her child.

1123
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,868
Even on good occasions,

1124
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,437
like for weddings,

1125
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,107
you spread goodwill with galbitang.

1126
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,177
"When are you buying galbitang?
When are you making noodles?"

1127
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,047
These sayings exist for a reason.
We spread generosity with soup.

1128
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,551
We serve yukgaejang
upon someone's passing.

1129
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:32,456
This shows how from before birth
and until after death

1130
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:36,893
and every moment in between,
broth is always by our side.

1131
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,497
To Koreans, broth is a way of life.

1132
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,865
That's what I think.

1133
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:48,071
BROTH WILL BE WITH US
IN EVERY MOMENT OF OUR LIVES

1134
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:18,969
