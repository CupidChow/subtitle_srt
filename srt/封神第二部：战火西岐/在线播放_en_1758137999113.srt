2
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,600
We carried Yin Jiao all this way.

3
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,730
If you can save him, then do it.

4
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,930
If you can't, just say so.

5
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,480
What are you dawdling for?

6
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Nezha.

7
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Do not be disrespectful.

8
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,350
We were a step too late.

9
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,850
We couldn't save Yin Jiao.

10
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,850
The dead cannot be revived.

11
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,850
That is the immutable way of Heaven.

12
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,850
Yin Jiao is dead.

13
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,600
To save him now would be
to defy the will of Heaven.

14
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,350
Once the way of Heaven is defied

15
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,730
a great catastrophe is sure to follow.

16
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,230
I implore Grand Master to reconsider.

17
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Begin.

18
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,430
Yin Jiao.

19
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,980
You hesitated before the battle.

20
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,030
You disappoint me greatly.

21
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,230
I will bring Father here...

22
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
so our family can be reunited.

23
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,100
What is she doing here?

24
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,180
Get out.

25
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,230
I am willing to offer myself
to the flames in my father's place.

26
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,730
You want my throne?

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,350
Aren't you a little too eager?

28
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,280
<i>Strange.</i>

29
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,100
<i>Yin Jiao is dead</i>

30
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,230
<i>but his vital essence has not dispersed.</i>

31
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,100
<i>Even the Investiture of the Gods cannot claim it.</i>

32
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,150
She is not human. She's a fox demon!

33
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,230
Vile son!
You really are trying to kill your own father!

34
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,100
I accidentally injured you, Father

35
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,980
only because I was trying to slay this demon.

36
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,480
He will be beheaded
at the Meridian Gate tomorrow.

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,850
The life you gave me...

38
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,100
<i>His vital essence lingers...</i>

39
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,230
<i>because his heart is filled with resentment.</i>

40
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,480
<i>It refuses to fade away.</i>

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,730
<i>This is unnatural.
I fear it is a terrible omen.</i>

42
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,730
<i>A person with such deep-seated resentment...</i>

43
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,230
<i>if he is revived,</i>

44
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,230
<i>the consequences will be unimaginable.</i>

45
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,730
I firmly believe that Yin Jiao
is the future ruler of all.

46
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,350
He is the one who can open
the Investiture of the Gods.

47
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,350
The Great Curse is upon us.

48
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,850
Yin Jiao is the last hope for the mortal realm.

49
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,230
And perhaps...

50
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,730
our last hope as well.

51
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,050
Form the array.

52
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,730
This is bad! He's absorbing our magical power!

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,980
Stop channelling your energy!

54
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,730
We can't stop!

55
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,980
The formation is locked. It won't break.

56
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,230
He's absorbing it faster and faster.

57
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,480
If this continues,

58
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,480
he'll drain every last bit of our power.

59
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,000
Grand Master!

60
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,600
He's absorbed all of your power!

61
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,600
We have committed a grave transgression
against Heaven.

62
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,980
<i>Commander Wen Zhong of the Shang Dynasty</i>

63
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,980
<i>campaigned in the North Sea,
fighting bitterly for ten years.</i>

64
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,480
<i>Today, he returns to court in triumph!</i>

65
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,350
I, Wen Zhong, campaigned in the North Sea.

66
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,230
After ten years of bitter war
I have not failed in my duty.

67
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,350
I now return the tally of command.

68
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,850
I, Wen Zhong, campaigned in the North Sea.

69
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,730
After ten years of bitter war
I have not failed in my duty.

70
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,850
I now return the tally of command.

71
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,350
Ji Fa, son of the Western Duke Ji Chang

72
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,980
brazenly tried to assassinate His Majesty

73
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,850
and has rebelled in Xiqi.

74
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,730
His Majesty's life hangs by a thread.

75
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,230
He regrets that he cannot lead
the campaign himself

76
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,850
and asks that the Commander
lead the attack on Xiqi.

77
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,730
I was a servant to the late king.

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,980
Since the late king has passed

79
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,850
I have grown old
and am no longer fit for service.

80
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,350
I wish to retire from my post.

81
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,600
Since you are no longer
willing to serve the state

82
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,850
His Majesty dares not compel you to stay.

83
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,900
It seems

84
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,480
the fate of the great Shang is sealed.

85
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,230
The King still lives

86
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,730
but the great Shang...

87
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,730
is already lost.

88
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,850
I, Deng Chanyu,

89
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,850
ask for permission to march against the rebels.

90
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,600
My late father, Duke Deng Jiu

91
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,100
spent his life on the battlefield

92
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,480
and had the honour of dying for his country.

93
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,600
I have fought by his side since I was young.

94
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,980
I wish to carry on his legacy

95
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,980
and win new glory for the great Shang.

96
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,730
His Majesty asks you to approach.

97
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,350
I will lead 800 cavalry
and the Mo Family Four Generals

98
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,230
and set out immediately.

99
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,230
If I do not capture the rebel Ji Fa

100
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,350
I will offer my life in apology.

101
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,850
I grant you a suit of armour.

102
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,350
Go now.

103
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,850
Fight for me in your dead father's place.

104
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,480
Fight for the great Shang.

105
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,230
Ji Chang, it's a good thing you're dead.

106
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,600
You got off easy.

107
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,850
You won't have to watch as the people of Xiqi

108
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,480
are slaughtered by our great king

109
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,350
one by one.

110
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,100
This is all because you
raised your son so well...

111
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,100
he tried to kill his king and rebel.

112
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,100
Ji Fa.

113
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,980
You don't actually believe
the King is dead, do you?

114
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,230
I killed him with my own hands.

115
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,980
I watched him die.

116
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,100
Ji Fa.

117
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,230
Do you remember this box?

118
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,230
This box...

119
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,350
once held the head of Su Hu.

120
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,100
And this sword...

121
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,980
This is Yin Jiao's Gui Hou Sword.

122
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,100
It was also this sword...

123
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,100
that took Yin Jiao's head.

124
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,850
The King's meaning...

125
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,480
should be clear to you now.

126
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,350
Yin Shou wants my head?

127
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,230
The King, remembering your old bond

128
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,230
is offering you a special kindness.

129
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,480
As long as you

130
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,980
take your own life to atone for your crime

131
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,230
His Majesty will spare Xiqi.

132
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,350
The great Shang army...

133
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,600
is on its way.

134
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,970
Will you die alone?

135
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,350
Or will all of Xiqi

136
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,850
die with you?

137
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,300
I should take your head right now!

138
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,330
Wait!

139
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180

After them!

181
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,730
This is a good place for an ambush.

182
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,730
Only one of the Mo Family Four Generals
followed us.

183
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,100
Should we wait, General?

184
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,730
Dismount and surrender!

185
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,230
You're the one who should surrender.

186
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,480
Mo Liqing!

187
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,430
Fire!

188
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,730
Let them see the power
of the Azure Cloud Sword.

189
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,550
Archers!

190
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,230
Get out of here!

191
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,850
Fall back to Xiqi City!

192
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,850
General Deng.

193
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,600
General Deng.

194
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,030
With skills like yours

195
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,050
you dare to rebel?

196
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,890
Do you have any idea what Yin Shou has done?

197
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,480
You dare speak the King's name?

198
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,730
Your king...

199
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,600
murdered his father and brother

200
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,600
to usurp the throne.

201
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,520
He took the fox demon Daji as his consort.

202
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,730
He killed Queen Jiang,

203
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,230
Grand Tutor Bi Gan

204
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,280
and Crown Prince Yin Jiao.

205
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,600
He framed the Four Grand Dukes for treason

206
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,230
and had them all put to death.

207
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,350
He even had my elder brother, Bo Yikao

208
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,850
cooked into a meat pie
and tricked my father into eating it.

209
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,700
If you were me

210
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,590
would you not rebel?

211
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,350
Why would I believe the words of a rebel?

212
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,050
Danger!

213
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,600
Danger!

214
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,980
Hurry, untie me!

215
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,100
I can help you!

216
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,930
Silence!

217
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,150
Look out!

218
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,350
Get out of the way!

219
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,600
Move!

220
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,730
Five-Colored Stone, return!

221
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,730
Come back and bite my hook when you're bigger.

222
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,980
Shen Gongbao.

223
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,350
Did you really think a few mangy crows

224
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,100
would be enough to find me?

225
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,920
Help!

226
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,850
Yang Jian! Nezha, help me!

227
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,850
What are you doing here?

228
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,850
My trousers!

229
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
My trousers going to fall off!

230
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Gently!

231
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,850
Leave them! Leave a few!

232
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,600
Or we'll both fall to our deaths!

233
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,980
Yin Jiao was beheaded.

234
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,480
I didn't expect that your father would also...

235
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,850
You should get out of here.

236
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,230
It's too dangerous.

237
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
What?

238
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,850
The flames of war have reached Xiqi.

239
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,100
I've already given the order

240
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,230
for the people to abandon Xiqi City

241
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,350
and retreat deep into Mount Qi.

242
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,100
I'll lead some men to delay the Shang army

243
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,730
buy as much time as possible.

244
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,480
Abandon Xiqi City?

245
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,480
You are the lord of Xiqi!

246
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,730
Are you just going to hand
Xiqi City over to Yin Shou?

247
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,850
Xiqi hasn't fought a war in hundreds of years.

248
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,600
We are no match for the great Shang.

249
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,350
I just fought them.

250
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,480
I see no chance of victory.

251
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,600
I no longer have the right to be their leader.

252
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,550
I understand.

253
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,100
I have a plan

254
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,730
that could solve Xiqi's troubles.

255
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
How about this?

256
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:07,850
You offer me and the Investiture of the Gods
to Yin Shou.

257
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,350
Yin Shou will be delighted

258
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,850
and he might just spare Xiqi.

259
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,030
You might even get an official title out of it.

260
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,230
Wouldn't that be nice?

261
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,930
You!

262
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,230
the Investiture of the Gods
must never fall into Yin Shou's hands.

263
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,480
So you're not a complete fool.

264
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,600
If Xiqi falls,
no one will be left to oppose Yin Shou.

265
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,230
Then he truly will become the ruler of all.

266
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,730
I'm the one Yin Shou wants.

267
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,730
I don't want to drag anyone else into this.

268
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,600
I've already caused the deaths
of my father and brother.

269
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:56,230
Now I've turned Xiqi into a battlefield.

270
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,980
I don't want anyone else to die because of me.

271
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,980
It was Yin Shou who killed your father
and your brother

272
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,430
not you.

273
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,600
If you die,

274
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,850
the world truly will belong to Yin Shou.

275
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,730
You can die and be free of your guilt

276
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,850
but what about the people who are left behind?

277
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,730
You have the courage to die for your guilt.

278
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,350
But do you have the courage
to live for the people of Xiqi?

279
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,050
It's over...

280
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,350
An even bigger one is coming.

281
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,350
His Majesty has appointed Yin Qi as Crown Prince.

282
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,100
We have come to report to the ancestors.

283
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,980
We humbly ask for the ancestors' blessings.

284
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,850
May the great Shang dynasty

285
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,980
be passed down through the generations

286
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,230
and endure for ten thousand years.

287
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,780
Assassins!

288
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,980
Protect the King!

289
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,230
Protect the Crown Prince!

290
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,850
Father!

291
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,980
Father!

292
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,730
Help me!

293
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,100
Father.

294
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,980
Yin Shou...

295
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,850
Help me...

296
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,230
Help me!

297
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Don't be afraid.

298
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,350
It was only a dream.

299
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,600
I can never forget...

300
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,230
the smell of burning skin.

301
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,430
They...

302
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,350
We have already killed them.

303
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,730
They can't hurt you anymore.

304
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
I thought...

305
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,480
that if I became king

306
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,230
I could control my own destiny.

307
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,230
But I never imagined...

308
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,730
that Heaven would be so unfair to me.

309
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,980
I am here.

310
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,560
You will not die.

311
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
My King...

312
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,480
will be king for a long, long time.

313
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,350
What's happened to you?

314
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,230
I am using my magic

315
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,850
to transfer your wounds

316
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,600
onto myself.

317
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,850
In just 49 days

318
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,980
you will be fully healed.

319
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,100
Why are you doing this?

320
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,230
You'll die.

321
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,600
You can possess another body, can't you?

322
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,850
Whose body do you desire?

323
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
I will kill them for you.

324
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,100
My King.

325
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,600
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

326
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,350
the Investiture of the Gods has been found.

327
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:41,980
Where is it?

328
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,350
Jiang Ziya has taken the Investiture of the Gods

329
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,230
and is hiding in Xiqi.

330
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,850
Xiqi again.

331
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,480
You cannot go.

332
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,350
The magic is not yet complete.

333
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,480
I fear that before you even reach Xiqi

334
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,730
you will die on the road.

335
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,600
We must obtain the Investiture of the Gods.

336
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,650
Why are they...

337
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Look.

338
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,350
The people of Xiqi have not given up.

339
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,930
Chop!

340
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,050
Thrust!

341
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,930
Chop! Chop!

342
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
It's the Marquis!

343
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,730
The Marquis is back!

344
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,480
The Marquis is back!

345
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,100
We knew you would return!

346
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,180
Marquis!

347
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,100
Xiqi is saved!

348
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,550
We're saved!

349
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,550
Marquis!

350
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,850
We thought we'd never see you again!

351
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,350
Why haven't you retreated to Mount Qi?

352
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,430
All of Xiqi has taken up arms!

353
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,350
We will follow your command
and fight the great Shang to the death!

354
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,730
Fight to the death!

355
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm the one Yin Shou wants.

356
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,850
I don't want you to die because of me.

357
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Child.

358
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,100
You are wrong.

359
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,100
We aren't staying to fight for you.

360
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,850
We are fighting for ourselves.

361
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,850
Xiqi is your home.

362
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,730
But it's our home, too.

363
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,350
We will defend Xiqi!

364
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,600
Old man.

365
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,730
You're an immortal.

366
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,100
I used to be.

367
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,600
They certainly arrived quickly.

368
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,730
Those giants with magical powers
are the hardest to deal with.

369
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,650
You're an immortal.

370
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,850
You must know some magic, right?

371
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,850
I used to.

372
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,530
And now?

373
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,100
Now, I only know how to fish.

374
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,100
An army is at our gates!

375
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,230
What good is fishing?

376
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,850
Because I don't see an army.

377
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,850
I only see a very big fish.

378
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,530
Old man.

379
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,100
When is the best time for fishing?

380
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,350
Night is the best time for a catch.

381
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,980
Seeing you,

382
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,350
always reminds me of my late father.

383
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,230
It pains my heart.

384
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,980
I have already retired from my post.

385
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,850
I am no longer the Commander.

386
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,980
Yes.

387
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,480
You are no longer the Commander.

388
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,230
If I should fall in battle

389
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,350
you will be king.

390
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,480
I was not able to protect my father's kingdom.

391
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,850
But at least...

392
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,850
I can still entrust my father's kingdom

393
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,350
to the person he trusted most.

394
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,350
Why do you speak such words, Your Majesty?

395
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,230
the Investiture of the Gods is in Xiqi.

396
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,850
If I want to end the Great Curse

397
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,850
and protect the Shang dynasty

398
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,480
I must lead this campaign myself

399
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,730
and get the Investiture of the Gods.

400
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,730
the Investiture of the Gods...

401
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,100
Can it truly end the Great Curse?

402
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,430
Mo Liqing!

403
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,550
Come back!

404
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,050
Quick!

405
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,980
General!

406
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,050
Report!

407
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,350
Xiqi launched a night attack.

408
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,430
The camp is in chaos!

409
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,050
Give the order.

410
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,850
Hold your positions!

411
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,430
Go.

412
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,480
Untie the horses' reins!

413
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
Go!

414
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,600
Mo Lihai!

415
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,980
Get back here!

416
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,730
Didn't I order you to hold your positions?

417
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,850
It was that big green bird from the gorge!

418
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,230
He stole Mo Liqing's sword!

419
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,100
All four of the Mo Family Generals
went after him!

420
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,600
Should I go and bring them back?

421
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,680
No.

422
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,980
Set up defenses immediately.

423
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,730
Protect the main camp.

424
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,050
Yes!

425
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,050
Fire!

426
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:48,930
Fire!

427
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,550
Old immortal.

428
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,350
Your fishing technique really worked.

429
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,230
A pity.

430
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,730
We only caught a small fish.

431
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,480
This isn't considered a big fish?

432
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,600
The real big fish is Deng Chanyu.

433
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,600
Then what about Deng Chanyu?

434
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,850
To capture the thieves,
you must first capture their king.

435
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,850
Luring away the Mo Family Four Generals
to capture Deng Chanyu in the chaos...

436
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,350
that was the objective!

437
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,100
Mo Liqing killed our brother, Tai Dian!

438
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,480
We must avenge him!

439
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,350
What is more important?

440
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,100
This opportunity cannot be missed.

441
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,100
As the commander

442
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,850
you let a golden opportunity slip away!

443
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
At dawn...

444
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,980
there will be a fierce battle.

445
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,350
Even though we killed Mo Liqing

446
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,400
the remaining three...

447
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,730
will be even harder to deal with.

448
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,350
If we can kill one Mo Liqing

449
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,350
we can kill the other three.

450
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,530
General,

451
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,480
Xiqi's morale is high
after their successful raid last night.

452
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,350
If we attack now, might it be...

453
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,350
Those who chase small victories
will suffer great defeats.

454
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,480
That young pup Ji Fa knows nothing of war.

455
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:58,100
Today, I will teach him a lesson.

456
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,550
Kill!

457
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,680
Fire!

458
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,730
What kind of magic is this?

459
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,730
This is Mo Lihong's Chaos-Origin Umbrella.

460
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,730
Fall back into the city!

461
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,300
Retreat!

462
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,730
Quickly, retreat! Retreat!

463
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,350
The Wind-Fire Pipa again

464
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:13,980
and the Chaos-Origin Umbrella!

465
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,730
Everyone, be careful!

466
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,100
Kill!

467
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
Lei Zhenzi!

468
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,980
Raise the drawbridge!

469
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,680
Wait!

470
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,850
Raise it! Quickly!

471
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,600
Raise the drawbridge!

472
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,430
Attack!

473
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,300
Today,

474
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,230
we will breach Xiqi!

475
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,480
Hold the gate!

476
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,100
It's the Flower Fox Marten
a master of burrowing!

477
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,180
Fall back!

478
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,100
What is that monster?

479
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,980
Could this be...

480
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,230
Who else could it be?

481
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,980
This is Yin Jiao
having absorbed the Master's power

482
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,100
manifesting this three-headed, six-armed form.

483
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,230
Go and help Yin Jiao!

484
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,480
Master Uncle, don't worry.

485
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:10,930
This can't hurt him.

486
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,730
He has plenty more tricks up his sleeve.

487
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,230
Xiqi is saved.

488
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,730
The world is saved.

489
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Don't move.

490
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,680
A practitioner of the immortal arts

491
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
cannot take a life!

492
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,730
You're finally awake.

493
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,230
Where's my armour?

494
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,310
I took it off for you.

495
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,780
If I hadn't taken it off

496
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,100
you would have drowned.

497
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,600
I saved your life.

498
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,100
You owe me a favour in return.

499
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,600
Tie me up.

500
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,300
I surrender.

501
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,350
You haven't lost yet.

502
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,100
Why surrender?

503
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,480
I followed Yin Shou

504
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:21,980
and helped annihilate Jizhou City.

505
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,350
I destroyed someone else's home
with my own hands.

506
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:31,350
Now my home is about to be destroyed.

507
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,730
I don't want Xiqi to become the next Jizhou.

508
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,850
I did my best.

509
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:43,980
My sword can no longer protect Xiqi.

510
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,850
I can only offer my life.

511
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,100
Attacking from behind, General Deng...

512
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:52,850
Truly courageous.

513
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:54,550
Cut the crap.

514
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,850
You won't escape this time.

515
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:58,550
Don't worry.

516
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:00,100
I'm not running anymore.

517
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,230
Surrendering myself

518
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,980
is the only way to save Xiqi.

519
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:08,980
Then you should have surrendered earlier.

520
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:12,350
Then so many people
wouldn't have died because of you.

521
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,600
They died to protect their home.

522
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,350
Don't you have a home?

523
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,100
I grew up on the battlefield.

524
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,300
I have no home.

525
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,600
Then you must at least have family.

526
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,850
I am the only one left in the Deng family.

527
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,730
One day, I will be just like my father

528
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,180
dying on the field of battle.

529
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,100
I will not disgrace the Deng family name.

530
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:56,430
I never thought...

531
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,480
that we are both fighting for our families.

532
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:06,900
Then do you know

533
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:07,980
the difference between us?

534
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:11,550
I won.

535
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,150
You lost.

536
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,180
No.

537
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,480
I fight for the living.

538
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,550
And you?

539
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,480
You fight for the dead.

540
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,550
Eat.

541
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,850
Is it sweet?

542
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:26,980
Eat some more.

543
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,980
My vital essence is nearly depleted.

544
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,980
I can no longer leave this body.

545
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,980
My body will soon begin to rot.

546
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,850
For the great Shang...

547
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,350
I have fought my entire life.

548
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,730
Before I die, how can I

549
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,100
watch it fall to ruin?

550
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:39,550
It's General Deng!

551
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:42,900
General Deng!

552
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:44,230
We've found you!

553
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,730
The Commander's army
has crossed the Yellow River

554
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,230
and is waiting to rendezvous with us.

555
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:29,350
I led a great army all the way here.

556
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:33,100
We haven't fought a single battle,
nor fired a single arrow.

557
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,550
Ji Fa,

558
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,850
you are already surrendering
and admitting your guilt?

559
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,350
I am not admitting guilt.

560
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,350
I am only admitting defeat.

561
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,230
I'm the one Yin Shou wants.

562
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,730
Withdraw your troops
and spare the people of Xiqi.

563
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,980
I will return to Chaoge with you.

564
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,600
You are in no position to bargain with me.

565
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:51,480
Xiqi has rebelled.

566
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,100
The city must be purged

567
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,480
to uphold the might of the great Shang.

568
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:56,550
Commander.

569
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,230
Why did Xiqi rebel?

570
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:59,730
Surely you must know.

571
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:01,730
Loyalty must be unconditional.

572
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:06,350
Only rebels try to find excuses
for their actions.

573
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:14,480
They all say the Commander

574
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,230
is a just man

575
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,850
who can distinguish right from wrong.

576
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:21,980
I never thought

577
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,480
you too would become Yin Shou's attack dog.

578
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,300
Behave yourself!

579
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:30,430
Kneel!

580
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,350
In serving the great Shang loyally

581
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,850
what is wrong with being an attack dog?

582
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,680
Commander.

583
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,850
Since Ji Fa has already surrendered

584
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:48,350
why do you insist on attacking Xiqi?

585
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,230
This slap...

586
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:53,980
is on behalf of your father.

587
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:55,980
As the vanguard

588
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:57,980
you were defeated and disgraced.

589
01:08:58,430 --> 01:08:59,600
Not only did you bring shame upon me

590
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,480
you have shamed the Deng family name.

591
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,480
Instead of seeking to redeem your honour

592
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,230
you plead for the rebels?

593
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,230
I only remember my father telling me

594
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,350
that slaughtering civilians

595
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,100
is the greatest shame a soldier can bear.

596
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,180
Insolence!

597
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,000
Annihilate Xiqi.

598
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,090
Leave no one alive.

599
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,230
This is an order from the King.

600
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,680
General.

601
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:34,100
This is our chance to earn great merit.

602
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,980
For the glory of the Deng family

603
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:37,400
we cannot afford to be merciful.

604
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:38,430
Silence!

605
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,600
When have you ever seen
my father slaughter the innocent?

606
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,980
My blade can kill enemies

607
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,480
but it will never kill civilians.

608
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,300
Follow me.

609
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,150
Who goes there?

610
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,180
Out of the way!

611
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:43,980
Stop them!

612
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,100
Close the gate!

613
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,230
Close the gate!

614
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
It's General Deng!

615
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,730
Why did you save me?

616
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:05,350
A life for a life.

617
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,980
Now I owe you nothing.

618
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:37,100
Stop!

619
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:00,550
Ji Fa!

620
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:02,580
You go on ahead!

621
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:18,230
Insolent Wen Zhong!

622
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,100
You see me, Yin Jiao,

623
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,100
and you do not kneel?

624
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,230
You are His Highness, the Crown Prince?

625
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,850
I am the 31st generation descendant of King Tang.

626
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:33,730
Crown Prince of the great Shang, Yin Jiao.

627
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,230
How did you become like this?

628
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,850
It was Yin Shou who killed me.

629
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:43,100
Can it be that you do not know?

630
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:46,850
Yin Shou murdered his father and brother

631
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,600
killed his wife and son,

632
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,600
and conspired with a fox demon

633
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,230
to usurp the throne.

634
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:55,480
And yet you still serve him?

635
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,230
I am serving the great Shang.

636
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,350
I am the Crown Prince of the great Shang.

637
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,680
Kneel.

638
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,100
Pledge your loyalty to me.

639
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,480
You are the Crown Prince.

640
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,480
Yin Shou is the King.

641
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:12,480
If I obey his command and kill you

642
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,850
at worst I will be called foolishly loyal.

643
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:17,980
But if I pledge loyalty to you and oppose him

644
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:19,980
that would be treason.

645
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,350
I would rather be foolishly loyal

646
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,100
than commit treason.

647
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:26,350
You old fool.

648
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:29,980
You only care about your own empty reputation.

649
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,980
You are not foolishly loyal.

650
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,480
You are just a fool.

651
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,350
I will spare your life for now.

652
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,980
Go back and tell Yin Shou

653
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,730
that Yin Jiao have returned.

654
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,350
If you dare set foot in Xiqi again

655
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:52,230
I will kill you.

656
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:10,050
You're home.

657
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:13,930
By freeing me,

658
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,550
you are now just like me...

659
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:17,480
a rebel of the Shang dynasty.

660
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:26,230
I have only one regret.

661
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,730
That I could not die in battle
alongside my father.

662
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:42,480
You still have a chance.

663
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:48,230
You should die beside your family.

664
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:57,980
Open the gate!

665
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,600
Marquis!

666
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,050
The Marquis is back!

667
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:04,430
Marquis!

668
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,530
Marquis!

669
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:08,550
My Lord Marquis!

670
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,980
General Deng is not an enemy.

671
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,350
She is the one who saved my life.

672
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,100
Thank you General Deng
for escorting Ji Fa back.

673
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,850
Since you're already at our doorstep

674
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,480
there is no need to see him any further.

675
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:28,930
Please return.

676
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:43,100
She is now my guest.

677
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,850
Our two armies are facing each other.

678
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,100
For General Deng to remain in Xiqi City...

679
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,230
I'm afraid that would be inconvenient.

680
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,850
She has nowhere else to go.

681
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,230
To send her away now...

682
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:00,850
is to send her to her death!

683
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,600
Ji Fa.

684
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,600
Do you still recognise me?

685
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
Yin Jiao.

686
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,980
Do you remember who you are?

687
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,180
I do.

688
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:51,850
I am Yin Jiao.

689
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,350
And who is Yin Jiao?

690
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:57,550
Yin Jiao...

691
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,100
is the 31st generation descendant of King Tang

692
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:01,850
the Crown Prince of the great Shang.

693
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,100
But my father killed me.

694
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,600
He didn't just kill me

695
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,230
he also killed my mother!

696
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,730
It was the resentment in your heart

697
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,480
that kept your spirit
from scattering after death.

698
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,230
You absorbed my magical power

699
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,600
and became what you are now.

700
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,850
You must learn to control your anger.

701
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,730
Otherwise, one day

702
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,100
your anger will control you.

703
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,350
When that happens

704
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,730
you will no longer be yourself.

705
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:42,980
I would rather remain angry.

706
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,350
I want revenge against Yin Shou.

707
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,230
Jiang Ziya had us save you

708
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,480
because he hoped you would return
to the world of the living

709
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,350
and become the ruler of all

710
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,980
to open the Investiture of the Gods

711
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,350
and save the world.

712
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:04,730
To do this, he sacrificed all of his powers

713
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,480
and became a mortal.

714
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,230
You are the last hope for the mortal realm.

715
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,350
I pray you will not fail him.

716
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,100
I am going to Chaoge

717
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:16,930
to kill Yin Shou

718
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:19,980
and avenge my mother and myself.

719
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,230
You must not go to Chaoge alone.

720
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:26,730
If you do, you will surely meet with disaster.

721
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,600
Remember this. Remember.

722
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:34,350
Jiang Ziya is in Xiqi
helping your friend Ji Fa.

723
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,730
They need you now.

724
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:53,930
I didn't expect

725
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,980
this sword to be with you.

726
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:02,550
You have returned.

727
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:04,480
It belongs to its rightful owner.

728
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,640
If one day...

729
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:12,730
I don't remember who I am.

730
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,420
You want to use this to remind me

731
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,850
that it was this sword...

732
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,550
that took my head.

733
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,350
♪ Don your armour, take up your shield ♪

734
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:44,980
♪ And march to the four corners of the land ♪

735
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:48,480
♪ Ready my spear and my halberd ♪

736
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,350
We can fight side-by-side again.

737
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,300
Ji Fa.

738
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:01,230
I truly envy you.

739
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,480
You can fight for your family.

740
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,550
But I...

741
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,600
I have no family.

742
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:22,600
I only have enemies.

743
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,180
Don't worry.

744
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,850
Once we defeat Wen Zhong

745
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,980
and unite the dukes of the four states

746
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,350
we will march on Chaoge.

747
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,850
I will use this sword...

748
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:42,350
to kill Yin Shou

749
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,100
and avenge you.

750
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,850
I must kill him with my own hands.

751
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:16,980
Don't come any closer.

752
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:22,100
Don't look at me like this.

753
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:29,100
Every scar on your body came from me.

754
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,350
You are suffering in my place.

755
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,480
You can search the entire world

756
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:43,730
and choose a younger,

757
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:46,100
more beautiful woman

758
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,850
to continue to accompany you.

759
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,740
You are one of a kind.

760
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:03,480
No one can replace you.

761
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,980
They will only remember you
at your most beautiful.

762
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,180
Reporting to Your Majesty.

763
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,230
An urgent message from Commander Wen.

764
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:35,930
Read it.

765
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,350
Has the Commander found
the Investiture of the Gods?

766
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,850
The Commander says...

767
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,230
that Yin Jiao is still alive.

768
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,350
The Commander also says...

769
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,850
Yin Jiao is Your Majesty's only son.

770
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:52,100
After you pass from this world

771
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,980
the great Shang dynasty must have an heir.

772
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:58,100
He hopes Your Majesty will pardon Yin Jiao

773
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:02,100
and reinstate him as Crown Prince.

774
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:15,930
Good.

775
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:18,730
Send word to Wen Zhong.

776
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,230
As long as he can annihilate Xiqi

777
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,850
and get the Investiture of the Gods,

778
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:24,730
I will grant his request.

779
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,850
Go now!

780
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:36,980
Pardon Yin Jiao?

781
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,730
Have you forgotten Ji Chang's prophecy?

782
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,980
The elite armies of Shang
are all under Wen Zhong's command.

783
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,600
For now, I can only placate him.

784
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,100
Once I have the Investiture of the Gods

785
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,850
it won't be too late to eliminate him then.

786
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:21,810
...

787
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:27,600
Shen Gongbao.

788
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:30,100
You failed to get the Investiture of the Gods.

789
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,480
And you still dare to show your face before me?

790
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:37,850
Those Kunlun Taoists
are truly insidious and cunning.

791
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:40,980
But I have already discovered his whereabouts.

792
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:43,730
I beg you to bestow another treasure upon me

793
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:47,980
and give your disciple a chance
to atone for his failure.

794
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,230
The day I emerge from my seclusion is not far.

795
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,480
Take this gourd.

796
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:15,100
It will help you.

797
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,850
This is the Five Poisons Gourd.

798
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:22,100
It can transform living people into Gu Soldiers,

799
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,730
yours to command.

800
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,180
Let's go!

801
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,680
Go!

802
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:40,430
Move it!

803
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:41,550
Go!

804
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:45,480
The King is finally going to forgive us.

805
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,350
Your brothers...

806
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:56,480
Yin Jiao, Ji Fa, Jiang Wenhuan, E Shun...

807
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:59,600
every one of them betrayed me.

808
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,730
I locked you in the dungeons

809
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:05,600
to test your loyalty.

810
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,730
Today, I am giving you a chance.

811
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:16,480
Are you willing to prove your loyalty?

812
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,980
We will be loyal to the King forever!

813
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,230
Are you willing to prove it with your lives?

814
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,980
We are!

815
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:38,480
What is Kunlun compared to us?

816
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:39,600
When it comes to magic

817
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,730
we from Golden Turtle Island are the true masters.

818
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,230
These Gu Soldiers...

819
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,350
have no emotions

820
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:02,600
and no fear.

821
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,350
They only know one thing:

822
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:08,350
Obedience.

823
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,150
How old is this wine?

824
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,030
We won't go home till we're drunk!

825
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:32,900
At least 30 years.

826
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:34,100
All the more reason
to make sure they never return!

827
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,850
They'll never return!

828
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:39,100
Hey!

829
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,980
Don't take it all!

830
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,230
Leave some, leave some!

831
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,230
We must drink our fill tonight!

832
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:52,780
Marquis,

833
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,350
he's nearly emptied the storeroom!

834
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,100
Tonight's wine...

835
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,100
must be plentiful!

836
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:00,980
Not just because we won a great victory

837
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:02,350
but more importantly

838
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,100
Yin Jiao is back.

839
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:05,730
My brother is back.

840
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,730
The future ruler of all has returned!

841
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:11,300
Come.

842
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:14,180
Come!

843
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,600
You shouldn't look so glum.

844
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,050
Cheer up.

845
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:26,930
Drink up!

846
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:29,600
Come, Marquis.

847
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:13,930
Thanks.

848
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,230
Today we drink to victory!

849
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,800
But when...

850
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,850
can we drink to the wedding of you two?

851
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:37,850
Wedding wine!

852
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:53,980
We practitioners of the immortal arts

853
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,050
are forbidden from drinking alcohol.

854
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:00,180
Be careful.

855
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:05,230

I know what you're thinking.

You wish you could kill Yin Shou right now.

869
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,230
But you shouldn't go to Chaoge alone.

870
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,730
You should lead the people

Dance!

960
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,230
I'm busy with important matters of the world!

961
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:28,480
The happiness of the common people

962
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,350
is the most important matter of the world!

963
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,850
Dance! Dance!

964
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,480
The Ten Absolutes Killing Formation

965
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,350
traps and locks the soul.

966
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,600
Drink this enchanted water.

967
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,730
Only then can you be protected.

968
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:36,230
Fill your bowls!

969
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:49,600
Rise!

970
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:54,180
Drink!

971
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:45,480
After tonight,

972
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:50,730
not a single living person
will be allowed to remain in Xiqi.

973
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:54,230
Warriors of the great Shang.

974
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:57,350
I will stand guard here

975
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:01,350
and await your triumphant return.

976
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,680
What is it?

977
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,850
For some reason,
the light of the stars and moon is gone.

978
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:27,230
This is not good.

979
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:40,650
Enemy troops!

980
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,730
Archers!

981
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:43,600
Archers!

982
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:44,930
Forward!

983
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:47,430
Light the torches!

984
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:49,980
Fire!

985
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:55,850
Prepare for battle!

986
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:39,350
Everyone, don't get caught in the light!

987
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,800
Everyone, stay in the shadows!

988
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:42,680
Fall back!

989
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:53,850
What kind of dark magic is this?

990
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,350
He's still alive,

991
01:41:57,430 --> 01:41:58,850
but his body is paralysed.

992
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:01,600
Then doesn't that make them
lambs to the slaughter?

993
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:04,600
We have to find a way

994
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:06,350
to destroy these mirrors.

995
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,300
Watch out!

996
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:58,550
Fall back!

997
01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:03,980
Though heaven and earth are dark,

998
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:05,730
The bronze mirrors gleam with light.

999
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:06,980
When a man is caught in their sight,

1000
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,350
His soul is pulled away.

1001
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:09,980
Bound and waiting for the slaughter,

1002
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,480
Like a lamb he stands as prey.

1003
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,230
When the Ten Absolutes arise,

1004
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,230
Both men and immortals die.

1005
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:18,730
It's the Ten Absolutes Formation,
which steals a person's three souls and seven spirits!

1006
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:22,930
Can it be broken?

1007
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:26,230
To break this formation

1008
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,730
we must find the location of Wen Zhong's altar.

1009
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,600
Hurry, split up and search for it.

1010
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,680
Right.

1011
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:45,600
We must hold the city gate!

1012
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:47,480
And quickly, inform the citizens.

1013
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,280
Reinforce the gate!

1014
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:49,650
Yes!

1015
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:50,680
Go!

1016
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,600
One, two, ram!

1017
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,180
Heart Mirror Light!

1018
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:07,930
Quick!

1019
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:14,310
The mirror light!

1020
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,730
We can't go through!

1021
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,730
Lu Gongwang!

1022
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:30,100
Give it to me!

1023
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:33,230
Don't go through!

1024
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,800
Let's go!

1025
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:58,600
Lu Gongwang!

1026
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:17,480
Quick, get the citizens
into the Marquis's estate!

1027
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:18,550
Hurry!

1028
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:50,850
Kill!

1029
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,850
Leave no one alive except the Crown Prince.

1030
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:05,980
Kill them all!

1031
01:47:07,550 --> 01:47:08,730
Burn it down!

1032
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,180
Get down!

1033
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:46,980
Surround him!

1034
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:56,800
Mother!

1035
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,180
Mother!

1036
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:08,030
Get that old man!

1037
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:09,230
He's Jiang Ziya!

1038
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:10,780
Stop!

1039
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:11,650
Nezha!

1040
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:12,730
Yang Jian!

1041
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:15,730
Those two...

1042
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:18,050
Stop!

1043
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:25,730
Yang Jian!

1044
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,230
Water Escape!

1045
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:30,230
Water Escape!

1046
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:32,980
Water Escape!

1047
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,150
Escape!

1048
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:36,230
Water Escape!

1049
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,650
Those two...

1050
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,100
You're never around when I need you!

1051
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:40,680
Water Escape!

1052
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:46,780
Master Uncle!

1053
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,800
Are you alright?

1054
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:02,100
Master Uncle, I'm back!

1055
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:04,930
Watch out for the mirror light!

1056
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:08,300
Master Uncle!

1057
01:49:14,050 --> 01:49:14,900
Master Uncle!

1058
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:16,230
It's too dark outside the city.

1059
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,300
We couldn't see anything.

1060
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:19,980
We searched everywhere
but didn't find any altar.

1061
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,100
Wen Zhong must have used some dark magic

1062
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:24,230
to hide his tracks.

1063
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:25,930
Old man,

1064
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:27,850
is there any other way?

1065
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:43,350
I'm so stupid.

1066
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:45,850
I was looking for Wen Zhong...

1067
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,730
but Wen Zhong was also looking for me.

1068
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:56,530
Quick!

1069
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:57,550
Get inside!

1070
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:58,680
Get up!

1071
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:03,850
Quick, get everyone away
from the doors and windows!

1072
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:05,850
Move inside, quickly!

1073
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:07,430
Be careful!

1074
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:09,350
Away from the doors and windows!

1075
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:15,180
Give it to me.

1076
01:50:16,430 --> 01:50:18,850
<i>Out of respect for my relationship
with your father</i>

1077
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:21,230
I'll give you one more chance.

1078
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:24,730
As long as you can help me get something

1079
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:27,980
<i>I can let the people of Xiqi live.</i>

1080
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:32,050
What is it?

1081
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:34,230
the Investiture of the Gods.

1082
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:36,780
Search carefully.

1083
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,980
Don't miss a single one!

1084
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:39,600
<i>Go into Xiqi City</i>

1085
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:41,850
<i>capture Jiang Ziya alive.</i>

1086
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:44,730
<i>The Investiture of the Gods is on his person.</i>

1087
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:46,800
<i>Xiqi City...</i>

1088
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:49,680
<i>How can I get inside?</i>

1089
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,350
<i>If you go and free Ji Fa</i>

1090
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:54,480
<i>won't that get you inside?</i>

1091
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:03,730
I can help you put on a show.

1092
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:22,730
I guessed correctly.

1093
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,100
You really did come
for the Investiture of the Gods.

1094
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,100
Red Armillary Sash, block the mirror light!

1095
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,280
Watch the light!

1096
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:15,150
Quick!

1097
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:16,230
Everyone, faster!

1098
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:29,930
Earth Escape!

1099
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:37,430
Are you alright?

1100
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:41,930
Fire Escape!

1101
01:52:51,930 --> 01:52:52,980
I'll leave him to you.

1102
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:54,850
Ma'am, come.

1103
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:04,180
Wood Escape!

1104
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,480
Universe Ring, go!

1105
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:33,480
Search house by house!

1106
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:36,100
Drag out every living,
breathing person you find!

1107
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:42,430
Careful!

1108
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:57,850
We agreed on a three-day limit.

1109
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:00,100
Why did you attack the city ahead of time?

1110
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:05,350
You actually managed to bring back
Jiang Ziya and the Investiture of the Gods.

1111
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:08,100
You are truly Duke Deng Jiu's daughter.

1112
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:10,600
You promised me

1113
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:12,730
you would let the people of Xiqi live.

1114
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:15,350
Stop the attack immediately.

1115
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,100
You have already done
what you were supposed to do.

1116
01:54:19,550 --> 01:54:21,350
Now give me the Investiture of the Gods.

1117
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:23,480
If you do not stop the attack

1118
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,600
you can forget about
getting the Investiture of the Gods.

1119
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:27,850
The King's order...

1120
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:31,350
is to kill every single person in Xiqi.

1121
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:33,230
Once the Yin hour (3-5 am) has passed

1122
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:37,100
all those whose souls
have been locked by the mirror light

1123
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:38,850
will die.

1124
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,100
Did you really believe

1125
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:43,480
that I would defy the King's command

1126
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:46,100
and make a deal with you?

1127
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,850
Take the Investiture of the Gods

1128
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:54,930
and go!

1129
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:57,230
That boy wasn't wrong about you.

1130
01:54:57,930 --> 01:54:59,850
You aren't helping them.

1131
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:02,730
You're helping Xiqi.

1132
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:17,100
Then we'll go fishing one more time.

1133
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:20,980
This time, I'll be the bait.

1134
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,980
Then who is the fish?

1135
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:28,350
The willing one will take the hook.

1136
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:32,230
As long as the Investiture of the Gods survives

1137
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:33,430
there is still hope.

1138
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,300
Keep it safe.

1139
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:39,850
When the time comes,
I will use a firework as a signal.

1140
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:41,230
Follow the firework

1141
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,480
and you will find Wen Zhong's altar.

1142
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,100
The heart of the Ten Absolutes Formation

1143
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:47,100
must be at his altar.

1144
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:49,230
Destroy its heart

1145
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:51,480
and the Ten Absolutes Formation
will break on its own.

1146
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,350
How dare you plot against me!

1147
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:58,850
Go, kill them!

1148
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:16,850
Yin Jiao, you're too late!

1149
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,230
Ji Fa, you're too slow!

1150
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:41,350
Ji Fa, my body is getting heavier.

1151
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:42,850
Yin Jiao, hang on!

1152
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,600
Yin Jiao, you can't be this useless!

1153
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:04,850
Yin Jiao, don't fall!

1154
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:06,350
We still have to go kill Yin Shou together!

1155
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:08,350
Ji Fa, it's up to you now!

1156
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:15,980
Yin Jiao!

1157
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:21,780
Go!

1158
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:22,800
To the altar!

1159
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,480
Lei Zhenzi, watch out for the mirror light!

1160
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:44,430
Lei Zhenzi!

1161
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,100
Charge!

1162
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:22,930
Ji Fa!

1163
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,980
Strike Wen Zhong's third eye!

1164
01:58:49,050 --> 01:58:50,100
The war will be over!

1165
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:59,600
What are you waiting for?

1166
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,230
Get inside!

1167
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:25,430
Hurry!

1168
02:00:11,550 --> 02:00:12,600
Close the gate!

1169
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:17,100
Charge!

1170
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:18,300
Charge!

1171
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:31,930
Come on!

1172
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,730
Charge into the Marquis's estate!

1173
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:01,100
What are you waiting for?

1174
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:11,480
Ceasefire or death.

1175
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:13,480
The choice is yours.

1176
02:02:14,430 --> 02:02:16,350
Victory is within my grasp.

1177
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:18,100
Why would I call a ceasefire?

1178
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:40,050
Hold on!

1179
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,680
Ji Fa!

1180
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:59,230
Deng Chanyu, quick!

1181
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:01,480
I'll give you one last chance.

1182
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:03,480
Come over here and kill Ji Fa.

1183
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:06,550
In your dreams.

1184
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:11,480
Do you really intend to be a rebel
of the Shang dynasty?

1185
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,650
Don't forget,

1186
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:14,230
you drank my enchanted water.

1187
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:15,600
When the Ten Absolutes Formation is broken

1188
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:16,800
you will die too.

1189
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:21,800
Quick!

1190
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:24,230
The Yin hour (3-5 am) is almost here!

1191
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:40,180
Ji Fa!

1192
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:48,440
Ji Fa!

1193
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:49,600
Quick!

1194
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:28,600
What are you waiting for?

1195
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:29,300
I'm sorry.

1196
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:32,100
I lied to you.

1197
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:34,100
No...

1198
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,100
You saved Xiqi.

1199
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:38,350
Xiqi is your home.

1200
02:05:43,930 --> 02:05:46,350
When we first met
at the Yellow River crossing...

1201
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:50,730
That song you sang...

1202
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:53,980
I liked it.

1203
02:05:55,550 --> 02:05:57,100

Jiao'er.

1246

Yin Shou.

1249
02:13:36,550 --> 02:13:37,550
I told you...

1250
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:43,730
I wouldn't let you go even in death.

of Golden Turtle Island in the East Sea is here.

Surrender now.

02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:07,430
This box was bestowed by the King.

1257
02:19:10,970 --> 02:19:12,310
Either...

1258
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:15,890
it contains the head of Ji Fa

1259

or...

1260
02:19:22,010 --> 02:19:25,310
it cannot return empty.

1261
02:19:46,890 --> 02:19:50,310
The King wants my head.

1262
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:51,960
Commander.

1263
02:19:56,890 --> 02:19:58,430
You are perceptive.

1264
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:13,510
Take it.

1265
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,480
Commander.

1266
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:29,770
May you rest in peace.

1267

1269
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:30,390
Rise.

1270
02:24:48,590 --> 02:24:49,590
Return.

1271
02:24:57,470 --> 02:24:59,890
Pay your respects to your father.

1272
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:04,680
Father.

1273
02:25:06,890 --> 02:25:09,850

Mother.
