"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,869
"Episode 27"

3
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:10,201
Young Yang Guo's skills?

4
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,075
You can refer from Little Master.

5
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:12,534
You'll know.

6
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:13,784
They're both as good.

7
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,242
A first-class player.

8
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,701
When young Yang Guo was...

9
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:18,118
protecting the Lord,

10
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,367
he lost one of his arms.

11
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:20,492
Doesn't the lost arm...

12
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:21,617
remind you of young Yang Guo?

13
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:23,160
There was no Xiaolongnü,

14
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:24,367
nor the condor in this case.

15
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:26,242
Little Master,

16
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,284
I don't think he can only use swords.

17
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,365
Do you think he...

18
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:30,576
knows the Deep Blue Press?

19
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:32,743
Aunt!

20
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:33,743
Guo Er!

21
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:34,868
Aunt!

22
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:36,241
Guo Er!

23
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:37,241
-Get to the point.
-Aunt...

24
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,409
Doomed!

25
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,367
They were out of options.

26
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:43,076
Then,

27
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:45,409
they thought of the Serpents' tomb.

28
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:46,867
So the Mute Riders took them...

29
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:47,868
to the tomb for refuge.

30
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,659
And it didn't bother them too much.

31
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:51,783
In their first attempt...

32
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:52,909
as the Mute Riders got in,

33
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:54,826
they've killed the Serpents
almost entirely.

34
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:55,993
By the time they enter,

35
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,241
young Yang Guo was badly injured.

36
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,076
The lord was heartbroken.

37
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:01,575
So he took out...

38
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:03,492
the corpse of the Serpents' leader...

39
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,242
from the coffin...

40
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,617
and put young Yang Guo in.

41
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:10,518
Why?

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,562
So, you don't know it!

43
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:13,534
Let me tell you.

44
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,848
From what they've recovered,

45
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,009
when the leader of the Serpents...

46
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:19,284
was building his own tomb,

47
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,701
he found the bronze tree.

48
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,617
The bronze tree can bring
the dead back to life.

49
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:24,616
So the Serpents...

50
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:25,909
placed their leader inside...

51
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,743
to await his revival.

52
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:29,241
The Lord knew about it,

53
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,242
so he placed young Yang Guo inside.

54
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:33,659
But the pursuit team caught up...

55
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:34,659
and they had to leave.

56
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:37,909
So young Yang Guo
was placed there alive.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,461
They left him a silk book with...

58
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:41,284
the Lord and the Mute Riders'...

59
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,492
next destination.

60
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:43,743
Alas,

61
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,576
after a thousand years,

62
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,076
The Lord and the General...

63
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,407
had long turned into ashes.

64
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,325
We opened the coffin.

65
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,034
Young Yang Guo...

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,041
awoke in terminal lucidity and died.

67
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:07,201
What an eternal parting.

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,994
Though these ancients are no more,

69
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,637
the water still runs cold.

70
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:16,779
By the way,

71
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,226
I've looked up on...

72
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,032
the bronze tree.

73
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,576
According to the internet,
its ancient name was "Hollow Pillar".

74
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:23,783
In 1984,

75
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:25,284
one was discovered in a mine...

76
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,284
at Panzhihua.

77
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:27,659
But it's not big.

78
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:29,617
And its roots...

79
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:30,869
were all rusted.

80
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,330
No scrolls or notes written...

81
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:34,916
to describe its use.

82
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:36,657
But that Mr. Qi,

83
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:38,915
the one who blabbered away...

84
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:40,748
and wasted hours of our time.

85
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:42,873
He says that the
“Classic of Mountains and Seas”,

86
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:44,497
and some ethnic tribe poems...

87
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:45,706
had mentioned about it.

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,040
It's related to the ancient
Earth Dragon.

89
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,456
Earth Dragon?

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,164
Snakes?

91
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:56,456
When I was with the bronze tree,

92
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:57,956
there were two serpents there.

93
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,956
One of it was strange.

94
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:01,873
One of its eyes was purple,

95
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:03,373
and the other was scarlet red.

96
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:05,998
The purple eye opens mostly.

97
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:08,539
But when the red eye opens,

98
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:09,623
I'll feel dizzy and nauseous...

99
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:10,665
when I look at it.

100
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:12,163
When Ning saw it,

101
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:13,831
she seemed to be in a trance.

102
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:14,873
She couldn't move an inch.

103
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,413
Then, I threw a grenade...

104
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:18,498
into its mouth.

105
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:20,206
It melted like wax.

106
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:21,665
"Candle Dragon"?

107
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,623
You say it's a Candle Dragon?

108
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:27,331
Isn't it a legend?

109
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:29,456
It is.

110
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,790
But someone researched on it,

111
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,456
and said it's a snake...

112
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:34,915
living in deep depths underground.

113
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:36,288
Because it lives...

114
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:37,831
in creaks within steep rocks,

115
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:39,705
So its eyes...

116
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,426
were mutated like flounders.

117
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,790
It's said that ancient people...

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,190
use it as longevity lamps.

119
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:47,915
It has thick layers of fat...

120
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:50,414
as if it's made of wax.

121
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:52,956
If what you say is true,

122
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:54,414
the snake I saw...

123
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:56,831
by the bronze tree that melted away...

124
00:05:58,163 --> 00:05:59,331
might just be the Candle Dragon.

125
00:05:59,373 --> 00:05:59,831
Wait.

126
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:01,915
The bronze tree was so big,

127
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
so magnificent,

128
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:04,665
just to lure a snake?

129
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:06,956
And,

130
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:08,789
there's something...

131
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,748
I can't figure out.

132
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,331
When Little Master and I...

133
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:12,664
touched the bronze tree's...

134
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:13,289
branches,

135
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,664
though we were not...

136
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,539
in the same space,

137
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:16,915
we saw each other.

138
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:19,831
And we even heard each other.

139
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:21,414
That I can't answer you.

140
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:30,498
Madam Huo.

141
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:31,331
Look at this.

142
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:32,622
The cheongsam you chose...

143
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,247
for Ms. Xiu Xiu is so beautiful.

144
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:36,164
She's sure to like it.

145
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:37,331
Beautiful.

146
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:37,998
Right?

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,456
Beautiful.

148
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,158
This looks good too.

149
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,244
And this too.

150
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,373
Get her measurements precisely.

151
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:43,456
No problem.

152
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:46,581
It looks better when it's fitting.

153
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:47,323
Rest assured.

154
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:47,998
I promise.

155
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:49,831
Granny!

156
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:51,623
Granny!

157
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:53,082
Look, Granny!

158
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,998
The dress I bought
from Vipshop is here.

159
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:58,748
What's wrong, Granny?

160
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:00,706
What's the matter?

161
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:02,623
Are you unpleased?

162
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:07,790
Are you making a cheongsam?

163
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,163
This cheongsam...

164
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,040
Is it for me?

165
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:14,706
Who can it be for besides you?

166
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,539
I'm not suitable for it.

167
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:18,747
Your elegance...

168
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:20,163
suits a cheongsam.

169
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,498
There's a saying.

170
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:22,789
A generation...

171
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,873
has its own trend.

172
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:27,790
The tailor makes the man.

173
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:29,790
Refinement comes from your clothes.

174
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,873
You may not be unsuitable.

175
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:34,414
Unless if you decide so.

176
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,831
But some girls nowadays...

177
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,373
wear short cheongsams...

178
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:42,790
with pin straight collars.

179
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:43,414
But,

180
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:46,331
they show off their legs with it.

181
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:47,790
That looks good too.

182
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:50,373
My granddaughter looks good
in everything.

183
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:54,873
All right then.

184
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,623
Consider this an add up
to my Vipshop closet.

185
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,706
Make one for me.

186
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,247
Sure!

187
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:07,123
Ms. Xiu Xiu,

188
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:07,831
this way please.

189
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:08,831
I'll take your measurements.

190
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:09,623
Yes.

191
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,498
Measure precisely.

192
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:12,498
Right.

193
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,206
We want both long and short dresses.

194
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:15,915
Madam.

195
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,164
Si Ye from Changsha is here again.

196
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:26,706
Mr. Ma was hospitalized.

197
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:29,956
He's sick?

198
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:30,998
Mental sickness.

199
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,456
I'll say, he looked so weird.

200
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,706
Thought he sat himself silly
in the prison.

201
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:37,790
Who knew,

202
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,040
it was schizophrenia.

203
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,706
Could it be...

204
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,581
he's the same as Da Shan's son?

205
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:44,747
Did he touch...

206
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:45,706
the bronze tree's branch,

207
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,414
and had schizophrenia?

208
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:48,998
How long did he touch it?

209
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:49,623
Besides,

210
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:51,081
Da Shan and his family...

211
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:51,915
had contact with the bronze tree.

212
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,581
Us too.

213
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,790
Why didn't we turn crazy?

214
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:56,331
It depends on our body conditions.

215
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:58,955
Didn't he always carry...

216
00:08:58,956 --> 00:08:59,831
the bronze bell with him?

217
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,123
It may be related.

218
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:02,915
In fact,

219
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:05,206
most of us...

220
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:07,831
have weak minds...

221
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:09,956
and are easily influenced.

222
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:12,082
Take Lao Yang for example.

223
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:28,206
I think,

224
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:30,790
Lao Yang could've been...

225
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:32,915
experiencing abnormality...

226
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:34,915
before touching the tree 3 years ago.

227
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:36,706
If not,

228
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:38,122
he won't be so sure...

229
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,164
and certain that...

230
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:40,289
the bronze tree...

231
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,642
can revive his mother.

232
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:43,289
What's weirder,

233
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,040
I had illusions...

234
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,163
when I was near the tree...

235
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,581
and saw his mother.

236
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,498
That's because of the magnetic fields.

237
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,206
Like when we're at the small altar.

238
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:53,456
We had illusions then.

239
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,082
If it weren't for him,

240
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:56,915
I might've been like Guo Guo or Ning.

241
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,164
I may have killed someone,

242
00:09:58,289 --> 00:09:59,498
or got killed by someone.

243
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:00,206
Really.

244
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:01,955
I pray we have no aftereffects...

245
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:02,956
now that we're out.

246
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:05,456
If not, we'll have to...

247
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,414
stay in Beijing Anding Hospital.

248
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:09,539
But some questions...

249
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:11,581
can't be explained with illusions.

250
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:13,373
For example, when I saw...

251
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:15,331
Lao Yang's corpse in the cave,

252
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,873
yet there he was,

253
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:18,748
alive outside the cave.

254
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,790
It's creepy just thinking of it.

255
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:25,539
Young Yang Guo,

256
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:27,928
someone from a thousand years before.

257
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:29,289
He stood up and fought us.

258
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:30,414
But alas,

259
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,456
there's another him in corpse form...

260
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:33,955
in the tomb.

261
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:35,206
All disintegrated into dust.

262
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:36,163
It was scary.

263
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,206
Maybe because of the magnetic fields,

264
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:46,082
time and space were disrupted.

265
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:48,498
He's right!

266
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:51,623
Maybe,

267
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:53,831
two parallel universes...

268
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:55,873
collided with each other concurrently.

269
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,288
That's why,

270
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,373
two identical people...

271
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:00,790
appeared simultaneously
in the same space.

272
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,372
You've heard about...

273
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:03,247
parallel universe, right?

274
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:04,790
This concept...

275
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,123
is from quantum physics.

276
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:07,581
The uncertainty of quantum.

277
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:08,664
Scientists...

278
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:10,040
found out when observing quantum,

279
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:11,873
that everything in the universe...

280
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,456
are formed by quantum.

281
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:14,915
From this we can deduce,

282
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,456
the universe is not one.

283
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,539
There could be similar
universes outside.

284
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:20,247
After further hypothesis,

285
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:21,873
the theory of parallel universe...

286
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,873
had developed into 8 to 9 variations.

287
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:28,873
When Lao Yang and I were
by the bronze tree,

288
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,581
a similar situation occurred.

289
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,237
"Xie Zi Yang"

290
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,998
Xie Zi Yang?

291
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:46,498
You're here.

292
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:49,137
"Xie Zi Yang"

293
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:57,164
I know.

294
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,706
How about this?

295
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:00,082
For example,

296
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:01,498
we've played games, right?

297
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:02,998
Your decisions...

298
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,498
decide the scenario.

299
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,164
For example, Fatty here..

300
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,539
is playing a game.

301
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:08,873
There are two options.

302
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:09,790
Option A,

303
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:10,998
Fatty danced.

304
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:11,831
Option B,

305
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:13,538
Fatty and Little Master...

306
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:14,206
had a fight.

307
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:16,040
If you choose A,

308
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,164
the scenario will be...

309
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:18,039
that you sprained yourself...

310
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,831
after the dance.

311
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,040
If you choose B,

312
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,205
that means...

313
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:21,830
you and Little Master...

314
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:22,331
fought each other.

315
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:23,539
Little Master beat you up,

316
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:24,456
and you were hospitalized.

317
00:12:24,873 --> 00:12:25,831
Don't curse me.

318
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:27,748
It's an example.

319
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,706
Different choices...

320
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:31,164
lead to different scenarios.

321
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:31,956
But,

322
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:34,289
from the moment you choose,

323
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:35,706
a parallel universe appears.

324
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:39,665
And the you in these two
parallel universes...

325
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:40,498
are still you.

326
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:42,414
We are still us.

327
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,748
Us who returned from the bronze tree.

328
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:45,790
And,

329
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,497
from the moment...

330
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:48,456
you made a choice,

331
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:49,665
the disturbed magnetic fields...

332
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:51,164
changed space.

333
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:53,163
So the two universes coincide.

334
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:54,498
Universe A's Fatty,

335
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:55,790
And Universe B's Fatty,

336
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,498
both appear in the room.

337
00:12:57,873 --> 00:12:58,706
This means...

338
00:12:58,831 --> 00:12:59,956
This means,

339
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:01,873
while I'm beating Fatty up,

340
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,331
and the other Fatty...

341
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:04,456
is dancing.

342
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:05,331
Yes.

343
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:07,082
Similarly,

344
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:08,498
we apply this...

345
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:09,831
onto Lao Yang this time.

346
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:11,539
It's the same Universe A and B.

347
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,748
Lao Yang in Universe A
entered the cave.

348
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:15,247
And he got trapped inside.

349
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:16,665
And Lao Yang in Universe B...

350
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,790
never entered the cave.

351
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:19,498
When A and B coincided,

352
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,040
maybe time...

353
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:21,914
developed a change...

354
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:22,998
beyond our comprehension.

355
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:24,163
So when B...

356
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,539
appeared in A,

357
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,164
The timeline in Space A...

358
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:28,205
had progressed to...

359
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,998
Lao Yang's dying moment.

360
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:32,915
But Lao Yang in Space B
was still alive.

361
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:33,956
So,

362
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,164
I simultaneously saw...

363
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,498
the dead Lao Yang and alive Lao Yang.

364
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:40,163
Similarly,

365
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,247
we place this theory...

366
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:42,998
onto young Yang Guo.

367
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:44,748
Universe A's young Yang Guo...

368
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,414
just laid in the coffin,

369
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:47,873
and you guys awoke him.

370
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:49,289
And Universe B's young Yang Guo...

371
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:50,830
had been lying in the coffin...

372
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,665
for a thousand years.

373
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,873
Making him, a dry corpse.

374
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:55,206
Though...

375
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,580
there are some things...

376
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,456
that I can't explain,

377
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,706
But this is...

378
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,373
the only reasonable possibility...

379
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:02,040
that I can think of.

380
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:03,915
Really.

381
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,956
Don't get serious.

382
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,163
We don't do science,

383
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:08,040
and we're not scientists.

384
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:09,163
This aside,

385
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:09,997
I'm more curious...

386
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:11,247
why Ning even went to the tomb.

387
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,414
She's really like a tail now.

388
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:15,123
Stuck on you and not coming off.

389
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
That Guo Guo with her was...

390
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:20,914
the one who introduced...

391
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:21,623
Mr. Ma to you.

392
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:22,581
Right.

393
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:25,164
We hardly ever communicate.

394
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:26,623
We only trade with each other.

395
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:27,956
Now that we've met,

396
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,538
he's digging a hole...

397
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:30,623
for us to jump in.

398
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,748
Qiu De Kao must be behind this.

399
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,123
Think about it.

400
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:40,082
What is there...

401
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:41,623
in that tomb...

402
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:43,373
that Qiu De Kao could be after?

403
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:45,289
Besides,

404
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:48,623
why is Wu Xie always scouting the way?

405
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,790
All that glitters,

406
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,581
is not gold.

407
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:12,498
Aunt, who is it
that's made you so mad?

408
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:13,790
Come, tell your nephew.

409
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:15,539
I will take care of him.

410
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:19,539
Men in Huo Family...

411
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:22,581
Besides looking decent,

412
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:24,539
and having a sweet mouth...

413
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:25,873
to coax people,

414
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:27,915
they have no other talents.

415
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:29,538
Actually,

416
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:31,998
I'm not very demanding.

417
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,331
Look at the Huo Family.

418
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:36,331
The women are taking care of it.

419
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:39,706
Isn't it great for us to be
safe and settled?

420
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:40,790
While you men?

421
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:42,956
It's fine to be incompetent.

422
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,331
But you all act tougher...

423
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:46,456
than the other.

424
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:49,706
Going astray when handling matters.

425
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:51,915
You can't blame me for this.

426
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:53,748
Blame that Lin fellow.

427
00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:56,247
Did I allow you to talk?

428
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,623
Why won't you let me?

429
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:00,206
Don't I have a right?

430
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:01,747
Not taking the cane...

431
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:03,456
and beating you up...

432
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:05,123
is the best right...

433
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,247
you can get.

434
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:10,748
Aunt, listen to yourself.

435
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:12,414
Could you even?

436
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:14,040
My parents died early.

437
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,206
You raised me yourself.

438
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:17,714
If I really have done wrong,

439
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:18,790
you can hit me...

440
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:19,539
or scold me.

441
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,163
That's your love to me, isn't it?

442
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:25,705
But this matter...

443
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:27,373
can't wait no longer.

444
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:29,665
The court order...

445
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:33,998
What happened?

446
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:35,790
Do tell.

447
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:38,289
Didn't I tell you, Uncle Si?

448
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,414
Let go of that land.

449
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:41,580
Why did you come...

450
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:42,915
-and cause trouble?
-Xiu Xiu.

451
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:45,040
You don't know business!

452
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:46,040
We've contributed so much...

453
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,414
for the land.

454
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,498
It's a great loss...

455
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,289
to just let go.

456
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:51,456
Uncle Si!

457
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,206
Don't you know about
stopping loss timely?

458
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:54,123
You don't listen to me,

459
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:55,163
and you insist to...

460
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:56,040
join hands with that Mr. Lin.

461
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:57,330
You are now charged with...

462
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:58,331
bribery and slaughter.

463
00:16:58,414 --> 00:16:59,873
Isn't this a huge loss?

464
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:02,123
We were framed.

465
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:03,581
Didn't you evict the residents?

466
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:04,706
Didn't you bribe them?

467
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:06,790
If you don't pay,

468
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,623
how will you get help?

469
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:10,373
Besides, those residents...

470
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:12,414
were smarter than you think.

471
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:13,873
They were waiting for the eviction...

472
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:14,956
to be millionaires.

473
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:15,873
What?

474
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:17,082
Would they stop...

475
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:18,414
if I didn't scare them?

476
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:19,790
If they don't move,

477
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,082
we can't build the building!

478
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,456
You know how much we'll lose...

479
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,206
if we postpone the project?

480
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:24,831
These are all the back story.

481
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:26,164
We know clearly deep down.

482
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:27,456
Shut up if you don't know.

483
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:28,538
So what you told me that day...

484
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:29,498
were all lies?

485
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,163
When did I ever lie?

486
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,206
I just went back
and thought it through,

487
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:36,040
and felt that things were off.

488
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,373
The idea you gave me...

489
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:39,998
will disadvantage the Huo Family.

490
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,164
Sometimes when you step back,

491
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:43,331
others will step in.

492
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:43,790
Right?

493
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,082
If you step back some more,

494
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,706
others will take your place.

495
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:48,498
What?

496
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,373
Will you be happy to see...

497
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:51,456
our family crumble?

498
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:52,456
You ignorant lass.

499
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,289
You'll bring bad luck to us all.

500
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:55,623
What did you say?

501
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:56,950
-I...
-All right.

502
00:17:57,414 --> 00:17:58,498
I know.

503
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,748
You can go.

504
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,082
Aunt,

505
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,665
about being charged...

506
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,163
I said I know.

507
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:08,790
Fine, fine.

508
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:10,082
I'll wait for your good news.

509
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:14,082
Bless you, Aunt.

510
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:22,247
Is the goalkeeper a director?

511
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:23,665
Fine.

512
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:25,206
Which team are you betting next?

513
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:26,040
Done!

514
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:27,331
Mr. Huo.

515
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:29,164
Done?

516
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:30,706
Yes.

517
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:32,748
Your aunt is really capable.

518
00:18:32,873 --> 00:18:34,082
She solved our problem.

519
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,831
You have no idea...

520
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,040
how connected she is.

521
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:38,414
With Madam holding out,

522
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:39,539
nothing will happen.

523
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,164
She's not just fooling us, right?

524
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:42,331
What do you know?

525
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,331
Let me tell you.

526
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,040
Women...

527
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,498
are all soft-hearted.

528
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:48,163
Especially to us, her kins.

529
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,831
See how she takes care
of Huo Xiu Xiu...

530
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:50,915
and spoils her.

531
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:52,414
But she's just a girl.

532
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:53,915
She'd be mad...

533
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,331
if she wants her as an heir.

534
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:56,581
You're right, Mr. Huo.

535
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:57,956
Family heir is a task...

536
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,206
best left for men.

537
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,414
The Madam is just...

538
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:02,831
in over her head.

539
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:06,164
Turning the Huo Family upside down.

540
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,456
A woman usurping man's power.

541
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,789
The human race can't stop...

542
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,623
the Madam now.

543
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,713
What is this called?

544
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,373
Anti-human.

545
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,790
Anti-human!

546
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:16,831
Mr. Huo,

547
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,498
where are we going tonight?

548
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,163
MIX is the way!

549
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:21,373
All right!

550
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:39,748
Why are you so nervous?

551
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:41,581
It's all my fault, Granny.

552
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:42,664
I didn't properly...

553
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:43,748
settle this matter.

554
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:44,831
And made you worry.

555
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,373
I've told you.

556
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:49,498
The leader of the family...

557
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,748
must stand tall.

558
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:54,748
You have to be tough...

559
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:57,456
and be heartless.

560
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:00,331
You treated him like he's something.

561
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:01,956
Don't you mingle with...

562
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:04,163
that Xie Zi every time?

563
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,455
Look at him.

564
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,706
See how he settles such matters.

565
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,289
Brother Xiao Hua is...

566
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:10,581
What about him?

567
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:14,456
When he took charge,

568
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,665
he was younger than you are now.

569
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,706
When Xie Jiu died,

570
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:21,581
no one was there to help him.

571
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:22,748
Back then, he's totally...

572
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:24,581
fearless and strong.

573
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,164
Because he could take the heat,

574
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:28,040
so he became the head
of the Xie Family.

575
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:28,998
Do you know that?

576
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:30,040
Granny,

577
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:31,998
I'll keep up.

578
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:36,247
You are far from experienced.

579
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:38,247
I blame myself for that.

580
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:40,873
I was wrong in some ways.

581
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,123
Granny.

582
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,289
Don't say that.

583
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:44,456
All right.

584
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:45,705
Today,

585
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:48,247
I'll give you one more lesson.

586
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:57,915
I'm hungry from all the drinking.

587
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,581
Let me treat you to a meal.

588
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:01,915
Sure.

589
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:05,081
But I don't know where...

590
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:05,873
to keep the sword.

591
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:07,289
What if the security sees,

592
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:08,331
and call the cops?

593
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:09,456
True.

594
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:11,915
Let's go.

595
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:13,289
Aren't you hungry?

596
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:23,164
One moment.

597
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:26,040
Mister,

598
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,498
I don't understand.

599
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,706
What does Qiu De Kao want?

600
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,040
Tricking me to the undersea tomb.

601
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:33,915
It's overseas.

602
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:35,831
Now the bronze tree.

603
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:37,455
You two should get...

604
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:38,163
your DNAs examined.

605
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,082
Is he suspecting...

606
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:41,830
that you're his long lost...

607
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:42,623
son?

608
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,082
But yes.

609
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,790
Most importantly,
what does Qiu De Kao want?

610
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:48,831
What does he want from you?

611
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,498
I have no value.

612
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:53,831
The only thing I can think of is...

613
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:55,123
he's trying to use me...

614
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:56,373
to influence my uncle.

615
00:21:58,581 --> 00:21:59,790
But what is going on...

616
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,498
between Qiu De Kao...

617
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:03,748
and my uncle?

618
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:05,873
Good friends maybe.

619
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:07,164
But let me tell you.

620
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,040
We have to trace back
to the beginning.

621
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:11,373
Who is Qiu De Kao?

622
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,748
Don't judge the fact that
he owns so many museums,

623
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:16,206
making himself so famous,

624
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:17,831
and pretending to be cultured.

625
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:19,413
His true identity...

626
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:20,581
is just an artifact smuggler.

627
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:21,831
Foreign artifact smuggler.

628
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:23,623
What do those smugglers want?

629
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:25,581
Valuable artifacts.

630
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:26,873
Your Uncle San Xing?

631
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,581
He's a treasure hunter.

632
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,581
They are like a hand in glove.

633
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,414
No.

634
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:35,956
They are a match made in heaven.

635
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:37,373
A perfect union.

636
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:38,623
Right?

637
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:40,247
You forgot.

638
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:43,040
When you saw them abroad,

639
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:45,081
Qiu De Kao gave Uncle San Xing...

640
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:45,790
a briefcase.

641
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:47,747
Uncle San Xing took the briefcase...

642
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:48,665
and sold it to an auctioneer.

643
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,414
Who did the auctioneer give it to?

644
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:51,665
They are making transactions.

645
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,706
I think they're just...

646
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,206
a client and a supplier.

647
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,373
Maybe Qiu De Kao...

648
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:58,123
wanted resources from Uncle San Xing.

649
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,373
Once he obtain the resource,

650
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:02,706
he can burn the bridge...

651
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:03,998
and abandon him.

652
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:05,373
Your uncle being abandoned?

653
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:07,581
Of course he'd never allow that.

654
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:08,247
Right?

655
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:10,247
They don't want to hurt each other.

656
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:11,998
So they chose you instead.

657
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:13,748
Targeting you...

658
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:14,998
and dragging you along.

659
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:16,206
Uncle San Xing...

660
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:17,538
can't feign ignorance...

661
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,206
and ask nothing.

662
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,373
In addition to your curiosity,

663
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,581
if you're dragged into it,

664
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:24,247
you’ll follow your uncle
relentlessly into tombs.

665
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:25,831
As time goes,

666
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:27,373
you'll learn a thing about resources.

667
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,498
When you do,

668
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:31,122
and you're not as bright...

669
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:31,790
as your uncle,

670
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:33,289
Ning will simply...

671
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:34,414
make you talk...

672
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,331
by captivating you.

673
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,163
And let me tell you.

674
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:40,831
Aren't you enemies?

675
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:42,665
Century old enemies.

676
00:23:43,414 --> 00:23:44,790
But now what?

677
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,955
Now,

678
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:47,790
what makes the world go round?

679
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:49,581
Money.

680
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:51,665
Everyone looks to money.

681
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,498
Is there anything it can't settle?

682
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:54,539
If money can't settle?

683
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:55,164
Raise it.

684
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:56,082
If you can't solve it still,

685
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:57,082
give it a double raise.

686
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:57,956
Understand?

687
00:23:58,289 --> 00:23:58,831
It's a fact.

688
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:00,123
Uncle San Xing?

689
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,414
Don't assume that your uncle...

690
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,040
is young and innocent.

691
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:05,289
If he's as naive as you are,

692
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:06,708
he would've long been...

693
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,206
sucked dry by others.

694
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:08,915
Understand?

695
00:24:11,706 --> 00:24:12,623
Besides that,

696
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:14,539
are there any other guesses?

697
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,622
That little bit of alcohol...

698
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,790
gave me this inspiration.

699
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:21,289
Maybe Qiu De Kao's target is you.

700
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:23,040
Not your uncle.

701
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:25,539
But what value do I have?

702
00:24:27,706 --> 00:24:29,373
Maybe you don't know yourself.

703
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:33,665
Qiu De Kao's traps...

704
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,456
gets more secluded each time.

705
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:36,581
See?

706
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:37,998
He had Ning openly contact you...

707
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:39,790
for the undersea tomb.

708
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:40,623
Directly.

709
00:24:40,956 --> 00:24:41,831
While abroad,

710
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:42,872
he sent messages...

711
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:44,331
and set up a fake website to get you.

712
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:46,539
Then, this time.

713
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:47,873
This time was worse.

714
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:51,040
We don't know
what other traps he has set...

715
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,000
to let you hop in.

716
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:57,163
I thought about it.

717
00:24:58,456 --> 00:24:59,581
We can't stay passive.

718
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,289
Regardless of Qiu De Kao's motives,

719
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:02,956
we have to take charge.

720
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,915
I will show him...

721
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:07,998
what I got.

722
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:12,289
Setting traps?

723
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:13,873
So can I.

724
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:20,998
You're all leaving?

725
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:23,164
You didn't even eat.

726
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:23,873
Boss!

727
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:24,747
Pack them up!

728
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:25,956
Pack these three bowls.

729
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:26,790
What a waste.

730
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:27,831
-Bill, please!
-Be right there.

All from the same family.

Their grandchildren sings now.

739

Youngsters nowadays...

740
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:28,373
don't listen to operas.

741
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:30,206
They go for cybercafes or karaoke.

742
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:33,623
They may not hold out for long.

743
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,498
Wait for me!

What's rare is that...

750
00:27:10,414 --> 00:27:11,623
people in the suburbs...

751
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,637

we will take care of them.

758
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:27,163
Done.

759
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,622
Are you still visiting the...

760
00:27:29,623 --> 00:27:30,498
Little Jade Bamboo Troupe...

761
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:31,623
at the Ao Village?

762
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:35,581
Didn't our project team...

763
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:37,373
recruit some opera school graduates?

764
00:27:37,684 --> 00:27:38,559
Let them go.

765
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:39,655
Gain some experience...

766
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:42,414
and get rid of their arrogance.

767
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:43,970
Done.

768
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:45,147
Also,

769
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,456
the two traitors have been found.

770
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,164
How do we punish them?

771
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,538
Bring them back.

772
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:54,831
Zhai Xing Yao was looking for them.

773
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:12,498
What happened in Guizhou
had nothing to do with me!

774
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:14,163
It's all Ma Yu.

775
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:15,956
You don't have to let me know.

776
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:17,163
When you meet Master Hua,

777
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:18,247
you can tell him yourself.

778
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:19,580
I've contributed...

779
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:20,831
to the Xie Family for so many years.

780
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:23,247
Xie Yu Hua kicked us out after that.

781
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,337
People may lose
their faith on him if news spread.

782
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,162
My job...

783
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,665
is to take you back to Master Hua.

784
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:31,873
Please cooperate with me.

785
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:33,581
Don't make me work overtime.

786
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:47,414
Hurry to your uncle.

787
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:08,956
His phone is busy.

788
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,082
He's unreachable.

789
00:29:10,163 --> 00:29:10,748
Let me tell you.

790
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:12,206
Mr. San doesn't want to see you.

791
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:12,998
You know that?

792
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:14,331
Mr. Naive,

793
00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:15,623
think about it.

794
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:18,539
You uncle is easier to
find than Little Master.

795
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:19,790
He's traceable.

796
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:21,998
Little Master disappears
without a sound.

797
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:22,873
One snap and poof.

798
00:29:22,998 --> 00:29:23,956
Totally untraceable.

799
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:25,040
Think about it.

800
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,247
I'll take a nap.

801
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:37,163
Young Master Wu.

802
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,760
Hey, Pan Zi.

803
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:39,373
It's me.

804
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:40,164
Where's my uncle?

805
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:42,123
Young Master Wu,

806
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,498
Master Wu said that...

807
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:45,331
I should tell you this if you called,

808
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:47,289
"some things are better left alone".

809
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:48,956
If you're too bored,

810
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,998
Master Wu said...

811
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,539
you could study for a PhD abroad.

812
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:52,373
He'll pay.

813
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:53,706
You tell him,

814
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:55,581
I have important things to tell him.

815
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:56,623
Tell him to pick up!

816
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,373
Master Wu is really not here.

817
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,748
Stop it, Pan Zi.

818
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:02,748
You tell him,

819
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:04,123
I've discovered a Chu dynasty tomb.

820
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,915
A Chu dynasty tomb!

821
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,998
I'm going to see it in two days.

822
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:08,163
If he's interested,

823
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:08,956
let me know.

824
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:09,706
That's it.

825
00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:14,373
You want to trick him with that?

826
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:15,873
I don't believe you.

827
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:18,163
I don't know.

828
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:19,997
Regardless, my curiosity...

829
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:20,706
is hereditary.

830
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:23,790
You win.

831
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:37,331
Master Wu.

832
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:39,740
Where did Young Master Wu...

833
00:30:39,748 --> 00:30:41,163
find that Chu dynasty tomb?

834
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:42,725
You believe him?

835
00:30:44,123 --> 00:30:45,040
He's bluffing.

836
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
He wants me to look for him.

837
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,993
Will you?

838
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:49,873
I'll keep him on hold.

839
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:54,206
What if he really knows something?

840
00:30:55,414 --> 00:30:57,206
He did just come back from Qinling.

841
00:30:57,331 --> 00:30:58,706
Maybe he discovered something?

842
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:02,289
But,

843
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:03,498
if you asked him,

844
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,040
he'd definitely tell you.

845
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:06,911
Some matters...

846
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,440
are safer kept unknown.

847
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:12,289
But that kiddo,

848
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:15,748
he still doesn't understand this.

849
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:33,665
Pair of ten.

850
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:35,206
Let me see.

851
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:36,163
Pair of J.

852
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:36,873
Pair of K.

853
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:38,040
Boom!

854
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:38,873
Pair of 10.

855
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,748
What do you mean by this?

856
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:44,873
Master Hua.

857
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:46,581
I know.

858
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:48,538
That fight at Guizhou...

859
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,206
eliminated 6 out of your 8 men.

860
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:52,123
You had a huge loss.

861
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:54,163
But there are risks in tomb raiding.

862
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:56,123
If you're scared,

863
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:57,665
you can hide under your girl's skirt.

864
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:58,998
Why come knocking?

865
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:01,790
Uncle Kang.

866
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:03,289
Don't talk like that.

867
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:04,789
You said the raid...

868
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,665
couldn't feed two families.

869
00:33:05,956 --> 00:33:07,414
You sent me and Ma Yu
to stir things up.

870
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,956
Master Hua,

871
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:13,288
your man...

872
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:15,082
is shifting his fault at me.

873
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:15,915
I have recordings.

874
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,956
Nonsense!

875
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:18,289
How is that evidence?

876
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:19,414
Technology nowadays...

877
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,873
can even create fake videos.

878
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:22,956
Xie Yu Hua,

879
00:33:23,414 --> 00:33:25,539
if you use your men as witnesses,

880
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:26,623
won't they follow suit...

881
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:27,956
with what you say?

882
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:30,873
Uncle Kang.

883
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:32,539
You've misunderstood me.

884
00:33:32,748 --> 00:33:34,414
You know...

885
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:36,040
what you did.

886
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:38,206
I know it too.

887
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:41,082
I'm here today...

888
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:44,082
to answer to my men.

889
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,873
You wrecked my lair?

890
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:05,123
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

891
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:07,331
Listen up.

892
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:09,164
I gave you face
because of your grandfather.

893
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:10,247
Don't forget.

894
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:12,161
No matter how invincible
Xie Jiu Ye was,

895
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:13,414
he's a dead man now!

896
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:15,539
You, an opera singing sissy,

897
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:17,539
have to fit yourself into our crowd.

898
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:18,665
Can you make your mark?

899
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:20,705
You think you have
such great reputation?

900
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:21,164
Yes?

901
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:22,747
You think you're safe on your seat...

902
00:34:22,748 --> 00:34:23,498
as Xie Family's head?

903
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:24,331
Let me tell you!

904
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,331
Zhai Xing Yao is watching!

905
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,414
Uncle Kang.

906
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:34,873
You're such a muddlehead.

907
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:36,872
The Xie Family's leader...

908
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:37,915
is still me.

909
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:39,330
So, no matter...

910
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:40,956
what Xing Yao promised you,

911
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:42,373
it's no use.

912
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,164
Okay.

913
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:56,373
Xie Yu Hua,

914
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,956
my territory is yours.

915
00:34:58,498 --> 00:34:59,831
Take everything with you.

916
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:02,163
I concede defeat.

917
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:04,164
Good.

918
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:14,123
Then what about the six men...

919
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:15,289
that died?

920
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:16,581
You want money?

921
00:35:17,498 --> 00:35:18,915
I'll pay one million each.

922
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:24,458
You...

923
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,782
should just go to jail.

924
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:39,998
So, what are you going to do now?

925
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:43,831
I don't know.

926
00:35:46,414 --> 00:35:48,206
Listening to your tone to Pan Zi,

927
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:49,790
I thought you had a plan.

928
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:52,164
You're just bluffing, weren't you?.

929
00:35:55,164 --> 00:35:56,289
No matter if it's my uncle...

930
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:57,539
or Qiu De Kao,

931
00:35:58,206 --> 00:35:59,123
I can't compare...

932
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:00,915
to their wit and vision.

933
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:02,289
That's right.

934
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:04,373
But they have flaws too.

935
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,040
They do everything...

936
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,665
after much consideration.

937
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:09,789
Everything will be...

938
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,748
in their control.

939
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:11,581
In fact,

940
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:14,123
they'll consider all possibilities...

941
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:15,748
and analyze solutions.

942
00:36:16,163 --> 00:36:17,206
Based on what I said,

943
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:19,206
what is our strength?

944
00:36:19,498 --> 00:36:20,539
Looking pretty.

945
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,247
Besides that?

946
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:25,040
Looking handsome.

947
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:28,331
Yes.

948
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:30,539
Besides,

949
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:31,790
our strength...

950
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,162
is we're clueless...

951
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:33,831
about what to do next.

952
00:36:33,956 --> 00:36:34,790
Even I'm not sure...

953
00:36:35,123 --> 00:36:36,539
what we should do next.

954
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:37,456
So,

955
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:39,581
if we can take charge...

956
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,331
and let them follow us,

957
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:44,163
they'll soon expose their tracks.

958
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:46,998
Totally unreliable.

959
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,956
Same old word.

960
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,331
Reliability...

961
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,706
can be tested.

962
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,539
Lao Kang's territory
isn't earning much.

963
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,414
It has only reached equity balance.

964
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,123
His inventory...

965
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:06,206
has been verified.

966
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,790
It's not even 3 million.

967
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:09,373
Sell everything off.

968
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:10,747
The money can be given...

969
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:11,831
to the six men's' family.

970
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:12,748
On the other hand,

971
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,956
hurry and distribute their pension.

972
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:15,539
Understood.

973
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:17,497
Things in the Yi inventory...

974
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:18,247
have been checked.

975
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,581
One fifth of it contains only code.

976
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:22,498
There are many packages...

977
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:24,247
unidentifiable from the logbook.

978
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,998
Our men didn't dare to open them.

979
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:29,062
Most things in the Yi Inventory...

980
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,164
were left by Granduncle Er.

981
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,689
His own account is clear.

982
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,581
But there are some things...

983
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,206
given by friends for safekeeping.

984
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:40,247
It was chaotic back then.

985
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:41,998
They may not be alive anymore.

986
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,164
So they were never returned.

987
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:46,206
Look for a time...

988
00:37:46,956 --> 00:37:48,289
to scan them with X-Ray.

989
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,081
Look inside...

990
00:37:50,082 --> 00:37:51,164
and see what's there.

991
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:52,622
But some of it...

992
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:53,915
are really weird.

993
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,082
I don't know
what were they thinking...

994
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:56,873
when they sent them in.

995
00:37:57,539 --> 00:37:58,831
This, Yihai 31.

996
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:00,331
An elm box.

997
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:01,956
Can you guess what's inside?

998
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:03,330
A few pieces of women...

999
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:04,040
and children clothing.

1000
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:04,998
A pair of shoes,

1001
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:05,915
a photo album,

1002
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:07,414
and a toy tiger.

1003
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:09,623
Perhaps to that person,

1004
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,998
these are his most...

1005
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,331
prized possessions.

1006
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:17,915
Keep them.

1007
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:20,123
Scan the photo albums...

1008
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:21,790
when you have the time.

1009
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:23,372
See if we can contact...

1010
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:24,373
their family.

1011
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:27,331
You're right.

1012
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:29,831
To the owner,

1013
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:31,040
they may be meaningful.

1014
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:32,539
Like when Granduncle Er...

1015
00:38:32,706 --> 00:38:34,123
had things scattered outside,

1016
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:35,955
you retrieved them one by one...

1017
00:38:35,956 --> 00:38:36,539
for all these years.

1018
00:38:36,873 --> 00:38:38,205
The money you've spent searching...

1019
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:38,873
was so much more.

1020
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:48,373
Granduncle Er and the rest
had remarkable lives.

1021
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:51,831
They encountered thrilling adventures.

1022
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,664
It's a pity that us descendants...

1023
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,665
don't know much about it.

1024
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:57,331
We can only connect the dots...

1025
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,370
through things they left behind.
