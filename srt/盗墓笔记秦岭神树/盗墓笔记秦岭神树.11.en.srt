"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:07,146
"Episode 11"

3
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,375
We couldn't...

4
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:12,709
identify the caller.

5
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,417
But 5 minutes before,

6
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,292
we were informed by...

7
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,250
the police.

8
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,792
We've intercepted a signal...

9
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,292
from within the border.

10
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,626
One of the guests.

11
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:23,959
Is it Wu Xie?

12
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,042
Not him.

13
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,667
We have been watching him.

14
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:31,501
Ning,

15
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,125
Wu Xie is a part of...

16
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,626
mission of yours,

17
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,000
there's no place for...

18
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,209
the sentiments.

19
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,125
I didn't.

20
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,501
When you were at the tomb of ocean,

21
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,959
you were in danger.

22
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,167
Indeed, you were able to get out...

23
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,375
because of him.

24
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:49,834
Father,

25
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,792
he saved my life.

26
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:52,501
I didn't...

27
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:53,667
even thank him.

28
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:55,042
Ning,

29
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:56,626
you're a good kid.

30
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,542
But, softness is your weak link.

31
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,918
A Chinese saying suits the situation,

32
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,375
the achievement of
a general cost many lives.

33
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:05,792
My child,

34
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:06,999
what we do,

35
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:09,584
is all for the fate of mankind...

36
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,417
and added with endless danger.

37
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,792
If you can't control it,

38
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,751
it may well ruin all of us.

39
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,375
So, don't be soft...

40
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:25,876
with Wu Xie anymore.

41
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,999
The fate of the human being.

42
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,417
Father.

43
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:32,334
What exactly are we doing?

44
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,542
I didn't mean to tell you...

45
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,250
the truth so early.

46
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,542
But,

47
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,459
do you remember...

48
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,459
the question I asked you?

49
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,999
If we could live forever,

50
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:51,876
maybe we can find the way...

51
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,209
to make people immortal.

52
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:56,292
No.

53
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,542
That's impossible.

54
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:01,834
I used to think it is...

55
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,417
human illusion.

56
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:07,334
But in the course of
studying the silk book...

57
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:10,417
and the Snake Eye Copper Fish,

58
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,000
I found a clue.

59
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,918
And maybe immortality...

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,999
is not impossible after all.

61
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,501
In one word, remember,

62
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:19,999
We're fighting...

63
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,667
for the destiny of human race.

64
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,876
We may not...

65
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,999
achieve the result in our lifetime.

66
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,751
But we're sacrificing for...

67
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:30,334
a great cause.

68
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:32,918
So,

69
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,209
don't be distracted by...

70
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,292
the trivial matters.

71
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,417
Take a vantage point,

72
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:44,042
separate yourself from
the things and people.

73
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,834
Yes.

74
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,292
I understand.

75
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,834
How're things over there?

76
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,667
A frightening day...

77
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:22,918
has just ended.

78
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,167
But, tomorrow is the big day.

79
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,999
Why was he there?

80
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:30,999
All I can think about...

81
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,375
is Snake Eye Copper Fish.

82
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,375
Seeing him at the auction venue today,

83
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,459
I was surprised.

84
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:37,626
I wanted to tell you,

85
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:39,626
but I forgot.

86
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,083
Didn't we say...

87
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,417
we have to share information?

88
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,250
I really forgot.

89
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:49,792
But, I wonder...

90
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,292
how did he get...

91
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,667
the information of the auction.

92
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,250
But, one thing is certain,

93
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,751
he's also here for...

94
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:57,542
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

95
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,125
Will he interrupt our plan?

96
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,209
He probably won't.

97
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,083
Now, my concern is...

98
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:07,999
the organizer.

99
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,542
I'll filter certain information...

100
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:15,959
and email to you altogether.

101
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,000
Have a look at it.

102
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,292
The organizer's venue is rented.

103
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,417
But, he's not a Czechs,

104
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:21,501
but an American.

105
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:22,751
Sure.

106
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,083
For tomorrow,

107
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,542
I'm counting on you.

108
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't worry.

109
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:02,542
So,

110
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,542
this is where Hendry Museum...

111
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:05,959
stores their collections.

112
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,709
It doesnâ€™t seem fake
with the sign there.

113
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:34,542
Could they be...

114
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,834
moving the stuff from the auction?

115
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,501
That is to say,

116
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,792
Snake Eye Copper Fish
is also in there.

117
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:05,459
What now?

118
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:06,751
Follow them.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,334
What's your plan?

120
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,459
What plan?

121
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,792
See.

122
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,584
They have 3 cars.

123
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,626
How are we going to snatch
the Snake Eye Copper Fish...

124
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,209
from the car in the center?

125
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,542
And it's followed by an Audi.

126
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,834
We may need the rocket-propelled
grenade to blast them.

127
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,334
Where can we get a
Rocket-propelled grenade?

128
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,999
We may even need air support.

129
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,334
-How's air support...
-Hold on.

130
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,167
Just a second.

131
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:40,042
What do you mean?

132
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,083
Carjacking, duh!

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,167
They have 3 cars,

134
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:44,834
a dozen people,

135
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:45,834
and might even have guns.

136
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:46,834
Can you handle that?

137
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,375
But don't tell me,

138
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:49,542
you're going to watch
the copper fish...

139
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:50,751
slip before your eyes.

140
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:55,292
Madam,

141
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:56,417
a Maserati...

142
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,167
is following us.

143
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:58,334
You want me to handle it?

144
00:08:58,542 --> 00:08:59,000
No.

145
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:00,918
Fatty,

146
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:01,999
stop chasing.

147
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:02,751
Now,

148
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,709
let's go back to the hotel,

149
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,584
then borrow some money.

150
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:05,292
Then tonight,

151
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:06,542
we'll bid for the
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

152
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,792
It'll take you a lifetime
to pay off that debt.

153
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,083
If one can get used
to the itching of lice,

154
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,125
one can forget the worry of debts.

155
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:15,501
To the hotel.

156
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:18,167
Fine, fine.

157
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:29,417
Madam,

158
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,083
the Maserati didn't catch up.

159
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:36,918
Find a shortcut,

160
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:37,792
get in front.

161
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:43,626
Fine.

162
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,000
Raise the money.

163
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll just sell another house.

164
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,542
The day when I have nowhere to stay,

165
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:50,584
I'll then move to Hangzhou...

166
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:51,417
and stay with you.

167
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:52,667
My food and lodging
will be on you then.

168
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:53,876
Aren't we back going
back to the hotel?

169
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:54,542
Why are you following them?

170
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:55,876
Yes, we're on our way to the hotel.

171
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,125
Wait. 
This is exactly the way to our hotel!

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,417
Exactly!

173
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,999
She made us
follow them on purpose?

174
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,709
That... who knows?

175
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:07,209
This...

176
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:50,501
Are you all right?

177
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:51,501
What are you doing?

178
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:52,542
Don't touch me!

179
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,125
I can get up by myself!

180
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,250
-Fatty.
-What?

181
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:01,042
Stay.

182
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,167
Something happened.

183
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:10,584
What...

184
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,042
do you want?

185
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,584
What's going on?

186
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,000
Something's up. Something's up.

187
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,000
What do you mean...

188
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:35,918
by surrounding me like this?

189
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,042
Who are you?

190
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,542
What do you think is going to happen?

191
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,000
I was just crossing the road.

192
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,417
Well, I'll leave now.

193
00:11:58,834 --> 00:11:59,250
Let's go.

194
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:07,542
They're getting in.

195
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:24,751
Teacher Xiao,

196
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,999
get to work.

197
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:39,959
How is it?

198
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,209
Which one?

199
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:43,334
Turn around.

200
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:52,709
This?

201
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,375
On your left.

202
00:13:58,792 --> 00:13:59,250
That's the one.

203
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:00,542
Got it.

204
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:27,834
USB port.

205
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,042
Stop the car!

206
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:16,334
What's going on?

207
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,542
Madam, the stuff is missing.

208
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,125
Thief! Thief!

209
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,751
Three men drive the van,

210
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:44,667
the others go with me!

211
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:45,417
Yes, Madam!

212
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:56,876
What now?

213
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,709
Let's go along for the ride.

214
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:01,584
Go after them.

215
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:02,709
Attaboy!

216
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,501
We're coming!

217
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,542
Someone's after you.

218
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:21,125
Catch up.

219
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,167
You blind! It's a road!

220
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:30,209
Hurry!

221
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,250
They're coming from the front.

222
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,250
Branch out into 2 parts.

223
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,501
Follow my directions.

224
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,959
Turn right after 200 meters.

225
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:56,167
Hurry up!

226
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:08,209
Turn left.

227
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,250
Is this how you lead me?

228
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,417
Take it easy.

229
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:29,709
That's nothing.

230
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,167
You assigned him?

231
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,125
No, it's a bonus.

232
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:53,584
You both can make it.

233
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:07,209
Split up!

234
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,167
Let me drive.

235
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,334
Gas is running low,

236
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,000
where to go?

237
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:51,417
To the park square.

238
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,209
You can easily hide
in the crowd there.

239
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:54,709
Who's that person?

240
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:55,751
I'm not sure for now.

241
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:56,876
Watch yourself first.

242
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:02,542
Reverse. Reverse.

243
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,709
Reverse. Reverse.

244
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:15,167
Say "Cheese"!

245
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:33,542
Goodbye, my friends!

246
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:38,918
What! Are you kidding me?

247
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,292
-What the hell!
-That rascal has gone!

248
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:41,626
God damn!

249
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:32,918
His riding skills are fantastic!

250
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,292
See, they're after him.

251
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,626
Block her way? Block or not?

252
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:38,709
Block!

253
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:02,751
Running away?

254
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:10,000
Let's see where you can go?

255
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,375
Beep beep, honk honk!

256
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,584
Beep beep, honk honk.
Try running now.

257
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:21,292
Beep beep, honk honk.

258
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,459
Have they just hit their back?

259
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,167
Ning,

260
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:49,709
are you all right?

261
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,250
Is your car all right?

262
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:52,584
Is your car insured?

263
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:03,083
Fatty,

264
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:03,959
let's go.

265
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:04,667
Sure.

266
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:05,709
Let's go.

267
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:13,667
Ning,

268
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,751
see you back home!

269
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:15,792
I'll pay you back then.

270
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:36,375
Ning must be pissed off.

271
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:41,501
That was fun.

272
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,042
What are you craving?

273
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,250
Anything, whatever.

274
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:54,334
Hello.

275
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:07,125
Fatty,

276
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:09,375
follow that Benz.

277
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,542
Follow them?

278
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:11,459
Sure.

279
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,083
Today has become
"The Fast and Furious".

280
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:14,209
Cut the crap.

281
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,459
Catch up to them.

282
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:26,334
â™ª Drift, drift, drift. â™ª

283
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:45,959
Fatty, stop!

284
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:48,667
What's up with you! You shocked me!

285
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:51,959
What's that?

286
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:54,626
That car is long gone.

287
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,209
What's going on?

288
00:24:59,125 --> 00:24:59,542
What now?

289
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:00,918
We're still parked on the road.

290
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,542
Forget it.

291
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:05,125
Let's go back to the hotel.

292
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:06,751
So, we're going back now.

293
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,167
Where should we keep this?

294
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:29,584
What's going on here?

295
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:32,042
Wu Xie.

296
00:25:37,876 --> 00:25:38,667
Here we are again.

297
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,375
What brought you here?

298
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:41,667
I knew it was you!

299
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:43,959
I saw Xiu Xiu and you.

300
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,167
What brings you here?

301
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:46,542
By the way,

302
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:47,834
those 2 helpers of yours,

303
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:48,792
what was that?

304
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:50,167
It was so sick the
way they rode the bikes.

305
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:50,999
Who are they?

306
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:52,375
One was Little Master.

307
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:52,918
Little...

308
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,334
Our Little Master?

309
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:57,751
Little Master?

310
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:00,375
How did you know Little Master?

311
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,125
We have known...

312
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,459
each other for a long time.

313
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:05,834
Don't be jealous for now.

314
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:07,792
Then, how about the other one?

315
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:09,542
The other one is...

316
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:10,792
Black Blindman.

317
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:11,999
Black...

318
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:17,999
An absolutely fantastic man!

319
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,042
Do you know Black Blindman?

320
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,709
No matter day or night,

321
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:27,918
he wears big sunglasses.

322
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,334
He's done a few tomb raids.

323
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:30,501
Not good as Little Master,

324
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:31,083
still,

325
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:32,959
he's the kind of man
our boss prefers, right?

326
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,626
Is this the Snake Eye Copper Fish...

327
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:40,417
that you lost last time?

328
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:43,375
Indeed.

329
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:46,292
We were swindled by them here...

330
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,584
through a text message.

331
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:48,626
How did you know...

332
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:49,918
Snake Eye Copper Fish was here?

333
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,209
It's Uncle San Xing who informed me.

334
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:12,542
We have...

335
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,125
prepared for the carjacking.

336
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,209
As you instructed,

337
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,209
to let him...

338
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,417
take the copper fish.

339
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:20,876
But, there was an accident.

340
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,542
It was...

341
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:22,667
snatched by someone else.

342
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,959
What do we know about that person?

343
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:27,876
He was wearing a helmet,

344
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:28,834
so I have no idea.

345
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:31,209
But, he definitely knows Wu Xie.

346
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,792
As I was chasing,

347
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,167
Wu Xie intercepted me.

348
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:36,167
He must know...

349
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,167
that man.

350
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:39,667
Bring Wu Xie to me.

351
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,626
Yes, sir.

352
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:44,876
Wu Xie is an unpredictable person.

353
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,375
He seems to wield...

354
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:48,834
an amazing magnetic field,

355
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,667
that makes things around him...

356
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:54,000
become unpredictable...

357
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:56,751
and turn to his advantage.

358
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,459
I think it's time...

359
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,375
to meet the third generation...

360
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:03,918
of the Wu Family.

361
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:14,209
Sir,

362
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,334
I'll start working on it.

363
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,375
Uncle San Xing gave me a call,

364
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:22,626
saying Qiu De Kao...

365
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:24,209
was going to auction the
Snake Eye Copper Fish here.

366
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:25,375
That's why I'm here.

367
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:27,999
Qiu De Kao?

368
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:33,542
No wonder Ning is here.

369
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:35,626
Don't tell me that,

370
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,375
the curator of Hendry Museum...

371
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:38,751
is Qiu De Kao?

372
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,000
Indeed.

373
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:41,918
Qiu De Kao's real name is...

374
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:42,959
Cox Hendry.

375
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,083
Qiu De Kao...

376
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:45,834
is the Chinese name he gave himself.

377
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:46,542
Just a second.

378
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,751
Were you saying that Qiu De Kao...

379
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:49,959
is the museum curator?

380
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,501
Something's wrong.

381
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:52,918
Qiu De Kao...

382
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,334
is supposed to be
the same generation...

383
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:55,542
as Gou Wu Ye and Xie Jiu Ye.

384
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:56,834
You're right.

385
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:58,999
Furthermore,

386
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:00,584
isn't Qiu De Kao...

387
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:01,918
Ning's boss?

388
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,959
Qiu De Kao...

389
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,209
came to China...

390
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:05,250
ages ago.

391
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,209
I knew this from...

392
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:07,000
my grandfather.

393
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:08,999
He also told me that...

394
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:09,999
Gou Wu Ye...

395
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:11,918
suffered a great deal under...

396
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,918
Qiu De Kao.

397
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,083
My grandfather also knows Qiu De Kao?

398
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,042
That's why I feel
like something's wrong.

399
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:18,876
He looks too young.

400
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,918
Could it be possible that...

401
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,250
the current Hendry...

402
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,501
is the son or grandson of...

403
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:25,375
Missionary Qiu De Kao?

404
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:26,667
Don't foreigners...

405
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:27,209
name the...

406
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,334
father, son and grandson...

407
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:29,542
with the same name?

408
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,501
Could that be true?

409
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:32,584
They're the same person.

410
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,626
Qiu De Kao can
speak both Mandarin...

411
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:35,584
and Changsha dialect well.

412
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,375
So, he kept a good relationship...

413
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,584
with the local Chinese.

414
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,751
Then, he knew a few grave robbers,

415
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:42,209
and started selling
their burial objects...

416
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:43,167
to foreigners.

417
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,999
He earned the referral
fees and price difference.

418
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:46,709
Later, his business grew bigger.

419
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:47,918
Gradually,

420
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:49,751
he got involved with Jiu Ye.

421
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:52,209
Among those,
his closest contact was...

422
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,000
Gou Wu Ye.

423
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,209
Until 1952,

424
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,626
churches withdrew from China.

425
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:58,501
Qiu De Kao...

426
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:00,125
set this up before he left China.

427
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,959
With his credibility
accumulated over the ages,

428
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,250
and a very low deposit,

429
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,417
he swept away many...

430
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:05,792
antiques from grave robbers.

431
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:07,459
Including Gou Wu Ye's...

432
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:08,751
silk book of Warring States period.

433
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:09,999
But,

434
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,209
after he boarded the ship,

435
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:12,042
he sent...

436
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,999
a telegraph to the Changsha Garrison.

437
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,792
He leaked the whereabouts of...

438
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:17,000
those grave robbers to them.

439
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:18,876
Consequently, they were either...

440
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:19,959
executed by shooting...

441
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,250
or put into prison.

442
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:23,792
Gou Wu Ye fled to the mountains...

443
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,375
and slept with corpses for weeks,

444
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:26,584
only then could he escape it.

445
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:27,792
This...

446
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,876
is the case of the silk book
of Warring States period back then.

447
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,167
He was so inhumane.

448
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,334
About these,

449
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,792
why have I never...

450
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:40,876
heard them from my grandfather?

451
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,542
Nor did he mention it on the book.

452
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,667
Your grandfather...

453
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:48,667
lost so many treasures...

454
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:49,918
to foreign antiques dealers,

455
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,125
and he was almost killed.

456
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,334
Such a shameful matter.

457
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:53,334
if I were him,

458
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,834
I wouldn't tell my grandson either.

459
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:23,792
Xiao Hua,

460
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:25,876
you took away...

461
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:26,792
Snake Eye Copper Fish,

462
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,125
Qiu De Kao and Ning...

463
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,501
won't let you off easy.

464
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:31,250
It's not safe here,

465
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,626
we'd better leave now.

466
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:40,751
They don't know me.

467
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:42,167
So, with me,

468
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,125
Snake Eye Copper Fish...

469
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:44,918
should be fine.

470
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:05,083
We should be fine.

471
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,417
She's not aiming at me.

472
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,792
Moreover,

473
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:09,542
she doesn't know...

474
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:10,459
we know each other.

475
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,083
Don't move.

476
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,250
Cigarette?

477
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,792
Miss Ning,

478
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:22,918
we were...

479
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:25,709
comrades who went through
fire and rain together,

480
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:27,334
and now you've tied us here.

481
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,626
What for?

482
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,042
Among three of you,

483
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:34,334
you're the trickiest one.

484
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:36,167
If you play any tricks,

485
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:37,459
I'll just shoot you.

486
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:40,584
If anything happens to the other two,

487
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,250
I'll also shoot you.

488
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:45,042
We're all innocent kids.

489
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:46,459
You misunderstood us.

490
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,209
We won't do tricks.

491
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:50,209
Ning,

492
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:51,417
where are you...

493
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,042
taking us?

494
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:55,167
You'll know once we get there.

495
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,375
I advise you...

496
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,417
to hand in Snake Eye Copper Fish.

497
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,959
I know people like you...

498
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:06,876
are acting loyal and tough.

499
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,167
I can't be tough to you.

500
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,667
But what you fear most is...

501
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:12,542
seeing your brothers get hurt.

502
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:14,584
If you mess around,

503
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,083
I'm not sure what will happen.

504
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:20,667
Don't move!

505
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:22,292
No one's moving.

506
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,459
I didn't move. You frightened me!

507
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:25,209
Snake Eye Copper Fish...

508
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:26,417
is really not with us.

509
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,542
Didn't you search us when...

510
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,083
you tied us up just now?

511
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,209
Where on earth is it?

512
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:32,417
Snake Eye Copper Fish...

513
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:33,709
is with our partner.

514
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:34,584
I guess...

515
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:35,876
he's on the plane by now.

516
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:41,375
Ning,

517
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,292
You're well aware that...

518
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,459
this is an illegal detention.

519
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,375
You'd better let us go.

520
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:47,751
Two hours ago,

521
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:49,167
you stole from my boss.

522
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:50,709
Now you're talking about legal rights?

523
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,292
You're doing an underground auction,

524
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:54,834
the source of antiques
is clearly not innocent.

525
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:57,501
But now,

526
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:58,834
you're our captives.

527
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:04,834
Well.

528
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:05,834
If you want...

529
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:06,792
the Snake Eye Copper Fish,

530
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:07,751
it's possible.

531
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,209
We can talk it over.

532
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:10,792
What can you bargain with?

533
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:13,834
What we can bargain with...

534
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:15,125
is this!

535
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,459
Run!

536
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,375
Let me go!

537
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:30,626
Xiao Hua!

538
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,417
Go! Go after him!

539
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,999
What are you thinking about?

540
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,334
My things are...

541
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,709
the cheapest here.

542
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,626
-Go and ask around if you want.
-Very well.

543
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,334
Here.

544
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:52,876
What happened?

545
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:55,042
I was grazed by a bullet.

546
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:56,083
No big deal.

547
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:57,542
Where's Wu Xie?

548
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:00,959
Wasn't he with you?

549
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:01,584
No!

550
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:04,083
I hinted him to be with you!

551
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:05,626
Didn't you see my eye signal just now?

552
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:06,459
You...

553
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:09,167
What can we do now?

554
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:14,792
Go back to hotel,

555
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:15,667
Then figure out a plan to save him.

556
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:15,959
Yes.

557
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,709
See you at hotel!

558
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:18,042
You're going there.

559
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:21,167
Here! Here! To this way!

560
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:23,167
Here! To this way!

561
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,918
Here! Right, to this way!

562
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,584
They...

563
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:54,542
Stop there!

564
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,792
I heard that...

565
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:15,083
food in Myanmar is
so special and delicious.

566
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,751
I'd like to try it.

567
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,918
Would you like to join me?

568
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:19,999
Of course.

569
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:35,709
Sir, the man you asked for.

570
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,083
There's no hospitality or so.

571
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:56,125
Should I...

572
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,334
call you Mr. Hendry...

573
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:58,999
or Mr. Qiu De Kao?

574
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,709
Qiu De Kao is fine.

575
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:04,334
When we speak Chinese,

576
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:05,417
using this name...

577
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:06,542
makes me feel friendlier.

578
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:07,918
Why did you bring me here?

579
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:10,542
Don't pretend.

580
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:12,999
There's no coincidence.

581
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:14,709
It's you who sent the message.

582
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:15,834
So,

583
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,751
have you seen what you wished for?

584
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,375
Snake Eye Copper Fish?

585
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,083
Yes.

586
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:22,876
Do you know?

587
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,959
After so many years of research,

588
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,375
I only found out that...

589
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,918
it was cast in Ming dynasty.

590
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:31,250
What are your thoughts?

591
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,292
You want to investigate Wang Zang Hai?
