1
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,840
"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:06,875
"Episode 40"

3
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,000
Slowly.

4
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,080
Clear the snow on it.

5
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,760
I want a better look.

6
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,000
Where did such a...

7
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,320
huge stone come from?

8
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
There are traces of damage.

9
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,760
It might have fallen from above.

10
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
But there are only rocks up there.

11
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,200
Look.

12
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,360
The dragon figures aren't symmetrical.

13
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,920
Looks like
"Two dragons Playing A Pearl".

14
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,000
This kind of stone carving...

15
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,200
should have its pair.

16
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
Normally, a carving like this...

17
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,920
is carved on the same door.

18
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,280
One for each side.

19
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,520
Besides,

20
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,600
judging from the damage,

21
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,360
it should've been caused...

22
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
by an avalanche or earthquake.

23
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
It just so happened to drop here.

24
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,320
So,

25
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,880
we can only wait for dawn...

26
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,520
to look for ways to go up.

27
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,720
The other half...

28
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,080
of this stone dragon must be above.

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,360
Rubbish.

30
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,400
Spouting nonsense
while you know so little.

31
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
What stone door?

32
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
It's the seal of
an underground palace.

33
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,840
Don't touch it.

34
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,000
We're doomed.

35
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,160
Look. You've pulled out its intestine.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,760
It's a chain used to pull the seal.

37
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,840
This is likely the side facing in.

38
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,760
I was wrong.

39
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
But,

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
why would a seal be here?

41
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,600
What's wrong?

42
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Is it frozen?

43
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait.

44
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
Can you smell anything?

45
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
I smell sulfur.

46
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,280
Sulfur?

47
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
Is there a hot spring nearby?

48
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,440
Seems like someone has been here.

49
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,600
Come quick!

50
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,040
I've found tracks left
by an archeology team!

51
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,280
Come quick!

52
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,240
Come!

53
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,280
It's over here!

54
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,080
It's such a secluded spot,

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,400
yet people have been here?

56
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
These writings are ancient,

57
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,440
but not the scratches.

58
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,720
And there are...

59
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,720
traces of life here.

60
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,240
These are the writings in King Lu's
silk book of Warring States period.

61
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,000
What team would...

62
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,640
understand these writings?

63
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,520
Today marks...

64
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,760
the second day we fell into the pit.

65
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,120
We finally caught a glimpse of...

66
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,920
Great Si.

67
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Great Si, are you okay?

68
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,080
I'm fine.

69
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,680
That's nothing new.

70
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,160
Why bother studying it?

71
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,560
Find a way...

72
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
to get out of here later.

73
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,840
Zhao Yu Zheng.

74
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,520
It's a female name.

75
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
Let's see what she wrote.

76
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,600
What are you looking at?

77
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,640
Don't bother.

78
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,240
I know.

79
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
How would you know?

80
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,200
It's their notebook.

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,120
It should be...

82
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,560
about their exploration.

83
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,960
As for the stone dragon,

84
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
you should take a look at it.

85
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,680
Mr. Naive, look.

86
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,480
It's empty.

87
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:02,920
Let's go.

88
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,840
It was just a faint smell.

89
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
But the sulfur smell is so strong now.

90
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,600
It's hollow underneath my feet.

91
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,960
It's a hot spring down there.

92
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,400
Let's see.

93
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,240
It's quite warm in here.

94
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,760
But this angle makes me uncomfortable.

95
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,960
There are some words
on the stone tablet.

96
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,560
What is it?

97
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
I can't see it.

98
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,760
Okay, enough.

99
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,280
Let's all go down and look.

100
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,920
Look, there are writings here.

101
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Here, too.

102
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,840
Look.

103
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
It's not clear.

104
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Looks like Chinese characters,

105
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,360
or Korean.

106
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,280
Korean?

107
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,640
It's Jurchen characters.

108
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
What is it about?

109
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,480
I'm not that good.

110
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,400
I have to study it.

111
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
I'll take a photo.

112
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,000
It's quite hot in here.

113
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,120
It should be at least 30 degrees.

114
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,160
Mr. Naive.

115
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,680
I think we didn't find...

116
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
the stone covered crack...

117
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,480
for no reason.

118
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,438
Exploit mountains
and local resource...

119
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
to build a mausoleum.

120
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,520
The loose stones out there...

121
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,800
should be the quarry...

122
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,520
they used to dig stones...

123
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,760
while constructing underground palace.

124
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,320
They might've found this crack...

125
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,600
when they were digging stones.

126
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,360
But don't know why,

127
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,160
later on,

128
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,640
they sealed it up with the rock.

129
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,080
The smell is getting stronger.

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,640
Let's go.

131
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,040
Here, Great Si.

132
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,920
Sit here and rest.

133
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,640
This is actually...

134
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,640
the vent of a volcano.

135
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,760
Volcano?

136
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Changbai Mountain...

137
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,520
is a dormant volcano.

138
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,720
The last eruption...

139
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,040
was in the early 18th century.

140
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,160
When it wakes,

141
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,320
and the lava flows,

142
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
we're going to die.

143
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,400
Don't worry.

144
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,560
Before you can even react,

145
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,640
we'd have been dead.

146
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,000
That's better.

147
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Guys,

148
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,320
can you say something auspicious?

149
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
This... This is terrifying!

150
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,360
Is this...

151
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
the way?

152
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,440
The crack is too narrow.

153
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,600
Our gears won't fit.

154
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,000
Little Master.

155
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,480
Great Si.

156
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,960
Look.

157
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
We don't know...

158
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
what lies in the crack.

159
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,920
Why not you take a break here?

160
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,600
Three of us will go in and scout.

161
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Kiddo,

162
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
are you trying to fool me?

163
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,400
Do you think...

164
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,920
I'd be embarrassed?

165
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,200
You're right.

166
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,760
With my age now,

167
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,920
it is difficult...

168
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,320
to get in there.

169
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Go on then.

170
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
Go see what's in there.

171
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,480
Great Si,

172
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,920
I'll stay here with you.

173
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,080
It's too narrow.

174
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,440
My clothes will be torn.

175
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,280
Just let it be.

176
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,320
It'll be vintage denim wear.

177
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,080
No way.

178
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,040
These are quite expensive.

179
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,800
Look at this cave.

180
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
It's a unique and primeval cave.

181
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,320
But it's getting hotter in here.

182
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,240
Don't you think so?

183
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,480
Still hot?

184
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,800
I can't even breathe.

185
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,880
Take off more tops.

186
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,120
Otherwise, go topless.

187
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,800
That won't do.

188
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,400
The air quality here is weird.

189
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,240
I think we were too reckless...

190
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
to come in here.

191
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Fatty.

192
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,800
We've come this far.

193
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,200
It'll be a waste to go back now.

194
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,960
Why don't we continue?

195
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,000
If we really can't find the way out,
we'll turn back.

196
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,960
All right.

197
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,640
Little Master!

198
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,400
Let's continue.

199
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,440
What's wrong?

200
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,600
Let's.

201
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,080
Nothing.

202
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,520
Fatty.

203
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,800
What is it?

204
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,200
Can you see me?

205
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
I can't see you!

206
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,160
Where you at?

207
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,640
Screw you.

208
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,000
Get going.

209
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,760
It's killing me.

210
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,520
This is enough for us three
to soak our feet.

211
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,439
There's a mural here, too?

212
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,720
I wonder if the previous expedition
team came here before?

213
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,920
I wonder when they were here,

214
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,999
did the cracks...

215
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,520
collapse already?

216
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,360
This mural is about...

217
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,080
fairies soaring into the sky.

218
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,800
The entrance is sealed
by the coiled dragon stone.

219
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,240
There are more murals in there.

220
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,560
What is this place?

221
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,080
There's hot breeze here!

222
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,640
It's a cave!

223
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
But I can't tell where it leads.

224
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,600
Who cares where it leads.

225
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Just find...

226
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,000
a comfortable and warm spot...

227
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,880
and set up tent.

228
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,120
I think this spot is pretty good.

229
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,080
Little Master,

230
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,160
what do you think?

231
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,480
Okay.

232
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,640
All right.

233
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
The PM2.5 here is slightly higher,

234
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
the rest is fine.

235
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,880
We can call them down now.

236
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,680
Little Master,

237
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,640
when you were climbing,

238
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,200
did you feel anything off?

239
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,680
Is there a problem?

240
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,880
Could it be...

241
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,920
that I was short of breath,

242
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,680
so I had hallucinations?

243
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,840
Actually,

244
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,280
when we were up there,

245
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,920
when Fatty fell down,

246
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,240
and when I saw the message...

247
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,520
left by the archeology team,

248
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,080
I had hallucinations.

249
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,240
Are you all right?

250
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,040
Forget it.

251
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,760
I'm probably too tired,

252
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
and need some rest.

253
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,960
Don't worry.

254
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm fine.

255
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Go and call them.

256
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:04,323
Okay.

257
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,440
You can't keep dreaming.

258
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,600
After you get out of here,

259
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,720
go get it checked in a hospital.

260
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,440
Yeah.

261
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,880
I think I should, too.

262
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,760
I think I must have fallen asleep...

263
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,800
when I was climbing.

264
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,040
That's why I hallucinated.

265
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Hurry and take a rest.

266
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,400
Soak your feet.

267
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,040
Or might as well take a bath. Come.

268
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,920
Go away.

269
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,320
When can we catch up to them?

270
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,120
I'm not too sure.

271
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,720
But I do know...

272
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
that we're not far from...

273
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,880
their destination.

274
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,160
Where's the Piyanping cream?

275
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,760
Have you seen it?

276
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,960
I found it. Here.

277
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,960
I have one. You eat.

278
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Great Si,
the canned food is heated up.

279
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,960
Have one.

280
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,080
I don't eat canned food.

281
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,000
Monk,

282
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,880
have one.

283
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,040
Put it at the side.

284
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,320
Great Si, drink some water.

285
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,840
I say,

286
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,040
this cave...

287
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,880
was obviously naturally formed.

288
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,680
And it has such a narrow entrance.

289
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,200
Why did these people
draw on the wall?

290
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,800
It is rather strange.

291
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,120
By right,

292
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,400
the murals in...

293
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
such an unique place...

294
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,360
should convey a special message.

295
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,440
But it's all just...

296
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,240
fairies soaring in sky
and celebrating.

297
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,600
It's rather common.

298
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,400
It doesn't mean much either.

299
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,200
Monk, look.

300
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,240
The fairies have quite nice figures.

301
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,520
They're curvy.

302
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,640
Fatty, what are you doing?

303
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,600
Don't scratch it. You'll ruin it!

304
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,200
Fatty, you...

305
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,000
Fatty.

306
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,040
What are you doing?

307
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,000
These murals...

308
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,040
might not be valuable,

309
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,320
but it's left by our ancestors.

310
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,320
We can't vandalize it.

311
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,240
That's not it.

312
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,480
I just think it's not that simple.

313
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,960
There seems to be two layers.

314
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,480
Still, you shouldn't damage it.

315
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,680
But,

316
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,520
this...

317
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,360
should not be...

318
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,480
the only mural here.

319
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,240
Such great effort...

320
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,800
to dig such a big cave.

321
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,360
What was their intention?

322
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,400
No idea.

323
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,680
Shun Zi.

324
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,320
What's wrong?

325
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,320
This isn't the hot spring I meant.

326
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,000
What do you mean?

327
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,920
There is a hot spring
near the black rock carving.

328
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,440
But it's not this small.

329
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,880
Go out.

330
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,360
Search around nearby.

331
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,400
What we want...

332
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,160
must be in that hot spring.

333
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,600
With the rock as the center,

334
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,880
the two hot spring mouths
are within its radius.

335
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,160
We got in from the crack...

336
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
and found the hot spring.

337
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,600
In the past,

338
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,920
we'd usually find the hot spring
on the ground.

339
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
The tree hole is covered by the snow.

340
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,680
The hot spring is just underneath.

341
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,560
Yes, it's here.

342
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,320
I thought I took
the wrong route again.

343
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,520
So the real hot spring pit...

344
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,920
is actually here.

345
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,280
Shun Zi.

346
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,200
So, this is the hot spring?

347
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,720
Yes.

348
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,120
Our predecessor purposely misled us...

349
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,320
and caused the archeology team
to find the wrong cave.

350
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,640
Fatty,

351
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,680
you're really headstrong.

352
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,800
See that?

353
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
I wasn't wrong.

354
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,720
Aren't there two layers here?

355
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,520
You're right!

356
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,120
I knew something was wrong.

357
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,080
Aren't the murals different?

358
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,280
Someone must've...

359
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,520
painted another layer...

360
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,040
on the original mural.

361
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,240
The top layer started to peel...

362
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,160
after being exposed to air,

363
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,560
so the bottom layer started to show.

364
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,480
After being exposed for too long,

365
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,680
the color started to...

366
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,760
fade and peel...

367
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,720
just like the top layer.

368
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,400
Moreover, this spot is covered.

369
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,800
Fatty,

370
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,960
you've really sharp eyes.

371
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,640
Nothing special.

372
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,880
My eyes can tell...

373
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,120
the gender of a sparrow...

374
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
from 800 metres away.

375
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,040
It seems like...

376
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,320
it was unfinished.

377
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,360
What do you mean?

378
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,600
Usually, a clear coating is applied...

379
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
on paintings from post-Tang dynasty...

380
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,360
to protect the murals.

381
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Then the colors...

382
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,040
wouldn't fade...

383
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,920
and peel off.

384
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,680
Then, this should be pre-Tang dynasty.

385
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,560
Moreover, it's hot and humid in here.

386
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,360
It'd affect the preservation.

387
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,440
Why are you looking at me?

388
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
You said such wise words,

389
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,960
I couldn't help but pay respect.

390
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,200
Don't think I don't know...

391
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,960
you're paying respect
to the dead warriors.

392
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
We can also pay respect to the living,

393
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,680
it shows our regard.

394
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,040
These floating clouds...

395
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,200
and attire.

396
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,080
Fatty,

397
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,240
Little Master.

398
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,760
Do you remember...

399
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,000
that we'd seen this attire...

400
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
on the murals in the underwater tomb?

401
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,560
Could it be related to...

402
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,480
the Sky Palace?

403
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,040
Master.

404
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,640
What's the Sky Palace...

405
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,520
that they're mumbling about?

406
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,080
Does it have anything to do with...

407
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,480
it?

408
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,080
Go and help them.

409
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,680
Let's go.

410
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
This should be...

411
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,560
the battle between...

412
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,680
King Wan Nu of Dongxia
and the Mongols.

413
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,520
This person.

414
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,520
This person...

415
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,080
should be King Wan Nu himself!

416
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,920
This is very likely to be...

417
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,720
the famous war which had led...

418
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,680
the fall of Dongxia.

419
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,480
Look.

420
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,960
The soldiers with...

421
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,400
armadillo skins and armors...

422
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
are the army of King Wan Nu!

423
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,600
The riders here...

424
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,440
are the army of the Mongols!

425
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,240
Look.

426
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,080
The Mongolian army has completely
outnumbered Dongxia army.

427
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,320
This was a landslide war.

428
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,080
But,

429
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,080
why does the Dongxia army...

430
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,240
look like they're all females?

431
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,400
No wonder their country was destroyed.

432
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,800
That's not it.

433
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,800
This is...

434
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,520
the characteristic
of Dongxia murals.

435
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,440
Look.

436
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,280
All of them...

437
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,320
appear to be very young on mural.

438
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,280
Look.

439
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,360
I also found an abnormal phenomena...

440
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,320
among the allusions.

441
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,760
It seems that...

442
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,760
those who came into contact
with Dongxia...

443
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,080
all said that
there were no old people.

444
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,360
All of them were very young.

445
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,560
The Koreans even said...

446
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,320
that when they died,

447
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,920
they still looked young.

448
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,640
This mural...

449
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,480
is presented in two parts.

450
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,080
But after they're combined,

451
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
It's fascinating!

452
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,600
This part.

453
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,640
Look.

454
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,840
This part recorded...

455
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,880
the situation of the battle.

456
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,400
The Dongxia people
fought one against three,

457
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,800
heroic!

458
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,880
But they were still...

459
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,040
shot dead by the Mongols.

460
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,840
This war...

461
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,120
This war...

462
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,760
ended up a massacre.

463
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,560
Brother Hua, you're really something.

464
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,840
I was confused...

465
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,960
by this mural.

466
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,200
Now everything makes sense
with your explanation.

467
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,720
You're really knowledgeable.

468
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,800
I'm interested in this stuff.

469
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
So, I studied more on it.

470
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,080
Naturally...

471
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,760
I learned a thing or two.

472
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,040
Then, what's the story...

473
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,040
behind Dongxia?

474
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Do tell.

475
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,640
Dongxia...

476
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,720
is a regime that appeared...

477
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,720
in Jilin and Heilongjiang...

478
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,040
when Jurchen was destroyed.

479
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,040
The founding emperor
called himself King Wan Nu.

480
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,960
According to historical records,

481
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,080
this country probably had...

482
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,200
all kinds of connections
with Jurchen people.

483
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,720
Even their scriptures were...

484
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,720
Jurchen characters.

485
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,640
Later, the Mongols made a detour
in Korea and ambushed them.

486
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,120
Dongxia was then destroyed.

487
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,240
So,

488
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,400
it's a short-lived country.

489
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
Only lasted over 70 years.

490
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,200
Many historian experts think...

491
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,080
they're just a tribe.

492
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,000
From aspects of government,
territory to population,

493
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,120
none fitted the scale of a country.

494
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,440
Wait.

495
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,680
Great Si.

496
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
You said you wanted...

497
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,400
to find Dongxia ruins.

498
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,840
But Dongxia...

499
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,600
only lasted over 70 years...

500
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,760
and had small population.

501
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,480
According to their buildings...

502
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,880
and attire on the mural,

503
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,840
they had low productivity.

504
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,120
How did they manage...

505
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,000
to build an underground palace?

506
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,320
Even if they could've,

507
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,320
they wouldn't have had time.

508
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,400
Right.

509
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,720
And the ancient buildings...

510
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,680
had different statuses.

511
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,960
The underground palace
would need a vast land.

512
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,520
Just now, you mentioned...

513
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
the attire of Dongxia.

514
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,640
Have you seen them on...

515
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,440
other murals?

516
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,640
On the mural,

517
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,080
a group of women
were wearing this attire...

518
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,640
and sending off the dead
on the snow mountain.

519
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,000
Their destination was a castle
floating in the clouds.

520
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,760
Have you ever thought...

521
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,520
that the Sky Palace you speak of...

522
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,160
could be the royal mausoleum
of Dongxia?

523
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,960
I thought about it.

524
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,080
But Brother Hua also said...

525
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,760
the fall of Dongxia
was during early Yuan dynasty.

526
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,480
But the Sky Palace...

527
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,800
was the great work of Wang Zang Hai.

528
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,040
There was a gap...

529
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,320
of decades or centuries in between.

530
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,240
Actually,

531
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,080
it could be seen from the traces...

532
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,000
in historical records.

533
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,480
The Mongols...

534
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,560
didn't completely destroy Dongxia.

535
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
But they...

536
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,640
retreated to the mountains.

537
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,640
I studied the records of Goryeo.

538
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,360
When Ming dynasty was found,

539
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,800
the ginseng collectors...

540
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,920
also saw people...

541
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,520
with odd attire here.

542
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,600
I think,

543
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,400
they should've been...

544
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,000
the survivors of Dongxia.

545
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,960
Besides...

546
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,600
We have...

547
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,680
first-hand information to verify this.

548
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,840
Snake Eye Copper Fish?

549
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,840
Take a look.

550
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,320
See if it's real.

551
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,800
It's from Mirror Palace.

552
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,920
He really has it.

553
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,240
I told you.

554
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,320
The fire at Cultural Bureau was fishy.

555
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,080
This copper fish...

556
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,520
is a mutation from dragons.

557
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,160
Our master...

558
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,880
obtained it by chance.

559
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,080
I believe...

560
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,560
it was made by...

561
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
someone who knows
the ins and outs of Dongxia.

562
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,240
What's peculiar is...

563
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,160
he used...

564
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,640
a brilliant trick...

565
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,920
to conceal a highly
confidential information...

566
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,200
in the copper fish.

567
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,720
Master.

568
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,680
Look.

569
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
The secret is here.

570
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
The scales of this fish...

571
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,800
conceals a total of
47 Jurchen characters.

572
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,840
How about that?

573
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,480
Amazing, huh?

574
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Such skills and wits...

575
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,400
the ancients had.

576
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,960
When I first saw it,

577
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,240
I was so shocked
that my jaw almost dropped.

578
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,440
Master.

579
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,280
Then what's written...

580
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,920
on it?

581
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,520
As the data isn't complete,

582
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,080
I haven't deciphered it yet.

583
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,800
But I'm certain...

584
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,960
that the creator of this fish...

585
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,400
wanted to record the secret...

586
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,200
of Dongxia.

587
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,040
There are some records which state...

588
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,480
that after the battle...

589
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,920
with the Mongols,

590
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,920
Dongxia people retreated
to the border of Jilin and Korea.

591
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,359
They lived in discretion
for a very long time.

592
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,480
If we can find...

593
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,640
all the data,

594
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,720
I think...

595
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,640
we'll be able...

596
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,080
to unveil the truth behind history.

597
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,200
Not long ago, I found out...

598
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,240
that Xie Yu Hua...

599
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,720
also has a copper fish.

600
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,040
I had got hold of it,

601
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,279
but I entrusted it
to your Uncle San Xing.

602
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,160
Great Si, you're really generous.

603
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,720
How could you give him...

604
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,800
such an important thing.

605
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,239
He promised me...

606
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,959
two pieces of information in exchange,

607
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,720
and promised...

608
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
to hand me the data...

609
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,480
that he deciphered.

610
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,280
I thought I had nothing to lose.

611
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,720
But after that,

612
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,040
I heard nothing from him.

613
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,200
Kiddo,

614
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,680
your uncle asked you
to look for the Sky Palace,

615
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I bet...

616
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,520
he had already cracked
the message in the copper fish.

617
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,920
Great Si.

618
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,880
Actually, before I came here,

619
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,160
I unknowingly lost my memory.

620
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,320
I couldn't find my uncle either.

621
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,280
We can only rely on ourselves now.

622
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,120
To top it off,

623
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
if you hadn't told me today,

624
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,760
I wouldn't have known
that Dongxia was related...

625
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,440
to the Sky Palace.

626
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,680
Let alone the others.

627
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,600
Wu San Xing, that rascal.

628
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,080
He's always acting all mysterious.

629
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,040
Now, it's pointless.

630
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,240
He even dragged...

631
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,360
his own nephew into this.

632
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
You're right.

633
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,760
Great Si.

634
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,000
I'm not lying.

635
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,040
This is not the first time
he ripped me off.

636
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,440
If he wasn't my uncle,

637
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,360
I would've...

638
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,080
Enough!

639
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,000
Let's get into business.

640
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,720
If this was real,

641
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
it might actually lead us to...

642
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,280
some Dongxia treasure...

643
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,760
and the Sky Palace.

644
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,120
Right?

645
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,280
Come! Let's... Let's look around!

646
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,000
Hurry!

647
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,360
Monk Hua.

648
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,600
It's at the back, right?

649
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,160
Can I blast it?

650
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,120
Are you...

651
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,040
planning to blast the crack open?

652
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,280
Yes.

653
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,560
You better not.

654
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,680
Lang Feng is also known
as the God of Explosives.

655
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,800
As long as we go down,

656
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,440
he could blast wherever we pointed.

657
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,280
He'd know the exact amount
of explosives needed.

658
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,760
That's amazing.

659
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,840
But I mean,

660
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
there's no passage...

661
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,480
in the crack.

662
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,480
It is...

663
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,880
but the structure of
a naturally frozen rock.

664
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,200
Very thick snow...

665
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,480
is accumulated behind it.

666
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,120
And there's no crack...

667
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,000
in the rocks.

668
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,360
There's no other passage.

669
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,640
Just now,

670
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,920
I stuck my hand in there...

671
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,040
to feel the airflow in the rocks.

672
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,320
There's no way...

673
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,880
there'd be a passage.

674
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,440
Not bad, Wu Xie!

675
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
How did you know...

676
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,840
about these?

677
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,600
I studied architecture in university.

678
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,920
I say,

679
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,200
is there nothing else...

680
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,280
to find or see?

681
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,480
If that's the case,

682
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,000
let's go back with the same route.

683
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,160
Don't you want to know...

684
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,480
what's written...

685
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,760
on this copper fish?

686
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,360
On this Snake Eye Copper Fish,

687
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,400
the last sentence of...

688
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,080
the Jurchen wordings
is very interesting.

689
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,600
What does it say?

690
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,840
It says...

691
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,360
that the King of Wan Nu...

692
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,200
is not human.

693
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,880
That's funny.

694
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,800
He must have held
a grudge against the king.

695
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,520
Otherwise he wouldn’t put in so much
effort to create the copper fish...

696
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
with mechanisms.

697
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,360
Just to accuse the king
for being inhuman.

698
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,080
Right?

699
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,440
Fatty,

700
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,840
your thinking...

701
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,600
is extraordinary.

702
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,760
If it wasn't an accusation,

703
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,400
then it'd literally mean
the king wasn't human.

704
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
It says...

705
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
that King Wan Nu...

706
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,080
is...

707
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,960
a monster from the underground.

708
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,360
Could it be...

709
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,440
a metaphor which describes
the king as dragon,

710
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,840
instead of human?

711
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,920
We thought about that too.

712
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,520
But after we studied it,

713
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,720
we realized,

714
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,560
this person just wanted
to record some secrets.

715
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,480
But the copper fish is small,
it fits only limited words.

716
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,280
So his choice of words...

717
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
was objective,

718
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,240
with no unnecessary
metaphors and rephrasing.

719
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,160
Besides,

720
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,960
if what you said was true,

721
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,760
think about it.

722
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Would anyone...

723
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,280
express the idea of
the emperor as dragon...

724
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,000
with these words?

725
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
This sentence isn't clear,

726
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,800
mainly because...

727
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,280
the data is incomplete.

728
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,920
If we can find the rest,

729
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,120
we might uncover...

730
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,680
the real meaning of this sentence.

731
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,760
I'm not that bright, you know.

732
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,560
I can't digest what you said.

733
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,200
Well...

734
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,720
Brother Hua,

735
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,560
let's not do sophisticated talk.

736
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,800
We'll open the casket later.

737
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,640
Once we open the casket,

738
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,640
it'd be clear to see...

739
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,760
whether he's a human or monster.

740
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,600
What I mean is...

741
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,840
it's always better to know...

742
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,880
yourself and the enemy.

743
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,840
-Right, Fatty?
-Yes.

744
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,440
You're right.

745
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,840
By the way,

746
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,440
have you thought about...

747
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,080
why the painter

748
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,320
drew the mural here?

749
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,360
And even added another layer...

750
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,560
to cover it up.

751
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,520
I think...

752
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,120
I'm just guessing.

753
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,640
Maybe,

754
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,000
they wanted to remove the mural...

755
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,920
after they finish it...

756
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,440
and place it in the passage.

757
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,240
It's possible. Look.

758
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,880
Isn't the hot spring quite warm?

759
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,680
It could also be...

760
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,040
the resting area of the workers.

761
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,720
Then,

762
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,600
they had free time,

763
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,040
so they painted to kill time.

764
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,320
I think...

765
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,680
unless,

766
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,000
you find the painter,

767
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,560
otherwise you'd never find out.

768
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,120
Just like a language test.

769
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,360
You're asking me...

770
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,880
what the author is trying to convey.

771
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,600
Even if the author took the test,

772
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,920
he might not even score full marks!

773
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,400
Right?

774
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,680
It's the same thing.

775
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,960
Fatty.

776
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,440
Sometimes, I really think...

777
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,360
we do need...

778
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
a chill person like you with us.

779
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,000
So that...

780
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,400
No.

781
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,920
we won't over think.

782
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,800
We need someone like you, Brother Hua.

783
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,880
If it weren't for you,

784
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,400
we wouldn't have known...

785
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,200
all that knowledge...

786
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,800
and vital information.

787
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,640
We rely on you.

788
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,400
You know it all!

789
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,520
Fatty.

790
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,360
Why do I cringe...

791
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,360
every time you use idioms.

792
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,440
Yeah.

793
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,200
Everyone must be exhausted.

794
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,480
Let's head back and rest.

795
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,200
Come. Go!

796
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,520
Wait!

797
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,560
What's wrong?

798
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,760
Don't make a sound.

799
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,160
It's an avalanche!

800
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,480
Young Master Wu, run!

801
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,280
Hurry!

802
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,040
Brother Hua! Come, quick!

803
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,360
Hurry up! Hurry!

804
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
Hurry! Hurry!

805
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,120
Mr. Naive!

806
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,360
Will they escape the brink of death...

807
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,320
and find the Snake Eye Copper Fish?

808
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,120
Will Wu Xie...

809
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,520
solve the longtime mystery
deep in his heart?

810
00:43:06,360 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned for next season.
