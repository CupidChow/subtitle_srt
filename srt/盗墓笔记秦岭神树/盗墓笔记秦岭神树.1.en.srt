"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:07,218
"Episode 1"

3
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,060
You brat.

4
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,040
That habit of yours was nurtured
by me since you were a kid.

5
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,274
What did I tell you?

6
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,020
How many times did I tell you?

7
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,291
Don't read your grandpa's notebook.

8
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,620
But you just had to!

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
You had a nightmare, didn't you?

10
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,275
That's not it, Uncle San Xing.

11
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,718
Look.

12
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,864
This Copper Fish with Snake Brows...

13
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,100
is different from the one
in grandpa's notebook.

14
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,280
And I've gone through...

15
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,486
the entire notebook.

16
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,080
I just couldn't find the...

17
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:28,193
"Wu San Xing, impudent child!"

18
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,930
Look!

19
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,080
Uncle San Xing!

20
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,700
Uncle San Xing?

21
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,020
You had a nightmare again, didn't you?

22
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
How many times did I tell you?

23
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,880
Don't read your grandpa's notebook.

24
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,618
Uncle San Xing.

25
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,839
You're awake.

26
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,420
What's the dream about?

27
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,874
I dreamt of you...

28
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,760
as a bad guy.

29
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,500
Is that so?

30
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:51,986
All right.

31
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,166
I won't disturb you then.

32
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,940
I'm going to sleep.

33
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:54,932
Sleep early.

34
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:19,199
Uncle San Xing.

35
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,880
Aren't you sleeping?

36
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,312
You woke me up.

37
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:23,775
I can't sleep.

38
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:25,837
Let's drink together.

39
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:26,498
All right.

40
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:28,257
Let me get some for you.

41
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,238
Here.

42
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:12,562
Uncle San Xing?

43
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:18,343
Uncle San Xing?

44
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,898
"Wu San Xing, impudent child!"

45
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,030
"Come to Hainan if you
want to save Uncle San Xing!"

46
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,734
Are you Mr. Wu?

47
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:15,216
-That's me.
-This is for you.

48
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,057
"Clear Water Bay Private Dock"

49
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:47,797
You...

50
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,628
How could you let Xie Lian Huan down?

51
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,160
How could you let Xie family down?

52
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:52,879
Impudent child!

53
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,939
"Come to Hainan if you
want to save Uncle San Xing!"

54
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:25,879
It's you.

55
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:29,474
Long time no see.

56
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,700
Follow me.

57
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:36,148
You sent me the e-mail?

58
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:38,574
Has Uncle San Xing
really gone missing?

59
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,220
You came all the way
here without being sure?

60
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:41,917
I called his staff in the store.

61
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
They didn't know...

62
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
where Uncle San Xing was either.

63
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,359
But Uncle San Xing is a veteran.

64
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,970
I don't believe...

65
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,140
that he'd go missing.

66
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,314
Uncle San Xing is collaborating...

67
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
with our company.

68
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:52,332
Your company?

69
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:55,192
It's an international marine
resources development company.

70
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,592
We use the existing sea lanes...

71
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:58,449
and historical records...

72
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,280
to locate shipwrecks...

73
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:02,296
and salvage the resources on the ship.

74
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:04,570
I know what you mean.

75
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,500
A ship is worth 10 tombs.

76
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:08,255
The resources in a shipwreck...

77
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,537
cost a fortune.

78
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:11,655
Many foreign dealers
want to make money with it...

79
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,555
even though it's illegal.

80
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,475
But how is it related
to Uncle San Xing?

81
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:20,144
This time, Uncle San Xing...

82
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,520
initiated the collaboration.

83
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:24,644
My uncle initiated
the collaboration...

84
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:26,208
to resell the resources in shipwrecks?

85
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,044
It's to protect the ocean ruins.

86
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:29,684
We've gone through legal formalities.

87
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:31,884
And you agreed to...

88
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,146
work with my uncle?

89
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,138
When we last met,

90
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,486
you were not so kind.

91
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,010
Your uncle and our boss...

92
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,558
are good friends.

93
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:43,114
And the clues he gave were convincing.

94
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,913
So the board of directors agreed...

95
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,008
to lend him some
extra equipment and staff...

96
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,250
with strata guarantee...

97
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,685
to scout the ocean
around the North Reef.

98
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,427
It was smooth at first.

99
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,865
Until 5 p.m. two days ago,

100
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:55,927
their ship disappeared from...

101
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:57,585
the satellite positioning.

102
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,537
There's been no news until now.

103
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,846
Enough with the explanation.

104
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:02,063
We're running out of time,
let's get on the ship.

105
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,220
Uncle San Xing is very experienced.

106
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,000
Unless the device in
your ship is broken,

107
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,347
and lost its signal.

108
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,293
That's impossible.

109
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,226
Our devices are of
the latest technology.

110
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,960
Something's happened to my uncle,

111
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,533
but you're here wasting time...

112
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,059
instead of getting
the maritime rescue...

113
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:18,821
to look for him!

114
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:20,562
Your uncle told us to do this.

115
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:21,777
That if something happens to him,

116
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:23,096
he wanted us to find you first.

117
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,057
Impossible.

118
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,064
My uncle has been
tomb raiding for many years,

119
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,860
he has never asked me for help.

120
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:31,834
I won't force you.

121
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,720
So, go home.

122
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,837
I didn't lie about the fact
that we're running out of time.

123
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:32,266
The mid-month windy season...

124
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,480
is approaching.

125
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:36,516
The sea will be rough.

126
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:41,721
You haven't changed at all.

127
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,420
You get agitated so easily.

128
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:48,301
These are our devices.

129
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:49,748
And this case.

130
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:51,798
Uncle San Xing has taken one of them.

131
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,040
See if any of these is useful to you.

132
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,520
Miss Ning,

133
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:37,377
sailing with this broken ship...

134
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,555
is like digging your own grave.

135
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:40,497
You'll get us killed.

136
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:42,245
It's a wreck.

137
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,720
Little comrade?

138
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:47,431
Why are you here?

139
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,106
Why are you here?

140
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:49,891
You guys talk.

141
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,910
I'll go up first.

142
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,580
Ning seems quite influential.

143
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:57,997
Even the second
generation tomb raider is here.

144
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,917
Come, hurry. Take a seat.

145
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:01,808
What did Ning tell you?

146
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,910
She said there's
an underwater tomb here.

147
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:06,197
She asked if I'd like to join.
Why wouldn't I?

148
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,321
Underwater tombs are rare.

149
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,420
I had to get a load of that.

150
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:09,256
Underwater tomb?

151
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,577
But Ning said it's a shipwreck.

152
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,817
It's a shipwreck,

153
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,056
and also an underwater tomb.

154
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,765
It's said that during Ming dynasty,

155
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:19,292
there was a loaded
tycoon named Shen...

156
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,410
Shen?

157
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:21,508
Shen Wan San?

158
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:22,717
That's right.

159
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:24,394
Are you talking about his son?

160
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,793
He was buried underwater.

161
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,800
But in a lake, not the ocean.

162
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,380
I don't care who he was.

163
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,158
Listen.

164
00:14:30,257 --> 00:14:32,740
If he's rich enough to
be a master of the seas,

165
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:35,347
there must be something I could use.

166
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:39,710
Underwater tomb?

167
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:42,103
No wonder Uncle San Xing came here.

168
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,081
By the way,

169
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,160
where's Uncle San Xing?

170
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,382
Ning said,

171
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,048
when Uncle San Xing was
looking for shipwreck with them,

172
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:51,711
he went missing.

173
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,391
Went missing?

174
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:55,757
You know what.

175
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:59,876
I thought I could travel
around here with their money,

176
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,457
but when I heard your uncle was here,

177
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,129
I knew it'd be a tomb raid.

178
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,279
My chance has come,

179
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,289
I'm going to be rich, you know.

180
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:11,109
Fatty.

181
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:12,247
Do you know what's happening now?

182
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,220
How could you still
think of tomb raiding?

183
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:14,257
Hear me out.

184
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,775
I'm here to look for Uncle San Xing.

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,482
Not to mention,

186
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:18,877
you can't just simply
sell the stuff on the ship.

187
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:22,747
As long as I'm having
a good time, I'm happy.

188
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,352
Come on, we hardly met.

189
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:25,658
You've been bossing me
around since you got here.

190
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,360
What's this got to do with you?

191
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:32,645
I wonder which part
of what Ning said...

192
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,035
is true,

193
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,480
and which of it is fake.

194
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:39,469
Let me tell you.
Don't be fooled by her pretty face,

195
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,680
she's sly.

196
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,800
She's like a pitcher plant,

197
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,640
that traps insects.

198
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,798
She only tells a half truth.

199
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,776
She'll rip you off behind your back.

200
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:49,176
You're way too innocent,

201
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:50,740
you won't stand a
chance dealing with her.

202
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:52,591
Even a pitcher plant is picky.

203
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:53,825
A high-fat,

204
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:54,405
high-cholesterol,

205
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,320
and nasty man like you...

206
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:56,378
is definitely not on my list.

207
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:57,765
Come to the deck now.

208
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,260
See that?

209
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:00,242
She's monitoring us.

210
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,080
Now who's the nasty one?

211
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:03,356
Let's go.

212
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:06,785
Stop looking, let's go.

213
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,860
Ning.

214
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,920
Didn't you say it's a shipwreck?

215
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:26,652
What's with the underwater tomb?

216
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:28,406
Didn't your uncle tell you anything?

217
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,204
We're all straight shooters here,

218
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,400
just cut to the chase.

219
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,477
Stop beating around the bush.

220
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:36,136
Your uncle said...

221
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,496
your grandfather mentioned
an underwater tomb in his notebook.

222
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,011
According to the notebook,

223
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,826
the archeology team
that your uncle joined...

224
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:55,746
had located an underwater tomb.

225
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,232
But something happened along the way,

226
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:00,402
and they didn't manage
to explore and salvage it.

227
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:01,461
All related information...

228
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,521
has then been locked away.

229
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,046
This time, your uncle...

230
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:04,972
came to us with the information,

231
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,180
and complete determination.

232
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:09,712
So you lied about
the legal formality.

233
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:12,951
You're using an ordinary
fishing boat as a rescue boat...

234
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,350
because the border guards...

235
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,840
have noticed your actions.

236
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:17,014
So you had to disguise yourself...

237
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,483
and go personally to save my uncle.

238
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,190
Am I right?

239
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,570
These are all trivial matters to me.

240
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,141
Finding your uncle is more important.

241
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,516
It's important to find my uncle,

242
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,729
but this is about principle!

243
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:30,156
It's a matter of life and death.

244
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,220
Let's find your uncle first.

245
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
We'll discuss about
the rest later, okay?

246
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:37,911
This is your device.

247
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:43,103
This boat won't work!

248
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:43,729
Consultant Zhang!

249
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
-Consultant Zhang!
-It won't work!

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,020
-Let me introduce...
-It won't work!

251
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:47,537
What? Why?

252
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:50,456
My boat can go anywhere.

253
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,686
There's no place that it can't reach.

254
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:54,348
It's too old and too small.

255
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:55,343
If the storm hits,

256
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:56,844
this boat might overturn!

257
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,500
Touch wood!

258
00:17:58,582 --> 00:17:59,662
Don't say such ominous things.

259
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,488
You're such a foul mouth,

260
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:06,864
Mister Jinx.

261
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:09,911
Consultant Zhang,

262
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,440
let me introduce you,

263
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:12,763
this is...

264
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,063
Pleasure to meet you.

265
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:18,747
My name is Zhang,

266
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:20,195
Z-h-a-n-g, Zhang Hao.

267
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,185
Hello.

268
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,010
I'm Wu Xie.

269
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,840
You can call me Fatty.

270
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:25,381
Hey.

271
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,906
Consultant Zhang is an
expert of ocean ruins.

272
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:31,755
I'm not an expert.

273
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:33,055
I was just lucky.

274
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,480
I happened to publish a few articles,

275
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,720
and made some minor achievements.

276
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:39,075
It's not worth mentioning.

277
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:39,975
I'm flattered.

278
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,880
You're too humble.

279
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,400
Not at all.

280
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,934
Let's improve together.

281
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:47,307
Oh my!

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,640
Such an expensive watch.

283
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,720
It's so handsome!

284
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:53,755
Mr. Wu, you're a promising young man.

285
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:54,647
Unlike us.

286
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,464
We're so old,

287
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:58,566
we can't do anything now.

288
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,056
The weather's changing!

289
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,755
The weather's changing.

290
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:04,315
It's fine.

291
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,300
Just follow me.

292
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:39,927
Hold on to the rope!

293
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:41,362
Move the stuff inside!

294
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,661
-Hold on tight!
-Can we still sail?

295
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:43,825
The wind is too strong!

296
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,964
We need to take shelter!

297
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,299
See! I told you this boat won't work!

298
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:48,796
Is there any way to
get around the storm?

299
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,041
That's impossible!

300
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,604
The storm is always moving!

301
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,002
I'm afraid we're running out of time!

302
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,280
See!

303
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:55,893
I told you this boat won't work!

304
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,044
Just shut up already!

305
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,300
It's fun!

306
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,500
Fun, my foot!

307
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,303
Hold on tight!

308
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
Hold on tight!

309
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:12,482
Hold on tight!

310
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:13,946
I'll help them!

311
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,125
What are you doing?

312
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,226
-Wu Xie!
-Watch out!

313
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:24,671
Don't try to be a hero!

314
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:25,205
Hold on tight!

315
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,627
Get inside the cabin! Hurry!

316
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:29,137
Hurry up! Hurry!

317
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,453
One of the motors broke down!

318
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:32,904
Repair it! Now!

319
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,900
What did he say?

320
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:35,924
He said one of the motors broke down!

321
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,720
We're really getting ourselves killed!

322
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,683
-Hurry and fix the radio!
-Yes!

323
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,695
Fix the radio!

324
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,097
If a ship passes by,

325
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,900
send out a mayday!

326
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,240
-Yes!
-Hurry up!

327
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,376
I told you!

328
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,314
You're all idiots!

329
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:57,362
Stop making things worse!

330
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,282
Get inside the cabin!

331
00:20:58,345 --> 00:20:59,365
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

332
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:00,635
Let's go! Hurry up!

333
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:02,338
Go!

334
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,860
Get down!

335
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,013
Get down!

336
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,983
Hurry up! Get down!

337
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,045
Ocean, oh, ocean!

338
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,405
-Fatty, are you nuts?
-Get down!

339
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,160
Get down, Fatty!

340
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,540
Fatty!

341
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,900
-Fatty!
-Fatty, wake up!

342
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,302
Hurry! Take him inside!

343
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:38,571
What's that sound?

344
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,620
I'll take a look.

345
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,485
Slowly. Watch out.

346
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,540
Look! What is that?

347
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,491
What is that?

348
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,298
I don't know.

349
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,148
What is that?

350
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,852
Look, it's over there!

351
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,440
What's going on?

352
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
There's a shipwreck ahead.

353
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,550
They want to take a look.

354
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,135
Be careful!

355
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,200
What is that?

356
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,300
A ghost ship!

357
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,276
It's a ghost ship!

358
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:13,021
A ghost ship!

359
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:29,316
Turn around! Don't look!

360
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,860
Hurry up!

361
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:33,977
Hurry up. Turn around.

362
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:34,833
It's a ghost ship, don't look!

363
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,790
Don't look back no
matter what happens.

364
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,218
Even if something touches you,

365
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:39,181
act like you know nothing!

366
00:22:39,184 --> 00:22:39,874
How's that possible?

367
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,626
There is no such thing in this world!

368
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,900
Listen to me!

369
00:22:58,787 --> 00:22:59,553
What's that noise?

370
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:29,187
Hold on tight!

371
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,860
Ning.

372
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,928
What is that?

373
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,360
Don't move.

374
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,336
Little comrade! Move!

375
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,280
Ning!

376
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,428
Ning!

377
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,900
-Come back!
-Let me go!

378
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,940
We can't leave her!

379
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,840
Don't go! It's useless!

380
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,271
Let me go!

381
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,658
She'll die once she
gets on the ghost ship!

382
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,080
She won't make it!

383
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,503
Let me go!

384
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:36,077
Don't go! Listen to me!

385
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,163
-Don't go there!
-Stay here!

386
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:49,212
We have to save her!

387
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:50,065
No!

388
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
We came together,
we must go back together.

389
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,380
Lives come first!

390
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,642
If you do this, you'll kill all of us!

391
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,449
-Fatty!
-Stay put!

392
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:57,666
Watch them.

393
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,176
Don't let them cut the rope.

394
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,036
I'll save her!

395
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,015
Be careful!

396
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:46,107
Ning!

397
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,476
Ning, are you all right?

398
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,860
Where did the hands go?

399
00:26:17,063 --> 00:26:17,712
I'm fine.

400
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,640
That thing is wicked.

401
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:21,249
I lost my strength once
it grabbed hold of me.

402
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,332
What the heck was that?

403
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,514
Come on.

404
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,060
Judging from the rust,

405
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,320
it must have sunken into
the sea for over a decade.

406
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:50,302
Maybe this storm...

407
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
has brought this ship
back up to the water surface.

408
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,340
That's impossible.

409
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,080
If it had sunken into the sea,

410
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,500
it would've been buried by the sand.

411
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,398
Even a crane can't lift it up.

412
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,500
Look.

413
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,464
Besides the natural decay,

414
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,978
there's no massive damage to it.

415
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:05,212
It means that after it was wrecked,

416
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:06,397
it didn't sink into the sea,

417
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:07,827
but it's been floating on the sea.

418
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,900
Why did you save me?

419
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,837
"Notebook"

420
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:11,152
"Archaeological Records
of the Paracel Reefs"

421
00:28:13,754 --> 00:28:16,174
"July 1984,
from Wu San Xing to Chen Wen Jin."

422
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,260
"July 15"

423
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,980
"July 16"

424
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:46,266
Ning!

425
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:52,508
Ning, what are you doing?

426
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,460
Ning, don't move!

427
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,377
Ning!

428
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:02,536
Sea monkey?

429
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,500
Watch out!

430
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:24,920
Let's go.

431
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:25,911
Okay.

432
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,380
How do we go up?

433
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,860
It's keel is broken.

434
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,520
This ship will be flooded very soon!

435
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,824
Let's leave now!

436
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:11,376
The ship is gone.

437
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,040
I'll take a look up there!

438
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,540
Okay.

439
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,565
Fatty!

440
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,640
I'm over here! Fatty!

441
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:35,576
Fatty!

442
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,195
We're here!

443
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,740
Come here!

444
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:44,768
Come here!

445
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,460
Baldy! We'll be safe!

446
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,525
Fatty!

447
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,780
Give me the knife.

448
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:25,768
Don't worry. It's fine.

449
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,174
What's this?

450
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,895
It's human-faced tumor.

451
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:44,801
A sprinkle of cow
hair will do the trick.

452
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,244
She's fine.

453
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:55,892
Just let her rest for a while.

454
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,979
Fatty, is your head all right?

455
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,313
I'm fine, my skull is tough.

456
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,595
But I'm seeing double-image now.

457
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,505
All right.

458
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,820
Find a corner and rest.

459
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:27,139
Don't get another concussion again.

460
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:27,995
No.

461
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,784
One of us has to stay awake.

462
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,019
If I hadn't kept watch here,

463
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,900
they would've run away.

464
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:34,784
I'm here.

465
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,960
Just let them run if they want.

466
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,998
Besides,

467
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,735
they're only trying to make a living.

468
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,643
But then there was a storm...

469
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,600
and a sea monkey,

470
00:35:40,821 --> 00:35:41,821
no one would've stayed.

471
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:42,422
Yeah.

472
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:44,107
They're not raiding tombs,

473
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,744
they didn't lose their uncle.

474
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:48,222
What about the Baldy?

475
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,778
Baldy is very strange indeed.

476
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,780
And Ning, too.

477
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,801
She's hiding a lot of stuff from us.

478
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,080
If it weren't for Uncle San Xing...

479
00:35:58,821 --> 00:35:59,461
Forget it.

480
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,260
Go get some rest.

481
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,260
I will keep watch.

482
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,480
I'm really hyper now!

483
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,620
I can't sleep.

484
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,682
Alright, I'll sleep first.

485
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,290
Two hours.
You can sleep after I wake up.

486
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,155
"Archaeological Records

487
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,840

490
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,057
Uncle San Xing, where are you going?

491
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,900
Take me with you!

492
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,140
There there.

493
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,579
Are you all right?

494
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:04,420
I'm fine.

495
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:08,534
Your uncle has something to do.

496
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,769
Be a good boy and stay at home.

497
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,900
I'll bring you some good
food when I come back.

498
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,640
Good boy.

499
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,413
Grandpa told you to play with me.

500
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,580
You're not listening to him.

501
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,880
Don't tell grandpa.

502
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:24,483
Uncle San Xing is
going to meet Aunt Wen Jin.

503
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,859
It's a great deal.

504
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,444
If we delay it any longer,

505
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,719
you'll lose your aunt-to-be.

506
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,200
Good boy.

00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:41,909
"July 21"

509
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,777
Are we good?

510
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:16,984
You're still mad at me?

511
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,131
Didn't I tell you?

512
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:23,482
I went to meet Aunt Wen Jin.

513
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,140
It's a great deal.

514
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:26,258
In the future,

515
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,457
she will be your aunt.

516
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,653
She'll bear many brothers
and sisters to play with you.

517
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,201
Is Aunt Wen Jin
going to join our family?

518
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:34,800
That's right.

519
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,160
Kylin Zhang.

520
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,580
Isn't this Little Master's name?

521
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,439
Is that really him?

522
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,820
That's impossible.

523
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,436
You're awake.

524
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,445
How are you feeling?

525
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,334
Did you save me?

526
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,580
No.

527
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,880
It was Baldy...

528
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,540
I mean Consultant Zhang.

529
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,451
Him?

530
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,049
I didn't expect that.

531
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
Consultant Zhang is
such a good fighter.

532
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,562
Where did you find
such a rare talent?

533
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,160
I have no idea.

534
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,840
Our company hired him.

535
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,756
I only know that he's
an ocean relics expert.

536
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:51,507
All right.

537
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,324
In this case,

538
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:55,867
it's time for you...

539
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,180
to tell me the truth.

540
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:00,500
What?

541
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,280
Why exactly did you ask me here?

542
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:13,948
Your uncle's ship has
really gone missing.

543
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,720
But a clue shows...

544
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,520
that 3 hours before the
ship had gone missing,

545
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:19,777
he'd already located
the underwater tomb.

546
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,679
They were preparing to get in.

547
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,260
We reckoned,

548
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:24,085
the research ship...

549
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,484
was hijacked by pirates.

550
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,590
If by then,

551
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:29,736
your uncle had
already entered the tomb,

552
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,240
he would be safe.

553
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,860
But not for too long.

554
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,660
Is he going to swim
all the way back...

555
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,359
without support in the
middle of the ocean?

556
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,803
There's no way the oxygen
tank could support him for so long!

557
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,705
In fact,

558
00:40:43,705 --> 00:40:44,803
your uncle once said...

559
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:47,282
there's a certain amount
of oxygen in the tomb...

560
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,380
that one can still breathe.

561
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,526
He knew this tomb too well.

562
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,600
He must've been there before.

563
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,460
Anyway,

564
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,086
what I said was just a deduction.

565
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:07,148
There might be other accidents.

566
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,360
If everything...

567
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,604
was planned by your uncle,

568
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,294
it means he wanted
to do it on his own.

569
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,380
That's impossible!

570
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:17,181
You know Uncle San Xing
better than we do.

571
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,960
This is not his first time.

572
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:19,856
Nonsense!

573
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,638
How could you let Xie Lian Huan down?

574
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,167
How could you let Xie family down?

575
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,380
Impudent child!
