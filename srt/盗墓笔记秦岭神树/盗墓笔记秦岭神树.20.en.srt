00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,760
"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:06,422
"Episode 20"

3
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,360
I only got to know them...

4
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,000
this time around.

5
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,320
I came to join the fun,

6
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,020
learn a thing or two.

7
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,400
But the two of them...

8
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,200
worked together previously.

9
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,020
They managed several big dealings...

10
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,160
and made good money.

11
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,360
The people they recruited this time,

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,340
Uncle Tai and Er Mazi,

13
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,120
actually specialize in this.

14
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,300
So you're the only innocent man.

15
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm like the saying,

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,240
"a single slip may
cause a lasting sorrow".

17
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,320
Luckily I met you, little lifesaver.

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,020
I reined the horse in
at the brink of the precipice.

19
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,200
Pulled back before it's too late.

20
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,440
After Mr. Li died,

21
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
where did the Tombs Collection go?

22
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,220
Mr. Wang has it.

23
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,240
Old man,

24
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,420
you're lying.

25
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,220
How could you say that?

26
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Little lifesaver.

27
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,060
Well, I am...

28
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
sincerely trying to befriend you.

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,200
Didn't you say that...

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,340
all of us...

31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,260
will work together...

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,280
to get through hard times.

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,140
This...

34
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,160
I... It's true.

35
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,380
Everything I said is true.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,360
All right then.

37
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,460
Let's go.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,220
Does it still hurt?

39
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Let me massage it!

40
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,420
You'll be fine after that!

41
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,220
Little Master!

42
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,919
The sound of water is gone.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,020
Are we getting further...

44
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,060
from the watercourse?

45
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,380
This road heads downward.

46
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,220
Could it head straight
to the center of the tomb?

47
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,380
That makes me wonder, Ms. Ning.

48
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,040
Flying all the way across the ocean,

49
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,685
just to torture ourselves here.

50
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,839
You should know...

51
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,281
this tomb very well.

52
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,817
Why do you look like...

53
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,880
you know nothing about it?

54
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,418
Ms. Ning.

55
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,100
Don't ignore me.

56
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,023
The only person who knew it is dead.

57
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:55,338
Do you think I'd believe that?

58
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:57,458
Back in the underwater tomb,

59
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,438
you were very well-prepared.

60
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:01,418
Why would you be so hasty this time?

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,380
Only one person knows...

62
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:04,840
and you know nothing?

63
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,095
This isn't your style.

64
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:10,703
I just came to have
a look around this time.

65
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,057
I didn't plan to come in,

66
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:13,850
but that big fish ruined my plan.

67
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,657
You mean...

68
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:18,674
you have a team out back, huh?

69
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:30,736
Did he buy it?

70
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,459
This is a man-made path.

71
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,599
I think it was made...

72
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:00,719
during the tomb construction...

73
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,320
for trolleys and transporting stones.

74
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:04,117
Then we'll get to the tomb...

75
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:05,097
if we follow this road.

76
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:06,276
Save it.

77
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:08,735
Do you even know which one's
the entrance and the exit?

78
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,820
There're only one road anyway.

79
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,076
It's all the same.

80
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,715
Is there the nest of
another strange beast here?

81
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,054
Where's the noise coming from?

82
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,160
What are these?

83
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,020
Keep quiet.

84
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:14,776
Qian Zhi,

85
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,400
what's the matter?

86
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:29,082
Giddy up!

87
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:01,762
Are they human or ghosts?

88
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:03,394
Definitely not human.

89
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,560
They came out from the stone.

90
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:07,161
Otherwise that blade...

91
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:08,825
would have killed Little Master.

92
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,010
Is this what Mr. Naive
and I heard in the village,

93
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,403
the ghost soldiers?

94
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,761
It's image capturing.

95
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:19,767
What?

96
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:21,849
It's just like the stone
wall of The Forbidden City.

97
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:23,497
Someone saw...

98
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:24,597
the shadow of maidservant...

99
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,677
and eunuch from Qing dynasty.

100
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:28,321
Scientist proved that...

101
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:29,743
it was due to the magnetic field.

102
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,603
Some people happened to...

103
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:33,057
capture their images...

104
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,540
and project them at a certain time.

105
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:38,143
Some are in the form
of sound, some images.

106
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:40,737
This phenomenon
happened all over our country.

107
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:43,829
You're right.

108
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:44,854
I heard about it too.

109
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,159
If it happened in the Forbidden City,

110
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,280
how could I not know?

111
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,539
That happened
because of thunder and rain.

112
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,560
Does it look like
there's thunder here?

113
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:51,597
Or rain here?

114
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,060
Don't forget.

115
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:55,309
The magnetic field here
is totally messed up.

116
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,498
Those people who passed by...

117
00:09:58,034 --> 00:09:59,074
were suited in Northern Wei attire.

118
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,223
Maybe during Northern Wei period,

119
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,640
these people passed by.

120
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,843
And because of the magnetic field,

121
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:07,907
their images from
the past were captured.

122
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:10,111
That's why we could see it.

123
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:11,692
That's right.

124
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,679
The leader earlier...

125
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,781
was wearing Northern Wei attire.

126
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:17,332
That look in their eyes...

127
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,400
was so daunting.

128
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,308
They definitely had
fought through many wars.

129
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,777
God knows how many
people they've killed.

130
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,837
I heard the mule would be
scared when the horse gets beaten,

131
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:26,342
but why are you so scared?

132
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,745
You're such a coward! Move aside!

133
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,400
Little Master,

134
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:36,717
what's going on?

135
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,600
Let's go.

136
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:23,077
What the heck is this place?

137
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,842
After a long day of effort,

138
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,409
how did we end up in a graveyard?

139
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,610
What's wrong?

140
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:52,029
Old man,

141
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:53,058
you're such a coward.

142
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,669
That's not it.

143
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:56,557
When I was walking towards here,

144
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:59,745
I felt something chilly
behind my neck.

145
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:02,029
Some... Something's blowing.

146
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:03,601
Look.

147
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,097
The torch has gone out.

148
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:08,456
It's so creepy.

149
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,139
It went out on its own?

150
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:16,486
It went out in a blink of an eye!

151
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,660
It's so creepy.

152
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,644
-It's so creepy.
-Lao Yang.

153
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,675
No matter if it's real or not,

154
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:31,261
be careful.

155
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:33,883
This place...

156
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:35,437
is way too creepy.

157
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,540
We must be careful!

158
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,057
It's an intersection.

159
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,740
Which way should we go?

160
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:11,057
Left.

161
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:14,028
Right.

162
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:18,054
How do you know?

163
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,900
I...

164
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,191
Then please lead the way.

165
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,411
Sure.

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,580
Forget it.

167
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:35,031
We'd better listen to you.

168
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:38,033
Take the left.

169
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,468
I'm so old already.

170
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,842
I'd be better off walking behind you.

171
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,568
Boys,

172
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,253
don't you think...

173
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,620
this place seems familiar?

174
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:16,506
Are we back at the same place again?

175
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,340
We'll listen to
Teacher Liang this time.

176
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:21,601
Let's go this way.

177
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,140
I told you to take this way.

178
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,780
Move. Don't get ahead of yourself.

179
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,380
Hurry.

180
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,420
We're back at the same place again.

181
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:47,461
Oh, no.

182
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:50,661
Could it be the spirits
of these corpses...

183
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:51,761
be blocking our way...

184
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:53,781
and stopping us from getting out?

185
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:55,369
Is that right, old man?

186
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,480
As I see it,

187
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:58,821
we've been...

188
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,186
circling this place,

189
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,101
because of the...

190
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:04,567
coffin arrangement here.

191
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,600
I'm certain that someone...

192
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,280
must have applied...

193
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,194
some weird tricks here.

194
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,400
I'm sure you know...

195
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,200
Zhu Ge Liang's Stone Sentinel Maze.

196
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,834
He managed to trap
hundreds of thousands...

197
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:18,801
of soldiers...

198
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,963
just by arranging some stones.

199
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,720
Trapping us with these coffin walls...

200
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:26,261
is just a piece of cake.

201
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:27,781
Don't make it sound so mysterious.

202
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,486
It's just a maze structure.

203
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,841
It's always a maze or a formation.

204
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,821
Enough is enough.

205
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,101
I don't mean to boast,

206
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:40,741
but if it's just a formation,

207
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,334
I can try to solve it.

208
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,000
But looking from the cliff,

209
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,599
this area is too big.

210
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,081
I'm not sure how long
I'd need to solve it.

211
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:54,383
Old man,

212
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,359
what are you babbling about?

213
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:57,721
I say,

214
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,127
we should use this torch...

215
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:00,562
and burn this place down.

216
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:01,861
Then the path will an open road...

217
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,865
-awaiting us.
-What are you thinking?

218
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,220
We'd burn ourselves as well.

219
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,441
We'd be burned to death
or choked to death.

220
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,445
Let's go.

221
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:07,849
Where are we going?

222
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,325
There's only one path left,

223
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,440
where do you think?

224
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,329
Wait for me.

225
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,192
Wait up!

226
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,046
Hold on!

227
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,383
How did the fire go out again?

228
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:48,483
Something...

229
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:51,543
Something's in the wall.

230
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:56,703
Why would the wind come from the wall?

231
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:58,543
That... that's right.

232
00:18:58,643 --> 00:18:59,583
Old man,

233
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,840
I told you you're a coward,
yet you denied it.

234
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,618
It's true.

235
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm not lying.

236
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,466
There really is something in there!

237
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,620
Over there!

238
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,122
Wu Xie, something's in there!

239
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,480
Amitabha, Amitabha,

240
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:28,503
Amitabha.

241
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:29,961
Out of all the things in the world,

242
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,480
why did I choose to explore this cave?

243
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,480
This time...

244
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:34,723
This time I'm really doomed.

245
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:39,245
I'm going to die in a strange land.

246
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,460
Old man, enough!

247
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,663
If you keep bawling,
I'll dump you here!

248
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,600
Go back on your own!

249
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,023
Wu Xie,

250
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,743
what was that?

251
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,580
I didn't see it clearly,

252
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,580
but I did feel like something...

253
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,720
passed by behind me.

254
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:05,423
Could it be a zombie?

255
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:08,503
-Lao Yang.
-Boys!

256
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,740
Don't frighten yourself.

257
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,170
Hurry and figure something out!

258
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,160
If there really are zombies here,

259
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:15,719
we might...

260
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,500
die with our bodies ripped apart!

261
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:23,053
My God!

262
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,172
My God!

263
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,413
Don't crush me!

264
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,857
Shut up, we need to kill that thing!

265
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,420
I can't hold it anymore!

266
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:16,182
I can't hold it anymore!

267
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,300
No way!

268
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,120
What's wrong, Wu Xie?

269
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,280
It's not moving anymore?

270
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,220
Is it dead?

271
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,526
I'll be dead if you keep crushing me.

272
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,776
Come.

273
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:36,714
Get up.

274
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,399
A rat?

275
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
No wonder we couldn't find it.

276
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
We lost it once it ran into a hole.

277
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,928
True.

278
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,440
It scared me to death.

279
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:54,771
Such a huge rat,

280
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,691
what kind of species is that?

281
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:58,819
Have you not heard about it before?

282
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,359
During the Sino-Japanese War,

283
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,186
there was a Japanese
army in northeast called...

284
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,542
Unit 731.

285
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,562
They purposely cultivated a virus...

286
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:07,612
and raised the rats.

287
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:09,192
The rats were enormous!

288
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,920
Could this be bred by virus too?

289
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,103
It could have...

290
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,760
lived off the corpses.

291
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,584
Not much different from
being bred by virus.

292
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:21,759
Look.

293
00:22:56,731 --> 00:22:58,498
What did you see?

294
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:01,332
Don't touch the coffin!

295
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,180
Be careful.

296
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,140
Okay.

297
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,940
Careful.

298
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,994
What's in there?

299
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,552
What did you see?

300
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:43,764
Big mutated rats.

301
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,160
Big mutated rats?

302
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,183
Then... then don't disturb them.

303
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:56,917
Let's get out of here!

304
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:03,755
Wu Xie.

305
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:04,720
Wu Xie.

306
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,792
Let's leave this place.

307
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,840
Let's go.

308
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:13,232
Wait up!

309
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,020
Come.

310
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,800
This way.

311
00:26:48,978 --> 00:26:49,454
Wu Xie,

312
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,858
where should we go next?

313
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,165
-Let me think.
-I can't go any further.

314
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:57,884
I really can't go any further.

315
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:00,315
I think it'll take us a while...

316
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,012
before we make it out of here.

317
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:04,127
Let's take a break.

318
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,060
Do you have any water? Give me some.

319
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:08,235
Give me some.

320
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,940
So troublesome.

321
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,361
There.

322
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,540
Old man,

323
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,719
what are you looking at?

324
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,280
Have you lost your mind
from all those scares?

325
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,680
Are you going to put those...

326
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,820
broken bones together?

327
00:29:02,215 --> 00:29:03,175
Let me tell you.

328
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,042
I've discovered a secret.

329
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,750
Come. Come here.

330
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,083
Look.

331
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,614
Do you notice anything?

332
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,181
Just get to the point, old man.

333
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,386
I won't tell you only.

334
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,840
Little... little lifesaver!

335
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,920
Little lifesaver!

336
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,500
Come here and see.

337
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,880
Stop shouting, just spit it out.

338
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:35,628
Hurry up.

339
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,780
Look.

340
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,532
Look at how clean the cut is.

341
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,520
It's a human collarbone.

342
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,383
It's caused before death.

343
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,000
Look.

344
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,299
It's sharp, isn't it?

345
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,340
This means...

346
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,518
the healing of the wound...

347
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,946
was impeccably close...

348
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,031
to the time of death.

349
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:55,736
How...

350
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,043
How is this a secret?

351
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,160
Let me finish it first.

352
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,820
This wound...

353
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:04,876
should be the man's...

354
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,123
cause of death.

355
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,295
I'm guessing that the wound is here...

356
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,252
because...

357
00:30:10,515 --> 00:30:13,125
he was knifed on
the upper collarbone,

358
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,560
and it slashed through
his carotid artery.

359
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:17,318
A brutal blow.

360
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,298
So,

361
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:20,122
it struck straight into the bone.

362
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,046
So all you want to say is...

363
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,540
this man...

364
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,245
was killed by a single slash.

365
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:29,751
That's not all.

366
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:31,392
Just now,

367
00:30:31,692 --> 00:30:32,692
I've taken a good look.

368
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,358
Many corpses here...

369
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:37,148
were slashed to death like this.

370
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:40,688
Normally,

371
00:30:41,488 --> 00:30:42,646
during the ancient sacrificial ritual,

372
00:30:42,962 --> 00:30:44,157
the victims would kneel...

373
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,360
in front of the sacrificial objects,

374
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,304
while the priest would cut
their throats from behind.

375
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,139
In this situation,

376
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,241
such a cut...

377
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:53,528
wouldn't leave a mark
on the collarbone.

378
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:55,895
These people before us here...

379
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:58,395
were slashed from the front.

380
00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:00,056
So I reckon,

381
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,263
these people died...

382
00:31:02,523 --> 00:31:03,523
in a battle.

383
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,640
Old man,

384
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:07,087
so be it!

385
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:09,047
How's that a secret?

386
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,380
This is just...

387
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,300
the beginning of the big secret.

388
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,191
The highlight is yet to come.

389
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,040
Little lifesaver,

390
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,580
take a look at this.

391
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,044
Bronze armor?

392
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,440
That's right.

393
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,373
And it's the armor style...

394
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,560
from the Post-Han dynasty.

395
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,000
Look at this one.

396
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
There isn't any lining.

397
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,671
So it's an armor for summer.

398
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,507
This man died during summer.

399
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,357
The oddest part is...

400
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:51,556
this one. Look.

401
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,089
It's silk.

402
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:57,033
That's right.

403
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:59,589
You're a bright man.

404
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,270
You could tell from just a glance.

405
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:06,477
Silk, armor...

406
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,720
These were used by the Hans.

407
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:11,015
Why are these...

408
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,320
in the Serpents' sacrificial tomb.

409
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:15,723
If I got it right,

410
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,180
what's within...

411
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,340
isn't some sacrificial tomb,

412
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:23,287
but an ancient battlefield.

413
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,232
From the way I see it,

414
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:31,755
the corpses here...

415
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:34,483
are of two different parties.

416
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,830
One is the guards
of this ancient tomb,

417
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:40,554
the other is the Han dynasty army.

418
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,728
The Mute Riders?

419
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:48,117
That's right.

420
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,677
I'm betting that the
Serpent tomb guards...

421
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,475
led them here.

422
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:57,356
With the complex
structure of this maze,

423
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,503
they destroyed the Mute Riders
in one fell swoop.

424
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,568
Let's split up. Be careful.

425
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,991
All right, move out.

426
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,248
Old man.

427
00:35:12,815 --> 00:35:13,715
How did the Mute Riders...

428
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,775
get out in the end?

429
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,370
I haven't figured out so far.

430
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,220
Then why don't we do as I say.

431
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,952
Let's burn this place down.

432
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:26,385
As long as we cover
our mouths and noses,

433
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,007
and be careful,

434
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,042
-we'll make it out.
-Okay.

435
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,378
Keep that thought.

436
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,927
From how I see it,

437
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,000
we're only stuck here in this maze,

438
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,979
because we've lost sense of direction.

439
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,120
You got that?

440
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,670
The reason why we've
lost sense of direction...

441
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,140
is because we cannot...

442
00:35:42,244 --> 00:35:43,464
determine a further linear distance.

443
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,440
If we can determine...

444
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,370
the correct direction,

445
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,739
it wouldn't matter how
complex the maze is,

446
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,727
we'd still get out.

447
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,736
How's that possible,

448
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,640
my dear lifesaver.

449
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,489
In this environment we're in...

450
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:54,378
We...

451
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,637
We'll go dizzy
if we go round in circles.

452
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,400
How can we even go straight?

453
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,174
Lao Yang.

454
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,603
Signal flare.

455
00:36:21,122 --> 00:36:21,537
Let's go.

456
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,240
Wait!

457
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,992
Wait for me!

458
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,220
Hurry.

459
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:03,683
Lao Yang!

460
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,760
Are you all right?

461
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:05,500
Hurry!

462
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,220
I can't run any further.

463
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,420
Lao Yang!

464
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,020
Retreat!

465
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,660
Hurry, hurry!

466
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:31,725
What was that?

467
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,591
It's burning so fast!

468
00:37:32,696 --> 00:37:33,236
Corpse oil.

469
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,538
The soil is soaked with corpse oil.

470
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,835
Run for your life!

471
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,923
Get back here!

472
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:58,402
What is it?

473
00:37:58,705 --> 00:37:59,705
Wu Xie, are you insane?

474
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,125
What are you researching now?

475
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,660
Look!

476
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,220
The coffin's moving!

477
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,900
Is there a secret passage?

478
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,700
Fire!

479
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,702
Hurry!

480
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:16,840
Hurry up!

481
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,754
It exists!

482
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:27,246
Lao Yang.

483
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:30,706
Teacher Liang!

484
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,885
Give me a hand!

485
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,118
I'm on fire!

486
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,854
My butt's on fire!

487
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,080
How did you catch fire?

488
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,779
-My butt's on fire!
-Turn around!

489
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,541
Why are you the only one on fire?

490
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,899
You must've done...

491
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,600
too many sins.

492
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,653
Stop your nonsense, let's go!

493
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,700
Hurry!

494
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,516
Little lifesaver,

495
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,492
have you figured out a plan?

496
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,881
Just intuition.

497
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:54,673
Let's split up and search!

498
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,860
The movable coffin...

499
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,126
must be around the intersection.

500
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:24,386
Found it!

501
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,279
This...

502
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:27,054
How did we...

503
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,841
end up in another dead end?

504
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,160
Wu Xie.

505
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,740
This coffin won't budge.

506
00:40:48,975 --> 00:40:51,355
Now we're really doomed!

507
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,284
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

508
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,625
My dear lifesaver,

509
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,274
stop playing around with the coffins.

510
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,028
Figure something out.

511
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,335
What should we do...

512
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,757
if the fire catches up?
