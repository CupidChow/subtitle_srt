"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,250
"Episode 5"

3
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,040
It's so beautiful!

4
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,330
Indeed.

5
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,410
Oh my god!

6
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,870
Good heavens.

7
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,750
This is a paradise!

8
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,910
Oh my god, this is so magnificent!

9
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,750
Can't believe there's...

10
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,830
such a beautiful place
in this ancient tomb.

11
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,540
Unbelievable!

12
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,500
This is an entire piece
of Phoebe Zhennan log!

13
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,950
Impressive!

14
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,990
Look at that.

15
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:39,990
Look!

16
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,410
It's the Luminous Pearl!

17
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,120
It's gorgeous.

18
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,370
It's ludicrous...

19
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,000
how they're embedded in
the 50 stars of the star chart.

20
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,080
My God!

21
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,000
The tomb owner is filthy rich!

22
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,790
Kylin, what are you looking at?

23
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,450
This must be the model
of the Sky Palace...

24
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,910
painted on the porcelains.

25
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,370
Sky Palace?

26
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,700
He really built a Sky Palace?

27
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,200
Where is it located?

28
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,410
In the sky?

29
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,040
This is awesome!

30
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,910
This tomb is...

31
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,870
a treasure trove!

32
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,950
Since we walked in,

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,549
we came across...

34
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,990
endless new discoveries
known to history!

35
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,620
When we find the Sky Palace,

36
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,790
the world will be shocked!

37
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,910
-For sure!
-Totally!

38
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,000
That'll be incredible!

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
Come and help me up.

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,080
I want to go have a look.

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,830
Coming.

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:32,870
Careful.

43
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,620
What's wrong?

44
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,450
I saw a corpse!

45
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,120
Kylin Zhang.

46
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,580
Who are you?

47
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,750
How did you know how to raid?

48
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,540
Who really are you?

49
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,500
How are you...

50
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,500
so calm in the tomb?

51
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,200
What's your real motive...

52
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,910
for joining the archaeological team?

53
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,830
Wen Jin,

54
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,700
what's going on up there?

55
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,870
It doesn't matter who I am.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,500
Look.

57
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,950
There's something in it.

58
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,620
If we take what's not ours...

59
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,000
there will be consequences.

60
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,450
The corpse is coming to life!

61
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,500
No.

62
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,330
That's not it.

63
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,700
Bio-electricity causes...

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
some changes in the corpse.

65
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,950
It's a physics phenomenon.

66
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,200
Go down.

67
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,750
Let me deal with it.

68
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,750
-What's going on?
-Sister Wen Jin?

69
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,000
How's everything up there?

70
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,750
Don't be afraid everyone.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,950
Why is it suddenly so dark?

72
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,990
Torchlight, hurry!

73
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,660
Stay calm, everyone.

74
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,660
Don't move.

75
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,750
The wall...

76
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,450
On... on the wall!

77
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,750
This is a shadow painting.

78
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,040
Light shines on the wall...

79
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,290
from a specific angle,

80
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,750
forming this painting...

81
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,040
with carvings on the wall.

82
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,410
That's right.

83
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,540
No need to panic.

84
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,080
This is a scientific phenomenon.

85
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,660
Then, what's this painting about?

86
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,160
Kylin,

87
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,500
what have you found?

88
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,290
It looks like a narrative painting,

89
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,410
showing the situation before...

90
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,290
the Sky Palace was completed.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,700
Look.

92
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,750
The palace was actually built...

93
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,750
on a very steep mountain.

94
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,700
The whole palace was enveloped..

95
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,910
in mist on the mountain,

96
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
as if it was floating on clouds.

97
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,910
It's true!

98
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,950
It looks like a snow mountain.

99
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,040
Look!

100
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,910
Is that snow...

101
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,330
on the peak?

102
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,580
The altitude of this
mountain is very high.

103
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,500
But I don't know which mountain is it.

104
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,330
It seems like a shadoof was used...

105
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,080
to pull the coffin up the mountain.

106
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,410
Are the people below the mountain...

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,370
taking part in a funeral procession?

108
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,910
So the Sky Palace is...

109
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,540
actually a mausoleum.

110
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:23,910
Who is that person...

111
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,000
in the coffin?

112
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,080
I've never read any
historical records...

113
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,450
regarding this.

114
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,910
Me neither.

115
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,250
Who is this?

116
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,250
Why is the boardwalk on fire?

117
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,450
Those must be the mausoleum guards.

118
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,620
After the encoffining ceremony,

119
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,750
they set the boardwalk on fire,

120
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,330
destroying the only way to...

121
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,120
the Sky Palace.

122
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,750
So no one could get in.

123
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,250
The mausoleum would be safe then.

124
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,620
But...

125
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,080
they also couldn't come down.

126
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,410
The mausoleum guards...

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,910
lived and died...

128
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,200
with the mausoleum.

129
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,370
That's such an...

130
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,660
inhuman feudal society.

131
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,290
Where did the Sky Palace go?

132
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,990
Did it fly to the heavens?

133
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,620
There was probably an avalanche.

134
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,790
The snow buried it.

135
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,540
Unbelievable!

136
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,870
No.

137
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,870
The whole mountain...

138
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,580
was buried in snow.

139
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,540
Wouldn't that mean...

140
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,330
the whole mountain...

141
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,660
became a real graveyard?

142
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,750
So much effort...

143
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,330
and resources were put...

144
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,500
into building the palace.

145
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,750
Yet, fate played a cruel trick

146
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,910
Wang Zang Hai left this painting.

147
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,410
Probably because...

148
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,620
he couldn't get over it.

149
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,290
It seems that...

150
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,250
even if we do find...

151
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,250
where the Sky Palace is,

152
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,330
we're unlikely to uncover it.

153
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,450
No worries.

154
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,950
I believe technology

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
will get more developed with time.

156
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,700
One day,

157
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,870
we'll find it.

158
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,500
Agreed!

159
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,990
Here.

160
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,660
What is it?

161
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,830
-There's a man over there!
-What?

162
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,790
What's going on?

163
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,580
There... there's a man over there!

164
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,870
Who is it? Come out!

165
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:30,750
It's...

166
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,450
It's Wu San Xing!

167
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,080
I saw his face!

168
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,540
Are you sure it's San Xing?

169
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,290
Did you see it clearly?

170
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,450
I...I only saw half of his face.

171
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:14,790
It's okay.

172
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,700
Except for Kylin
and the last one behind,

173
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,580
the rest turn off your torchlight.

174
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,700
We've used a lot of...

175
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,620
battery.

176
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,790
We need to save it.

177
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I'm scared.

178
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,120
Scared of what?

179
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,160
There are so many of us.

180
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,040
It's okay.

181
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,000
Walk together with me.

182
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,080
Don't swing your torchlight!

183
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,950
Light the road!

184
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,950
How come there's water?

185
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:57,910
Stuffy,

186
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,660
so...

187
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,620
you lost your memory
after coming out...

188
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,950
from the tomb?

189
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,830
If you're a storyteller,

190
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,790
this is an annoying pause.

191
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,370
If you're a script writer,
 this is a lousy ending.

192
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,450
If you're a novelist,

193
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,160
you're George R.R. Martin.

194
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,540
It's not just what
happened in the tomb,

195
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,830
I don't even...

196
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,870
remember who I am.

197
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,990
It was only a few months later.

198
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,450
I finally remembered...

199
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,080
some fragments of my memories.

200
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,500
Few years after that,

201
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,660
I realized...

202
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,450
something was wrong with my body.

203
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,700
I don't remember...

204
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,290
what the reason was.

205
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,910
But 3 months ago,

206
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,040
I ran into your Uncle San Xing.

207
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,790
I thought he looked familiar.

208
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,870
I wanted to find out...

209
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,120
more about myself,

210
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,120
so I followed you...

211
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,540
to King Lu's Seven Stars Palace.

212
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,500
Over there,

213
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,580
I found something
fishy about your uncle.

214
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,330
Stuffy,

215
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,250
you said that after...

216
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,660
coming out of the tomb,

217
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,660
you lost your memory.

218
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,580
Maybe the traps...

219
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,540
and the scent here...

220
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,870
made you see things.

221
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,000
So maybe before you passed out,

222
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,450
the person you saw wasn't my uncle.

223
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,870
It might've had
nothing to do with him.

224
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,580
The golden silk book...

225
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,580
you took from the copper coffin...

226
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,750
was fake.

227
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,910
The real one...

228
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,080
was taken by your uncle.

229
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,540
Stuffy,

230
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,950
how come I remember...

231
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,790
Uncle San Xing told me that...

232
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,700
it was you who switched it.

233
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,040
No.

234
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,910
It was your uncle.

235
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,910
He and Da Kui...

236
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,290
dug a tunnel from behind a tree...

237
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,120
to the bottom of the coffin.

238
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,990
This is also the reason why...

239
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,700
Da Kui had to die.

240
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,660
That's not true.

241
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,950
It was only a dream.

242
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,790
Think about it yourself.

243
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,500
How many things have your uncle...

244
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,950
hid from you or lied to you?

245
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,540
How many suspicious things...

246
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,200
have you discovered about him?

247
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,870
I know best...

248
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,080
what kind of person my uncle is.

249
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,000
He would never hurt me!

250
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
If he really was your uncle,

251
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,290
for sure he won't hurt you.

252
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,290
But...

253
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
What do you mean?

254
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,160
What is the point of you guys...

255
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,790
talking about this now?

256
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,160
It doesn't matter...

257
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,370
who's telling the truth.

258
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,000
It only matters...

259
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,160
if we get out of here.

260
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,200
So how?

261
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,450
You want to stay here?

262
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,410
And be stuck in here?

263
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,910
Each of you can get a folding stool...

264
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,870
and chit-chat like old ladies,

265
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,410
while you keep
talking about the truth.

266
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,910
Seriously!

267
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,200
Let me...

268
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,080
get dolled up.

269
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,330
Fatty,

270
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,080
you're such an eyesore.

271
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,660
Are you imitating
the Forbidden Maiden?

272
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
You know nothing.
I'm becoming one with character.

273
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,080
Right now, I'm a pretty lady.

274
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,790
A pretty lady is me.

275
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,080
Gate of Life.

276
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,370
Stone road.

277
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,750
Open!

278
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,700
Open!

279
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,370
All right.

280
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,700
Fatty,

281
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,910
tell me.

282
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,290
You don't really...

283
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:26,990
want to...

284
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,410
just see the Sky Palace, right?

285
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,660
We can't have...

286
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,910
came all this way...

287
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,830
for nothing.

288
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,830
No harm taking a few of...

289
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,080
the Luminous Pearls.

290
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,450
You're unbelievable!

291
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,620
I knew it!

292
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,500
At a time like this,

293
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
yet you're thinking about pearls.

294
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,830
You've got me wrong.

295
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,040
I have a plan.

296
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,040
Dummy Zhang said that...

297
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,870
the stone road goes uphill.

298
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,660
The room with...

299
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,620
the wall painting has...

300
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,540
a very high dome.

301
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,950
The slope plus the dome...

302
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,330
are about 10 meters high.

303
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,450
How deep is this tomb?

304
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,580
If we want to go out,

305
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,830
we have to exit from the dome.

306
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,290
We have...

307
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,540
three ways out now.

308
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,330
First one...

309
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,580
is to go back the way we came from.

310
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,410
But we don't know...

311
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,200
how often...

312
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,790
the chambers move.

313
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,910
We don't know when...

314
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,790
we can return...

315
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,910
to the first chamber.

316
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,160
Second method.

317
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,990
The tomb builders...

318
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,290
must have built a secret passage...

319
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,830
to prevent themselves
from being buried alive.

320
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,990
But this secret passage...

321
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
leads to the sea.

322
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,790
This goes back...

323
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,200
to the problem we had before.

324
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,040
The sea is so deep.

325
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,700
Without the oxygen cylinders,

326
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,870
if we go up, we'll either get...

327
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,750
decompression sickness...

328
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,580
or air embolism.

329
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,790
So it doesn't work at all.

330
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,000
Third method.

331
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,540
Dig our way out.

332
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,450
You smartypants.

333
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,080
When we first walked
on the tomb passage,

334
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,410
I looked at the water pressure gauge.

335
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,000
We were 13 meters...

336
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,290
below sea level.

337
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,910
This pool is...

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,990
about 10 meters...

339
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,160
from the tomb passage.

340
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,250
So we're now...

341
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,410
less than 30 meters...

342
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,660
below sea level.

343
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,870
So...

344
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,000
the ceiling of the room...

345
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,990
where the model of...

346
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,160
the Sky Palace is stored...

347
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,290
is less than 10 meters.

348
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,990
We may still stand
a chance of getting out.

349
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Not bad, fatty.

350
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,080
You finally came to the point.

351
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,160
I'm always on point.

352
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,410
Alright.

353
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,450
Don't waste my time,
I need to put on my make up.

354
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,870
Don't make me miss the low tide.

355
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,250
Fine.

356
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,700
I won't disturb you dressing up.

357
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,200
By the way,

358
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,790
let me warn you.

359
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,330
If we really get in,

360
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,870
don't touch anything.

361
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,250
If there really are traps,

362
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,040
at least we won't...

363
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,700
die because...

364
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,870
of some dead people's stuff.

365
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,200
You're so mean.

366
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,160
Last warning.

367
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,990
Don't touch the Luminous Pearls.

368
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,120
Little master,

369
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,410
Fatty and I have analyzed...

370
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,910
I heard everything.

371
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,250
I've got it right!

372
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,750
I've got it right!

373
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,870
I've got it right!

374
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,910
Luminous Pearl.

375
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,500
There is a Luminous Pearl.

376
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,580
There is a Luminous Pearl.

377
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
Luminous Pearl.

378
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,580
Luminous Pearl.

379
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,160
Luminous Pearl.

380
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
This passage is so narrow.

381
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,910
If I can't pass through this passage,

382
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,990
it means either the tomb owner...

383
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,080
is too narrow-minded...

384
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,990
or I have too big a heart.

385
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,700
What passage is this?

386
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,540
So narrow.

387
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,870
Do you realize...

388
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,450
it's so quiet here?

389
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
And it seems like...

390
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,330
this passage has no end.

391
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,790
Maybe if we keep walking,

392
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,830
we'll reach the cosmos.

393
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,620
That's not even possible.

394
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,620
From the sea to the cosmos.

395
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,660
What are you thinking?

396
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,250
It's just a metaphor.

397
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,750
I happen to have another one.

398
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,830
This is like an elephant passing
through the eye of a needle.

399
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,540
It's too darn narrow.

400
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,450
The tomb owner...

401
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,200
must be very narrow-minded.

402
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,330
His mind is...

403
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,580
probably smaller
than the eye of a needle.

404
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,370
Not really.

405
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,330
He must have...

406
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,540
his reasons for building it this way.

407
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,620
This is a shipwreck tomb after all.

408
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,750
It has limited space.

409
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,200
He saved space here...

410
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,580
to build the Sky Palace.

411
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,080
Besides,

412
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,580
tomb raiders...

413
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,370
are usually short...

414
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,160
or skinny.

415
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,500
No one expected a fatso.

416
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,410
Yeah, sure.

417
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,040
Speaking of figures,

418
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,370
in the history of
tomb raider families,

419
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,870
I'm definitely the number one fatso.

420
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,000
But that was before.

421
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,870
I've lost weight.

422
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,750
Seriously.

423
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,870
No way, This...

424
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,870
-Don't laugh!
-Fatty Wang.

425
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,910
I was walking just fine before.

426
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,990
How did I get stuck?

427
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,660
No! Something's wrong with this wall!

428
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:19,750
That can't be!

429
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,830
The passage is getting narrower!

430
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,790
Let's go back first.

431
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,250
Let's go!

432
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,120
It won't do.

433
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,250
You have to think of a way.

434
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,450
Or all of us are going...

435
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,450
to die here.

436
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,290
Let's run back.

437
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,500
Maybe there's still a glimpse of hope!

438
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,330
It's too late.

439
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,120
Start climbing!

440
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,540
Come on.

441
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,290
Hurry, Fatty Wang!

442
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,830
Wait for me!

443
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:50,790
Here!

444
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:55,990
Up!

445
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,700
So close.

446
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,540
I tell you,

447
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,540
I'd rather be killed by arrows...

448
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,990
than become a meat sandwich.

449
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,500
Thank god for your thick fats.

450
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,250
It made you bouncy.

451
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,500
You can rest for now.

452
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,790
Luckily, you didn't hurt your bones.

453
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,750
I'm dying. I need a break.

454
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,500
-Let's go.
-No, I need a break.

455
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,160
Look.

456
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,080
What?

457
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,040
Wu San Xing...

458
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,040
pushed me to the wall...

459
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,000
and I died unjustly.

460
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,120
God is my witness.

461
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,660
Who is Xie Lian Huan?

462
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,950
Why did Uncle San Xing hurt him?

463
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,910
Xie Lian Huan was also
 in the archaeological team.

464
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,080
He's the one who died on the reef.

465
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,410
Isn't there something wrong here?

466
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,290
What are you talking about?

467
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,870
Here. Look.

468
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,700
You didn't get it done right.

469
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,660
Let me see.

470
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,370
Give it to me!

471
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:10,990
What is it?

472
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,290
What's wrong?

473
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,290
I told him this wasn't done right.

474
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:13,990
But he keeps denying.

475
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,580
I've checked. He's just nitpicking.

476
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,080
This your chance...

477
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,540
to impress Wen Jin.

478
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,750
If you don't want it,

479
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,200
plenty of people are waiting in line.

480
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,370
I'd like to see...

481
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,700
who's more capable...

482
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,500
than me.

483
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,450
Go on, keep bragging.

484
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,990
We're both from the
Mystic Nine families.

485
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,540
even I...

486
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,290
Alright.

487
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,160
Keep your voices down.

488
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,500
Should I give you some loudspeakers...

489
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,410
to yell at each other?

490
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,830
Come and look at this pump.

491
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,540
-It seems to have a problem.
-Coming.

492
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,540
You're wrong.

493
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,410
Well...

494
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,950
I'm worried that he's put it wrong.

495
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,160
Impossible.

496
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,700
What if it doesn't work
when you install it?

497
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,990
-It'll definitely work.
-Enough.

498
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,700
Wen Jin.

499
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,830
Leave it to me.

500
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,000
Hurry up, everyone!

501
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,660
Alright.

502
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,330
You even have the big guns.

503
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,080
You've got everything you need.

504
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,830
So professional.

505
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,540
What brings you here?

506
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,410
I came to see you.

507
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,450
San Xing.

508
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,410
I've been going on
about it for so long.

509
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,410
Can you take me to the sea?

510
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,950
What are you saying?

511
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,660
What do you want to see?

512
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,500
If you want to travel,
go somewhere else.

513
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
It's no fun following
an archaeological team.

514
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,370
San Xing.

515
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,540
Help me talk to Wen Jin.

516
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't need the pay.

517
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,870
I can work as your assistant too.

518
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,370
I'm much better than...

519
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,990
those college kids who work for her.

520
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,250
Tell me.

521
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,950
What is your real intention?

522
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,330
I...

523
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,990
I was commissioned by a person.

524
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,750
Who?

525
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,950
What do you want?

526
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,330
A foreigner.

527
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,790
The one who went...

528
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,330
to Baoziling with you?

529
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,580
San Xing,

530
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,040
how did you know?

531
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,330
You don't have to worry about that.

532
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,500
Tell me.

533
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,540
How did you know...

534
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,910
about the blood zombie tomb?

535
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,750
Qiu De Kao took me there.

536
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,830
Qiu De Kao?

537
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,790
The foreigner I just said.

538
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,410
He's been living in Changsha...

539
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,700
for a long time.

540
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,620
I know him.

541
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,870
I also didn't know...

542
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,540
how he found out...

543
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,580
about the blood zombie tomb.

544
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,870
But he wasn't familiar
with the situation there.

545
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,830
So he asked me to be his guide.

546
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,990
San Xing, you have no idea!

547
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,410
It was so dangerous!

548
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,080
I almost got myself killed!

549
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,120
You deserved it.

550
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,830
Qiu De Kao is a son of a gun.

551
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,080
Yet you worked for him.

552
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,160
Aren't you afraid that
he'll send another telegram...

553
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,750
and get you executed?

554
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,580
It's fine, San Xing!

555
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,660
It's a commercial society now,

556
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,500
a time when we rely on our brains.

557
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,750
Qiu De Kao asked me...

558
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,660
to do something for him
in the Paracel Islands.

559
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,120
But It's a sensitive region.

560
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,750
Normal boats can't enter without...

561
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,870
the permission of the
Maritime Safety Administration.

562
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,910
It's more convenient
to tag along with...

563
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,160
the archaeological team.

564
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
San Xing, don't worry.

565
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,160
I promise...

566
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,080
it won't create...

567
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,370
any trouble for Wen Jin.

568
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,250
If it's too inconvenient,
then just forget it.

569
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,750
I'll think of another way.

570
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,330
It's not too inconvenient.

571
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,040
But I can't make the call on this.

572
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,120
I need to talk to Wen Jin.

573
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,500
Of course, we need her say.

574
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,370
She is the leader, right?

575
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:54,990
Come.

576
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,700
Brother, let me give you a toast.

577
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,910
Impudent child!

578
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,000
You...

579
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,950
How could you let Xie Lian Huan down?

580
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,750
How could you let Xie family down?

581
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,640
"Emergency,
detailed records to be furnished."

582
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,250
How could you let Xie Lian Huan down?

583
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,160
How could you let Xie family down?

584
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,000
Because of what happened just now,

585
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,990
I've decided to lose some weight...

586
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,410
when I go back.

587
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,330
I'll work my butt off...

588
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,540
until I achieve my goal.

589
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:44,540
I can't.

590
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,990
Let's take a break.

591
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,950
I can't do this.

592
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:48,990
Take a break.

593
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,000
Looks like...

594
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,990
Xie Lian Huan is an expert.

595
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,410
The tunnel...

596
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,580
goes upward in a zigzag direction.

597
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,950
By digging it this way,

598
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,410
even if there's a small landslide,

599
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,160
it won't be life threatening.

600
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,040
He still could remain calm...

601
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,160
in such an urgent situation.

602
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,370
Impressive.

603
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,410
His surname is Xie.

604
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,330
A successor of the Mystic Nine?

605
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,330
Dummy Zhang,

606
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,580
the archaeological team included...

607
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,500
successors from the
Mystic Nine and you,

608
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,620
yet something bad still happened.

609
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,580
I don't remember it.

610
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,160
Then do you
remember the way down?

611
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,950
Since you've been here before.

612
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,790
Tell me.

613
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,700
You were fine passing
the passage in the past.

614
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,370
How come we almost got crushed...

615
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,790
into a meat pie just then?

616
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,040
Did you take us to the wrong way?

617
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Unless the mark...

618
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,620
on the monument was altered...

619
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,450
by another person.

620
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,750
It's possible that...

621
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,540
the gate we passed through
wasn't the gate of life...

622
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,200
but the gate of death.

623
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,950
Who could possibly do this?

624
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,410
Ning.

625
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,330
Let me tell you, this girl is...

626
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,450
Ning is... I...!

627
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,540
Perhaps Ning...

628
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,660
wanted us dead.

629
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,450
But she doesn't have the skills to...

630
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,950
modify this centuries-old mechanism.

631
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,160
Then it must be your uncle.

632
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,750
Don't think too much.

633
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,370
He's unlikely to want to...

634
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,620
hurt a good nephew like you.

635
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,290
He wanted to kill Xie Lian Huan.

636
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,500
How much hatred...

637
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,790
did your uncle have for him?

638
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,700
That's impossible.

639
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,540
Xie Lian Huan is our relative.

640
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,120
He's about the same age as my uncle.

641
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,660
I met him before when I was little.

642
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,910
I remember him.

643
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,080
It's an internal fight.

644
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,580
Little master.

645
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,160
How much do you remember...

646
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,700
about Xie Lian Huan?

647
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,620
He doesn't remember.

648
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,250
See.

649
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,450
I have a hypothesis.

650
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,250
Suppose Xie Lian Huan
and your uncle...

651
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,330
knew each other...

652
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,950
and they had a good relationship.

653
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,620
When they were in...

654
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,410
the archaeological team,

655
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,830
they hid it from everyone.

656
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,830
But...

657
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,700
when they went in...

658
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,830
for the first time,

659
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,790
Xie Lian Huan discovered
the underwater tomb...

660
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,950
and the entrance to the tomb.

661
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,790
He didn't tell anyone...

662
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,370
except your uncle.

663
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,540
Judging from their backgrounds,

664
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,410
they couldn't give
up this opportunity.

665
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,990
So they waited when...

666
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,500
the team wasn't paying attention.

667
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,620
They found the time...

668
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,290
to secretly dive in
the underwater tomb.

669
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,290
Both of them are experts,

670
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,500
so it was a piece of cake to them.

671
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,410
San Xing!

672
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,620
Wu San Xing! Wu San Xing!

673
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,370
Open the door!

674
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,830
Wu San Xiang, quickly open the door!

675
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,330
What are you doing?

676
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,500
Open the door!

677
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,990
What are you doing? Open the door!

678
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,120
Wu San Xing!

679
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,120
Wu San Xing!

680
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,370
Open up!

681
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,410
Open up!

682
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,370
Greedy men only see...

683
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,370
money in their eyes.

684
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,910
Many tomb raiders kill
their companions...

685
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,040
in the tomb.

686
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,040
It's nothing strange.

687
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,120
We don't know...

688
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,040
what ignited...

689
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,540
the conflict.

690
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,000
But we can be sure that...

691
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,120
when Xie Lian Huan...

692
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,660
had no way out,

693
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,200
he left a blood message...

694
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,410
on the wall of this passage.

695
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,160
But all of a sudden,
he found out that...

696
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,990
this wall was hollow.

697
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,080
So he used the tools he had...

698
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,750
to dig a tunnel here...

699
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,830
and saved his own life.

700
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,000
Yet he still ended
up dying on the reef.

701
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,410
Perhaps...

702
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,910
after he escaped,

703
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,450
Xie Lian Huan was
looking for your uncle.

704
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,500
But your uncle...

705
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,830
killed him.
