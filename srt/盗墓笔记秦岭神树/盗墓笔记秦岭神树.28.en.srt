"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:07,062
"Episode 28"

3
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:09,845
Granduncle Er and the rest
had remarkable lives.

4
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,125
They encountered thrilling adventures.

5
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,085
It's a pity that us descendants
don't know much about it.

6
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,645
We can only connect the dots...

7
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:20,725
through things they left behind.

8
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:25,885
Guess it's better than nothing.

9
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:28,765
When I'm dead,

10
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,045
there would probably be nothing left.

11
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:35,245
No possessions.

12
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,085
No memories.

13
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:44,125
Like smoke dispersing in the wind.

14
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,125
There's been unrest
in the circle lately.

15
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:50,405
Someone's wavering.

16
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:52,405
Is it because of what happened...

17
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,605
with Gua Qian Er and Ma Yu?

18
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:55,925
Yes.

19
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,205
There has been a rumor
circulating around...

20
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:00,805
about the untimely deaths
of the six men.

21
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,445
Another rumor...

22
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:04,125
said their pensions were reduced.

23
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:07,205
Some people are saying
that Gua Qian Er and Ma Yu...

24
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:08,765
lost their judgment.

25
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:10,885
We're no longer in pre-liberation.

26
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:13,205
Making use of connections
doesn't mean party favoritism.

27
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:15,885
It was handled too indifferently.

28
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:18,085
There are also those...

29
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:21,925
who criticized your ruthlessness.

30
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:23,605
You spared no sentiment
for your own people.

31
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:26,165
That you were being unfair.

32
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:36,365
Don't you think...

33
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:37,965
that they are like rats
in a dark sewer?

34
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:41,965
They have no capabilities...

35
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:43,085
and yet they drag others down.

36
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:45,245
As if their made-up rumors...

37
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,445
could win them some benefits.

38
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:49,925
Since their hearts are wavering,

39
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,605
why not...

40
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,285
I let them...

41
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,205
falter even harder.

42
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:04,405
Sorry, ladies.

43
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,485
My friend's here.

44
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,645
Why don't we chat next time?

45
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:07,605
-Okay.
-Okay.

46
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:09,365
-Keep in touch. Bye.
-Sure.

47
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,525
-Bye.
-Bye.

48
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,125
Why are you back?

49
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:24,765
Some things...

50
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,645
are better left in the dark.

51
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:28,565
Makes life more fun.

52
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:30,325
Why didn't you find me...

53
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:32,045
once you wee back?

54
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:33,605
Think of it...

55
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,645
as a surprise from me.

56
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:37,965
You've been back a while, right?

57
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:40,325
Yes.

58
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,125
You contacted others...

59
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,565
but not me.

60
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:46,845
I was going to find you
in a few days.

61
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:48,005
Didn't expect...

62
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:50,445
you to be so impulsive now.

63
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:53,965
I heard you were almost...

64
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:56,965
arrested by the FBI in the States.

65
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:58,005
I just snuck a peek...

66
00:04:58,085 --> 00:04:59,285
at some politician's
personal mailbox...

67
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,365
and browsed their internal web.

68
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:01,845
Luckily, I was quick on my feet.

69
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:03,605
They couldn't trace me.

70
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,605
I really don't understand...

71
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:08,045
the fun of being a hacker.

72
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:08,725
You don't?

73
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:10,325
Let me enlighten you.

74
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:13,205
Say,

75
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,045
you wish to peek into someone's life.

76
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:23,205
Or perhaps you wish
to know who your men...

77
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,085
are talking to.

78
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,325
Forget about it.

79
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:28,845
Don't be so stubborn, bro.

80
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,285
It doesn't matter who
we're working for...

81
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,685
in this current society.

82
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:32,845
With Master Hua,

83
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,005
I get to make money
and keep my life too.

84
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,885
Even if I die,
someone would avenge me.

85
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:39,485
With you people,

86
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:41,725
I'd probably die
before I get the money.

87
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:43,565
I might even die
by our own people's hand.

88
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:44,925
You better be sure.

89
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:46,805
Jie Yu Hua's not going to last long!

90
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:48,245
Shut up!

91
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,645
Or maybe you'd like
to give your men...

92
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:53,405
a little surprise?

93
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:12,765
A lot of things...

94
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:14,525
can be accomplished...

95
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:15,925
with Internet connection.

96
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:19,285
This is what I consider fun.

97
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,365
What else do you know about me?

98
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:26,205
Anything to eat at home?

99
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:28,085
Nothing.

100
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:29,725
There's only the
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

101
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:34,805
Let's have Zihai Hotpot then.

102
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:38,845
You go ahead.

103
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:40,525
I'm not hungry.

104
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:43,485
Gosh, you.

105
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,885
Why are you picking fights
with your stomach?

106
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:49,645
We're home.
We should eat, drink, be merry.

107
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,805
Fine. I'll eat.

108
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:57,765
Let's have the crazy, spicy pot.

109
00:06:58,565 --> 00:06:59,525
Sure. Watch the road.

110
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:00,925
Watch the road!

111
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,045
Looks like...

112
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:34,485
you're not happy with this present.

113
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,205
I'm telling you this is murder.

114
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:45,205
How could they say it was an accident?

115
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:47,205
Lower your voice. My head hurts.

116
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,325
Who cares about your head hurting?

117
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:49,965
Listen to me.

118
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,205
They were after our lives.

119
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:54,005
No.

120
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,445
What do you mean no?

121
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:56,445
Look at us!

122
00:07:59,405 --> 00:07:59,965
Come here.

123
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,445
What?

124
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:03,645
What I mean is...

125
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:06,565
they seemed to be
looking for something.

126
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:08,165
Before I passed out,

127
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,765
I saw them grabbing our bags
from the car.

128
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:13,685
And, we've been body-searched.

129
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,485
They took the silk book?

130
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:18,845
And the sword too.

131
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:21,445
They were after the tomb.

132
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:23,525
But only the three of us know.

133
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:24,965
Nobody else does.

134
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:29,885
Yes, understood.

135
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,885
-Aunt!
-Si Ye.

136
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:33,565
-Something's happened.
-You can't go in.

137
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:36,405
-Si Ye.
-You need take charge for me, Aunt!

138
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:38,165
-Go away!
-The madam is resting.

139
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,245
-That's right.
-Aunt!

140
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,765
-Aunt!
-What are you doing, Si Ye?

141
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:42,805
Go away! Get lost!

142
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,005
Let me in!

143
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:47,725
I want to see Aunt.

144
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:48,405
Where is she?

145
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:49,645
Granny is resting.

146
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,085
What's the matter, Uncle Si?

147
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:52,805
What does it look like to you?

148
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:55,165
You got beat up?

149
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:57,085
Aunt said she's taken care of it.

150
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:59,365
Is this what she meant?

151
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,485
A bunch of people
showed up at my office...

152
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:03,805
and started beating up everyone.

153
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:07,565
Where is the law?

154
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:10,925
Xiu Er.

155
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:14,725
Did you have something to do with it?

156
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,085
Why would you even think that?

157
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:19,325
Xiu Er, I've never done you wrong.

158
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:20,645
When you were a kid,

159
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:21,725
I always took you out to play...

160
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,005
and bought you goodies.

161
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:23,965
How could you...

162
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,405
What are you talking about, Uncle?

163
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:27,725
I wish for nothing more...

164
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:28,685
than your safety.

165
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:29,965
My safety?

166
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,525
Is this what you call being safe?

167
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,325
You've grown up,
priorities have changed.

168
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:37,685
Over the years,

169
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,605
Aunt has been very clear...

170
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,325
in wanting you to take over
the Huo family.

171
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:42,805
Did you ever wonder...

172
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:44,485
if a little, inexperienced girl
like you...

173
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:45,485
could hold up...

174
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,685
the enormous Huo family?

175
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:47,925
You'd break your back.

176
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:50,005
You've been living a fun-filled life.

177
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,165
On whose money?

178
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:53,165
It was from every one of your uncles,

179
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:54,885
earning them through our blood,

180
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,685
sweat and tears.

181
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:57,965
Who gave you the right to the helm...

182
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,485
just because of what Aunt said?

183
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,125
Are you saying I've only received...

184
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:02,365
and never contributed?

185
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,805
Perhaps my eye sight is bad,

186
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:05,365
but I sure couldn't tell.

187
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,645
Xiu Er, I urge you to know
where you stand.

188
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:08,925
The present society...

189
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,765
is ruled by the capable.

190
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,805
The way Aunt operates no longer works!

191
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,205
So what do you suggest?

192
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,445
Aunt, I'm...

193
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,285
This Huo family...

194
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:37,405
is forever plagued by misfortune.

195
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:40,565
This is a matter
from two generations ago.

196
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:42,725
It should no longer be of importance.

197
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,365
But the sword of the Huo family...

198
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,765
is always sharpened by the women.

199
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,125
Because women...

200
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,565
are always smarter.

201
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,045
Smarter than the men.

202
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:53,525
It's genetics.

203
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,525
I don't blame you.

204
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:58,885
All this time, your uncles,

205
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:02,445
aunts, brothers and nephews...

206
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,445
have all gotten along nicely,

207
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:06,925
and lived peacefully.

208
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:08,445
So,

209
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:12,085
why did you suddenly appear?

210
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:15,525
You're the bringer of misfortune.

211
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:18,005
One moment you like someone,

212
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,325
the next you don't like someone.

213
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:22,085
Trouble follows you everywhere.

214
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,565
Whose feathers did you ruffle?

215
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:25,365
Now you've caused trouble...

216
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:27,165
outside of the family.

217
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:29,885
That's because you weren't being fair.

218
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:31,725
I wasn't fair?

219
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,085
Let me tell you something then.

220
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:35,125
You have no idea.

221
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:37,805
Everything you get to enjoy today...

222
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,685
was exchanged through the lives...

223
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,685
of the Huo women.

224
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:45,005
Do you know that?

225
00:11:45,925 --> 00:11:47,525
And yet you complain.

226
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,605
Haven't you been fed...

227
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:51,725
with only the best?

228
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:54,085
You have no gratitude.

229
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:55,445
I'm warning you.

230
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,565
I can forget about
what happened today...

231
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,205
but it doesn't mean
I'm cleaning up after your mess.

232
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:03,805
You need to pay the consequences...

233
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:07,165
for what you've done wrong,
understand?

234
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:10,885
Aunt!

235
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,285
You brought me up yourself.

236
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:17,045
You can't throw me to the wolves!

237
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,725
You.

238
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:27,885
You don't know how to be grateful.

239
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:30,165
You've abandoned
your loyalty and morals.

240
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:35,925
Tell me, what good are you to me?

241
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:40,805
No good. No good at all.

242
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:42,885
I wouldn't try,

243
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:45,005
for my own sake.

244
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:47,645
You created this mess.

245
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,725
You handle it yourself.

246
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,605
Whatever punishment you have coming,

247
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,325
you need to accept it.

248
00:12:58,485 --> 00:12:59,485
Get out!

249
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,565
Get out of my sight.

250
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:07,885
Okay, fine!

251
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:09,845
If you're resolved...

252
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,565
to cast me aside,

253
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,445
I'll just have to expose you!

254
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:15,925
You think I don't know what...

255
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,005
the Mystic Nine is all about?

256
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:20,965
The Huo family is far from pure.

257
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:24,125
Look at that temper.

258
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,525
You could say that the Huo family...

259
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:32,445
is like having a jade...

260
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:34,885
pop out from a crack in the rocks.

261
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,045
The liverwort...

262
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:39,645
has taken root in the flesh.

263
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,805
If you don't remove it,

264
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:44,125
it would become a useless rock.

265
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,445
If you be more ruthless...

266
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,325
and cut it off,

267
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:49,045
it might...

268
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:52,405
have a chance at becoming
an icy jadeite.

269
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:57,725
Granny, the Huo family
is an Emperor Jadeite.

270
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:00,365
You're right, yes.

271
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:02,645
Emperor Jadeite, we are.

272
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:12,605
Wake up, Yao.

273
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,005
You set the alarm yesterday...

274
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:16,405
to wake you up at 8 a.m.

275
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,965
Wake up, Yao.

276
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,445
You set the alarm yesterday...

277
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:22,845
to wake you up at 8 a.m.

278
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,405
Yao, wake up right now!

279
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,645
You have a lot to do today!

280
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:39,605
You'll be in a lot of trouble
if you don't get up now!

281
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:44,445
Yao, wake up right now!

282
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,365
You have a lot to do today!

283
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:51,085
You'll be in a lot of trouble
if you don't get up now!

284
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:02,005
Why is the me yesterday...

285
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,165
so mean to the me today?

286
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,285
A well-established critic...

287
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,565
trying to learn opera?

288
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:23,565
Why?

289
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:25,645
Trying to be a double threat?

290
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:27,085
Best not overwork yourself.

291
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,325
What on earth is Jiu Ye thinking?

292
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:31,485
No matter what,

293
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,805
Jie Yu Hua is Jiu Ye's
biological grandson.

294
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,005
What era are we living in?

295
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:38,365
Who still cares about that?

296
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,245
Besides,

297
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:40,845
he's not the only one...

298
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:42,405
connected by blood.

299
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,005
Don't forget.

300
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:47,685
There's still that Zhai Xing Yao.

301
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:48,925
Wasn't Zhai Xing Yao...

302
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,845
adopted by Jie Yu Hua's parents?

303
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:53,445
Supposedly so,

304
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:56,045
but he's actually
the illegitimate son.

305
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,165
Really?

306
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:58,285
You see,

307
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:00,925
the biological son
was adopted by Jiu Ye.

308
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:02,965
Meaning the spot is there...

309
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,845
for the illegitimate son.

310
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,085
Yao and Yu Chen have never got along.

311
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,645
He recently left the country in a fit.

312
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,205
His friends and roots are here though.

313
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:17,445
In my opinion,

314
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:18,845
anybody but Jie Yu Hua...

315
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,445
is okay to take over.

316
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,525
The Xie family would have to
change their name to Zhai now.

317
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,565
Be it Xie or Zhai,

318
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:29,885
it is still a family
of Xie's descendants.

319
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:42,245
Master Hua,

320
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:43,845
several of the Xie seniors...

321
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:44,565
met with seniors of the circle...

322
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:45,645
concerning the official proceedings.

323
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,965
The last time they had a meeting...

324
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:49,485
was when you first became the head.

325
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:50,525
Now another one?

326
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:51,765
They're clearly breaking ranks here.

327
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,405
We can't let them.

328
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,485
Back then, Xie Jiu Ye
wanted to be democratic,

329
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:56,885
giving everyone
a chance to participate.

330
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:58,285
That's how the Xie family survived.

331
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,245
I don't see anyone else
having this rule.

332
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:01,485
And they're still doing well.

333
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,325
Yet, the Xie family rules...

334
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:06,365
has harbored greed among some.

335
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:15,005
What's the agenda of the meeting?

336
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:16,965
To change the head.

337
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,445
They want Zhai Xing Yao
to be the head.

338
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:21,325
That punk was adopted by the Xies.

339
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:22,365
He's far from qualified.

340
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:23,925
He's getting ahead of himself.

341
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:27,725
I heard he's been contacting those
who didn't like the way you operate.

342
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:29,205
I bet...

343
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,445
he's the one pulling the strings.

344
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:33,885
Yao.

345
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,365
We used to be so close.

346
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,325
Master Hua, your problem
is that you're too sentimental.

347
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:42,605
Too sentimental with the Huos,

348
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:43,685
and to Wu Xie.

349
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,405
Don't tell me you're the same
with Zhai Xing Yao.

350
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,405
You need to see if it's worth it.

351
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:48,765
Inform everyone.

352
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:50,805
I agree to the meeting.

353
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:53,605
Tomorrow night at nine.

354
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,325
At the Xie family home.

355
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:57,605
Wait, why do you accommodate them?

356
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:58,685
I'd just show them the door.

357
00:17:58,765 --> 00:17:59,965
Since this is the Xie family rule,

358
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:02,125
as the head,

359
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:03,445
I cannot allow...

360
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:06,085
anyone to operate
outside of the system.

361
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:09,965
I suppose.

362
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,125
You have a point.

363
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,325
Actually, there's nothing to worry.

364
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:19,045
There are more who supports you
within the Xie family.

365
00:18:55,165 --> 00:19:01,605
♪ Passing the peonies. ♪

366
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:03,325
Nice!

367
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:14,925
♪ In front of the fence. ♪

368
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:17,085
Lively and full of expression.

369
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:18,845
Look at him go.

370
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:19,885
He's got the chops.

371
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:21,805
I'm sure he'd be
a generational superstar.

372
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:23,725
Aiding you...

373
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:25,725
in collecting masterpieces
all across the land.

374
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,525
Looks pretty young.

375
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:34,365
♪ Unclasp your collar. ♪

376
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:35,405
Do you hear that voice?

377
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:38,285
So full and bright.

378
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:53,125
♪ Loosen the clothes. ♪

379
00:19:53,325 --> 00:20:01,365
Bravo!

380
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:02,645
Let's go talk to him.

381
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,485
Looking for me?

382
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:47,285
The tea's cold. Get a new pot!

383
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,165
What's the time now?

384
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,365
Why isn't Master Hua here?

385
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:55,925
Is he going...

386
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:57,445
to leave us hanging like this?

387
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,365
It's only 7.50 p.m.

388
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,565
Why are you so anxious?

389
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:05,165
He's the VIP.

390
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,805
It's only right
to be the last to arrive.

391
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:08,085
I don't care.

392
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:09,925
Eight o'clock.

393
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:11,805
I'm leaving on the dot
if he doesn't come.

394
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:16,485
You can leave now if you want.

395
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,605
You need to walk the talk.

396
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:21,525
What are you saying?

397
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,845
Why don't you figure it out yourself?

398
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:25,725
Why are we here today?

399
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:27,685
I'm sure everyone knows.

400
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:29,805
But there's always some
who are clueless.

401
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:31,805
Believing that with enough ants,

402
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:33,685
they could take down the elephant.

403
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:35,685
Who gave you the right to speak?

404
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,205
How many years has it been
since you joined the Xies?

405
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:40,765
If it's experience,

406
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,045
I can't compare with you for sure.

407
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:43,285
But if it's abilities,

408
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,285
someone like you...

409
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:46,205
that only waits for the bonus
without lifting a finger...

410
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:47,805
has no right to criticize me.

411
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:48,765
Watch your mouth.

412
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:49,685
You little punk, you.

413
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,205
You're stepping out of line!

414
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:52,765
Come, sit.

415
00:21:53,165 --> 00:21:54,405
Don't let him get on your nerves.

416
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,165
Come on.

417
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,845
What's the occasion today?
Everyone's here.

418
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:08,965
Sorry, Master Zhai.

419
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,525
Your spot is not here.

420
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:12,885
Please.

421
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:14,765
Everyone.

422
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:15,925
Which one of you today...

423
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:17,485
is going to give up your seat...

424
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,165
to Young Master Zhai.

425
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:25,165
Young Master Zhai,
why don't you sit here?

426
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,765
Today, I'll be sitting here.

427
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:06,005
Are we going ahead with the meeting?

428
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:08,845
Otherwise, I'm going to go.

429
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:11,005
Xie Yu Chen...

430
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:12,845
won't be coming today.

431
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:15,445
But it's okay that he's not here.

432
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,165
The official affair still proceeds.

433
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,365
Just because you said so?

434
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:20,725
Where do you stand?

435
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:21,965
Me?

436
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:23,885
I'm a year younger than Xie Yu Chen.

437
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,845
I guess I'm considered
his younger brother.

438
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,565
Since my older brother's not here,

439
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:29,925
it is only right for me...

440
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:31,285
to conduct the official affairs.

441
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:33,725
Any objections?

442
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:39,085
I object!

443
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:40,845
The head is not here.

444
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:43,325
No one has the right
to replace him...

445
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:45,605
and chair the meeting.

446
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:47,645
Isn't the agenda today...

447
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,405
to find a replacement for the head?

448
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:53,685
I believe everyone here...

449
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,165
is qualified for the position.

450
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:58,045
Remember what Xie Jiu Ye said before?

451
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:00,165
We need to be democratic.

452
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:01,885
Let's not waste any time...

453
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:02,845
and practice democracy.

454
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:04,525
Let's...

455
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,245
raise your hands to vote.

456
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:08,805
Come on.

457
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:12,005
Raise your hand if you wish
to replace the head.

458
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:22,965
You guys better be sure.

459
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,045
Even the American president
changes every 4 years.

460
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:34,325
So why...

461
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:37,045
can't the Xies change their head?

462
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,805
We need to be in tune with the times.

463
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,485
The only constant in life...

464
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,085
is change.

465
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:51,205
It's about time the Xie family
got some new blood.

466
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:54,645
All right, that's decided then.

467
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,925
Let's discuss the second agenda.

468
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:00,885
Who will be the new head of house?

469
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:04,685
My candidate is...

470
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:06,925
Zhai Xing Yao.

471
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:09,645
Those who agree,

472
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:11,205
raise your hand.

473
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:24,085
Those who agree, raise your hand.

474
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:37,365
♪ A pair of birds
sits on the tree... ♪

475
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:51,808
"Zhai Xing Yao"

476
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:54,165
A friend's betrayal is the worst.

477
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:57,045
Imagine if I sent
the photos to Yuan...

478
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:15,228
"Zhai Xing Yao"

479
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:18,593
"Zhai Xing Yao"

480
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,045
These are records of everything...

481
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,725
you took from the Xie family.

482
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:25,085
It includes all the secret deals...

483
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,285
you conducted using Xie assets.

484
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:30,245
Did I miss out anything?

485
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:42,565
-Big!
-Small!

486
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:44,085
Make it a big!

487
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:47,885
-Give me a big!
-Small!

488
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:52,725
-Big!
-Small.

489
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:56,285
Do you even know what you're doing?

490
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:57,445
Look at this hand!

491
00:26:57,565 --> 00:26:59,125
Stop whining just because
you're unlucky.

492
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:00,005
Mind your own business!

493
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,085
You're disrupting my game!

494
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:02,485
-Don't argue.
-Shut up.

495
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:03,725
Again, let's go!

496
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:05,365
-Again...
-Make your bets.

497
00:27:05,485 --> 00:27:06,765
-I'm betting on small.
-Get on with it.

498
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:10,165
-Come on.
-I know it's coming.

499
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:14,205
Bet on small! Trust me!

500
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:15,725
Sign your name...

501
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:16,885
and all this money is yours.

502
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:25,525
I've borrowed from you
countless times.

503
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,285
Why did the interest go up?

504
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:30,725
Uncle Liu, times are challenging.

505
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:32,205
We need to eat too.

506
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:35,045
Still, 28 is too high.

507
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,045
I actually have a suggestion.

508
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:40,885
No need for you to pay any interest.

509
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:52,845
You are Master Hua's uncle.

510
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:55,685
That makes me Yao's uncle too.

511
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:01,445
I'll try to be objective.

512
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:03,805
For many years,

513
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,085
Yu Chen has worked hard...

514
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:08,085
to preserve Xie family's reputation.

515
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:10,165
His contribution...

516
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:11,965
is clear for all to see.

517
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,645
But it was really tough on him.

518
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:17,765
As his paternal uncle,

519
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:19,685
it pains me to see him like that.

520
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,485
Who can help lighten his burden?

521
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,005
It's Yao, of course.

522
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:26,565
Yao is capable.

523
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,925
Also, a descendant of the Xies.

524
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:31,085
He should do his part for the family.

525
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:32,845
Don't you all agree?

526
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,165
-Yes.
-That's right.

527
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:36,925
The head is not here...

528
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:39,125
and you guys run amok.

529
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:40,525
When Master Hua comes back...

530
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:42,045
I already told you.

531
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:43,725
He's not coming back.

532
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:45,525
What do you mean?

533
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:51,165
You dare endanger Master Hua?

534
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:52,405
Don't assume.

535
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:55,525
He's my brother.

536
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,045
You lot need to grow some balls.

537
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:01,925
Those in favor of me being head,
raise your hand.

538
00:29:02,245 --> 00:29:04,165
You, you and you.

539
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:07,925
No one objects, right?

540
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:09,485
I object.

541
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,485
The Xie family does need
a new head of house.

542
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:19,165
But it shouldn't be a bastard child...

543
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:20,885
who would risk his brother...

544
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:23,845
in order to climb the ranks.

545
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:25,245
Fifth brother,

546
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:27,245
don't assume there's rain
when you hear the wind.

547
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:29,645
Yao and Yu Chen are brothers.

548
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:30,685
What brothers?

549
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:32,005
That's nonsense!

550
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:33,925
Yao's parents...

551
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:35,765
were friends with Yu Chen's mother.

552
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:39,925
They died in a car accident.

553
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:41,685
Yu Chen's mother took pity on him...

554
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:43,205
and adopted him.

555
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,205
You can get a DNA test
if you don't believe me.

556
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,885
Yu Chen's parents
brought him up with care...

557
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:54,325
and the Xies treated him
like their own.

558
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:55,565
And what does he do?

559
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:57,805
In order to become the boss,

560
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:00,285
he's thrown Yu Chen under the bus.

561
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:01,605
Such a character...

562
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:04,005
is not fit to be Xies' leader!

563
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:05,805
Yes, Fifth Brother is right!

564
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:09,565
I think Fifth Brother...

565
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:11,525
is the most fitting candidate.

566
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:15,525
If it's Fifth Brother taking over,

567
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:17,925
I support it whole-heartedly.

568
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:21,805
Fifth Brother, you claimed
that Yao hurt Yu Chen,

569
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:23,245
but what proof do you have?

570
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,005
He admitted it himself.

571
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,685
I was only kidding.

572
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:28,765
Why?

573
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,405
Do you also think
he won't come back?

574
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:33,525
I've been told...

575
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,285
that Yu Chen had been
attacked in the village.

576
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:37,925
You can't simply make up stories.

577
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:41,005
Perhaps he got stuck
in a traffic jam on the way.

578
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:42,885
Someone shot him!

579
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,125
This isn't the USA.

580
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:45,925
People don't go around swinging a gun.

581
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:47,605
That's enough.

582
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:49,325
Allow me to butt in.

583
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:52,445
We all know Fifth Brother...

584
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:54,165
and what he's done...

585
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:55,845
over the years.

586
00:30:56,325 --> 00:30:57,205
This whole time,

587
00:30:57,365 --> 00:30:58,405
he's been handling...

588
00:30:58,485 --> 00:31:01,205
all the affairs on behalf of Yu Chen.

589
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,325
And, there is not even...

590
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:06,245
a single problem in the books.

591
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:07,725
That's why...

592
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:10,605
I think the new head of house...

593
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:13,285
should be Fifth Brother.

594
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:14,365
Don't you all think so?

595
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:15,605
Right?

596
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:17,765
-I agree...
-Me too.

597
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:19,125
I agree...

598
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,725
Fifth Brother was born to be
a prime minister.

599
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:24,485
So he should continue
being the prime minister.

600
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:27,365
But Yao has what it takes
to be the helm.

601
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,245
Sixth Brother.

602
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:30,285
I heard...

603
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:32,245
you've accumulated
almost 7 million in debt...

604
00:31:32,245 --> 00:31:33,885
at Li Wei's casino.

605
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:37,685
You recently cleared the debt.

606
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,365
Where did you get the money from?

607
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,685
You accepted Yao's money...

608
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:45,925
and so you're defending him.

609
00:31:46,565 --> 00:31:49,565
You sure are a very worthy uncle.

610
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,525
If that's the case,

611
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:56,125
those who support Fifth Uncle,

612
00:31:57,405 --> 00:31:58,445
show your hand.

613
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,645
One, two, three, four, five.

614
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:09,165
Please keep your hands raised.

615
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:15,205
There are some people...

616
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:17,165
who have yet to raise their hands.

617
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:19,125
They don't support me...

618
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:20,805
nor Fifth Uncle.

619
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:23,045
Does that mean you guys...

620
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:25,045
continue to support Xie Yu Chen?

621
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:27,845
I won't bow down to anyone
but Master Hua!

622
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:28,645
That's right!

623
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:29,965
Good.

624
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,125
Are you sure?

625
00:32:34,765 --> 00:32:35,765
A dead man...

626
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:38,005
can't protect you.

627
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:40,925
Master Hua is here.

628
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:01,805
Fifth Uncle.

629
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:04,405
Would you like an anti-anxiety pill?

630
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:09,045
You don't look so good.

631
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,725
Three things.

632
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:29,525
One,

633
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:33,485
the head of the Xie family is me.

634
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:35,525
Two,

635
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:38,085
assassinating the head of house...

636
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,405
means betraying the Xie family.

637
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:44,045
An unforgivable act.

638
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,005
You've got the wrong person!

639
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:50,725
It was Zhai Xing Yao's idea.

640
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:03,365
You don't have long to live.

641
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:05,085
Stop dragging your family down.

642
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:06,845
Make some money while you can...

643
00:34:06,965 --> 00:34:08,565
so your wife and kids
can live a good life.

644
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:10,405
So long as you kill Xie Yu Chen,

645
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:12,765
you get to keep the 10 million...

646
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:15,045
no matter you survive or not.

647
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,805
Looking for me?

648
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:23,045
Master Hua!

649
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:29,365
How is my disguise, brother?

650
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:34,085
Fifth Uncle.

651
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:36,405
Is my brother's life
worth only 10 million?

652
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:39,405
How stingy of you.

653
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:44,925
You guys better not think
you're blameless.

654
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:48,525
Zhai Xing Yao and Xie Yu Chen
put on this show...

655
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:50,525
for only one purpose.

656
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:52,445
It's to find out...

657
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:56,005
those that do not support Yu Chen.

658
00:34:56,965 --> 00:34:59,605
None of you are getting away!

659
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,605
Hand over the culprit
and recording to the police.

660
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,405
Three.

661
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,085
Those that doctored the books,

662
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:12,525
fix it within a week.

663
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:15,525
And I'll bury the hatchet.

664
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,285
After one week,

665
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:21,245
hand it over to the police.

666
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:24,205
Understood.

667
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:34,205
Yu Hua, you were too easy on them.

668
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,085
Fish can't survive
when the water's too clean.

669
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,405
Besides, the Xie family...

670
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:39,845
has never been a place for saints.

671
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,285
That's true.

672
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,365
Saints wouldn't be in
this business to begin with.

673
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,085
You're not actually a Xie.

674
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,125
We share the same account.

675
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:49,725
How am I not a member of the Xies?

676
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:52,925
You know what I mean.

677
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:53,725
I don't.

Why should I?

684
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:12,405
It's your deal.

685
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:14,005
Why should I settle it for you?

686
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:15,845

Laptop.

693
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:17,845
Some old playthings.

694
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:20,085
And also an archeology journal
I kept as a kid.

695
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:21,965
Nothing of value is gone?

696
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:24,005
That's it then.

697
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:26,205
It must be the same guys who hit us.

698
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:32,045
Think.

699
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:33,925
What else could they be after?

700
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,485
Could they be after...

701
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:39,565
my grandfather's notebook?

702
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:40,965
Your grandfather's notebook
is missing?

703
00:37:42,165 --> 00:37:42,805
Before leaving,

704
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:44,325
I kept the Snake Eye Copper Fish
and the notebook...

705
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:46,045
in the safe at my parent's place.

706
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:47,925
Who could it be?

707
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:50,725
Qiu De Kao.

708
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,845
Ning, how's the investigation going?

709
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:04,645
We are still trying...

710
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:05,725
to track down those people.

711
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:08,045
Wu Xie nearly got run over by them.

712
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:09,725
The car and the house...

713
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:11,045
had been searched.

714
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:14,605
They were obviously
looking for something.

715
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:18,805
I did a check on the van.

716
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:21,125
Drunk driving
and running the red light.

717
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:22,925
It did look like an accident.

718
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:24,285
The other two cars...

719
00:38:24,285 --> 00:38:25,805
were suspicious though.

720
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,405
They had fake plates...

721
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,485
with records of hit-and-run.

722
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:33,445
Even the police couldn't identify
who the drivers were.

723
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:36,245
Pause the investigation.

724
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:38,645
Now,

725
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,085
you need watch out.

726
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:44,325
We can't afford to lose Wu Xie yet.

727
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:45,845
Protect him.

728
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,285
Sir, any idea...

729
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:52,965
who they are working for?

730
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:56,085
Not at the moment.

731
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,005
This Mr. Zhang...

732
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:04,245
was a prominent figure in Changsha.

733
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:05,405
He came from a wealthy family.

734
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:06,925
He enjoyed watching plays...

735
00:39:08,165 --> 00:39:09,125
and idolized Granduncle Er.

736
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:11,405
He supposedly invited Granduncle Er
to perform privately.

737
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:13,725
After liberation,
his family factory was handed over...

738
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,285
and he became a worker himself. But,

739
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:17,365
he's hidden away some money.

740
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:19,805
The man has a son.

741
00:39:20,205 --> 00:39:21,405
Spoiled and obnoxious.

742
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:22,725
Addicted to gambling.

743
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,045
He lost everything
and accumulated a huge debt.

744
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:26,205
He forced his old man...

745
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:27,525
to use all his asset...

746
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:28,405
to pay his debt.

747
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:30,205
The old man ended up...

748
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:32,485
with nothing but that headpiece.

749
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,685
The son was going to sell
even the headpiece.

750
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:37,285
But the old man wouldn't let him.

751
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:38,325
He called it his lifeline...

752
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:39,285
and held onto it.

753
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:40,645
The latest update?

754
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:43,125
The old man is dead.

755
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:45,845
The son plans to sell the headpiece...

756
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:47,445
so he can continue to gamble.

757
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:51,565
You sure it's Granduncle Er's?

758
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:53,085
I've had it appraised.

759
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:54,365
It's the real thing.

760
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:57,245
The exact same headpiece...

761
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:58,845
was seen at Granduncle Er's place.

762
00:40:00,085 --> 00:40:01,885
It should be real, yes.

763
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:23,965
Master Wu, everything's packed.

764
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:27,205
It's been so long...

765
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:28,685
that it feels foreign.

766
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:31,285
We've traversed the globe...

767
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:33,565
but nothing beats this place.
It's home.

768
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:38,805
Master Wu.

769
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:41,525
Aren't you going to pay...

770
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,005
Young Master Wu a visit?

771
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,685
Me, visit him?

772
00:40:46,805 --> 00:40:48,885
He's not dead nor incapacitated.
No thanks.

773
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:52,205
What did you find out
about those people?

774
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:55,005
The ones who hit
Young Master Wu's car...

775
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:56,285
are the ones who broke in.

776
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:57,405
Same gang.

777
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:58,525
Not locals.

778
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:00,765
They are paid professionals.

779
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:03,045
They don't know
who the mastermind is either.

780
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:05,725
But after taking
Young Master Wu's things,

781
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:07,565
they did as the client wanted...

782
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:09,685
and left them in a drawer
at the mini market.

783
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:12,165
Surveillance at the area is minimal.

784
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:13,845
They can't find out who did it.

785
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:16,125
Master Wu.

786
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,645
Do you have any suspicions?

787
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:20,165
Tell me, I'll get it done.

788
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,325
No, now's not the time to react.

789
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:25,845
Young Master Wu is an open target,

790
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:27,325
whereas they're hidden.

791
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:29,485
If they try again,

792
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:30,845
I'm afraid Young Master Wu...

793
00:41:30,845 --> 00:41:31,965
might not be so lucky again.

794
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,085
My nephew is not an idiot.

795
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:37,525
He still has his friends.

796
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:40,085
If they go for another bout,

797
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,125
who knows who would come out on top.

798
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:43,445
Master Wu.

799
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,365
Isn't it better...

800
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,205
to nip them in the bud?

801
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:50,245
I'm afraid troubles will follow suit.
