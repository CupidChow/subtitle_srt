"Episode 9"

3
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,040
Even though...

4
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
those nightmares have never...

5
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
stopped haunting him,

6
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
Wu Xie has decided...

7
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,600
that he will no longer be
troubled by those intangible clues.

8
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,960
Since...

9
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
the happy memories that he had...

10
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,640
throughout every
thrilling experience...

11
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,240
were so vivid,

12
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
just as it was happening
right before him.

13
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,600
When I found out...

14
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
that we'd be entering
the mysterious...

15
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,320
underwater tomb of Paracel Islands,

16
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,960
I felt more excitement...

17
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,080
than fear.

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
All this time,

19
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,000
searching for stories that have...

20
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,920
been buried by...

21
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
the dust of history in those tombs...

22
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,960
were my greatest pleasures in life.

23
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,440
However,

24
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,720
things were not...

25
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,480
as simple as I imagined them to be.

26
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,280
What's gotten into you? Let's go!

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,680
All the things that I've
encountered in these tombs...

28
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,200
completely changed
my understanding towards...

29
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,080
the ancient technology
of traps and geomancy.

30
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,480
I realized that there
were actually a lot of...

31
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,760
mysterious incidents in my life...

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,120
that were all related to these tombs.

33
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,040
Even when I was younger...

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,400
It tickles!

35
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,800
Stop!

36
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
No one can predict the future.

37
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,960
Wu Xie believes...

38
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,960
that what he finds
in each adventure...

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,560
is the reason to hold on.

40
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,800
Wu Xie.

41
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
We've some results
on that old photo that...

42
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,240
you asked me to investigate.

43
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,080
You just gave me...

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,080
this one photo.

45
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,440
If you search online,

46
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
there is only one result.

47
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
According to the IP address,

48
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,680
we can be sure that
the person who posted it...

49
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,760
was in Beijing at that time.

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,120
Who are these...

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,160
people in the photo?

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,400
It's an archeology team...

53
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
from a few decades ago.

54
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,880
My uncle was among them.

55
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
"Search Notice"
But it's my first time...

56
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,960
seeing such a detailed name list.

57
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,040
Aside from this name list,

58
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,640
were there other
things you could find?

59
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
I've tried everything that I could.

60
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Take a look.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,440
"Published by: Island 701"

62
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,560
Island 701?

63
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
Can you find his location?

64
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,480
Island 701.

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,720
This name...

66
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,520
may not necessarily
be used by only one user.

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,880
The last time it appeared was...

68
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,760
in the company system of Taraxacum.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,280
I've skimmed through this web page.

70
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,120
I think it's...

71
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,840
an information technology
headhunting company.

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,840
They're based in Hangzhou.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,040
Taraxacum...

74
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
Taraxacum Information
Technology Co., Ltd.

75
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:40,840
Wait,

76
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,800
what are you trying to do?

77
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,320
You're engaging a
high-end IT company...

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,800
to find Island 701?

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,280
The search notice...

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
gave us a clue that
we've been overlooking.

81
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,880
What clue?

82
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
On 20th of July,

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
my uncle and Chen Wen Jin...

84
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,080
discovered the
underwater tomb's entrance.

85
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,840
Ten people were on the list.

86
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,320
After that,
Xie Lian Huan left the team,

87
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,280
and died.

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,960
There should be...

89
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,240
nine more people left on the list.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,040
But the list from 24th of July...

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,200
only had 8 people.

92
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,680
One was missing.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Yes.

94
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
If he did not go to
the underwater tomb,

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
then he wouldn't have died.

96
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,800
But why didn't he go
to the underwater tomb?

97
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,400
I suspect...

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,760
that he knew...

99
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
that the underwater
tomb was dangerous,

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
so he left alone.

101
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,720
So, you think that...

102
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,480
something's wrong with
the person upstairs, right?

103
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,760
Whether if there's anything wrong,

104
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
we'll find out after we test him.

105
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,880
Fatty.

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,520
I have one question.

107
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,000
What?

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
Why am I dressed like this?

109
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,600
Just pretend to look serious.

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,320
Remember.

111
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,760
You are the boss of an organization.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
The big boss.

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
I am a boss.

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,920
The boss of Panjiayuan market.

115
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,080
What's this?

116
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,600
Tuck it in, tuck it in.

117
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
I don't usually wear these clothes.

118
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
What a waste to buy them!

119
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,400
I have to return it later.

120
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,520
Hurry, tuck it in.

121
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,080
Remember.

122
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
What's most important
for an actor is...

123
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,880
belief.

124
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,760
You're the actor.

125
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,840
Your whole family are actors.

126
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
This is so awkward,

127
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,480
so darn awkward.

128
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,520
Is that Island 701...

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
really so important?

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,880
Shouldn't we put our focus on...

131
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
Wang Zang Hai...

132
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,200
and the Sky Palace?

133
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,480
This is our only clue,

134
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,440
so you tell me.

135
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,160
This is such a mess.

136
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,400
We can't just do this with...

137
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,240
impulse alone, right?

138
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,840
What's that person called?

139
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,680
Xiao Huo, right?

140
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,080
It's Yu!

141
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,680
Hello.

142
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Hello.

143
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
We're here to see
the director, Mr. Xiao.

144
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,440
Mr. Xiao is in a meeting right now.

145
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,200
May I know if you have
made an appointment?

146
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,040
I called Mr. Xiao's
secretary yesterday.

147
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
We're here for a partnership.

148
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:04,960
All right.

149
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,720
Let me bring you...

150
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,680
to the waiting room first.

151
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,520
This way, please.

152
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,080
All right.

153
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,320
You really made an appointment?

154
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,840
Of course not.

155
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
Let's just go in first.

156
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,640
What a rebel.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,680
Did you see him?

158
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,160
Xiao Yu.

159
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,720
This way, please.

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,600
Please have a seat.

161
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,520
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

162
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,720
We are...

163
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,160
We're from the Sunflower...

164
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,000
Turing Robot Development Company.

165
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,640
This is our boss, Mr. Wang.

166
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
I'm the Creative Director, Wu Xie.

167
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,240
Have a seat.

168
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,920
Firstly,

169
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,520
thank you Mr. Xiao...

170
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,640
for giving us the chance
to introduce our company.

171
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
We, the Sunflower Company,

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,680
are the country's...

173
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
first company that's
developing Turing robots.

174
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,480
Actually, the foreigners have been...

175
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,000
researching on Turing
robots since long ago.

176
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
This is definitely...

177
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,960
the most promising industry right now.

178
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,280
If an IT company...

179
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,880
wants to become the industry's leader,

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,280
then artificial intelligence
will be your best choice.

181
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Let me explain...

182
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,760
my idea to you.

183
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,640
If you provide me the
big data in your database,

184
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,440
I can instantly simulate an...

185
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,720
artificial intelligence robot for you.

186
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,920
It will definitely suit your company,

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,920
definitely user-friendly,

188
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
and definitely beyond
your expectations.

189
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,760
I think you better stop
wasting your time here.

190
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,280
Perhaps you've misunderstood
the nature of company's business.

191
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,400
I hope that you can find...

192
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,360
a suitable partner to
work with in the future,

193
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,000
and achieve your dreams.

194
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,800
I have another meeting later,

195
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,160
so I'll not waste any
more time with you here.

196
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,280
You know the way out.

197
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,360
Mr. Xiao.

198
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,480
I think I may have been unclear,

199
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,520
but I know that your company...

200
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,080
strives at big data cloud computing.

201
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
Let me give you another example.

202
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,640
With a random Internet user name,

203
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,840
like Island 701,

204
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,440
once a strange term like this appears,

205
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,840
it will be recorded
into your big data.

206
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,640
If it is in your cloud database,

207
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,440
then you can analyze...

208
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,240
its footprints through data.

209
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,840
If its footprints
increases over time...

210
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,040
I don't know what
your real intention is.

211
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I only have one thing to tell you.

212
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,040
Whatever it is,
I can't give you what you want.

213
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,200
We can't work together either.

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,600
Send them out.

215
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,840
This way, please.

216
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,120
Wait,

217
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,160
didn't you just expose
your own intentions?

218
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,520
They didn't even give
us any information,

219
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,760
why did you mention Island 701?

220
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,440
I did it on purpose.

221
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,080
On purpose?

222
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,760
I just wanted to
see how this Mr. Xiao...

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,840
would react after hearing that name.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,240
No, but why?

225
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,400
I've already seen this photo.

226
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,160
What's up?

227
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,760
Look properly...

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,240
at the list of names that...

229
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
Island 701 provided.

230
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,200
Chen Wen Jin,

231
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,760
Huo Ling,

232
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Li Si Di,

233
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Kylin Zhang...

234
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Xiao Da?

235
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,480
Xiao Huo must be related to Xiao Da.

236
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,760
I don't know if they are related,

237
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,080
but he definitely has
something to do with Island 701.

238
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,080
Because after I said that name,

239
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
his reaction explained everything.

240
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,400
-Hello!
-Hello.

241
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Why are you here?

242
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,640
I remember you!

243
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,920
Aren't you Mr. Wang?

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
Yes!

245
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,640
You came before, didn't you?

246
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,320
Yes, yes.

247
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,280
I remember you.

248
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,880
How did I even drop that?

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,800
-Let me pick it up for you.
-Did I break it?

250
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,120
We don't have much time.

251
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,280
How long more for remote operation?

252
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,800
Just show me his computer first.

253
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,360
-Be careful now.
-I know, I know.

254
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,680
By the way.

255
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,240
Oh, yes.

256
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,160
I'm here today...

257
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,120
because I want to meet Mr. Xiao again.

258
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,800
The other time,

259
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,800
that... employee of mine,

260
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,680
Xiao Xie...

261
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,520
What happened?

262
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
A hacker has hacked into my computer.

263
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,360
You're Island 701?

264
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,840
-There's no choice.
-What a tough job.

265
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,720
What are you doing?

266
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,920
Mr. Xiao!

267
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,400
I mean no harm!

268
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,440
Please tell me the truth
about the underwater tomb!

269
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,600
Let him go first.

270
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,240
Yes, sir.

271
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,600
I've heard enough
of reasons like that.

272
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,120
Everyone who asked me
about the archeology team,

273
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,960
all said that they
want to know the truth.

274
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,840
This time, I will not
call the cops on you.

275
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,120
You better watch out.

276
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,880
Just tell me what you know,

277
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,400
and I promise...

278
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,440
I won't disturb you again!

279
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,160
But today,

280
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,200
I won't leave no matter what.

281
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,400
Because my uncle...

282
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,520
has been missing since a month ago.

283
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
The only person who has a clue...

284
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,240
is you, and only you!

285
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,840
Your uncle?

286
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,440
My uncle is Wu San Xing.

287
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,800
Sir, you're not allowed in there!

288
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,040
Sorry, Mr. Xiao.
We couldn't keep him out.

289
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,440
A little more than a month ago,

290
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
my uncle was taken advantage of,

291
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,360
and disappeared at
the underwater tomb.

292
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,880
I personally went to
the underwater tomb,

293
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,360
but I couldn't find him either.

294
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,280
If what you said was true,

295
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,400
I understand and sympathize with you.

296
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,840
But I'm sorry.

297
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,600
I only know the things from the past.

298
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,000
They will not be of any help to you.

299
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,040
As long as you 
give me your cloud data,

300
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,880
I will decide...

301
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,560
if they are of any help.

302
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I am no longer associated...

303
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,360
with what happened back then.

304
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,840
In fact, I was never part of it.

305
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,520
So...

306
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,680
please understand.

307
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
I don't want to be disturbed...

308
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,960
because of this matter anymore.

309
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,720
Great.

310
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,120
After a long morning,

311
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,080
I'm done acting with you.

312
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,840
Where's my pay?

313
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,040
Stop messing around.

314
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,160
I think he refused to tell us...

315
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,480
because of other reasons.

316
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,480
What other reasons?

317
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,080
He's just a jerk in disguise!

318
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,080
What reason can there be?

319
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,400
I think he just...

320
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,360
doesn't want this issue...

321
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,040
to affect his family.

322
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
Whatever it is, let me tell you,

323
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,960
that Island 701 is a dead end.

324
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,840
It's not a dead end.

325
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,240
You can go back to Beijing.

326
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,360
Back where?

327
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
You summon and
dismiss me as you please?

328
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,080
Right?
I just came this morning.

329
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,840
-Now you want me to leave?
-If you don't want to go back,

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,800
then just stay in Hangzhou.

331
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,560
I'll pay for your meals.

332
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,520
I'm going to meet Ji Jiu Zhang.

333
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Wait...

334
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,800
I...

335
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,310
"Search Notice"

336
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,160
"Beike Real Estate"

337
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,400
Doctor!

338
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,000
What's wrong?

339
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,920
Oh, yes.
Hello, hello, hello.

340
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,520
Hello.

341
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,680
Doctor Li.

342
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,760
Did you know?

344
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,000
You healed my mother?

345
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,960
She's just great at home now.

346
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,800
She's so healthy now.

347
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,680
Thank you so much.

348
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,640
It's my duty.

349
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,600
So, I...

350
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,560
I'm here today...

351
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,120
to look for Xiao Yu.

352
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,040
Mr. Xiao...

353
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
His mother, right?

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
Mr. Xiao's mother, right?

355
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,520
She should be...

356
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,840
sunbathing by the lake right now.

357
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,840
Mr. Xiao should be there too.

358
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,480
His mother... Okay.

359
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,800
How do I get to that lakeside?

360
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,720
Do you want some water?
I'll get it for you.

361
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,480
All the water in this lake...

362
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,560
can last me a few lifetimes.

363
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,840
Titanic.

364
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,840
Auntie?

365
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,520
You must be Xiao Yu's mother, right?

366
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,760
-Come here!
-I am...

367
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,960
I am...

368
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,400
What's your name?

369
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,760
My surname is Wang.

370
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,880
Wang!

371
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,080
You're that...

372
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,560
That Wang something's son, right?

373
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,560
Exactly!

374
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
I know your dad!

375
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,480
Yes!

376
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,880
Your dad's name is Wang...

377
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,120
Wang, Wang, Wang...

378
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
Wangba!

379
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,120
Ba?

380
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,480
Ba Si!

381
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,440
Okay!

382
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,200
To be honest,

383
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,160
the condition of your mother's...

384
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,200
intermittent abnormality and
amnesia is getting worse.

385
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,200
We don't have better solutions now.

386
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,480
When you have time,
spend some time with her.

387
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,320
Take her out for walks.

388
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
Try to avoid sensitive questions.

389
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,480
Okay.

390
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,440
I understand.

391
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,400
Mr. Xiao.

392
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,560
Why are you here?

393
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,640
Where's my mom?

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
Your friend came to visit her.

395
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,520
She's talking with him now.

396
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,560
I don't have such friends!

397
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,160
Mr. Xiao, Mr. Xiao!

398
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
You work together, right?

399
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,680
See, he doesn't only have that...

400
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,840
Taraxacum IT Company or something,

401
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,840
but,

402
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,040
we're also doing
archeology together!

403
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,200
You know, like going
to underwater tombs,

404
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,360
Island 701.

405
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,760
Do you know these things?

406
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,880
-Underwater tomb!
-Auntie!

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
-Mom, mom!
-Auntie, don't move!

408
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,680
Who asked you to do archeology?

409
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,360
-I'm here.
-Tell me!

410
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,680
-Who asked you to do archeology?
-Auntie!

411
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Who asked you to do archeology?

412
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,120
Mom, it's fine now.

413
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,880
Xiao Yu's stance...

414
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,720
is firmer than we imagined it to be.

415
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,000
Yet everything about
the archeology team...

416
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,920
is crucial for Wu Xie...

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,120
to solve the mystery.

418
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,640
All of the confusion...

419
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
seem to lead to...

420
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
this Snake Eye Copper Fish.

421
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,280
What kind of power can it have...

422
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,880
to make so many people chase after it?

423
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
There are 3 Snake Eye Copper Fishes.

424
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,200
One's in King Lu's Seven Star Palace,

425
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,480
one's in the underwater
tomb of Paracel Islands.

426
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,920
Where would the other be?

427
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,120
Could it be in the Sky Palace?

428
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,480
There are 3 tombs.

429
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,560
One was from the
Warring States period,

430
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,880
one was from the Ming dynasty.

431
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,840
The other one...

432
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,560
may be the...

433
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,960
Sky Palace that buries the nobles...

434
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,960
of the ethnic minorities.

435
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,440
What do these 3 tombs...

436
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,000
have in common?

437
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,720
Where's your suit?

438
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,600
I returned it.

439
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,720
Respect.

440
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,560
What are you plotting again?

441
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
What's poking me?

442
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,600
What is it?

443
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,200
The thing that you wanted.

444
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,280
After we got kicked out,

445
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,600
I didn't give up.

446
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,840
After a while,

447
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,600
I followed him to the nursing home,

448
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,320
and I met Xiao Yu's mother.

449
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,600
She has mid-stage dementia.

450
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,920
I'm quite envious of you.

451
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,560
You have a mother to take care of,

452
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,080
but all of my family is gone.

453
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,120
They've been gone since I was young.

454
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,520
Mr. Xiao, Boss Xiao.

455
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm sorry.

456
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,800
But seriously,

457
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,080
you're both quite alike.

458
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:58,960
He...

459
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
lost his family, and is
searching for his family.

460
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,840
And you...

461
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
You're taking care of your family.

462
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:11,880
Wait.

463
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,840
Where was Wu San Xing last seen?

464
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
Xiao Yu just looks
coldblooded on the outside...

465
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,320
and has a very strong
awareness to protect himself.

466
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,960
But it's not his fault either.

467
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,600
Say, a family...

468
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,600
ended up like this...

469
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,520
because of tomb raiding.

470
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,520
It would've been the
same for anyone else.

471
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,000
His father was Xiao Da.

472
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,320
That's right.

473
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,520
Also, let me tell you.

474
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,800
Xiao Da...

475
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,280
was the only one member of
the archeology team who...

476
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,800
never went to the underwater tomb.

477
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,680
My father, Wu San Xing,

478
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,800
Chen Wen Jin and the gang...

479
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,920
departed together
to the Paracel Islands.

480
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,560
A day before they went in,

481
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
he got a high fever instead.

482
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,640
The archeology team...

483
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,240
left him alone on sea.

484
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,000
When he woke up,

485
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,560
three days have already passed.

486
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,320
Did he go to the tomb himself?

487
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,800
He didn't dare to.

488
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,120
I investigated the work unit...

489
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,240
that his archeology team belonged to.

490
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
I couldn't find anything.

491
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,360
What happened after that?

492
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,240
After that, he...

493
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,240
returned to Beijing alone.

494
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,480
My father visited
the Paracel Islands...

495
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,640
at least 3 times a year.

496
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,200
This went on for about 2 to 3 years.

497
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,080
Until...

498
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,920
someone came to meet him.

499
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,120
Uncle San Xing came to meet him?

500
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,400
He went to meet Xiao Da.

501
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,920
Xiao Da was really happy.

502
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,480
He has always been
a fan of your uncle.

503
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,720
Did my uncle mention anything else?

504
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,280
Did he mention other people?

505
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,120
No.

506
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,360
Instead, he...

507
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,400
came to ask Xiao Da...

508
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,480
about the whereabouts of those people.

509
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,080
My father has been following...

510
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,280
Wu San Xing's train of thoughts.

511
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,680
If Wu San Xing could
not explain something,

512
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,200
he would not ask.

513
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,400
My father asked Wu San Xing as well,

514
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
about what happened back then...

515
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,760
in the underwater tomb.

516
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,240
What did Wu San Xing say?

517
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,320
He said...

518
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,000
that regardless if
they're dead or alive,

519
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,040
he wanted to see the person...

520
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,800
or the body.

521
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,480
But I think what he is
truly searching for...

522
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,960
are not these people.

523
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,760
Fatty.

524
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,800
There's a recording here.

525
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,720
Xiao Yu recorded it.

526
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,600
He recorded your uncle...

527
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,840
arguing with Xiao Da.

528
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,000
Why didn't you go?

529
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,080
Brother Xing.

530
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,640
What are we looking for?

531
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,360
Our teammates from
the archeology team.

532
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,640
But we searched half of China...

533
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,040
Are they all dead?

534
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,680
If I can escape from
the underwater tomb,

535
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,000
then they must be
able to do the same!

536
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,360
It's different.

537
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,000
Xie Lian Huan is dead already.

538
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,920
How can they still be alive?

539
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,080
They must be alive.

540
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,400
They have the key.

541
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,560
The secret can't stay hidden forever!

542
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
It will eventually be revealed!

543
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,640
The situation that
we are in right now...

544
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,280
We must not forget...

545
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,520
our true goal!

546
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,000
You know what I mean?

547
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,200
Fatty.

548
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
Who drew this?

549
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,640
I don't know,
Xiao Yu didn't say anything.

550
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Can you ask him for me?

551
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,800
It's all here!

552
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,600
Can't you just figure it out yourself?

553
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,640
I promised not to disturb him.

554
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,760
I'd be pretty shameless
to disturb him again.

555
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,440
It's fine being a bit more shameless.

556
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,600
Boss Xiao,

557
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
sorry for disturbing you at night.

558
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,680
Can I just trouble you one more time?

559
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
You have this thing in here.

560
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,320
Can you tell me...

561
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,640
who drew it?

562
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,000
Never mind, just look at it yourself.

563
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,960
I don't know what this is either.

564
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,400
My father used to...

565
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,280
argue with Wu San Xing...

566
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,680
because of this thing.

567
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm guessing that
this has to do with...

568
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,800
my father's disappearance.

569
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,520
Is Master Hua still not here?

570
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,640
He's here.

571
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,560
He sent a photo to the
email that we gave him.

572
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,760
It was exactly the same
as the old photo you sent.

573
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,400
No.

574
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,800
To be precise,

575
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,920
this photo...

576
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,440
did not have the words that you wrote.

577
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,760
It's been edited out.

578
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,920
I checked it.

579
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,280
It was not edited with your photo.

580
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,680
Also, this photo...

581
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,720
has a Snake Eye Copper Fish too.

582
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,000
He has the Snake Eye Copper Fish.

583
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,800
Aside from that,
he'd also like to meet you.

584
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,440
I've checked it,

585
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,120
his IP address has been altered.

586
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,320
Are we going to meet him?

587
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,560
Yes.

588
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,720
Do we need to make any arrangements?

589
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,080
Arrange for it to happen on a boat.

590
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,680
Don't let him get away.

591
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,880
Roger.

592
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
Cool.

593
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,440
Why did you bring me here?

594
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,680
Are you rewarding me?

595
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
That's one way to put it.

596
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,360
Good things pass by really quick!

597
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,080
You're not going to get some of that?

598
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,440
Say, just hurry up and go!

599
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,280
I'll pass.

600
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,200
I'll wait for you over here.

601
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,880
Don't regret later!

602
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,800
You're the person
who wants to meet me?

603
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,840
Someone wants to meet you.

604
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,480
-Come over for a while.
-Sure!

605
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,520
What's the meaning of this?

606
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,640
What's wrong, Wu Xie?

607
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Request a song.

608
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,520
Hey sisters, excuse me!

609
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,800
At that table earlier,

610
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,280
I lost while playing Truth or Dare!

611
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,760
My friend...

612
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,240
forced me to come over here...

613
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
and treat you all to a drink!

614
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,760
Come, come, come!

615
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,480
What's up?

616
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,880
Who's going to talk first?

617
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,160
You have the clues to the copper fish?

618
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,680
You're investigating it too?

619
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,320
You go ahead.

620
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,040
You first.

621
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,720
Fine.

622
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,200
Come on.

623
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,800
All right.

624
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,280
Currently, I have...

625
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,600
one Snake Eye Copper Fish.

626
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,440
I need to gather the other two.

627
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,520
How do you know
that there are 3 in total?

628
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,920
I guessed it.

629
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,360
What did you base your assumptions on?

630
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,640
This is already the third question.

631
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,880
You're just asking me questions.

632
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Are we still friends or not?

633
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm just anxious.

634
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,560
Because the Snake Eye Copper Fish...

635
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
is very important to me.

636
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,360
Since you're investigating...

637
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,320
Snake Eye Copper Fish,

638
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,160
you must have seen that photo, right?

639
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,400
The Paracel Islands' archeology team?

640
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,160
Then you should know...

641
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,000
that my uncle, Xie Lian Huan...

642
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,800
was in that photo, right?

643
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,000
Which one's your uncle?

644
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,680
This one.

645
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,440
This?

646
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,440
Are you sure that's not my uncle?

647
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,920
This is a very low resolution photo,

648
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,640
it's normal for you to
get the wrong person.

649
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,040
Furthermore, from what I know,

650
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,440
when they were younger,

651
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,800
they did look very alike.

652
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,480
Even if someone called them twins,

653
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,520
people would've believed them.

654
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Also, don't forget...

655
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,920
the Xie and Wu families...

656
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,240
were related by marriage.

657
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,280
They were cousins to begin with.

658
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,040
So, what's wrong with looking alike?

659
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,760
Jiu Ye.

660
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,080
I have brought the young master.

661
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,680
Uncle, you're back!

662
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,200
What troubles did
you get into this time?

663
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,640
Yu Chen.

664
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,400
He's your third uncle
from the Wu Family.

665
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,720
Both of them look really alike.

666
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,960
Hello, uncle.

667
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Later on, I found out...

668
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,920
that they both joined the
same archeology team.

669
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,240
Yet the ship that
transported my uncle...

670
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,320
went missing.

671
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,360
Even my uncle's body...

672
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,720
could not be found.

673
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,880
That is why, up until today,

674
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,240
he's still not included
in the Xie family's tomb.

675
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,040
Look.

676
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,480
I'm sorry.

677
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
Why are you apologizing?

678
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,240
You still haven't told me...

679
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,800
how did you deduce...

680
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,240
that there are 3 copper fishes?

681
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,960
You also know...

682
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,040
that the copper fishes relate
to do the archeology team.

683
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,960
Can it be that...

684
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,760
you're investigating on
the archeology team too?

685
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Not long ago,

686
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,400
I went to the underwater
tomb of Paracel Islands.

687
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,160
Wu Xie.

688
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,120
You really shouldn't
get involved in this.

689
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,120
Trust me.

690
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,560
Stop this.

691
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,560
As long as I can't
locate Uncle San Xing,

692
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,960
I will continue...

693
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,680
to investigate this case.

694
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,240
Before I came,

695
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,240
I was worried that
accidents may happen,

696
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,400
so I left the copper fish...

697
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,320
at home.

698
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,480
After I return to Hangzhou,

699
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
I will send it to you.

700
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Why are you giving it to me?

701
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,160
There are 3 Snake Eye Copper Fishes.

702
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,840
If you have 2 of them,

703
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,840
perhaps it would help...

704
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,000
to find the other one.

705
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,240
I'm not interested in...

706
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,160
the secret behind...

707
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,000
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

708
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,480
I wanted to find...

709
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,840
my Snake Eye Copper Fish...

710
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,240
simply because I may
be able to find out about...

711
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,480
the cause of my uncle's accident.

712
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,600
Xiao Hua.

713
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,880
It seems that the both of us...

714
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,240
are doing the same thing.

715
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,320
That is why...

716
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,000
if you have any clues,

717
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,160
be sure to tell me.

718
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,400
Okay.

719
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,880
Did you come alone?

720
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,560
Do you want me to send you back?

721
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,680
It's fine.

722
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,160
I have a friend with me too.

723
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,040
Let me introduce you to him.

724
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,840
Is that him?

725
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,720
Say, you didn't even tell me.

726
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,320
If something happened and...

727
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,320
human traffickers kidnapped you,

728
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,000
what do I do?

729
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,560
Thankfully, it was Xiao Hua.

730
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,120
Otherwise,

731
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,760
you wouldn't even know how you died.

732
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,440
I didn't expect it to be Xiao Hua.

733
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,880
He shocked me too.

734
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,920
Say, Xiao Hua...

735
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,360
really lives up to his name.

736
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,000
He dresses in such
a flamboyant manner.

737
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,000
Crazy.

738
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,360
Turns out...

739
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,040
that Xiao Hua is...

740
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,360
investigating on the
underwater tomb too.

741
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,200
His objectives...

742
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,600
are to find out...

743
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,360
about his uncle,
Xie Lian Huan's cause of death.

744
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,280
Did you tell him
about the blood writings?

745
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,840
That's what I'm worried about.

746
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,200
If he finds out about...

747
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,040
the writings on the wall,

748
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,440
he will really think that my uncle...

749
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,800
killed Xie Lian Huan.

750
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,960
Do you think that it was my uncle too?

751
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,680
No.

752
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,360
You can't be sure...

753
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,960
that your uncle didn't do it, right?

754
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,680
That is why...

755
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,040
I must...

756
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,400
find out the truth behind this case,

757
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
and give Xiao Hua an answer.

758
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,440
I mustn't let my uncle be framed,

759
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,320
and not let Xie Lian Huan die in vain.

760
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,680
Sir, turn left ahead.

761
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,720
All right, stop thinking about it.

762
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,120
I don't care about justice,
but I do care about my friend.

763
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,880
I never betray my friends.

764
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,240
Little Master is an introvert,

765
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,280
and besides, he doesn't...

766
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,160
even know Xiao Hua.

767
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,200
It's not possible.

768
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,640
If anything happens,
Fatty Wang is here.

769
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,400
Don't worry about it.

770
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,600
I just feel...

771
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,680
sorry towards Xiao Hua.

772
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,240
Say, why do you keep...

773
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
over thinking things?

774
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,760
Drink up!

775
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,040
Drink up and you'll forget everything.

776
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,040
Besides,

777
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,280
think about it.

778
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,520
If you manage to find out...

779
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,200
how Xie Lian Huan died,

780
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,480
aren't you also...

781
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,280
helping Xiao Hua?

782
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,560
What do you think?

783
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Plus, are the both of you...

784
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,240
very close?

785
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,560
You're just childhood friends...

786
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,600
who happened to
play together in the past.

787
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,280
So what?

788
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,720
I used to be close to...

789
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,480
a little girl in kindergarten too.

790
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,520
We had a wedding, kissed, all that.

791
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,400
But if we meet now,

792
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,880
we don't even know each other.

793
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,520
Fatty!

794
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,120
Prepare flight tickets to go abroad.

795
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,800
Where are you going?

796
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,920
I found a way to help Xiao Hua.

797
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,040
"Kokang, Myanmar"

798
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
We don't even know
if it's a scam message,

799
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,840
and now we're abroad.

800
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,680
I don't know if you're
crazy or if I'm crazy.

801
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,360
Maybe we're both crazy.

802
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

803
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,160
That Snake Eye Copper Fish
isn't even something common.

804
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,560
Most people shouldn't know about it.

805
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,600
Hello.

806
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,840
Mind your step, please.

807
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,840
Let me tell you, we're abroad.

808
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,160
You have no idea.

809
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,280
Just like this one.

810
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,400
-Hello.
-This place...

811
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,880
is not in our country,
but abroad now!

812
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,840
Right?

813
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,600
We'll be safe when we're home.

814
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,040
It's so dangerous outside!

815
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,960
Maybe,

816
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,720
if we want to meet anyone
or discuss about anything,

817
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,560
we can just invite
them to our country!

818
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,560
Let's stay in our country's territory,

819
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,720
it's safer that way.

820
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,360
-You're right.
-Of course.

821
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,080
Can we go now?

822
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Where are we going?

823
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Hendry Museum.

824
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,520
How do we go there?

825
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,440
Hurry up, Fatty!

826
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,400
It's the crappy bike you rented!

827
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,760
You're blaming my bike for being slow?

828
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,600
Let's do this,

829
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,560
let's make a bet.

830
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,680
Let's see who reaches
Hendry Museum first.

831
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,400
What's the bet?

832
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,720
What's the bet?

833
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,680
We'll talk about that later.

834
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,720
But whoever arrives first...

835
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,240
has to film a video...

836
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,240
and post it on Weibo.

837
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,880
No denying it!

838
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,720
Ready, set, go!

839
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,920
Hello, I'm Wu Xie.

840
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,360
I made a bet with Fatty Wang...

841
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,800
on who reaches Hendry Museum first.

842
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,120
I got here first,
this video will be my proof.

843
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,600
Do you see that?

844
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,640
Fatty is here.

845
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,080
What's wrong, Fatty?

846
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,240
Do you accept your loss?

847
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,480
Yes.

848
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,880
Just tell me what you want.

849
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,080
I haven't thought about it yet.

850
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
We're here, right?

851
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,400
This museum is not that big.

852
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,520
Why don't we do this?

853
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,840
You owe me 1 wish.

854
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Once I think of something,

855
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,920
then you will repay me.

856
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,400
Wait, what?

857
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,560
You're serious?

858
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,760
Of course!

859
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,680
I got a wedgie.
