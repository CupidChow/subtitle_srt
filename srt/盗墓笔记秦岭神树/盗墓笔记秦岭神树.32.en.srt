00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:04,383
"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:06,716
"Episode 32"

3
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,040
Mirrors?

4
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,440
There's likely
only one way out of here.

5
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
So the people who ambushed us
must still be nearby.

6
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,600
Stay on high alert.

7
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,840
Why are there so many mirrors?

8
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,200
This is a mirror maze...

9
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
to stop raiders from going further.

10
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,560
Let's split up and find the exit.

11
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
This is a good cover.

12
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,240
I would choose to ambush here.

13
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,760
Kai.

14
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,040
Kai!

15
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,080
Kai.

16
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,200
Kai!

17
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,960
Hang in there!

18
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,200
Kai.

19
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,200
Kai!

20
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,720
Where's he?

21
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,920
He went your way.

22
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
Kai, Kai!

23
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,760
I wonder how Fatty is now.

24
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,480
Master Hua, I found a passage.

25
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,520
This is a trap door.

26
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,640
The joint has been remade.

27
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,960
You can only lock
the door from the outside.

28
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
It seems like someone tried to enter.

29
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,440
He thought that he can do
that by breaking the lock.

30
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,280
But this is not the trap.

31
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm surprised that
Lieutenant Zhang was so skillful.

32
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,720
Let's try the mortise and tenon.

33
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,920
Fatty?

34
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Fatty!

35
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,600
Wake up.

36
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,760
Fatty!

37
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Wake up, Fatty.

38
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,320
Fatty, are you all right?

39
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,960
Not bad,
it's Simmons mattress this time.

40
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,520
Why are you here?

41
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
They sure have guts.

42
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,847
How dare the excavators bother me.

43
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Be serious!

44
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,360
Better don't let me
find out who did this.

45
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,880
Are we out of the tomb?

46
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,840
Whose house is this?

47
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,480
This room seems to be where
Lieutenant Zhang used to live.

48
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,240
But where is his body?

49
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Or is there a secret chamber?

50
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
It's okay, I'm fine on my own.

51
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,400
The watch doesn't belong here.

52
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,720
Why is it?

53
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,240
Its placement is strange.

54
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,040
Why would somebody
put a watch in the center of a table?

55
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,320
Why not? It just happens to be there.

56
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,200
So what?

57
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,200
So, there is a secret chamber.

58
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,560
This should be
Lieutenant Zhang's coffin.

59
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,160
Carved wood.
And the timing is right too.

60
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,880
Why are you standing there?

61
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,400
Let's open it!

62
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,160
Come on.

63
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,760
Let's not.

64
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Why?

65
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,720
I took a nap on his bed,

66
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,240
so I need to thank him in person.

67
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,440
Wu Xie,

68
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,480
we need to know who is in the coffin.

69
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,640
Great!

70
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,280
Come on!

71
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,920
One, two!

72
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,600
Little Master?

73
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,440
Wu Xie!

74
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,400
He's dead.

75
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,000
This isn't Little Master.
He won't die.

76
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,160
Even if he did,

77
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,080
he wouldn't be wearing
the Republic uniform.

78
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,960
This is definitely not him.

79
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,280
But this guy looks exactly like him.

80
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,360
This...

81
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,720
They're very much alike.

82
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,920
If he isn't Little Master,

83
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,720
could he be Lieutenant Zhang?

84
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,960
By the way,

85
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,040
I saw the diary of the man who took
his own life when I entered.

86
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
There might be some clue.

87
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,880
I gave my heart
to the wrong person.

88
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,040
How should I face myself?

89
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,320
Those whom the gods love die young.

90
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,720
Just words to vent his feelings.

91
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,920
Here it is.

92
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,200
I,

93
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,480
Dou Cheng,

94
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,640
swear to follow the Lieutenant,
dead or alive.

95
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,680
Even hell can't stop me.

96
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,360
How loyal and courageous.

97
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,800
He must have taken his own life
after his superior passed on.

98
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,360
What a die hard fan.

99
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,720
He wasn't even forced to do so.

100
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,880
He did that on his own will.

101
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,880
He wrote that he was transferred...

102
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,680
to work under Lieutenant Zhang Bu Xun.

103
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,120
Zhang Bu Xun?

104
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,760
Could this be the Lieutenant Zhang
that Xiao Hua mentioned?

105
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,320
Wait a minute.

106
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,600
Let's look further.

107
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,520
Here it is.

108
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,000
The General entrusted an
important task to Lieutenant,

109
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,520
but we never thought
that it would be...

110
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,560
You're really good,

111
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,520
but you're too stubborn sometimes.

112
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,520
So what if the army raids a tomb?

113
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,640
We're not the only ones.

114
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,480
Sun Dian Ying even raided
the tomb of Empress Dowager Cixi.

115
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,440
What we did is nothing
compared to him.

116
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,240
I don't want to be like them.

117
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,600
Dear brother-in-law,

118
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,960
I have to feed my soldiers.

119
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,640
I can let them starve,

120
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,520
but I can't have them go
to war with empty stomach.

121
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,680
Moreover,

122
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
we need money.

123
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,240
Do you want me to ask from
the Ministry of Finance?

124
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,960
You're well aware that
they'd only fill their own pockets.

125
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,480
They don't care if soldiers like us
are dying from starvation!

126
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,280
Dou Cheng!

127
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,600
If you're not paid,

128
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,160
would you still be
Lieutenant Zhang's adjutant?

129
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,120
I will!

130
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,400
How about 100 silver dollar
every month to be my adjutant?

131
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,320
General,

132
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,760
I wish to be
Lieutenant Zhang's adjutant only.

133
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,240
Do you think he's better than me?

134
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,600
General,

135
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,200
I must be grateful.

136
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,840
Lieutenant Zhang saved me once,
my life belongs to him.

137
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,960
Good!

138
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
You're just like him.

139
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,360
No wonder he thinks highly of you.

140
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,560
Dou Cheng is still young,
don't make fun of him.

141
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,200
All right.

142
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,800
Back to business.

143
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,440
I caught a tomb raider named Wang.

144
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,960
He knows a rich tomb.

145
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,920
You don't have to get
your hands dirty.

146
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,640
Just get the treasure out and exchange
for money for military expenses.

147
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
Our soldiers can't go to war
on an empty stomach.

148
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,440
I remember Zhang Gao Yuan.

149
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,880
He's said to be the
warlord around Yungui...

150
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,360
who was really powerful once.

151
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,160
He was quite arrogant.

152
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,720
I heard that he was born to...

153
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
a wealthy family at a place where
people were tough and brave.

154
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,160
He once wiped out a group
of bandits who entered the city,

155
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,280
and brought some men...

156
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,200
to eliminate their den.

157
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,160
Then, with the guns and
gun powder of the bandits,

158
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,880
he formed an army,

159
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
the militia.

160
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,000
Guns from Yungui?

161
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,000
Didn't the house owner
mention about Zhang Gao Yuan?

162
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,520
Some also said he was
forced to join the army.

163
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,560
A colonel named Zhang
happened to pass by.

164
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,280
I still remember his name.

165
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,360
Zhang Gao Yuan.

166
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,440
He was a hero.

167
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,680
I think Zhang Bu Xun
was no ordinary man too.

168
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
Lieutenant found the tomb using a map.

169
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,720
Lieutenant.

170
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Remind everybody...

171
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,800
to lay the body in place
and not make fun of it.

172
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,920
Yes.

173
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,840
When we're done,

174
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,880
seal up the hole.

175
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,960
Okay.

176
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,960
Cheng,

177
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,840
what will the tomb owner think as the
treasure in his tomb is all raided...

178
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,120
after hundreds of years?

179
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,600
Lieutenant,

180
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,520
I think a dead person
doesn't have the ability to think.

181
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,840
Lieutenant,

182
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,000
in my opinion,

183
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,480
he'd enjoyed his life,
both dead and alive.

184
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,080
That's enough.

185
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,960
Compared to him,

186
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,560
many people who aren't
buried after they died...

187
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,760
are even more pitiful.

188
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,840
You deserve this.

189
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Is it salary?

190
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,640
I'll pay you later.

191
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,160
It's my cut?

192
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,520
Yes.

193
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,840
Your cut.

194
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
You must take it.

195
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,640
Take it,

196
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,840
and buy some fine
jewelries for my sister.

197
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,080
When I married my fifth wife,

198
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,080
she looked really shabby.

199
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,720
Her ring is too small,
even I think that's embarrassing.

200
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,840
Qing Ping doesn't like jewelries.

201
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,240
Are you stupid?

202
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,160
All women like jewelries.

203
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,680
She didn't tell you so that
you won't feel awkward.

204
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,280
Bu Xun,

205
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,760
I see you as my own brother.

206
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,280
I even married my sister to you!

207
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,680
I don't ask for others.

208
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,520
But what other people have,

209
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,360
I want her to have it too!

210
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,240
Reporting.

211
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,560
That's it.

212
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,560
I'll send it to your house.

213
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,640
Leave now!

214
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,560
General.

215
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,720
Spit it out.

216
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Everybody is saying that they don't
want to enter the tombs anymore.

217
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,000
Why?

218
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,080
You have no idea that the
tombs are really creepy.

219
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,440
Fatal traps are everywhere.

220
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,640
If it weren't for Lieutenant...

221
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,080
General,

222
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,600
that is a place for the dead.

223
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,480
You would kill a living person,

224
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,920
but you're afraid of the dead?

225
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,080
Then, are you afraid of money?

226
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,000
Tell them.

227
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,880
Those who enter tombs can get an
extra 20 silver dollar everyday.

228
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Second timers get 40 and the
number is doubled every time.

229
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,760
I don't believe...

230
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,680
that they don't want it.

231
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
Is it very comfortable here?

232
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,880
Yes, sir.

233
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,680
Stop! Stay there!

234
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,480
Stay there! Still running?

235
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,440
Stop!

236
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,080
Get up.

237
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,640
You thief!

238
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,880
How dare you stole from us.

239
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,360
Stay there. Hit him!

240
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,800
You stealing brat!

241
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,160
What are you doing? Stop it.

242
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,200
Let's go.

243
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,560
This kid is quite tough.

244
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,440
Like the young you.

245
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,400
Madam told me that...

246
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,160
you fought a lot too
when you were young.

247
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,200
Nonsense.

248
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,560
I didn't fight,

249
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,480
I was working hard.

250
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,600
Lieutenant Zhang,

251
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,320
please let me serve you.

252
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
I can fight.

253
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,920
I didn't say that.

254
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,720
I...

255
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,400
What I said was: "Sir, feed me!
And I'll serve you with my life!"

256
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,720
You're too young.

257
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
If you want to be a soldier,

258
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,920
learn to read first.

259
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,800
Then only you'll know about war.

260
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,320
Somebody, take him to the orphanage.

261
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,040
Yes!

262
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,000
No!

263
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
No, I'm not going there!

264
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,560
Kid,

265
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,120
that orphanage
belongs to the Lieutenant.

266
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,120
You can eat and read there.

267
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
After you study,

268
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,120
you can serve the Lieutenant!

269
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,720
Like you?

270
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,480
Not really.

271
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,560
I'm one and only to the Lieutenant!

272
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,680
Just go.

273
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,920
Someone's dead!

274
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,800
Run for your life!

275
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Someone's killed! Run now!

276
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,520
Lieutenant.

277
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,280
Madam made the soup for you.

278
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,760
What's the point?

279
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,280
You're bleeding again?

280
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,440
Is the interrogation done?

281
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,960
Yes.

282
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,351
They're the family of
the tomb raider, Wang.

283
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,240
They were trying to avenge him
as they thought you killed him.

284
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,040
What is it about the Wang family?

285
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,760
They're the descendants of a famous
Fengshui master from Ming dynasty.

286
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,840
But they're just relatives who
aren't close with the main members.

287
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,800
The direct descendant's
whereabouts are unknown.

288
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,840
The person caught by the General is a
key person among the main members.

289
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,720
He knows many secrets
about the family.

290
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,320
But he's not a tough person.

291
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,080
He betrayed his family
with just some threats.

292
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,840
Yet they tried to avenge him.
He's not worth it.

293
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,360
What about the boy?

294
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,560
Was he killed?

295
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,840
The General said that...

296
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,520
we must hinder the
assassination of an officer.

297
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,760
He must be punished heavily.

298
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,680
-So he was shot dead.
-But he's just a kid.

299
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,960
He's not a kid if he
would kill someone.

300
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,280
Luckily you're safe this time.

301
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,720
If you were killed,
what's the point of your sympathy?

302
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,360
Cheng,

303
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,440
sometimes I think that...

304
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,040
you don't really respect life.

305
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,760
I don't respect life.

306
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,600
Neither do I fear god or ghosts.

307
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,160
I only respect and fear you.

308
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,720
You do respect me,

309
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,600
but you don't fear me.

310
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,000
That's because you're nice to me.

311
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,120
Cheng,

312
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,920
you're smart, tactful and a good
soldier and you can speak English.

313
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,480
I'll appoint you as the
company commander.

314
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,000
-Then...
-Lieutenant.

315
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,960
Are you kicking me out?

316
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,840
Do you want to be my follower forever?

317
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,560
Why not?

318
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,600
All adjutants wish
for a bright future.

319
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,280
My brightest future
lies on the path as your adjutant.

320
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,560
Nonsense.

321
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Respect life!

322
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,120
It's just a matter of respecting life.
I'll respect anything you want me to.

323
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,680
That's not it.

324
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,760
I don't care,
I'm not following your instruction.

325
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,720
Are you disobeying me?

326
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,200
Then, do you want to shoot me?

327
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,840
You...

328
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,480
It's hot!

329
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,240
Lieutenant,

330
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,680
if you hate tomb raiding so much,

331
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,920
why not tell the General
to let someone else do it?

332
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,360
I'm indebted to him.

333
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,560
I know.

334
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,760
You're alive today because
he helped you back then.

335
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,080
But all the villagers survived the
bandits' attack because of you.

336
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,480
So, you've returned his favor.

337
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,200
We must not count kindness.

338
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,400
Only money can be counted.

339
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,840
Taking revenge is short,

340
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,320
but repaying kindness takes forever.

341
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,600
What? Do you want to take it for free?

342
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,000
You need to sign your name, get it?

343
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,080
Yes, I did.

344
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,160
Listen up!

345
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,400
If I found any problems
at the headquarter,

346
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,480
you'll be eating bullets!

347
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,680
Who else?

348
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,960
Let's go, hurry up.

349
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,640
Those who want to serve the
country with Commander Cai,

350
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,560
sign on this paper.

351
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
And you'll get a uniform and rice.

352
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,480
Move.

353
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,120
You're late.

354
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,520
Are you trying to drag me back?

355
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,760
Brother, is it safe to join them?

356
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,640
Can we don't go?

357
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,400
If you don't go,

358
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,240
you'll starve to death, I'll go.

359
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,480
Sir, welcome.

360
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,480
Get a pot of Longjing tea from Xihu!

361
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,480
Sir, which army do you belong to?

362
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,280
Do you have a gun?

363
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,360
Sir, welcome.

364
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,480
But you have money, haven't you?

365
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,640
-How much do I need to go in?
-It takes everything you have.

366
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Welcome, sir.

367
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,480
So little?

368
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,760
Sir,

369
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,400
people pay 10 silver dollars
to do business here.

370
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,400
But you...

371
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,840
Sir, please go in.

372
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,040
Get lost now.

373
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,800
Does this watch worth
10 silver dollar?

374
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:05,960
Fine, go.

375
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And you'd better be smart.

376
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,640
Waiter, I need tea!

377
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,760
Coming!

378
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,800
Waiter, I want wine!

379
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,760
-Sir, this way please.
-Okay.

380
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,560
These are nothing.

381
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,600
Two people, upstairs.

382
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
Hurry up!

383
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,840
Shopkeeper,

384
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,800
do all the soldiers here
do this everyday?

385
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,920
Yes, they do.

386
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,160
When war breaks out few months later,

387
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,720
another new batch will come.

388
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,440
And our good business goes on.

389
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,240
Commander Cai,

390
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,520
I heard that you're
married again recently.

391
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
And your new wives are
as pretty as my darling.

392
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,560
No wonder you weren't
here for so many days.

393
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,400
So,

394
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,000
I bet your pocket is full now...

395
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,920
after going to Sichuan
with Commander Cai.

396
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,720
Luckily I have a good boss.

397
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,840
I can make a lot of money
as Dai's follower.

398
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,640
But you're different, Xiao Zheng.

399
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,240
You've sacrificed
even your own sister.

400
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,480
But where's the money?

401
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,000
Send a message to your superior.

402
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,560
Stop showing off.

403
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,320
Bugger off!

404
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,280
What are you looking at?

405
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,040
What now?

406
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,080
What now?

407
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,240
You stared at me?

408
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,840
Why?

409
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
I'll kill...

410
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,360
Are you dead?

411
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,080
Let go of me.

412
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,120
Let go of me!

413
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,840
You can do whatever you like at home,

414
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,200
or in front of your wife.

415
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,520
But don't make a fool
of yourself here.

416
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
Don't you forget that
you're a soldier.

417
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,240
Who the heck are you?

418
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,520
He's with the Commander in Chief,
they just came back from Yunnan.

419
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,840
You're Commander in Chief's
adjutant, Mr. Zhang?

420
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,960
My goodness,

421
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,760
we're fighting our own friends.

422
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,680
This is just a misunderstanding.

423
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,600
Come back here.

424
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,880
We're friends.

425
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,320
We're friends.

426
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,320
Here.

427
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,360
Here you go.

428
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,840
Aren't you embarrassed?

429
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
So, you're a student.

430
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,400
What are you doing here?

431
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
To take a look around.

432
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,880
What did you see then?

433
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,200
A whole bunch of trash.

434
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,200
Waiter, where's my wine?

435
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Coming, coming!

436
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,960
There'll be a day when justice arises.

437
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,840
Governing a country.

438
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,360
Well, we can't let these people
handle such affairs, can we?

439
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,040
Aren't you also
enjoying your tea here?

440
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,240
Nice writing.

441
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,680
Tell me.

442
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,600
Why did you write these?

443
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,440
I have to go now.
Give me back the book.

444
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,400
I think you should tell me first.

445
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,440
Why did you write these?

446
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,943
Why bother? We've different beliefs.
You can keep the book.

447
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,560
Zhang Bu Xun.

448
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,720
I'm Zhang Gao Yuan.

449
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,880
I think you know where
you can find me.

450
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,840
Here's the wine.

451
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,520
-Make way.
-Buns for sale!

452
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,320
Fresh buns for sale!

453
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,000
Welcome,

454
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,800
do you want buns or rice noodles?

455
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,440
We also have sesame seed cakes.

456
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,360
Come and take a look!

457
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,960
There's free rice.

458
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,920
-Hurry up, here!
-There's nothing for latecomers.

459
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,600
Line up.

460
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,720
It's for everybody. Slowly.

461
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,320
Next, next.

462
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,960
Everyone gets it.

463
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,200
Stop pushing, you'll get yours.

464
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,440
It's enough for everyone,
stop pushing.

465
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,480
-Next.
-One for me.

466
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,080
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

467
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,520
Please come in.

468
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,520
Congratulations.

469
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,960
Congratulations.

470
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,080
Thank you.

471
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,760
-Madam Zhang, welcome.
-Congratulations.

472
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,000
-Sir, congratulations.
-Thank you.

473
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,160
Welcome.

474
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,200
Congratulations.

475
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,400
-Congratulations, sir.
-Thank you.

476
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,480
This way, please.

477
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,080
Since you're here,
why don't you come in?

478
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,080
Frankly speaking,

479
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,640
I think you're different from those
rotten and gold-digging scholars.

480
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,080
Now is the best time
to awaken the people.

481
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
I, Zhang Gao Yuan,

482
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,120
am forming an army of my own.

483
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,400
I need people like you.

484
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,520
Don't decide now.

485
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,600
I won't force you.

486
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,320
But,

487
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,040
since you're here,

488
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,800
just come in and join us.

489
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,320
Let's get to know each other.

490
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,760
Moreover,

491
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,480
I have something to return to you.

492
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,040
Look good.

493
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,160
Energetic!

494
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,600
You're born to wear a uniform.

495
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,680
From the moment I saw you,

496
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,680
I was attracted by your heroic look.

497
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,600
When our army's strong enough,

498
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,480
we'll conquer the world
with this heroic spirit.

499
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,360
Yes!

500
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,000
Believe me,

501
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,840
we'll get better.

502
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,320
The current situation favors us.

503
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,520
Commanders Dai And Liu will go to war.

504
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,160
I was told that...

505
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,360
Dai has sent his men
to invite Luo Pei Jin.

506
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,400
Do you know what this means?

507
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,760
This means he has lost his confidence.

508
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,600
Sichuan is in chaos now.

509
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,480
The Chuan Army is vulnerable
and Dian Army is targeting them.

510
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
We can seize this
chance to attack them.

511
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,880
Those in Beiping won't let
Sichuan be taken by others.

512
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,160
Follow me,
I'll introduce someone to you.

513
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,080
Qing Ping!

514
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,640
Brother!

515
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,360
I miss you so much.

516
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,480
You look good.

517
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,440
Is the gun real?

518
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,880
You studied abroad
for such a long time,

519
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,800
don't you have any sense of decency?

520
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,680
Is this something a girl should touch?

521
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,000
Can't I see it?

522
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,840
Besides, brother,

523
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,840
I studied in a girl school in Beiping,
not abroad.

524
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,760
That's not even overseas.

525
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,460
You haven't seen me for so long,

526
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:47,280
-still you don't show care.
-You're prettier!

527
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,640
So much prettier!

528
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,000
That's more like it.

529
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,120
-Let's go.
-Come on.
