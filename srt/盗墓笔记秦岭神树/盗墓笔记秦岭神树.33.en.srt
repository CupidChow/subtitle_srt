"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,840
"Episode 33"

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,918
You studied abroad
for such a long time,

4
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,834
don't you have any sense of decency?

5
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,709
Is this something a girl should touch?

6
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,125
Can't I see it?

7
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,834
Besides, brother,

8
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,751
I studied in a girl school in Beiping,

9
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:20,751
not abroad.

10
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,792
That's not even overseas.

11
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:26,292
You haven't seen me for so long,

12
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,125
-still you don't show care.
-You're prettier!

13
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:30,542
So much prettier!

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,959
That's more like it.

15
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:33,999
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

16
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,125
Who is he?

17
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,918
Let me introduce you.

18
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,209
He's my best friend,

19
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:43,584
Zhang Bu Xun.

20
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:46,375
Bu Xun.

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,125
This is my sister,

22
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,417
Zhang Qing Ping.

23
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:51,751
Hello.

24
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,083
Let's talk inside.

25
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:04,667
Who is he?

26
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,250
That was so embarrassing.

27
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,292
Cool, right?

28
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:08,876
When he's angry,

29
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,209
he won't even save face for me.

30
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,751
Let's go.

31
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:12,667
I'm not happy.

32
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,125
I'll save face for you later!

33
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:16,375
Let's go!

34
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:17,792
That's more like it.

35
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:18,918
Let's go.

36
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:26,417
Gao Yuan,

37
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:27,959
I've done what you told me to do.

38
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:28,542
Okay.

39
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,300
Sit down.

40
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,120
Sit down and talk.

41
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:36,918
Look.

42
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,167
It's not easy to peel this apple.

43
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:41,288
By the way,

44
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:42,876
later,

45
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,542
distribute some money
to our comrades...

46
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,751
to boost their morale.

47
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:46,292
Sure.

48
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,292
Besides,

49
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:48,876
you have to guard...

50
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:50,083
the armory for me.

51
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,667
It wasn't easy to get those weapons.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,459
Here.

53
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,167
Eat an apple.

54
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,292
Brother.

55
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:04,667
All this while,

56
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:05,959
you've never once...

57
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,000
peeled an apple for me.

58
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,042
Bu Xun,

59
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,334
I will peel another for you.

60
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:26,501
Zhang Bu Xun.

61
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,825
What's so great about you?

62
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,709
My brother...

63
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,834
keeps you at home like a treasure.

64
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,834
I didn't keep him for nothing.

65
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,959
In the future,

66
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,292
he'll make great contribution.

67
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,792
Him?

68
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:40,501
I don't see it.

69
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,375
Look at him.

70
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:43,375
He doesn't speak,

71
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,626
and is always so complaisant.

72
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,792
What can he contribute?

73
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:49,417
Brother,

74
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,167
we're a family.

75
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm your sister,

76
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,459
he's an outsider,

77
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,876
you know nothing about him.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,709
Why do you side him and bully me?

79
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:12,167
Bu Xun is not an outsider.

80
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,375
Also, Qing Ping.

81
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,334
The most important thing...

82
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,999
in friendship is trust.

83
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,292
I'm sure...

84
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:21,167
your teacher in Beiping
had taught you this.

85
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:22,292
Brother!

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,459
My teacher also taught me...

87
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,667
to be cautious against danger.

88
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,083
I just don't get it.

89
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,501
What can the both of you achieve?

90
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,125
That's means we're doing it right.

91
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,709
That means our approach is right.

92
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:39,250
Here.

93
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:41,918
It's always about you two.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,918
You're both family.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,959
I'm the only outsider!

96
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:47,626
My sister...

97
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:48,667
is always like this.

98
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,042
Don't mind her.

99
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,542
Rong Chang Ren,

100
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:00,501
I've read your letter.

101
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,792
I understand why Mr. Sun...

102
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,209
recommended Yuan,

103
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,334
but I personally don't agree with it.

104
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,918
Yuan is in fact capable and bold,

105
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,709
but his mindset...

106
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,209
is no different from
the conservative folks.

107
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,667
It's hard for me to imagine...

108
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,375
how long the republic system can last.

109
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,542
After all,

110
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,584
it wasn't Mr. Sun's fault.

111
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,709
He just lacked of...

112
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:26,792
weapons and manpower.

113
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,876
Even if the strong countries...

114
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,876
have advanced
technology and civilization,

115
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:33,626
military power is
still what's most crucial.

116
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,000
Regarding the transfer to Beiping,

117
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,209
I think it is not time yet.

118
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,417
We'll talk again.

119
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,292
Gao Yuan.

120
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:10,959
The matter I was investigating...

121
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,292
is proven to be true.

122
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,167
The bandits will enter
the city in two days.

123
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:20,709
Good.

124
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,042
What are our chances of winning?

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,042
It doesn't matter,

126
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,709
this is our best opportunity.

127
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:33,459
You're right.

128
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:13,459
Ready.

129
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:34,667
Fire!

130
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:57,959
Why are you here?

131
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,375
Who asked you to come?

132
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:01,792
What's the matter?

133
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,626
Can't I come here?

134
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:05,584
Besides,

135
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,209
I know what you and my brother...

136
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:08,250
are doing.

137
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,083
Don't worry.

138
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,876
I won't tell my father.

139
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:16,792
My brother is working his tail off...

140
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:18,334
to be successful,

141
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:19,125
I get it.

142
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,584
But you?

143
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,083
You're a scholar
living under his roof,

144
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,417
and have to kill for him.

145
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,292
Are you insane?

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,209
Without the country,
no one can survive.

147
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:32,751
That's it?

148
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:33,709
That's it.

149
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,626
You're such a blockhead.

150
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,209
I've talked so much,

151
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,667
but you just gave me one sentence.

152
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,125
Are you angry?

153
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:46,167
No.

154
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,000
Then, smile for me.

155
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:52,876
Smile!

156
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:55,501
Smile.

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,501
Smiling...

158
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,334
doesn't mean one is happy.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,626
Not smiling...

160
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:02,876
doesn't mean one is sad.

161
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:07,959
So, a blockhead like you may not be...

162
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,959
a blockhead inside.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,459
Right?

164
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:12,375
Right?

165
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:13,209
Right?

166
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,000
You smiled.

167
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,999
My brother and you
defeated the bandits,

168
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,250
that was a great contribution.

169
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,751
Those prisoners and local militia...

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,751
had guns and gunpowder too.

171
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,417
They're considered
an official army too?

172
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,125
Owning guns and gunpowder...

173
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,292
doesn't make them the official army.

174
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:36,959
Then, what else?

175
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,584
They need strategic planning,

176
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:46,334
systematic training,

177
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:48,417
even stricter training
than an official army.

178
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,584
Not only do we capture bandits,

179
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,918
but also traitors,

180
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:52,918
reactionary warlords,

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,501
and so much more.

182
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:01,792
Yes, officer!

183
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:15,834
One!

184
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:18,626
-Two!
-Ready!

185
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,792
-Three!
-Hold tight.

186
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:23,417
-Four!
-Stand firm!

187
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,667
Here, hold your stance.

188
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,209
Raise your arms.

189
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:30,417
Good.

190
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,000
Raise your arms.

191
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:39,834
Assemble!

192
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,709
We all left our homes...

193
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,250
to fight for the renewal
of our nation!

194
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:47,459
Brothers,

195
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:48,334
thank you.

196
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:53,167
It's our duty!

197
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:53,834
Salute!

198
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,584
Fire!

199
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:49,334
Fire!

200
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:34,667
Victory!

201
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,751
I didn't expect...

202
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,626
that someone would
lay a hand on Master...

203
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:44,167
in the middle of the party.

204
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:44,918
Commander,

205
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,999
what should we do?

206
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,167
Is it related to the raw opium?

207
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,083
But back in Yunnan, we had...

208
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:50,792
Shut up!

209
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:53,959
Who the heck are you?

210
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,209
Do you know who I am?

211
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:56,584
I know.

212
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:58,667
You're the son of Cai Heng Yuan.

213
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,584
The Commander of Qianxi.

214
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,209
You sell raw opium,
make profit from war,

215
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:05,000
help the devil with your father.

216
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:07,542
You are Cai Wen Yuan.

217
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,626
It's you.

218
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,292
Where's the raw opium?

219
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,501
Dream on it!

220
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,459
I could use few more bullets on you.

221
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:33,501
If you want to live,

222
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:36,209
don't value money so much.

223
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:38,959
In the warehouse at no. 47.

224
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,459
That's just a part of it.

225
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,250
Where are the others?

226
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:57,792
In...

227
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,292
In the cellar of my house.

228
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:20,501
Bu Xun!

229
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,936
"Cai Manor"

230
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:38,167
Gao Yuan.

231
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:46,209
Bu Xun.

232
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,250
I know you feel unease.

233
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,417
But we're revolting.

234
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,626
During a revolution,
there is always bloodshed...

235
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:55,834
and sacrifice.

236
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:00,584
I know many women
and children are inside.

237
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:02,167
But I have no choice.

238
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,375
I won't allow any mistakes...

239
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,209
in this.

240
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,501
Once there's a mistake...

241
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,751
what about our brothers...

242
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,000
in the army?

243
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:33,626
Bu Xun.

244
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,459
There's something...

245
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,584
that I've always wanted to tell you.

246
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,792
I have a friend in the army.

247
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,083
He's been asking me to go help.

248
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,918
But I thought it wasn't time yet.

249
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,542
But now, I...

250
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:54,999
You want to be an official?

251
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:00,501
If I have a post,

252
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,292
there'd be many benefits.

253
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,375
We could do more things,

254
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:06,042
get to know more people.

255
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,501
Do you know you need
money to be an official?

256
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:10,292
That is why I need the raw opium.

257
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,834
But we're still not sure...

258
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,999
about its origin.

259
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,584
How can we fix this?

260
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,626
I would lay down my life
for my country,

261
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:27,501
what then is risk to me?

262
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,375
We will never succeed
if we don't take risks.

263
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,167
Now,

264
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:40,375
we're wearing our lives
on our sleeves.

265
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:42,459
But,

266
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,834
when we have power in our hands,

267
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,250
We'll be equal...

268
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:49,542
with the bigwigs.

269
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,542
Us.

270
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,167
I'm talking about us.

271
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,000
Then, we can teach them...

272
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:05,542
how to be a good official.

273
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:14,334
See?

274
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,501
I wasn't lying.

275
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:25,834
Bu Xun,

276
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:28,751
half of our dream has come true.

277
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:31,792
You mean,

278
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,417
we're one step closer to our dream.

279
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,667
Yes.

280
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,667
And we'll get even closer to it.

281
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:50,209
I would lay down my life
for my country,

282
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,209
what then is risk for me?

283
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,125
Major cares about the country,

284
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,792
I'll do my best to help him.

285
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:10,792
I see.

286
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:12,999
Some of the writings are blurred.

287
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,334
But they are mostly trivial matters.

288
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:18,999
Like where they fought,

289
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,250
"Lieutenant bought me
Huadiao Wine Chicken",

290
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,918
and something like...

291
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,000
Fog Village?

292
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,667
"I found out...

293
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:31,542
the death-exemption plate was pawned
by a villager from Fog Village.

294
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,375
Colonel was very happy with the news,

295
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,000
so he went to Fog Village
for a closer look."

296
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:42,417
Go! Hurry up! Cut the nonsense!

297
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:44,334
Why are you arresting me?

298
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:45,626
Bugger off!

299
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:49,125
Stand properly!

300
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,584
Don't move!

301
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:10,542
Officer,

302
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,125
I wonder...

303
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,334
what you're looking for?

304
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,542
I heard...

305
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,999
that your people here...

306
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,459
found an ancient tomb.

307
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:22,459
No!

308
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:23,834
That was a lie!

309
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,999
It's just a rumor, officer!

310
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:27,751
Officer!

311
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:33,334
Please stop! I can't take it!

312
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:45,167
Brothers,

313
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,000
there's a hole!

314
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:49,542
Let's go!

315
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,751
Officer, we didn't find any tomb.

316
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:04,417
No!

317
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,626
Chief!

318
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:45,999
I heard that your people...

319
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,459
found an ancient tomb.

320
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,042
Yes,

321
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:50,542
we did.

322
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:55,292
In the ancient tomb,

323
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:56,959
there's a treasure...

324
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,709
which can make people live forever.

325
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:05,417
I said,

326
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,542
your people...

327
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,250
found a treasure in the tomb...

328
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,709
which can make people live forever.

329
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,000
No.

330
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,709
I don't know.

331
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:18,083
You don't know?

332
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,250
Officer.

333
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,375
I swear.

334
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:31,959
Is this what your people...

335
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,292
found in the tomb?

336
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:35,501
Yes.

337
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:36,417
Look.

338
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:38,417
What's written there?

339
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:43,626
Officer.

340
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,250
I'm illiterate.

341
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,375
You're illiterate?

342
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,209
Then does any of you know how to read?

343
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:57,751
Our Chief studied for a year,

344
00:24:58,667 --> 00:24:59,751
he knew the 100 surnames,

345
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:00,584
mathematics.

346
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,751
Then, did you tell anyone else...

347
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:15,626
about the tomb?

348
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:17,626
No, no.

349
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:18,375
No?

350
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,250
It's true.

351
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,501
All of you...

352
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,375
are a bunch of idiots.

353
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:14,459
Did you find it?

354
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,459
Why did you kill them?

355
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:18,876
They were useless.

356
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:22,375
Did you find what I asked?

357
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:28,459
What's wrong?

358
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:29,959
Going soft?

359
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:32,000
Were the lives you took in wars...

360
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,459
any less than this?

361
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,334
But these people are innocent.

362
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,459
They're dead anyways.

363
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:41,417
Gao Yuan.

364
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:46,459
How did you become like this?

365
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,334
You said you wanted to change China,

366
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:52,292
save the people from misery.

367
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:54,999
But look at what you're doing.

368
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:57,751
You massacred the people!

369
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:59,584
Sacrifice must be made for success!

370
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:02,542
Sacrifice is inevitable
to achieve the greater good!

371
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:03,834
This is not sacrifice,

372
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:05,709
it's a massacre!

373
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,999
We're the men with power,

374
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:14,417
we don't have to care
about the lives of a few ants.

375
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,751
Gao Yuan.

376
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:18,667
We're ants, too.

377
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,209
No!

378
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:20,876
I am not an ant.

379
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:22,667
I never was.

380
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,999
What kind of a new country...

381
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,250
do you really envision?

382
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:41,542
Bu Xun.

383
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,292
Don't think about
those useless things anymore.

384
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,834
Complete the missions
that I entrusted to you.

385
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,334
You will help me, won't you?

386
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:08,834
Be careful.

387
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:10,834
Slow down. Give me a hand.

388
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,125
Slow down. There.

389
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:15,501
Here. Together now.

390
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,501
Be careful.

391
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,918
Slow down.

392
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:21,999
Watch the floor.

393
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:24,501
Carry this too.

394
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,501
Wang said...

395
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,667
that Wang Zang Hai...

396
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:39,167
found the secret of immortality here.

397
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,792
Listen up!

398
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:43,918
Even if you turn this place
upside down,

399
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,083
you must find it.

400
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,000
Those misleading rumors...

401
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,626
have wasted...

402
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:51,959
too much of our time.

403
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,125
Since it's a rumor,

404
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,959
then it could be true.

405
00:28:58,542 --> 00:28:59,542
Emperor Qin Shi Huang...

406
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:02,626
ruled over 6 countries
and pacified the world.

407
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,000
Until now, no one could surpass...

408
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:06,999
his spectacular achievements.

409
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,125
But, at the end,

410
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:10,834
he was obsessed with alchemy,

411
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,459
hankered for immortality,

412
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,459
and ended up a laughingstock.

413
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:16,918
Gao Yuan.

414
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,125
Can't we focus solely on the wars?

415
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:21,626
Don't think about
those unrealistic things.

416
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:23,667
If immortality had been real,

417
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,501
Wang Zang Hai would've been immortal!

418
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,167
How do you know he isn't immortal?

419
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,250
Will an immortal...

420
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,459
stay at the same place forever?

421
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:35,626
Would he wander around...

422
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,999
the people who know him?

423
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:39,000
But I've searched for so long,

424
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:41,876
and there's nothing.

425
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:43,417
Good things...

426
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:45,918
are never found so easily.

427
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:47,876
The better it is,

428
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:49,626
the more hidden it is.

429
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,501
This place...

430
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,042
definitely has Wang Zang Hai's
immortality spell.

431
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:03,334
Bu Xun.

432
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:05,083
Think about it.

433
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,459
If we can both be immortal,

434
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,042
won't we achieve...

435
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,334
all of our ambitions?

436
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:14,459
Gao Yuan.

437
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:16,834
If you want to be a president,
I can help you!

438
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:17,709
If I'm a president,

439
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,375
you'd be the general!

440
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,083
With your help,

441
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,125
I'll always be at ease.

442
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:32,167
Gao Yuan,

443
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,209
can you please listen to me?

444
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,375
Enough.

445
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:37,542
Bu Xun.

446
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,292
We shouldn't...

447
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:40,626
argue anymore.

448
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:42,959
Gao Yuan.

449
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:44,709
But we're searching for something...

450
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:45,751
that doesn't even exist,

451
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:47,459
that's pointless!

452
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,959
You don't want to help me anymore?

453
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,542
Our priority should be to save
the country and the people.

454
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:57,042
Have you forgotten our ambition?

455
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:05,959
How could I...

456
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,375
forget our ambition?

457
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,250
Seeking for immortality...

458
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,125
doesn't go against...

459
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,167
our ambition.

460
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,334
Gao Yuan!

461
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:15,792
We need both to save...

462
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,167
the country and people.

463
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,083
Think about it.

464
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:21,792
One day, if both of us die,

465
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:23,626
then who'd save the country?

466
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,209
Who'd achieve...

467
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:26,125
our ambition?

468
00:31:29,918 --> 00:31:30,584
Gao Yuan.

469
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,751
Can we give those villagers...

470
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:35,999
a proper burial?

471
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:41,501
You take care of it.

472
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:14,167
Lieutenant!

473
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:17,334
Lieutenant!

474
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:18,667
There's another level below.

475
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,584
We found a trapdoor.

476
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:21,918
This chamber has two levels.

477
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:28,999
Lieutenant, look.

478
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,542
The layout here completely differs
from the upper level.

479
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,834
The upper level
should be for sacrificial,

480
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,959
while this should be the main chamber.

481
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:38,209
This time,

482
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:39,999
we'll surely find
what the General wants.

483
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,584
He said that...

484
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,959
once we complete this mission,

485
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:45,083
we'll never do such shady deals again.

486
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,709
Don't inform the General yet.

487
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:48,999
I'll tell him after we find it.

488
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:50,459
Let our brothers...

489
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:52,125
bury the caskets first.

490
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:53,209
Go on.

491
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:54,375
Yes, sir.

492
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,751
The stone casket is huge.

493
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:13,667
Look at that.

494
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:16,125
Look.

495
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:17,918
What are these?

496
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:18,918
Don't touch it.

497
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,709
Be careful.

498
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:36,501
Don't move!

499
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,292
What's going on?

500
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:47,459
What's happening?

501
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,000
Fruits!

502
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,292
Fruits!

503
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:40,918
I want one too!

504
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:42,083
Delicious!

505
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,542
Delicious! It's so sweet!

506
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:51,250
Officer,

507
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,209
have a fruit.

508
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:01,542
It's so delicious.

509
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,417
It's so sweet. This fruit is so sweet.

510
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:14,834
It's so good.

511
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:18,999
I want one more.

512
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,417
I'll take one more!

513
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:47,125
Xiao Fang!

514
00:35:58,584 --> 00:35:59,167
Lieutenant!

515
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:03,751
Stay away!

516
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:15,375
What's with them?

517
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:16,876
They've been poisoned.

518
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:22,584
Tell the others to take weapons
and back me up.

519
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:23,334
Go!

520
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:24,250
What about you?

521
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:24,834
Hurry up!

522
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,999
You must be careful!

523
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,584
Lieutenant!

524
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:19,501
What's going on?

525
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:21,792
What happened?

526
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:23,999
Lieutenant!

527
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:26,876
Watch out.

528
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:31,751
They're all dead.

529
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:33,709
Lieutenant!

530
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:35,667
Lieutenant!

531
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,876
You brought an entire unit with you,

532
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:52,584
but now you say you can't find it.

533
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:55,292
We searched all over.

534
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,542
But we couldn't find him.

535
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:02,292
Where could he go?

536
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:04,083
I don't know.

537
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,792
I just went up to pick up some guns.

538
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,626
When I got there, Lieutenant...

539
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,334
and the monsters were gone.

540
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,292
How could you...

541
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,626
leave him there alone?

542
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:42,083
Are you purposely hiding it from me...

543
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:47,375
so that he can find that thing
on his own?

544
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:48,626
General.

545
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,999
We both saw them
turn into monsters with our own eyes!

546
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,792
Immortality doesn't exist!

547
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:05,167
Let me tell you.

548
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:08,876
If I find out...

549
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:11,584
that he had left with those things,

550
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:15,417
all of you...

551
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,459
I mean, all of you...

552
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,042
will die.

553
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:29,709
Dou Cheng.

554
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:33,709
Lieutenant.

555
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:35,709
You're alive?

556
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:36,999
Dou Cheng.

557
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:41,417
Go.

558
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:48,000
Gao Yuan.

559
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,542
You scared me.

560
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,292
Where have you been?

561
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,250
What exactly happened?

562
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,792
We found the main chamber.

563
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:07,375
All our brothers...

564
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:09,417
suffered hallucinations.

565
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:11,751
They saw many trees,

566
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:14,125
which were full of fruits.

567
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,709
But what they ate...

568
00:41:18,334 --> 00:41:20,626
was the thousand-year-old corpse
in the casket.

569
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:26,876
The immortality spell was a fraud.

570
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,125
Gao Yuan.

571
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:46,250
I almost died.

572
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:48,083
Why would I lie to you?

573
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,209
Aren't you standing...

574
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:54,417
right in front of me now?

Dou Cheng said
he searched all over for you.

576
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:00,542
Where did you hide?

577
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:03,626
I really don't remember a thing.

578
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:05,459
I only remember...

579
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,751
that I came here once I woke up.

580
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:25,626
Bu Xun.

581
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,626
The immortality spell...

582
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,542
is a rare find.

583
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:31,542
Whoever sees it...

584
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:34,083
can never resist it.
