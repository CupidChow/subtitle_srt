"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:07,193
"Episode 6"

3
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:08,918
Perhaps...

4
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:11,545
after he escaped,

5
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:13,000
Xie Lian Huan was
looking for your uncle.

6
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:14,918
But your uncle...

7
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,125
killed him.

8
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:19,626
This may be the reason why...

9
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,125
Xie Lian Huan died on the reef.

10
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:22,918
But there's another possibility,

11
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,542
that is his death was an accident.

12
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,083
After all, when he was found,

13
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,834
his oxygen tank wasn't there.

14
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:31,000
If that's the case,

15
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:33,167
why did Uncle San Xing
take you to the tomb again?

16
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,584
When the body of Xie Lian Huan
was brought back by ship,

17
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,959
we were left with some rubber boats.

18
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:41,918
We completed most of our tasks...

19
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,751
on this reef.

20
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:45,334
But little did we know...

21
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,125
that there would be a storm.

22
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,792
The only way to survive...

23
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:51,375
was to hide in the underwater
tomb which contains air,

24
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,250
and wait for the storm to pass.

25
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,918
But your uncle's plan
was totally changed too.

26
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,083
This was also why...

27
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,334
your uncle sneakily led us...

28
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,751
into the chamber with the
model of Heavenly Palace.

29
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,250
Then, knocked us out...

30
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:03,542
in the passage.

31
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,000
As for what happened next,

32
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,167
I do not know.

33
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:07,876
But I'm pretty sure that...

34
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,959
if these people are still alive,

35
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,292
they would have lost their memories...

36
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,334
like I did.

37
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,751
But why didn't Uncle San Xing
just kill all of you,

38
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:17,709
and end everything?

39
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:19,667
I have no idea.

40
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,042
You're assuming...

41
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:29,042
Uncle San Xing as a
scheming and plotting monster.

42
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,792
But he's not.

43
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,125
He was just a young man with
little life experience back then.

44
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,042
Furthermore, Chen Wen Jin
was in the team too.

45
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,501
He wouldn't harm her.

46
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,709
Something must be
wrong with your memory.

47
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,042
I'm sure that...

48
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:41,626
your hypothesis is wrong.

49
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,876
What an idiot.

50
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,501
You removed your mask without
even testing for oxygen here.

51
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:52,959
If this was a stuffy cave,

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,667
you would be dead.

53
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,125
But I'm fine, aren't I?

54
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,209
I can't believe there's air...

55
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,501
in the underwater.

56
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,209
This sure is amazing.

57
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,709
How come there's only so little left?

58
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,209
Xie Lian Huan.

59
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:31,834
Xie Lian Huan!

60
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,042
What happened?

61
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,999
San Xing, look. Look at this!

62
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,667
This should be the
coffin of the tomb owner.

63
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,209
I wonder who lies in it.

64
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:22,709
This is just a human figure.

65
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:23,918
Xie Lian Huan,

66
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,083
you coward.

67
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,042
Human figure?

68
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,250
I was scared to death!

69
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,999
But this human figure...

70
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,751
looks so weird.

71
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,834
It looks like it was
screaming while being tortured.

72
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:01,834
San Xing,

73
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,584
this is a metal coffin.

74
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,042
This hole extends to the
interior of the coffin, I guess.

75
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,292
This is a Whistle Coffin.

76
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,459
What?

77
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,250
It was sealed with metal
and contains a hole.

78
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,125
It is definitely a Whistle Coffin.

79
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,876
So, something terrible must be inside.

80
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,542
It may even be a zombie or a demon.

81
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,125
That is why it was sealed with
molten iron from the outside,

82
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,542
with nothing but an opening.

83
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,417
Allowing someone skillful to...

84
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,709
reach for the treasure inside.

85
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:42,083
If his hand was bitten
by the thing inside,

86
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,292
he must cut his arm
off from the outside.

87
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,542
Well, that's an interesting story.

88
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:47,751
But this is impossible.

89
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,292
This is something handed
down by our ancestors.

90
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:50,709
There must be a reason behind it.

91
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,209
San Xing,

92
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:56,876
aren't you curious about...

93
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,334
the thing inside?

94
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,626
Let's go back...

95
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,751
to get the black donkey
hoof and some candles,

96
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:02,709
and return tomorrow.

97
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,667
The coffin won't run away.

98
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:05,417
No need to rush.

99
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,459
You'd better just look at it.

100
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:13,209
Don't touch it.

101
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:16,083
I'm going there.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,834
What should I do?

103
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,834
What is going on?

104
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:50,542
San Xing,

105
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:53,334
I just threw a burning kindling
inside to take a clearer look.

106
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,709
I didn't expect this to happen!

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,584
Are you insane?

108
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,542
Where did you learn
this cheap trick from?

109
00:07:58,584 --> 00:07:59,834
It didn't even work!

110
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:04,667
Under a dry condition,
the clothes on the corpse will burn,

111
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,083
let alone the body itself!

112
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,375
Can you use your brain?

113
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,083
San Xing, stop scolding me!

114
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,417
Let's put out the fire first!

115
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,209
You're really a trouble maker!

116
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,125
Why are you standing there?

117
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,167
Get some water!

118
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:19,834
Water.

119
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:20,417
Right!

120
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,000
Water.

121
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,209
I found it, I found it.

122
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,083
San Xing, calm down.

123
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:24,834
The water's here.

124
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:25,918
Here, pour it.

125
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,042
You brought wine instead of
water when raiding a tomb?

126
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,375
Are you out of your mind?

127
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:39,667
Water.

128
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,999
Where can I find water?

129
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:45,250
Give it to me!

130
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,417
I'll deal with you later!

131
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,792
You brat.

132
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,334
What should I do?

133
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,709
Are you crazy?

134
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,834
It's out, it's out.

135
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,334
The fire's out.

136
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:08,042
Ghost whistling in a Whistle Coffin.

137
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,375
It's ominous.

138
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,918
You set it on fire,

139
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,292
and then peed on it.

140
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,000
You're now officially its enemy.

141
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,167
San Xing, please don't scare me.

142
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,501
Demons and zombies...

143
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:21,667
are just creepy bluffs.

144
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:24,417
This is nothing but a coffin...

145
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:25,626
with a funny design.

146
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:26,999
Maybe the tomb owner...

147
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,083
was an artist.

148
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,876
He designed the coffin
like this on purpose.

149
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:33,042
Never mind.

150
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,042
What's done is done anyway.

151
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:36,584
But nothing happened.

152
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,459
Maybe it's an empty coffin.

153
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:39,999
Consider yourself lucky.

154
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:47,876
San Xing,

155
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:49,834
isn't that gross?

156
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,292
You want to talk
about hygiene in a tomb?

157
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,083
Just go home then.

158
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,209
What did you feel?

159
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:00,792
A ring!

160
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,667
It's a jade weight on its tongue.

161
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,209
-It won't burn easily!
-Really?

162
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,167
Take it out then!

163
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:07,792
Come on.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,834
Take it, quick.

165
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:12,250
Oh, no!

166
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:13,334
It's a trap!

167
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:14,667
Stay there, Xie Lian Huan!

168
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,334
Don't you move!

169
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:18,792
I'll take a look.

170
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:19,876
Don't go anywhere.

171
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:20,959
Stay there.

172
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,959
San Xing, come back
as soon as you can!

173
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:07,292
I'm guessing...

174
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,999
your uncle had summoned...

175
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,584
something evil in the tomb.

176
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:12,751
When you see him after this,

177
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,626
splash him with black dog blood,

178
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:15,876
and get rid of that thing.

179
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:16,584
He'll be okay.

180
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,209
That's impossible,
such things don't exist.

181
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,667
Says who?

182
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:24,042
Didn't you notice that your uncle
loves combing hair like a woman?

183
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:24,626
Cut it out.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,792
That's nonsense.

185
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:29,751
What trap is this?

186
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,584
How can it still move
with all this rust?

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,834
Lian Huan.

188
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:40,751
Xie Lian Huan.

189
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:15,250
Lian Huan!

190
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:18,876
Lian Huan.

191
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,751
Lian Huan, Lian Huan!

192
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,751
Lian Huan, Lian Huan!

193
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:54,792
Come out!

194
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,501
Show yourself if you dare!

195
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,459
Come out!

196
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:40,792
That wretch!

197
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,542
I'm not afraid!

198
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:14,042
Either live free or die hard.

199
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm not afraid to die at all!

200
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,709
There's not enough oxygen...

201
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,501
till we resurface.

202
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,999
But my stamina is better than yours.

203
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,209
Maybe I can get out alive.

204
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:47,918
As soon as I get out of here,

205
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,125
I'll send people for you right away.

206
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:51,542
But if I fail,

207
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll stay in the water as fish food.

208
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:58,999
And you...

209
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,876
You can rest in the tomb.

210
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,167
Wait for me.

211
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,584
Fine.

212
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:30,459
I know that...

213
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,209
you might see...

214
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:33,876
Uncle San Xing as a monster.

215
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,918
But he's actually a simple man.

216
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,876
Maybe a little boastful.

217
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,417
He was quite
unreliable as a young man.

218
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:41,209
Let me tell you.

219
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,375
One time, when I was little,

220
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,334
Uncle San Xing wanted to take me out.

221
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,250
But suddenly,
his friend asked him out.

222
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,501
He wanted to go,
but was worried that I'd get lost.

223
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,584
So, he tied me on a tree.

224
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:52,999
And I got a heat stroke then.

225
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,083
Guess what happened next?

226
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,876
My grandpa beat
him up and chased him...

227
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,250
all the way down the street.

228
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,751
But all of a sudden,

229
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:04,834
Uncle San Xing became mature.

230
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,501
The time he spent at home...

231
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:08,834
had become less,

232
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,918
so did the time he spent with us.

233
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,250
But I always believed that...

234
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,876
Uncle San Xing...

235
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,209
was still the same as
when he was young.

236
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:21,292
He didn't change.

237
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:25,626
Don't worry.

238
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:27,792
When I find him,

239
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,959
I'll ask him myself...

240
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:31,459
and give you both an answer.

241
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,459
Do you feel itchy?

242
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,334
Do you feel itchy or not?

243
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,292
-You're still feeling itchy?
-Since just now...

244
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,584
Yes, I've been feeling
itchy since just now.

245
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,417
Did you sweat on the wound?

246
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:46,167
Don't touch it, or it'll get infected.

247
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:47,584
Have you had enough rest?

248
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,042
Let's go.

249
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:56,667
Wait for me.

250
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:38,709
Oh no, hang on.

251
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:39,709
Stop.

252
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:42,292
I'm so itchy, it's getting itchier.

253
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,167
Is it because you
hadn't bathed for days?

254
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,083
What? Hey.

255
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,792
It's the area that had
contact with the lotus arrows.

256
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,709
-Let me take a look.
-Sure.

257
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:54,959
How is it?

258
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,709
Fatty, this is serious.

259
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,292
I'm not lying.

260
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:03,959
It has gone moldy.

261
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,626
White mold.

262
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,584
Lingzhi might even grow on it.

263
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:09,834
White mold?
Lingzhi? What the heck?

264
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,083
This is troublesome.

265
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:14,959
There's something
with those lotus arrows.

266
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,167
I was shot too.

267
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,542
And I also felt itchy
at the side chamber.

268
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,375
But I was fine after a while.

269
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,167
I wondered why too.

270
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:25,584
Hey, what are you doing?

271
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:26,250
What's going on?

272
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:27,667
Do something about it!

273
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:28,125
This...

274
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:29,417
This is too itchy.

275
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,918
You might as well skin me off!

276
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,876
Hurry up!

277
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,417
I heard that some
even killed themselves...

278
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:34,918
after they were shot by these arrows.

279
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:35,876
Dummy Zhang,

280
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,334
are you making fun of me now?

281
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:38,876
Hurry up and figure something out!

282
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:41,792
What, now?

283
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,083
Do something!

284
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,250
Look at it!

285
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,292
Okay, Fatty.

286
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,542
I'll stop teasing you.

287
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:48,999
The truth is,

288
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,000
I know how to deal with this.

289
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,125
Just apply lotion.

290
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,000
You city folks are such princesses.

291
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,542
We're raiding a tomb,
but you brought...

292
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,876
Lotion?

293
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,292
You might as well bring along
poker cards and start playing here.

294
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,667
Blow on it, quick!

295
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:11,959
Quit whining.

296
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:12,834
Blow yourself.

297
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,167
-It really hurts.
-Don't be so delicate.

298
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:15,334
Just endure it.

299
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,125
What did you apply on my skin?

300
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:20,709
-I'm all fine now.
-Let's go.

301
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,292
Wait a minute!

302
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,292
What's the brand of your lotion?

303
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,792
I want to get some online too.

304
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,083
-I'm not telling you.
-I want some too!

305
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,792
This is incredible.

306
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,250
Promote physical culture.

307
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,125
Strengthen the people's body.

308
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,792
Avoid getting beaten.

309
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,667
Do exercises.

310
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:31,459
Strengthen the people's body.

311
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,751
Do exercises.

312
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,334
Protect the country.

313
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,751
Strengthen the people's body.

314
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,834
Do exercises.

315
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,375
Build those muscles.

316
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,959
Avoid getting beaten.

317
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,125
Move.

318
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,501
Why is it so wet here?

319
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:58,167
It's fragrant.

320
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:10,876
Quiet.

321
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,000
Who are you?

322
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:09,751
Please embrace me.

323
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,918
I told you to keep quiet.

324
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,375
Didn't you see that?

325
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,209
There was something!

326
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,751
I only caught a
glimpse of a black shadow.

327
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,667
It was too quick,

328
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:04,709
I couldn't see it clearly.

329
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:05,417
Calm down.

330
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,542
Speak slowly. What was it?

331
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:07,417
A woman.

332
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:08,667
She strangled me with her hair.

333
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,667
-She wanted to kiss me!
-Are you in heat?

334
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:11,959
You still have time
for wet dreams now?

335
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,250
It was not a dream!

336
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:15,250
See.

337
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:16,292
It's so wet!

338
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,042
Isn't that sweat?

339
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,751
Can you sweat this much?

340
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,000
Enough, stop fooling around.

341
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,083
If there were something,

342
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,083
it would pass by me too.

343
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:24,125
I would've seen it.

344
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:25,083
But I didn't.

345
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,083
A woman, you said?

346
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:47,334
Do you have fire?

347
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:48,667
It's afraid of fire.

348
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:49,250
I do.

349
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:10,542
Fatty!

350
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:14,083
Fatty! Fatty, get up.

351
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,209
Fatty, are you all right?

352
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,000
Get up!

353
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:26,999
-Are you all right?
-I couldn't breathe.

354
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,334
I almost choked to death.

355
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:28,792
It's okay now.

356
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,042
I nearly passed out.

357
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:31,709
Luckily you're fine.

358
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,250
Or it'll be difficult for me.

359
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:34,209
About what?

360
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,417
I almost had to give you
a mouth to mouth!

361
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,125
Get lost!

362
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:38,918
What was that?

363
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:40,167
A Forbidden Maiden.

364
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,292
Forbidden Maiden?

365
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,780
Rumors really don't
arise out of thin air.

366
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,180
There's proof to it too.

367
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,042
What exactly...

368
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:49,626
is a Forbidden Maiden?

369
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:51,542
Forbidden Maiden...

370
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:53,709
seems to be a poisonous
jellyfish with hairlike tentacles.

371
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,209
When it touches a human,

372
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:56,876
he'll see illusions.

373
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,999
Luckily we had fire.

374
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,209
Bah!

375
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,501
She almost tarnished my chastity!

376
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:04,834
Do you think I'm easy meat?

377
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:06,292
Screw it.

378
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,584
Be it Forbidden Maiden or Sea Monkey,

379
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,834
I think the tomb owner
purposely placed them here.

380
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:12,250
Perhaps they have great longevity,

381
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,375
and have been guarding the tomb.

382
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:18,667
Let's get going if you're fine.

383
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,250
Don't stay here.

384
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,167
Let's get out of here.

385
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,501
Or the Forbidden Maiden will be back.

386
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:24,999
Hold on.

387
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,042
-There was a sound...
-What, now?

388
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,167
before the Forbidden Maiden showed up.

389
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:29,501
But it's gone now.

390
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,542
Maybe it was caused by
the Forbidden Maiden.

391
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,125
No way.

392
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:34,501
She can't make any sounds.

393
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:35,501
Moreover,

394
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:36,834
it was led by its hair.

395
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,834
It doesn't need to walk.

396
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,042
Stop talking about
the hair, seriously.

397
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:41,834
When you do,

398
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:44,125
I can feel it in my throat.

399
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:08,042
Well, why did Xie Lian Huan do this?
What was on his mind?

400
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,626
Why was he so tricky?

401
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,792
The passage is way too complicated.

402
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,999
He wasn't being tricky.

403
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,626
This place leads to the tomb wall.

404
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,042
And beyond the wall is the sea.

405
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:18,042
If it's opened up,
sea water will gush in.

406
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:20,417
So, he could only change
directions and go upwards.

407
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,751
He also wanted to get out...

408
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,167
from the roof like me?

409
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,375
Great minds think alike, don't we?

410
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,250
But the three of us
should be luckier than him.

411
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,209
If he could leave here alone,

412
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:34,250
then the three of us
sure can do that too.

413
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,709
But he died after he was out,

414
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:37,459
and we wouldn't.

415
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,125
Right?

416
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:42,999
I still don't believe...

417
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,334
that Uncle San Xing would hurt him.

418
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:48,292
You're such a good nephew.

419
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:12,918
It's a dead end.

420
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:47,918
I found the exit!

421
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:48,959
Come here quickly.

422
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:50,417
Wu Xie!

423
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:53,876
Wu Xie!

424
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:19,751
Not bad, Dummy Zhang.

425
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,125
You were pretty okay.

426
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,083
But if it weren't for me,

427
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,250
can you defeat it so easily?

428
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:26,999
We get it.

429
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,834
But Stuffy is a great fighter.

430
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:29,876
Was I not good?

431
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:30,792
Was I not?

432
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:31,918
Was he better?

433
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:33,501
Do you know what's outwitting?

434
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:35,751
We were working together as a team.

435
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,459
Everyone was vital.

436
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:39,501
Could this be...

437
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,167
the chamber...

438
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:42,709
that has the model of Sky Palace?

439
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:43,501
Fatty,

440
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:44,918
we're at the top of
the underwater tomb!

441
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:54,876
The Luminous Pearl.

442
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:12,459
Oh my god.

443
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:16,042
This Sky Palace is really magnificent.

444
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:18,292
It's as beautiful as
the Forbidden City.

445
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:19,250
Fatty,

446
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,834
take a look here, quick!

447
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,667
What's so great about a model?

448
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:24,501
When we're out of here,
I can buy for you online...

449
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:26,417
the models of
airplanes, cannons, tanks,

450
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,292
aliens and many more.

451
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:29,834
Are they even comparable?

452
00:34:31,584 --> 00:34:35,626
Could Sky Palace really exist?

453
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,667
Little Master,

454
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,083
what are you looking for?

455
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:51,167
I think someone's watching us.

456
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,083
Could the Sea Monkey be a pack animal?

457
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:58,501
Like when we killed one,

458
00:34:58,626 --> 00:35:01,375
and all its families and relatives...

459
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:02,542
would seek revenge on us?

460
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,667
Stop it.

461
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,042
If you keep on talking,
they might come for real.

462
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:14,709
Who knows.

463
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:35,375
Little Master,

464
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:38,751
could this meditating mummy...

465
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,250
be the tomb owner,

466
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:41,375
Wang Zang Hai?

467
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't know.

468
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,459
Was Wang Zang Hai a monk?

469
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,501
Can you read more
during your free time?

470
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:52,000
Wang Zang Hai had never became a monk,

471
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,542
but he was quite
knowledgeable in Taoism,

472
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,959
and a great feng shui master.

473
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:59,125
Then, that isn't Wang Zang Hai.

474
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,751
Taoist priests believe
in soul transcendence.

475
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:03,918
Only a monk will leave behind his
body to be worshipped by others.

476
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:05,667
There's always an exception.

477
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:06,959
Actually,

478
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,584
many meditating mummies
found historically were man-made.

479
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,209
Like the making of Egyptian mummies.

480
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,042
With some techniques,
skills and medicine,

481
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,334
the bodies were preserved.

482
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,751
They even had similar
characteristics to marble,

483
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:20,542
with minimal decay.

484
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:21,667
Then, Wang Zang Hai...

485
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:23,709
brought this to himself.

486
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,042
He made himself into a sample.

487
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,000
Did he think he could be like Pharaoh,

488
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,000
resurrecting from
dead using his body?

489
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:30,751
People achieved self-mummification...

490
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,792
because they feared death
and wished for an eternal life.

491
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,626
Was Wang Zang Hai the same?

492
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,792
Judging from the structure,

493
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,626
this should be the main chamber.

494
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:55,918
But there's not even a single coffin.

495
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:59,292
Did he regard the Sky Palace...

496
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:00,542
as his coffin?

497
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,375
If that's true,

498
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:03,834
then this is Wang Zang Hai.

499
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,292
But in my opinion,

500
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:12,626
a man who made the Sky Palace...

501
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,999
would not...

502
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:15,918
want to be hidden in
an underwater tomb.

503
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:18,000
Why are you so stubborn?

504
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:20,375
The name isn't written on its face.

505
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,792
This is a body from centuries ago.
Let's have fun guessing.

506
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:24,167
Who cares about its identity.

507
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:01,167
Sir,

508
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,042
Wu Xie has arrived
in the main chamber,

509
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,292
and saw the model of the Sky Palace.

510
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,417
He's worthy to be a
descendant of Wu family.

511
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:11,542
Wu Xie looks like
an ordinary person...

512
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,667
with a little bit of intelligence.

513
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,375
There are a lot of strange things
in the tombs of the ocean.

514
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:19,542
Forbidden Maiden and Sea Monkey.

515
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:21,417
But he seems to have managed it.

516
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:23,292
He's helped by experts.

517
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:25,792
If the experts lent their help,

518
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:27,292
that means he's capable.

519
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,292
They don't take him as a fool.

520
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,083
Well, with that in mind,

521
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,417
I think we can go a step further.

522
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:35,083
Sir,

523
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:38,334
are you sure that
Wu San Xing will care for Wu Xie?

524
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:39,709
He's nothing...

525
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,459
but ambitious,

526
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,999
someone who won't stop for anyone.

527
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:48,250
Chinese people are most
particular about inheritance.

528
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:51,167
There are 3 brothers in Wu family.

529
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:52,375
Only...

530
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:56,792
Yi Qiong is married with kid.

531
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,250
Neither of Wu San Xing...

532
00:38:59,918 --> 00:39:02,667
and Er Bai did.

533
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:06,542
Wu Xie is very important for the
family. I don't believe San Xing...

534
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:09,751
would let him take risks easily.

535
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:13,042
Once we led him in,
San Xing will stay put.

536
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:14,959
And everything will
start to go all right with him.

537
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:18,834
And he will cooperate with us then.

538
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,501
Although,

539
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:25,626
if he should leave Wu Xie to die,

540
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:28,501
he will earn my respect.

541
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:29,209
Sir,

542
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:31,667
I didn't find any copper fish.

543
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm not surprised.

544
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:34,876
With the wisdom of Wang Zang Hai,

545
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:37,542
he wouldn't put all
the things together.

546
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,542
But he built too many tombs.

547
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,542
We do not know which one...

548
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,667
the other 2 copper fishes are in.

549
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,375
I got an idea.

550
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:46,292
Don't worry.

551
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:49,501
We've collected enough information
about the tombs of the ocean.

552
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:51,501
Anything else would be excessive.

553
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:53,876
Your mission is Wu Xie.

554
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:57,751
Yes, sir.

555
00:39:58,167 --> 00:39:58,918
Watch out!

556
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:13,083
Stuffy,

557
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:16,334
the Changbai Mountain is painted here.

558
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,876
The painting is hardly visible.

559
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:19,876
How can you tell?

560
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,334
The highest peaks of
Changbai Mountain are very special.

561
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:24,709
Any educated person can tell.

562
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:27,584
Look.

563
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:30,167
The clothes of the
grievers look strange.

564
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:31,542
I can't tell which
dynasty they're from.

565
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:33,000
They look like a
minority group though.

566
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:35,375
With only their clothing,

567
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,083
I can't tell from which
dynasty the Sky Palace was built.

568
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:38,292
It's Ming dynasty.

569
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:40,501
Wang Zang Hai was from Ming dynasty.

570
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:42,876
Well, can the Sky Palace he built
belong to another dynasty?

571
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:45,501
Not bad, Fatty.

572
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:46,626
You're indeed an expert.

573
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:47,584
I told you.

574
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:48,918
You book worms,

575
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:51,375
you only know about
those stupid theories.

576
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:53,459
A bunch of unnecessary crap.

577
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,876
Putting it into practice
works the best, get it?

578
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,375
Yes. You're always right.

579
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:00,542
But Fatty,

580
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:01,918
did you notice...

581
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,375
the grievers are all females?

582
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:07,792
You're right.

583
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:09,292
What is this custom?

584
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,250
I don't know either.

585
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,334
Could all the male members...

586
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,584
in the dead person's
family have been dead?

587
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:18,667
That's pitiful.

588
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:22,501
Even more pitiful than the
Yang Warrior Women.

589
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:26,667
Guys, look.

590
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:30,000
The painting is quite informative.

591
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,083
Now that we have these clues,

592
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:32,417
we can go to Changbai Mountain...

593
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,751
and ask someone
who's familiar with the place.

594
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,209
I'm sure we'll get the exact
location of the Sky Palace.

595
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,334
But...

596
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:39,501
the palace is buried under
the centuries-old Snow Mountain.

597
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:40,918
And frozen soil is very soft.

598
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,959
One mistake from us and
there'll be an avalanche.

599
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,542
So, it's almost impossible...

600
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,250
to dig the Sky Palace out.

601
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:47,709
Well,

602
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,501
this is what archeologists do.

603
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:51,626
If you're afraid to get sweaty,

604
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:55,459
you're not a real archeologist.

605
00:41:55,876 --> 00:41:56,501
You?

606
00:41:56,918 --> 00:41:57,542
Doing archeology?

607
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:58,709
Little comrade,

608
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:00,626
don't look down upon us,

609
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:02,709
the wild archeologists.

610
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:04,999
We've also contributed...

611
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,375
to the archeological field.

612
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:07,792
In order to protect the relics,

613
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:11,292
we worked our tails
off and risk our lives.

614
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:13,209
Fatty,

615
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,375
tomb raiding is not doing archeology.

616
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:18,000
With you working your tail off,

617
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,375
it's a miracle that the field of
archeology in China can develop!

618
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,834
Mister-always-right.

619
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:23,876
Don't do that now.

620
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,959
But don't you want to
see it with your own eyes?

621
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:28,459
I do.

622
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:29,334
Okay, then!

623
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,542
Let's figure a way out,

624
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,375
and go there together.

625
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:33,375
No.

626
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:36,709
Only I will stay with a
heartless person like you.

627
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,751
Others would've left
and ignored you already.

628
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,792
This is such an amazing place.

629
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:41,999
Don't you want to go?

630
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,334
You won't get another chance.

631
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:44,876
For now,

632
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,375
I have to stop being curious.

633
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:49,999
As Uncle San Xing is
still nowhere to be found.

634
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:57,542
Pretentious little guy.

635
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:03,209
Stuffy.
