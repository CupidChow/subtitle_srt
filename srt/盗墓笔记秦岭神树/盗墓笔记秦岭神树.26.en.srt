00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,920
"Episode 26"

3
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,983
Mother.

4
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:27,358
Lao Yang,

5
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:28,734
is that you?

6
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:33,525
Yes!

7
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:34,484
It's me!

8
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:35,692
Have you found the exit?

9
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,233
No, I haven't.

10
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,442
I'm moving the rocks now...

11
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:39,358
and going in there.

12
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:40,525
Wu Xie,

13
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,150
did you find something?

14
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:43,983
I've found a pile of bones...

15
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,275
and his belongings.

16
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:46,983
Anything else?

17
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,734
There's a diary inside.

18
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,025
It says he came into the mountain..

19
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:53,901
with his companion...

20
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,192
three years ago.

21
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,233
But apparently his companion...

22
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,150
had buried the hole with dynamite...

23
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,650
and starved him to death.

24
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:08,525
Lao Yang.

25
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,484
Keep moving the rocks.

26
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:11,983
I'll see if...

27
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:12,817
there are other clues.

28
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:14,066
I'll help you in a while.

29
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,817
Xie Zi Yang.

30
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:01,775
Lao Yang.

31
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:03,775
Was there a student...

32
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,275
called Xie Zi Yang in our class?

33
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,400
I think there was.

34
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:19,734
You're here.

35
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:38,609
Lao Yang.

36
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,775
Isn't this your identity card?

37
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,275
Why is it with him?

38
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:48,484
Do you know him?

39
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,400
Who is he?

40
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:52,525
Wu Xie,

41
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,025
Certain things are best...

42
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,108
left unknown.

43
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,692
He was Xie Zi Yang.

44
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:06,817
He was Lao Yang.

45
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,066
Then, who are you?

46
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:17,609
Tell me.

47
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,982
I'm both Xie Zi Yang...

48
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,901
and Lao Yang.

49
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:24,400
How could this happen?

50
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,108
Have you lost it?

51
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:28,817
No, I'm fine.

52
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:30,734
It was me who killed myself.

53
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,609
I killed myself!

54
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:33,442
Impossible!

55
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:35,025
Lao Yang!

56
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:41,192
Well.

57
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,609
I don't care if you're Lao Yang now.

58
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:48,609
You've hidden so much from me.

59
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:50,901
You pretended to be Mr.Wang,

60
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:52,901
now you're telling me
you killed yourself!

61
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:56,775
What exactly do you want?

62
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,317
Why on earth did you do all this?

63
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,233
It's simple!

64
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:03,567
I didn't want another "me"...

65
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,233
to exist in this world,

66
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:07,609
so I killed him.

67
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,692
Now that you know,

68
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:13,734
you can't live.

69
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:28,275
Don't move!

70
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,859
Lao Yang.

71
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:44,233
I came all this way for you.

72
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:46,817
I promised to take you home.

73
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:48,982
If you want to kill me,

74
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,484
go ahead.

75
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,025
Lao Yang!

76
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:30,400
Have you lost your mind?

77
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:34,400
Lao Yang!

78
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:35,567
Let me go.

79
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:51,609
Watch out, Lao Yang!

80
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,108
Lao Yang.

81
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,275
Run.

82
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,150
Run!

83
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:02,066
Hurry!

84
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,192
Hurry.

85
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:20,942
Go.

86
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:31,942
Lao Yang.

87
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:40,859
Lao Yang.

88
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:46,400
Hurry.

89
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:58,775
Run, Lao Yang!

90
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:10,233
Run!

91
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:26,317
Go!

92
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:27,150
Go, hurry.

93
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:42,982
Hurry!

94
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:03,692
Wu Xie.

95
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:06,025
Go!

96
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:24,983
Wu Xie.

97
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:26,484
Wu Xie.

98
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:27,567
There's rattan.

99
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:28,609
I think I can catch it.

100
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:32,525
Lao Yang!

101
00:15:58,484 --> 00:15:59,150
Lao Yang!

102
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,442
Lao Yang!

103
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:32,982
-Lao Yang.
-Wu Xie.

104
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:34,400
Don't move.

105
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:35,983
Not a word.

106
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,233
Don't move.

107
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:10,650
Wu Xie!

108
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,358
Wu Xie.

109
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:13,066
I told you...

110
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:13,901
not to move!

111
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,066
Hold on.

112
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:20,859
I'm all right.

113
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:22,901
I've something to say.

114
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:24,400
Wu Xie.

115
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:25,400
Brother.

116
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,983
I'm sorry.

117
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:34,901
I'm terribly sorry.

118
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:39,066
I've done a lot of
wrong things along the way,

119
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:41,400
kept lying to you.

120
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,734
At the end,

121
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,108
I even wanted to hurt you.

122
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:51,650
Wu Xie,

123
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:53,982
you're always like this,

124
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,025
forgiving everyone,

125
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,150
especially me.

126
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,400
Didn't you keep asking me...

127
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:06,317
what exactly...

128
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:08,609
what exactly do I want,

129
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:10,066
right?

130
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,025
Actually,

131
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:16,192
I brought you here...

132
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,400
to the end
of this Qinling sacred tree,

133
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,859
to use...

134
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:26,692
a kind person like you,

135
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,066
to use the power
of this sacred tree...

136
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:39,358
to save a person.

137
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,901
To save my mother.

138
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:43,817
I know that.

139
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,150
I know all that.

140
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:47,484
But, it's not going to happen.

141
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,400
Listen to me, Lao Yang.

142
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:50,734
Don't say another word.

143
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,567
I'll take you out for sure.

144
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,150
This will all come to an end.

145
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,484
Everything will be okay.

146
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:03,066
Wu Xie.

147
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:05,275
Wu Xie!

148
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,692
I've spent 3 years
in this stupid tomb.

149
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,025
In these 3 years,

150
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:12,775
I don't even know who I am.

151
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:13,942
And...

152
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,692
I don't know how I even existed.

153
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:16,734
I feel like...

154
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:19,275
the walking dead.

155
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:21,525
I think...

156
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:22,901
I think that I'm insane.

157
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:24,942
I'm insane.

158
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,025
I only know...

159
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:31,358
what I want.

160
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,567
But to obtain it,

161
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:38,942
I've done so much wrong.

162
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:43,192
I killed somebody.

163
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:47,817
I think I...

164
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,525
I think I belong here.

165
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:54,983
Lao Yang,

166
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:57,983
you are who you are.

167
00:20:58,567 --> 00:20:59,775
You're no one else.

168
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:02,192
Whom you killed was only an illusion.

169
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:03,692
It's all the bronze tree's fault,

170
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:04,692
I don't blame you!

171
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:06,150
Lao Yang,

172
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,192
I'll take you out for sure.

173
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:09,982
Lao Yang!

174
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,108
I'll take you out for sure!

175
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:14,025
Wu Xie,

176
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,233
thank you for...

177
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,108
being with me all the way.

178
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:21,275
Thank you for...

179
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:24,025
never giving up on me.

180
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:25,692
It's you...

181
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,025
It's you who made me feel that...

182
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,650
I wasn't a mere shell.

183
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:33,317
You made me feel.

184
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:37,108
You made me feel...

185
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,192
the brotherhood between us.

186
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:41,982
So,

187
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:45,442
I know I didn't live my life in vain.

188
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:49,484
Stop talking.

189
00:21:49,982 --> 00:21:50,567
Lao Yang!

190
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:03,108
Wu Xie.

191
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:04,275
Wu Xie.

192
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:05,317
You'll be fine.

193
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:07,484
Tell me.

194
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,859
Tell me.

195
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:19,525
In my next life,

196
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,066
how will I ever be so lucky...

197
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:25,025
to meet such a good brother as you?

198
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:27,192
I won't let you die.

199
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:30,734
Will you still be my brother?

200
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:32,692
No doubt.

201
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:50,233
Lao Yang!

202
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:55,692
Lao Yang!

203
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:00,983
Lao Yang!

204
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:45,233
You're alone?

205
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:47,817
I promised him,

206
00:25:55,442 --> 00:25:56,859
but I failed him.

207
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:02,734
We did all we could.

208
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:16,609
Are you okay?

209
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:43,650
Wu Xie!

210
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:10,484
Run!

211
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,942
You saved me at the underwater tomb.

212
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:27,609
Now I don't owe you anything.

213
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:29,233
Ning, I told you.

214
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:38,650
Ning!

215
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:04,859
Ning,

216
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,983
friends...

217
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:08,983
don't owe each other anything.

218
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:17,983
Wu Xie!

219
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:38,567
Wu Xie.

220
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:40,983
Wu Xie!

221
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:43,942
Wu Xie!

222
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,847
"Emergency"

223
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:44,983
You're awake.

224
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:47,525
You're fine.

225
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:49,650
Nothing big.

226
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:50,859
You'll be fine after a rest.

227
00:37:50,942 --> 00:37:51,982
What are you doing here?

228
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:56,859
Why are you here?

229
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:57,567
How did you...

230
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,066
How did you get here?

231
00:37:59,108 --> 00:37:59,734
Little Master.

232
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:01,609
Do you think he's possessed?

233
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:02,525
Never mind.

234
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:03,484
Hold on.

235
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:05,609
Let me pour some nasty on you,

236
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:06,358
and force it out.

237
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:06,859
Come.

238
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:07,484
No!

239
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:08,108
Let me help.

240
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:08,692
Come.

241
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:09,484
You want a sip?

242
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:10,400
Come, come.

243
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:11,484
Just a sip.

244
00:38:11,484 --> 00:38:12,108
Little Master!

245
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:13,025
No!

246
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,942
Don't be scared.

247
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:15,358
Just a tiny sip.

248
00:38:15,484 --> 00:38:16,734
What are you afraid of?

249
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:17,609
Drink up.

250
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:18,983
Hurry, drink up!

251
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:19,942
Just a sip!

252
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:20,817
What are you doing?

253
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:23,901
This is a hospital.

254
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:26,609
What are you laughing at?

255
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:28,982
Don't you know he needs rest?

256
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:31,358
What's that?

257
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,609
I'm sorry. Here you are.

258
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:34,609
Put it down.

259
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:35,609
Putting it down.

260
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:37,066
Doctor,

261
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,025
I have a question.

262
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,775
What's with his shrill voice?

263
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:42,775
It's an aftereffect...

264
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,233
from his severe concussion,

265
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:45,942
his speech center is affected.

266
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:47,233
It doesn't matter,

267
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:48,400
he'll be fine in a few days.

268
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:50,066
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

269
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:53,150
No fooling around.

270
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:03,400
I tell you what.

271
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:05,066
I don't know what's real...

272
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,650
and what's not right now.

273
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:07,983
That bronze tree is too strange.

274
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,775
I...

275
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:10,982
don't even think
we ever went in there.

276
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,426
But judging by your sad condition,

277
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:13,901
it's impossible we weren't there.

278
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:15,400
Little Master,

279
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:16,484
I...

280
00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:17,983
Enough.

281
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:21,567
Don't talk.

282
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:23,901
Let's wait for a few days.

283
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:26,317
This disease is for
chatterbox like you.

284
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,233
You're the chatterbox!

285
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:32,150
Come touch me if you can.

286
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:32,942
I...

287
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:33,982
I...

288
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:40,567
Smartypants!

289
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:42,066
I... I...

290
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:45,525
Come get me.

291
00:39:46,982 --> 00:39:47,609
Little Master!

292
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:48,365
You...

293
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:49,400
-I'll leave.
-I...

294
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,525
What do I get?

295
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:08,734
I got you...

296
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:29,567
Yes.

297
00:40:30,442 --> 00:40:31,692
It's the Braille.

298
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:33,817
I asked Xie Yu Chen...

299
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:35,317
to look for a Braille expert...

300
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
for the translation.

301
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:37,525
But there are some...

302
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,233
ancient words...

303
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:40,859
that even the expert can't understand.

304
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,650
But, I got the gist of it.

305
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:50,150
Do tell.

306
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:53,317
The young Yang Guo whom we met

307
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,525
-is in fact...
-Young Yang Guo.

308
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:56,222
Why not Xiaolongnü?

309
00:40:56,317 --> 00:40:57,192
Only a nickname.

310
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:58,108
Do you even want to listen?

311
00:40:58,233 --> 00:40:58,901
Forget it.

312
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,983
You can ask Dummy Zhang.

313
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:01,775
Look at him,

314
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:02,982
see if he tells you.

315
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:04,275
Come on.

316
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,358
Stop whining.

317
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:06,859
Young Yang Guo...

318
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:07,983
is in fact...

319
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:10,525
a Lord's personal bodyguard.

320
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,859
This Lord...

321
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:14,192
involved himself in...

322
00:41:14,192 --> 00:41:15,275
a fight for a throne.

323
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:16,108
Briefly speaking,

324
00:41:16,192 --> 00:41:17,484
there was a group of people...

325
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:18,775
who wanted him to be the emperor.

326
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:22,692
The royal courtiers however,
opposed him...

327
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:24,150
and even sent troops to kill him.

328
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:26,275
So young Yang Guo and...

329
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,235
Mute Rider General together,

330
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:29,025
they escorted the Lord in his escape.

331
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:32,400
Along the way,
there were all kinds of troop battles.

332
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:34,400
For young Yang Guo's martial skills,

333
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:36,025
you can refer to Little Master.

334
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:36,775
You'll know that...

335
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:37,983
they're both as good.

336
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:39,484
A first-class player.

337
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:42,233
While young Yang Guo
was protecting the Lord,

338
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:43,609
he lost one of his arms.

339
00:41:43,692 --> 00:41:44,484
Doesn't the lost arm...

340
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:45,567
remind you of young Yang Guo?

341
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,317
Of course there was no Xiaolongnü,

342
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,901
nor the eagle in this case.
