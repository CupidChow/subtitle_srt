"Episode 2"

3
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,417
Uncle San Xing?

4
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,042
Uncle San Xing,

5
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:34,667
why are you here?

6
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,542
What is this ship?

7
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,959
How many times did I tell you?

8
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,584
Don't meddle in my business.

9
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:47,834
Why won't you listen?

10
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:50,709
Uncle San Xing,

11
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,334
Ning told me that...

12
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,626
you got in trouble while
tomb raiding at sea.

13
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:54,334
That's why I...

14
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,375
Little comrade,

15
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,083
wake up.

16
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:18,667
Little comrade.

17
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,876
You're in hysteria.
What were you dreaming?

18
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,542
You're keeping too
many things in your head.

19
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:29,584
Be like me.

20
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,918
Every time I have a problem,

21
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:31,834
I'll start chanting.

22
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,709
May money come to me.

23
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:41,000
Hurry, get up.

24
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:42,292
Hurry up.

25
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,459
Here,

26
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,834
drink this and buck up.

27
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,999
Let me tell you.
Once we enter the tomb,

28
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:51,125
the mystery will be gradually solved.

29
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:51,999
Get it?

30
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,751
You're eating already?

31
00:04:58,834 --> 00:04:59,709
Why didn't you wait for us?

32
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,209
That's so rude.

33
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,626
Dig in.

34
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,959
We're approaching the shipwreck.

35
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,792
Are these freshly caught?

36
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:08,876
Nothing beats having
seafood on a boat.

37
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:09,959
It can't get any fresher.

38
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,584
We get to eat once the
boat owner fishes them.

39
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:13,999
Stop looking.

40
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,584
We're about to dive,

41
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,375
no drinking.

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,375
Your uncle was the one
who located the sunken ship.

43
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:24,501
I heard that...

44
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,000
he has also located the tomb.

45
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,999
When we're underwater,

46
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,083
we'll be counting on you.

47
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,375
Why don't you believe me?

48
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:31,584
Uncle San Xing
didn't tell me anything.

49
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,375
I only did a little research
because I'm interested in archeology.

50
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,167
But don't you worry.

51
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,959
For the sake of Uncle San Xing,

52
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,834
I'll do my best.

53
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,334
Spirit and beer are my friends.

54
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,042
While I raid a tomb, I drink beer.

55
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,501
And I become more energetic. Here.

56
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,000
I got them from the boat owner.

57
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,918
Where did you steal the beer from?

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,709
Steal?

59
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,459
I traded them with the meat.

60
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:57,999
This is called the beer culture
exchange of the north and south.

61
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,292
It's good.

62
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,000
Try it.

63
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,000
-Come on, you guys...
-Give me.

64
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,918
Baldy, you drink too?

65
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,000
Great! Tell you what.

66
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,250
I don't care about your attitude,

67
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,209
but it's great that we
can drink together.

68
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:15,709
We can't only eat without drinking.

69
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,000
-Aren't we drinking buddies?
-Exactly.

70
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,083
Here we go.

71
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:20,751
Let's get down to business.

72
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,876
The three of you are experts in this.

73
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,999
Do you have any
advice for our dive later?

74
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:26,042
Do you have the exact location?

75
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,125
Yes, it's confirmed.

76
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:28,667
The frogmen are
cleaning up the rubble.

77
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:29,792
Fine.

78
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,250
Then all that's left for me to do
is just man up and go forward.

79
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,584
Are there any traps?

80
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,250
Even if there is,

81
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:38,250
it won't be a complicated one.

82
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:40,000
Firstly, it's underwater.

83
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,125
It may be already damaged by
the sea water or water pressure.

84
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,209
Secondly,

85
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,876
building a tomb
underwater is a trap itself.

86
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:46,918
In the past,

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,292
when technology wasn't advanced,

88
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:50,792
the owner wouldn't
expect tomb raiders...

89
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,918
to stay underwater for an
extended period of time raiding tombs.

90
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:53,999
So, even if there's a trap,

91
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,167
it won't be complicated.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,209
Then it should be...

93
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,876
♪ An open field! ♪

94
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,667
Come, cheers to that.

95
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,542
Cheers.

96
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,667
Where's Ning?

97
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,083
Sir,

98
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,626
everything is going as planned.

99
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:07,959
Soon comes the crucial step.

100
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,792
Keep your eyes on Wu Xie.

101
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,542
The Wu's are tricky.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,125
Don't let him be off hook.

103
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,834
Yes, sir.

104
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,125
Sir,

105
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,918
was Consultant Zhang...

106
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,375
involved in any of our projects?

107
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,209
No.

108
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,000
What about him?

109
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,876
I have a feeling.
It's just a hunch that...

110
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,792
something's weird about him.

111
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,292
If he threatens the operation,

112
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:34,999
take him out.

113
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:35,959
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:37,375
Remember,

115
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,584
your safety is important.

116
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:40,167
Ning,

117
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,417
you're my most valuable asset.

118
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:18,501
Okay, I got it.

119
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:25,459
They said that the
looters' tunnel is very long.

120
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,417
And some parts of the
entrance have collapsed.

121
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:28,918
They're fixing it with a stand.

122
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,626
We'll go down when they're done.

123
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
"The anchor of the sunken ship."

124
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,280
"It must be huge."

125
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:59,885
"Let's go forward."

126
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,000
"Markings of the looters' hole to the
sunken ship left by Uncle San Xing."

127
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:40,034
"Take a look here."

128
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,800
"My uncle was here,
the entrance is here."

129
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:21,283
"Check your gear, we're going in."

130
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,040
"What are you looking at? Go."

131
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
"Stop."

132
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,360
"The statue on the wall
is opening its eyes."

133
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,440
"Let's get out of here."

134
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,040
"Over here, guys."

135
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:21,033
"I saw something nearby."

136
00:17:57,508 --> 00:18:00,368
"What's wrong?"

137
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,200
"I saw a lot of hair."

138
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:11,312
"No way."

139
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,500
"Look down there."

140
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,180
"What the heck was that?"

141
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:37,205
"How do I know?"

142
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,097
"Oxygen 20.9%, gas 0%,
H2S 0ppm, CO 0ppm"

143
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,792
Baldy, are you looking for trouble?

144
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:23,709
Why did you push it?

145
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:26,042
My organs almost burst out!

146
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,959
Do you want me to
puke my intestines at you?

147
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,584
That was an emergency.

148
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,751
If I didn't activate that trap,

149
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,375
you would've been strangled
by the hair, you know that?

150
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:36,459
Just leave me alone!

151
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:37,375
Enough.

152
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,250
Let's go up.

153
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:53,459
Little comrade,

154
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,334
where is this?

155
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,063
No casket or catafalque here.

156
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,300
This should be one
of the side chambers.

157
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:11,751
Fatty Wang is home.

158
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:24,834
Look here!

159
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:26,417
There are footprints.

160
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:31,999
Whose footprints?

161
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,292
Mister San Xing's, perhaps?

162
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,876
This one seems fresh.

163
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,000
It's small!

164
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:41,792
Is that a kid?

165
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:42,918
A kid no more than 3 years old.

166
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,209
But this is not a playground.

167
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,417
Why is there a kid here?

168
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:49,918
Corpse wax?

169
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,083
Yes, it's very wet.

170
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,542
Corpse wax!

171
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:57,584
A zombie?

172
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,209
Did you notice it?

173
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,292
The footprints only head one way.

174
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:05,626
There are no returning ones.

175
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:52,626
This is a casket for baby.

176
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,209
Was the kid a family of
the owner or a sacrifice?

177
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,417
The kid was buried alive.

178
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,584
It'll contain lots of cool stuff,

179
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:00,876
especially in the stomach.

180
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,626
There'll be a luminous pearl in it,

181
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:03,209
you know?

182
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,375
That's very valuable.

183
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:06,999
Where did the kid go?

184
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,876
Darling!

185
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,751
Where did the kid go?

186
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,792
Darling!

187
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:13,918
Darling, how naughty you are.

188
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,292
Let uncle have a look at you.

189
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,042
Lower your voice.

190
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,167
It was buried alive at a young age.

191
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,375
Can't you let it rest in peace?

192
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,999
You hypocrite.

193
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:21,959
Fine, leave it be.

194
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:23,375
Let me see what else is in here.

195
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:24,042
Hold on.

196
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,876
This casket looks
different from the others.

197
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:27,876
Let's skip this one.

198
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,542
We're not here for grave goods.

199
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:30,959
Hurry up and find the main chamber.

200
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Stop wasting time.

201
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,375
This is way too creepy.

202
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,459
Why don't we act first?

203
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:14,375
Shall I shoot it?

204
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,918
This is an urn from Ming dynasty.

205
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,292
You'll cause the loss of relics.

206
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:20,459
We won't be able to take it anyway.

207
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,125
Is there another way out?

208
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:23,334
Another way?

209
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:24,375
Besides this door,

210
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,751
there's only the hole
where we entered.

211
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,584
We either take the shortcut in there,

212
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,918
or get back to the boat and
buy a flight ticket back to Beijing.

213
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,459
I'll buy you mutton hotpot,

214
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:32,626
roast duck and braised delicacies.

215
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:34,334
Why should we fear this urn?

216
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:35,375
Go on.

217
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,167
Why did you hit me?

218
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,209
It hurts.

219
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,125
On my way.

220
00:26:05,876 --> 00:26:06,626
Let's go.

221
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,292
Don't you think the urn
is like our tour guide?

222
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:40,876
If we put on a red cap...

223
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,042
and let it hold a tiny, colorful flag,

224
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,083
it'll say,

225
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:45,250
"Look here,

226
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,542
follow me!"

227
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:47,334
Come on.

228
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:50,000
These tricks are for scaring people.

229
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,000
What if it is alive?

230
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,000
Maybe...

231
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,000
Enough, both of you.

232
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:54,751
Let's go.

233
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:56,751
Wait a minute.

234
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:59,000
This kind of path is
usually filled with traps.

235
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,334
Let me check first.

236
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,792
If Uncle San Xing was here before...

237
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:11,417
The door in front is open.

238
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:12,918
Someone must have entered through it.

239
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:18,125
It shouldn't be Uncle San Xing.

240
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:19,792
If he was here,

241
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,083
all the traps...

242
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,292
should have been destroyed,

243
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:23,125
or activated.

244
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:28,042
Every step you take here matters.

245
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:29,459
Little comrade, are you sure of this?

246
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:31,209
Follow me.

247
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,167
All right!

248
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,834
What the heck? Let go of him!

249
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:08,584
Are you all right?

250
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:10,083
Fatty!

251
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:13,167
Move!

252
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,083
Calm down!

253
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,334
-Keep calm.
-Don't touch!

254
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:23,209
Calm down.

255
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:24,334
Calm down, it's fine.

256
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:25,209
-Fatty, look at you!
-It's okay.

257
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,083
Your back!

258
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,667
Wait... wait a second.

259
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,709
Something's wrong.

260
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:37,959
I don't feel pain at all.

261
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:39,667
That's right.

262
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:41,709
This doesn't hurt.

263
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:44,250
Fatty,

264
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,459
does it feel so good
to be shot to death?

265
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:47,250
I've never died before,

266
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,459
I have no idea.

267
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:52,000
You!

268
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,042
I'm not bleeding either.

269
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:57,417
You're right.

270
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:02,751
I really am all right?

271
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,709
Get up there.

272
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:31,083
Let's go.

273
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:37,417
Consultant Zhang,

274
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:38,542
did you get it?

275
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,959
It was too fast, I couldn't keep up.

276
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,083
You guys...

277
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,501
We're fine.

278
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:48,834
Where is Ning?

279
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:53,459
That evil wench has fooled us.

280
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:54,626
She used us as her shield.

281
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:55,792
How heartless.

282
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:56,584
Well, Baldy.

283
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,042
Your boss has entered,

284
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,250
why didn't you follow her?

285
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,918
Ning stepped on the
trap on purpose just now.

286
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,042
You!

287
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,250
Dummy Zhang,

288
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:26,083
are you kidding us?

289
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:27,876
You've been deceiving
us this whole time?

290
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,209
The arrow has a lotus tip.

291
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,501
It's not lethal.

292
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,125
Did the tomb owner
create these traps...

293
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,834
so that we would give up?

294
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,709
I say, the tomb owner...

295
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,667
is just a crazy wackadoo.

296
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,417
He should have just shot us to death.

297
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:55,250
Why did he fool around with these?

298
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,709
Ning stepped on the
trap intentionally.

299
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,250
She seemed to try to kill us.

300
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,417
But in fact,

301
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:04,834
the arrow has a lotus tip.

302
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:05,709
It's not harmful.

303
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:07,501
Now, this is weird.

304
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,959
With her capability,

305
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:10,709
she could've come here on her own.

306
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,334
Yet she tried so hard to get us here.

307
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:13,292
Why is that?

308
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:15,250
Maybe she thought
since she could get in easily,

309
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:16,667
she no longer needs us.

310
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,918
So she kicked us
down the ladder, get it?

311
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:26,417
Perhaps...

312
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,834
she learned the secret of this
underwater tomb from Uncle San Xing?

313
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,042
Anyway, she ditched us...

314
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,125
to do something she
wouldn't want us knowing.

315
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,918
She definitely knows where
the most precious treasure is,

316
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,459
and refuses to share it with us.

317
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,709
What did I tell you,
foreign relics dealers are evil.

318
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,501
She betrayed us without hesitation.

319
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:46,834
Whatever, let's not waste time here.

320
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:47,501
After her!

321
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,042
To the left chamber.

322
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:50,751
Dummy Zhang,

323
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,876
don't show up all of a
sudden and order us.

324
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:54,459
Can we really trust the zombie?

325
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:56,083
It'll take us to the zombie nest.

326
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:56,876
And what will we become?

327
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,125
Take-out food, am I right?

328
00:33:58,209 --> 00:33:59,125
Let's listen to Stuffy.

329
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:00,542
To the left chamber.

330
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,334
Are you looking for trouble?

331
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,792
Fine, I'll listen to you.

332
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:06,834
Hold on!

333
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:11,083
Let's bring the
oxygen tanks here first.

334
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:12,334
In case something happens.

335
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:19,626
Don't do this again.

336
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:28,667
We've only left for 10 minutes.

337
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:29,542
But where are the tanks?

338
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,876
Did we come to the wrong place?

339
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,584
Did Ning move them?

340
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:35,751
That's impossible.

341
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,292
She has entered the chamber.

342
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,417
Unless there's another passage.

343
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,709
This wasn't where we came from.

344
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,375
The previous chamber had no pillars.

345
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:48,167
He's right.

346
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,959
The baby casket at
the corner is also gone.

347
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,042
And the burial objects
are placed differently.

348
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:54,876
Moreover,

349
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:56,167
look above you.

350
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:02,667
How is this possible?

351
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:04,626
Did we take the wrong way,

352
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:06,083
or the wrong door?

353
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:08,918
But there was only one way in.

354
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:30,834
Stop looking.

355
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:32,375
There's only one way
in and out of here.

356
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,792
If we really took the wrong door,
I'll marry a zombie.

357
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,209
Didn't your uncle tell you...

358
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,959
about the passages in
the underwater tomb?

359
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:51,751
Little Master,

360
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,751
have you...

361
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:55,709
been to this tomb before?

362
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:57,751
I don't know.

363
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,292
Don't you know
whether you've been here?

364
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:00,834
Do you have Alzheimer's?

365
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,501
Maybe I have been here.

366
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,209
Some places seem familiar to me.

367
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:14,125
But I don't remember.

368
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:15,792
Little comrade,

369
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,292
an underwater tomb is so uncommon.

370
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:19,501
Didn't your uncle tell you anything?

371
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:20,542
Think harder.

372
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:24,167
Uncle San Xing did
tell me many stories.

373
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,792
But I can't tell which
one of them is true.

374
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:27,667
Fine.

375
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,250
Then I'll start the discussion.

376
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:32,125
I asked Ning before,

377
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,209
about how Mister San Xing
knows about this tomb.

378
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:35,292
Ning said that...

379
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,999
a group of tomb raiders...

380
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,000
was bombing shipwrecks
near the Paracel Islands.

381
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:41,334
They found a tomb beneath here.

382
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:44,459
The burial soil was
almost completely damaged.

383
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:47,083
And some parts of the outer
tomb wall have collapsed.

384
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:48,792
Yet, they still couldn't
find a perfect way...

385
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,709
to enter the tomb no
matter how they tried.

386
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:51,792
Wait a minute.

387
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:53,542
What do you mean by
"completely damaged"?

388
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:54,918
Didn't you see it when you entered?

389
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,417
The outer part was hardly damaged.

390
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,709
This was what Ning said.

391
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:00,044
I only conveyed her words.

392
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:02,250
I'm trying to start a discussion!

393
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,334
Do you want to know or not?

394
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,167
Jeez.

395
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:07,792
Where was I?

396
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:08,792
Right.

397
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:11,626
Back then, an archeological team...

398
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,209
also learned about this.

399
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,626
After the tomb raiders left,

400
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,709
the archeological team conducted...

401
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,751
a secret investigation here.

402
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,792
The tomb is completely sealed.

403
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:41,751
There's a waterproof wall,

404
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:42,876
it's covered with clay.

405
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,709
-There might be oxygen inside.
-That's great.

406
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,000
Professor Zhang.

407
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:18,459
You're the expert.

408
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:19,250
You do it.

409
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:25,501
Only the words in the
middle are visible.

410
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,542
Interior Ministry.

411
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:27,751
Interior Ministry...

412
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:30,584
was a royal department
supervising in appliance manufacture.

413
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:31,876
This box...

414
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,459
might date back to Ming dynasty.

415
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:36,209
There should be something
wrapped inside this cloth.

416
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:37,334
If they wanted to enter,

417
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:38,626
they needed to tear down the wall.

418
00:38:38,999 --> 00:38:40,167
But this is underwater.

419
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:42,209
When the wall is torn down,

420
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,501
the water will gush in.

421
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:44,709
And no one will know...

422
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:45,834
what will become of the tomb.

423
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,459
Furthermore, it's normal
for the archeological team...

424
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:48,834
to protect the ruins first.

425
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:50,918
Unlike me, they won't
blast things off easily.

426
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:52,792
The only thing I'm certain of is...

427
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,584
the Watergate was crucial.

428
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:55,626
Somebody suggested...

429
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,542
to dig a tunnel at the
bottom of the tomb as an entry.

430
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,584
But the localization showed that...

431
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:04,000
the soil in this part of the sea
isn't from the Paracel Islands,

432
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,959
it's the white clay near
Guanyao, Fujian instead.

433
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,334
It covers up over 7000 square metres.

434
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:10,667
Judging from the ratio,

435
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,709
they couldn't come
here with their technology.

436
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:13,959
But they dug it anyway.

437
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,959
Still, the bottom was nowhere
to be seen after a 15-meter dig.

438
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,918
They couldn't even estimate the time
and length of the tunnel needed.

439
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,876
And then there were
some other reasons,

440
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:23,999
so the team left.

441
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:26,417
This place was then buried again.

442
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,334
The most interesting part is,

443
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,334
the data of the archeological team...

444
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:32,626
was all gone!

445
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:35,167
A few years later,

446
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,250
another archeological team came.

447
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,125
Your uncle was one of them.

448
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,709
He's too indiscipline!

449
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:44,999
How can he go out alone...

450
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:46,334
without even asking for permission?

451
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:49,501
That's right!

452
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:50,667
What if he got into trouble?

453
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,083
Look there!

454
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:53,209
On the reef!

455
00:39:53,334 --> 00:39:54,792
Where? Where is it? Where?

456
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:55,751
I see it!

457
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:10,792
Copper Fish with Snake Brows?

458
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:11,501
Yes.

459
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:13,000
Ning said,

460
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,584
your uncle believed that the
member who suddenly died...

461
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,083
must have entered the tomb.

462
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,459
The Copper Fish with
Snake Brows was the evidence.

463
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,334
So, they searched the area nearby,

464
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,959
and found more than 40 huge rocks,

465
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:27,042
those rocks we saw on our way here.

466
00:40:27,918 --> 00:40:28,751
I'm certain.

467
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,709
Underneath this area,

468
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:32,334
there's an underwater
tomb on a sunken ship.

469
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:32,999
Really?

470
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,209
An underwater tomb on a sunken ship?

471
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,375
The tomb is first built on the ship,

472
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:39,083
then, find a ground
or a trench in the sea.

473
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:42,626
After that, sink the
ship and seal it with soil.

474
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:44,501
There goes the underwater
tomb on a sunken ship.

475
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,209
It's like the tomb on land,

476
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,709
but the location is under the sea.

477
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,417
The place must have originally
been a submarine canyon,

478
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:52,626
but was then filled.

479
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:53,959
Gosh,

480
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,209
this needs a lot of work!

481
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:56,709
Were the ancient
people capable of this?

482
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,417
That's right.

483
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:58,083
Wen Jin,

484
00:40:58,751 --> 00:40:59,918
we finally found it!

485
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,000
What happened then?

486
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:02,999
Then?

487
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:05,584
Your uncle went underwater himself.

488
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:08,167
After that, the team left halfway too,

489
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,375
and things were still unsettled.

490
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,250
Until recently,

491
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,459
your uncle collaborated
with Ning's company...

492
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:13,792
to enter the tomb again.

493
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:14,959
Let me repeat it.

494
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,501
I heard all these from Ning.

495
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:17,667
I don't know whether they're true,

496
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:19,292
but I presume they somehow are.

497
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:22,375
She doesn't have
to lie to me with this.

498
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,000
Unless...

499
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:25,918
Unless she was also
cheated by Uncle San Xing.

500
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:27,709
Yes.

501
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,292
I remember when I was little,

502
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:49,834
Uncle San Xing was away
from home for a long time.

503
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,459
When he returned, he
became dark and skinny,

504
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,125
and weak too.

505
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:54,417
But I also remember...

506
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:55,667
he and grandpa...

507
00:41:55,876 --> 00:41:56,459
had a long talk...

508
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:57,667
in his room.

509
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:01,209
Grandpa even scolded him.

510
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:09,667
I believe that...

511
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:11,876
Uncle San Xing had been here before.

512
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,209
But it still doesn't explain...

513
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,250
why this side chamber
suddenly looks different?

514
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,709
Are you saying I
digressed from the subject?

515
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:20,167
Fine.

516
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:22,000
I was here before.
