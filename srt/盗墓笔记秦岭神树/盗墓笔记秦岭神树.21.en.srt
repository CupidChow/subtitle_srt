3
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,876
My dear lifesaver,

4
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,584
stop playing around with the coffins.

5
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,375
Figure something out.

6
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:19,459
What should we do...

7
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:20,999
if the fire catches up?

8
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:47,751
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

9
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,417
Wu Xie.

10
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:50,918
What are you doing?

11
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,292
It's opened!

12
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,000
We're saved!

13
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,420
Come on!

14
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,792
It's our way out.

15
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,459
Amitabha.

16
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:24,626
When one door shuts, another opens.

17
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,083
Little lifesaver,

18
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,334
you're my great savior.

19
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,792
You should thank those rats.

20
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:32,459
Stop buttering him up.

21
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,584
Let's get out of this place.

22
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:34,792
Okay.

23
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,834
We're saved.

24
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,626
We're finally free.

25
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:34,501
Lao Yang?

26
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:37,375
Teacher Liang?

27
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:47,083
Lao Yang!

28
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:09,792
Wu Xie!

29
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:12,876
Wu Xie!

30
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:19,834
Lao Yang!

31
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:22,459
Lao Yang!

32
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,209
Oh my god.

33
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,042
What is this place?

34
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:56,626
Glasses.

35
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:17,999
Wu Xie!

36
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:24,209
Wu Xie!

37
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:25,626
Wu Xie!

38
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:28,083
Lao Yang.

39
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:31,292
Wu Xie.

40
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,125
Lao Yang.

41
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:33,709
Are you okay?

42
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:34,334
I'm okay.

43
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:35,292
What about you?

44
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:37,417
I'm fine.

45
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:38,334
I'm fine.

46
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:39,209
What's wrong?

47
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,709
I'm fine, I'm fine.

48
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:45,375
Little lifesaver,

49
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,125
where are you guys?

50
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,918
That must be Teacher Liang.

51
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,083
I'll go find him.

52
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,834
I'm an old man.

53
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,834
Don't leave me here...

54
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,250
all alone!

55
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,000
Where are you guys?

56
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,000
Old man.

57
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,125
Aren't you a little bit
overdramatic as an old man?

58
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:09,167
-Little lifesaver.
-Teacher Liang, are you okay?

59
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,834
There you are.

60
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:11,876
I was so scared.

61
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:13,501
Where are we now?

62
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,083
Where are we...

63
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,000
Are you hurt?

64
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:16,876
No...

65
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm fine.

66
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,125
Come, let me give you a hand.

67
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:20,918
Oh my...

68
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:30,459
It's so huge.

69
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,042
That explains why
no matter how long we dug,

70
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,918
we just couldn't reach the top.

71
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,209
Let me borrow it for a while.

72
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,292
Haven't you noticed?

73
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:47,167
This tree is made of bronze.

74
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,626
A truly extraordinary craftsmanship.

75
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,459
Astounding workmanship.

76
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:56,834
A heavenly creation.

77
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,375
Is this the...

78
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:00,250
trunk of that bronze tree...

79
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,959
that you discovered back then?

80
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,250
That means...

81
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,417
this tree grew up to the top.

82
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:09,375
Which is also the one...

83
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,375
that you and Mr. Ma found.

84
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,042
Could this be built by...

85
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:17,584
the Serpents?

86
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:18,918
I don't think so.

87
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,834
It's a gigantic bronze tree.

88
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,584
They wouldn't have this kind of...

89
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,667
smelting technology in the past.

90
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,209
Then... then who built this?

91
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,125
Where did it come from?

92
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:29,876
Could it be...

93
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,125
grown from hell?

94
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,000
Bullshit.

95
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:36,876
Think about it.

96
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:42,000
We came in this Underworld
through the Yellow Spring.

97
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,667
Where else could it
possibly grow from...

98
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,542
other than hell?

99
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,834
Boys, come down here!

100
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,125
There are traces of
excavation down here.

101
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,125
Should be the Serpents...

102
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,999
discovered this bronze tree...

103
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:59,459
when they were constructing the tomb.

104
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,542
But I'm not sure...

105
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:03,209
how deep it goes if we keep digging.

106
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:03,918
Lao Yang?

107
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:12,459
Lao Yang.

108
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:13,999
What are you thinking about?

109
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,709
I don't know.

110
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:20,417
Just that maybe we should...

111
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:21,375
climb up there?

112
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:22,834
Did you really think
you were a monkey?

113
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:23,626
Come on.

114
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:26,375
Something doesn't feel
right with this tree!

115
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,584
You must be careful!

116
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,834
How is this a dead end?

117
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,918
Since the construction of the
tomb was completed,

118
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,626
the rocks were all in place,

119
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:54,417
wasn't it normal to seal the way out?

120
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,876
What should we do now?

121
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:01,083
Great idea.

122
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,959
Hang on.

123
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,209
You want to use that inside a tomb?

124
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:06,792
Are you guys amateurs?

125
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,292
The type that tries to
get yourselves killed?

126
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:09,876
Go ahead and use it.

127
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,542
Just wait until we
get out above ground.

128
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:13,375
I don't care even if
you bury yourself.

129
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,000
Fine.

130
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:15,876
Then, what do you think we should do?

131
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:18,751
Here, go.

132
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:19,709
Break it open.

133
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,292
Who are you to order me around?

134
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,959
Because you're the
most incompetent here.

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,751
Ms. Ning,

136
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,292
this place feels evil.

137
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,459
I got chills all over my body
as soon as I entered.

138
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,542
My waist.

139
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,083
Little Master.

140
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:48,918
Little Master.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,542
Little Master,

142
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,000
this place is full of
bronze bell as well.

143
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,125
Kylin Zhang,

144
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,292
have you seen this before?

145
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,042
Ms. Ning,

146
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,417
did you hurt yourself from the fall?

147
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:18,501
If only Mr. Naive was here.

148
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,209
This should be the
Serpents' ritual of sacrifice.

149
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,626
How is this a ritual?

150
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:26,626
It's more like a
museum of dead bodies.

151
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,250
Here's the museum curator.

152
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,501
This ancient cauldron looks nice.

153
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,375
Look at the quality...

154
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,334
Take it with you
if you can carry it up.

155
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:53,792
This bell...

156
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,501
This must be worth of something.

157
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:56,459
Hang on!

158
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,834
It's fine for me if you want
to take the cauldron with you.

159
00:12:58,918 --> 00:12:59,876
But if you touch this bell,

160
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:00,792
and cause hallucinations,

161
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:01,751
believe it or not,

162
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:02,417
you might get yourself killed...

163
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:03,209
by your own imagination.

164
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,250
These bells...

165
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:27,751
are just like the one on the body
of that huge zombie creature.

166
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,292
Then, Uncle San Xing told me that...

167
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,375
these bells were made before
Warring States period.

168
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,751
He didn't tell me the
details about it.

169
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,125
But just a single bell back then...

170
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,667
had had so many lives killed.

171
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,375
There are dozens of bells here.

172
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:40,751
If they ring...

173
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:51,167
That treasure chest in the
hands of the priest...

174
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:52,709
There must be some treasures inside.

175
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,834
I saw it too.

176
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:55,918
Fine, fine.

177
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't move, don't move.

178
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,417
You're not qualified enough...

179
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,125
to touch the stuff of a priest.

180
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,334
I should be the one to look first.

181
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:15,959
Don't touch it.

182
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:19,999
What's the matter?

183
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,626
There's nothing inside.

184
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:22,999
You told me not to touch it.

185
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,125
Yet you touched it first.

186
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:38,834
Oh no.

187
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,000
Little Master.

188
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:26,334
Little Master?

189
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:28,626
Little Master.

190
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:33,167
Little Master.

191
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,792
Go to hell.

192
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,125
Come on.

193
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,042
Come on.

194
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:06,999
Fatty!

195
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:09,042
What are you doing?

196
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,667
Are you out of your mind?

197
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,209
Come out, Fatty!

198
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,626
How dare you shoot me?

199
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,000
Come out!

200
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:48,584
Fatty!

201
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,250
There you are.

202
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:19,584
Where's Ning?

203
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,626
Their bodies must be crushed.

204
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:52,542
Tell me,

205
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:55,834
how should I explain
this to Mr. Naive?

206
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,125
Little Master,

207
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:09,542
what happened just now?

208
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,667
Didn't you experience
any hallucinations?

209
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:25,959
Come and take a look at this.

210
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,667
Something is engraved on it.

211
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:32,834
What is it?

212
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,417
Another two-bodied snake.

213
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,209
This is the totem of the Serpents.

214
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:40,751
Why was it engraved here?

215
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,125
Maybe the Serpents...

216
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:46,834
thought of it as a miracle being.

217
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,959
So they engraved the totem...

218
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,667
here as a sign of worship.

219
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:51,584
Teacher Liang,

220
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
you have a broad range of knowledge.

221
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,167
Can you tell...

222
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,167
which era does this
bronze tree belong to?

223
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:02,626
It could belong to the
Shang and Zhou Dynasties.

224
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:06,375
Shang and Zhou Dynasties...

225
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,792
had over 1,000 years of history.

226
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:08,667
Teacher Liang,

227
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,709
you might as well just
tell us you don't know.

228
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,000
This has to be inspected...

229
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,083
with specialized instrument.

230
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,792
It's impossible to tell
its specific era...

231
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:20,876
by just looking at it.

232
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,792
Look closely.

233
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:24,167
Look at its color.

234
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:25,501
It's black.

235
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,167
It's blackish Grey.

236
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,834
It could be tin bronze,

237
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:34,667
leaded tin bronze and...

238
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,959
leaded bronze.

239
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,876
In my opinion,

240
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:40,667
it could belong to the era around...

241
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:43,125
Western Zhou dynasty.

242
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:47,501
How certain are you?

243
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:50,709
It's meaningless to discuss further...

244
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,083
if you want to be so specific

245
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,459
Then...

246
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:54,959
Then...

247
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:57,250
Maybe around 50 percent.

248
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,167
You might as well have said nothing.

249
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:03,792
Most of the artifacts these days...

250
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,209
belonged to the era
after Song dynasty.

251
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,292
There's only so few
before Tang Dynasty.

252
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:08,584
It's amazing enough that...

253
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:08,999
Teacher Liang could tell...

254
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,167
it belonged to
Western Zhou dynasty.

255
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,042
Teacher Liang,

256
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,459
let's say if it was from
Western Zhou dynasty.

257
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,375
judging by the technology back then,

258
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,083
were they capable of making
a bronze tree like this?

259
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,459
My dear lifesaver,

260
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:24,834
this is a even
tougher question for me.

261
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,459
I only know that...

262
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,792
they used pottery molds
for making bronze vessels...

263
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:33,375
which was a mold made from pottery.

264
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,918
Theoretically,

265
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,501
as long as they could
make the pottery mold,

266
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,167
they would be capable of...

267
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,083
Making such a huge bronze tree?

268
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:42,083
How big of a pottery mold
would they have needed?

269
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:43,334
That's impossible.

270
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,792
Nothing is for sure.

271
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,918
Let me teach you something.

272
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:52,042
The time from 1000 BC...

273
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:54,543
to the Common Era...

274
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,999
is historically known as
the "Age of Wonders".

275
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,417
Many constructions
which you thought...

276
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:02,334
would be impossible were
built in that period.

277
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:03,250
Such as...

278
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,083
the Great Wall, pyramids,

279
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,876
Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor,
Tower of Babel...

280
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,834
If you must say that...

281
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,459
it was impossible for them to
build such an enormous bronze tree,

282
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,292
that may be uncertain...

283
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,999
as the technology was already mature.

284
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,292
With just an order from the Emperor,

285
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:20,709
those who worked for him...

286
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,667
could have actually built it...

287
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:24,959
in maybe 8 to 10 years.

288
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:27,501
This isn't the deception scheme
during the Great Leap Forward.

289
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,751
You can't make things happen...

290
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:30,709
by just talking big.

291
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:34,042
When Emperor Qin Shi Huang
collected all the world's weapons,

292
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,834
yet he only managed to
make Twelve Metal Colossi.

293
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:38,209
For an enormous bronze tree like this,

294
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:39,999
they could have built over
hundreds of metal colossi.

295
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,042
Plus where did all this
bronze come from?

296
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:43,918
You tell me.

297
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,918
Now you're just arguing
for the sake of arguing.

298
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,375
Maybe it was because of...

299
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,292
the making of this bronze tree,

300
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,375
that cooper had lessened...

301
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:52,834
when it came to Qin Dynasty.

302
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,876
Which was why they could
only afford to make...

303
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,375
the Twelve Metal Colossi.

304
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,042
What now?

305
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,209
You're the professional here.

306
00:22:58,918 --> 00:22:59,626
You're always right...

307
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,167
even if you're just talking nonsense.

308
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:02,292
You...

309
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:03,292
He...

310
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:03,918
By the way,

311
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:06,876
didn't Mr.Li say that...

312
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:09,000
this tomb possesses treasures that...

313
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,250
are far more precious than the
Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor?

314
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,667
But we didn't see
any treasure at all...

315
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,459
along the way.

316
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:15,584
Isn't...

317
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,167
Isn't this...

318
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:19,751
huge bronze tree a treasure?

319
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:22,209
We're not metal collectors.

320
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:26,083
What can we do with this huge tree?

321
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:28,167
Like the bronze tree in Sanxingdui,

322
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,876
it's labeled as a national
treasure now, you know?

323
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,918
You're saying as if you could...

324
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:33,792
dig it out and sell it.

325
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,209
Why can't I?

326
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:36,709
If I really did dig it out,

327
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,459
I could make a great fortune!

328
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,292
Fine, dig it out then.

329
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,083
Dig it out.

330
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:41,876
Dig it out and sell it.

331
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:42,501
Stop fighting.

332
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:44,626
I'm pretty sure that...

333
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:46,375
the treasure that Mr Li
was talking about...

334
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:47,792
was not this bronze tree.

335
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:54,751
Shall we look for the treasure?

336
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:02,959
We haven't even found the
coffin of the tomb owner.

337
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,167
Let alone the treasures
buried with him.

338
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:16,584
It's such a pity that...

339
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:18,959
Mr Li's death was too sudden.

340
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:20,959
Otherwise,

341
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:23,125
he would've known...

342
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,125
where we should go next.

343
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:29,375
You boys, wait for me!

344
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:31,751
Wait for me!

345
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:36,626
Wu Xie,

346
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,709
isn't your hand getting sore...

347
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,042
from holding the torch so long?

348
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:41,334
Come.

349
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,000
Let me help you.

350
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:44,792
Aren't I considerate?

351
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:45,584
Lao Yang,

352
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:47,751
you were so eloquent...

353
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:48,834
while arguing with Teacher Liang.

354
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,375
Plus you've spent so long...

355
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,125
in this tomb,

356
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:53,250
you must've known about
the tree for some time,

357
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:54,751
right?

358
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,501
Come, come.

359
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:06,959
Tell me,

360
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,667
what is the secret behind...

361
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:10,250
the bronze tree?

362
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:17,709
Teacher Liang,

363
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:19,626
was he part of your team?

364
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,792
I don't know him.

365
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:24,334
There were only...

366
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:25,501
five of us.

367
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:26,876
You've met them all.

368
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:32,000
Lao Yang.

369
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:35,292
This...

370
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,709
This man hasn't be dead for long.

371
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,542
His body is still soft...

372
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:41,667
and warm.

373
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,918
Could there be other people here?

374
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:47,334
Don't worry about others now.

375
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,584
Let's help him down first.

376
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,626
I really hated her when we were in...

377
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:07,250
the underwater tomb.

378
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,459
Then the feeling was gone.

379
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:12,876
I was just feeling nervous...

380
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:14,167
talking to a girl.

381
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,959
That was why I kept mocking her...

382
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,709
or arguing with her.

383
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,542
There wasn't any hard feelings.

384
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:20,999
But now that she's gone.

385
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:22,999
I didn't even get to explain to her.

386
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,375
What should we do now?

387
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:34,751
I'm talking to you.

388
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:35,834
What should we do now?

389
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:38,000
There's an entrance here.

390
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:39,334
I...

391
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:41,834
Why didn't you tell us just now?

392
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:42,626
You?

393
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,209
If you had told us earlier,

394
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,584
we wouldn't have been hallucinated.

395
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,792
Mr. Naive's wife wouldn't have died.

396
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:49,876
Even Guo Guo would still be alive.

397
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:50,792
I just remembered it!

398
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:55,292
I only just recalled it.

399
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,584
What else did you recall?

400
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,542
What do we have down there?

401
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,501
What did you recall?

402
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,542
Maybe give me a spoiler?

403
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:36,459
This is just great.

404
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:39,167
Amazing.

405
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:02,250
Old man, why do you sigh so much?

406
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:04,999
We might not know...

407
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:05,918
where this little brother...

408
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:06,999
came from...

409
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,167
but his goal...

410
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,417
could've been more or less like ours.

411
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:14,334
Yet he just...

412
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:16,167
lost his life here so suddenly.

413
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:20,083
At least let me...

414
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,667
mourn for him for a little while.

415
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,999
What is there to mourn about?

416
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,918
If he didn't die,

417
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,999
should we have fought him?

418
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,250
Could you even?

419
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,584
This...

420
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,834
If he had a companion,

421
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,250
he should've...

422
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:38,834
climbed up the tree by now.

423
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,626
Climbed up the tree?

424
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,125
Why?

425
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,501
I was just thinking about it,

426
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,292
we've walked such a long way.

427
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:47,584
This place...

428
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,417
should be the deep end of the tomb.

429
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,626
But other than the bronze tree,

430
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:53,083
we didn't see anything.

431
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:54,834
Perhaps,

432
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,834
for the ancient Serpents,

433
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,125
the Bronze Tree...

434
00:28:58,792 --> 00:28:59,375
was viewed as...

435
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,584
a miracle creation like you said.

436
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,501
Which was why they...

437
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:03,709
carved their totem on the tree.

438
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:05,375
But think about it,

439
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:06,876
would their leader...

440
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,542
have placed his tomb...

441
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,751
in the place that they believed...

442
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,334
was the closest with God?

443
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,751
You're saying that the tomb owner...

444
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,209
placed his coffin...

445
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,375
on the tree?

446
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:29,667
All the treasures must be on the tree.

447
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:31,999
Let's climb up the tree then.

448
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:33,334
-Climb the tree?
-Yes.

449
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,250
I'm an old man,

450
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,876
my movements aren't as smooth.

451
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,542
You'll have to help me out a bit.

452
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:40,459
Come on.

453
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,167
Wait... wait.

454
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,751
Here... here.

455
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:53,792
Put it on.

456
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:57,876
What do you mean by this?

457
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,459
Just take it as...

458
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:04,083
a metal that's...

459
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:06,000
connected with high
voltage electricity.

460
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:08,501
Tell me the truth.

461
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,125
Sir, I'll explain this...

462
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,125
next time, okay?

463
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,459
Teacher Liang, let's go.

464
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:24,125
Let's go... let's go.

465
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:25,209
You need to help me out.

466
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:25,918
Come on.

467
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:31,459
Give me a hand.

468
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,792
Wu Xie,

469
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,501
be careful.

470
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:52,751
Don't touch the branches.

471
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:54,334
Got it.

472
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:33,709
How am I supposed to get up there?

473
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,918
With a body like mine...

474
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,375
Get down here.

475
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:40,167
-This is the worst.
-Teacher Liang.

476
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:41,209
It's okay, Teacher Liang.

477
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,125
We'll climb up first.

478
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,125
And pull you up with rope.

479
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,083
Don't abandon me.

480
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,083
We would've done that
sooner if we had intended.

481
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:49,000
Don't worry.

482
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,000
-Little lifesaver...
-Careful.

483
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:53,083
Be careful.

484
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,999
Don't let your exposed skin...

485
00:31:55,334 --> 00:31:56,876
touch the tree.

486
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:58,501
Careful.

487
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:05,542
Come.

488
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:07,542
Slow down.

489
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:15,792
Come.

490
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:18,751
Drop...

491
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Drop the rope now.

492
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:23,626
Here, are you ready?

493
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,959
1, 2, 3.

494
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:30,459
Careful!

495
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:32,667
Watch out!

496
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:35,292
Careful.

497
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:54,209
Darn that Little Master.
He could've told me...

498
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:56,375
there was a pothole there.

499
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,501
We're finally here.

500
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:35,042
I've been here before.

501
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:42,501
You remember it now?

502
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:00,209
This is my signature mark.

503
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:01,792
I leave this mark...

504
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,792
in every tomb that I've been to.

505
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:04,584
Then can you recall...

506
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,626
when you came here?

507
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,042
Looking at this mark,

508
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:08,918
it should be before I went to...

509
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,626
the underwater tomb
of Paracel Islands.

510
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,292
I'm not asking you to
recall anything else.

511
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:17,876
Just try to recall...

512
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:18,834
whether this place has...

513
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,999
any valuables for me.

514
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,209
And how many are there?

515
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:24,083
Are they worthy for me to go in?

516
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,125
The Serpents' tomb was unlike...

517
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:27,999
the tomb of Zhongyuan people.

518
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:30,292
This place has been reconstructed.

519
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:32,501
Such intricate traps.

520
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,292
It could be the works
of the Mute Riders.

521
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,250
Be careful.

522
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:07,709
Little lifesaver,

523
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,167
all this walking is wearing me out.

524
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:12,459
Can we take a break?

525
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:13,417
Please.

526
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,709
You're so troublesome!

527
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:16,083
Lao Yang.

528
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:18,584
Let's take a break.

529
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,000
Thank you.

530
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:25,125
I'm exhausted.

531
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:35,584
I...I have some food here.

532
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:40,501
I have two here.

533
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:43,125
Here.

534
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:45,334
Thank you.

535
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:46,876
Give it to me.

536
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:51,501
Little brother,

537
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:53,209
you've been reminding us...

538
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:54,999
along the way not to let our skin...

539
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,000
touch this tree.

540
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:00,083
What is the reason for that?

541
00:36:02,918 --> 00:36:05,292
Just listen to my advice
if you want to live.

542
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,501
Little brother,

543
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,792
looks like...

544
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:13,792
you're quite familiar
with this environment.

545
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:16,876
But based on my understanding,

546
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,083
even Mr. Li's...

547
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,375
Tombs Collection...

548
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:23,667
doesn't mention about this tree.

549
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:24,667
That's enough.

550
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:26,125
Are you done?

551
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,417
Or do you...

552
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,250
still have some energy to spare?

553
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,626
Fine.

554
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:33,125
I'll say no more.

555
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:41,459
Wu Xie,

556
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:44,459
how about this?

557
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:45,042
You see,

558
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,042
we still have hundreds
of meters ahead.

559
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:48,751
Based on his physical strength,

560
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,751
we might need to spend
our night on the tree.

561
00:36:59,209 --> 00:36:59,834
Lao Yang,

562
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,125
I feel like...

563
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:03,584
something...

564
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:04,501
is looking at us.

565
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,042
Nothing there,

566
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:14,250
other than the three of us,

567
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:16,083
and the dead one down there.

568
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,417
Or is his ghost...

569
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:19,626
looking at us?

570
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:21,000
Stop your nonsense.

571
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:23,125
Here.

572
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:26,584
Under this situation,

573
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:28,334
don't let your imagination run wild.

574
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:31,542
It's like when you just
finished a horror film,

575
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,751
you feel like...

576
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,542
you're surrounded with ghosts.

577
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:39,999
Little lifesaver,

578
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,334
what did you see?

579
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,334
Don't... don't scare me.

580
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:48,626
Is there any other...

581
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:51,626
living things on this tree?

582
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:54,083
I told you not to imagine things.

583
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,250
We found such a gigantic bronze tree.

584
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,584
If we notify the government,

585
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,959
do you think...

586
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,459
they will name it after us?

587
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:02,959
Lao Yang Bronze Tree?

588
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,250
Ever heard names like Wanger
Mazi Rectangular Cauldron...

589
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:06,751
or Zhao Tugen Triangular Wine Chalice?

590
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,000
I know the name sounds awful.

591
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,459
But give me some time.

592
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:12,542
I'll think of...

593
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,918
a name with a western ring to it.

594
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,417
Teacher Liang,

595
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:17,667
are you ready to walk now?

596
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:19,167
Let's go.

597
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:20,834
Let's go.

598
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:25,000
Move faster.

599
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:28,292
I can't.

600
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,751
I'm scared of heights.

601
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:34,083
Come on.

602
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,292
Please start your performance.

603
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:47,667
Good.

604
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,000
That's nice.

605
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,834
What's going on?

606
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:40,751
What happened?

607
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:47,626
Sounds like someone's up here.

608
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:49,792
Could it be your friends?

609
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,417
It...

610
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:51,501
It's impossible.

611
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:52,792
The fire in the coffin array...

612
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:53,751
couldn't be put out so soon.

613
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:54,959
It can't be Uncle Tai and the rest.

614
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:57,209
Then who...

615
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:58,959
could it be?

616
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,042
Could it be...

617
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,542
the companions of that corpse?

618
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:05,375
That's bad.

619
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
We'll be disadvantaged...

620
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:09,626
if a conflict is triggered.

621
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,999
I'll go and take a look.

622
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:13,667
Don't be rash.

623
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:15,000
What if they have guns?

624
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:15,876
I have one too.

625
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,209
Listen to me first.

626
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,375
They're in the dark,
while we're easy targets.

627
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,334
We don't even know how many...

628
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:19,751
are there.

629
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:20,792
We can't act rashly now.

630
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,000
Our priority now...

631
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,042
is to keep walking.

632
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,000
Faster.

633
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:25,834
Faster, faster.

634
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:26,626
Go, go, go.

635
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,000
Little lifesaver,

636
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:28,876
-slow down.
-Go.

637
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:29,375
Faster.

638
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:30,667
Keep walking.

639
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:34,834
Be careful.

640
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:44,584
Keep up.

641
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:54,000
Old man,

642
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:55,918
are you sure...

643
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
you have the strength to climb up?

644
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:58,501
Don't worry, Teacher Liang.

645
00:40:58,626 --> 00:40:59,667
Like how we did it just now,

646
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:00,751
we will pull you up.

647
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:04,125
By the way,

648
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,959
if we bump into...

649
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:06,999
your companions on the way,

650
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,209
we'll need you to talk to them.

651
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:09,501
Forming a collaboration...

652
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,626
is better than a conflict.

653
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,709
Don't worry.

654
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:12,792
Peace will benefit both parties.

655
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,250
Peace will benefit both parties.

656
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,083
Don't you try playing dirty tricks.

657
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,250
Don't worry, don't worry.

658
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:21,709
Come, give me your hand.

659
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:25,250
Let's go.
