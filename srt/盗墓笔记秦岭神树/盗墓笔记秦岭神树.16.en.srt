"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:07,102
"Episode 16"

3
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,125
My ancestor took the cloth out...

4
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,667
only after he was home.

5
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,542
It was full of words.

6
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,626
But my ancestor was illiterate.

7
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,083
After he grew up,
he joined the military.

8
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,209
He fought many wars for years,

9
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,000
and gradually,
he made some contribution.

10
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:41,999
He was promoted to an officer.

11
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:45,000
It was then that he heard,

12
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,292
the battle near his house...

13
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,709
started because the Grand Marshal...

14
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:54,000
sent an assassin to
kill the young prince.

15
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,334
But the young prince's escort team...

16
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:58,250
was nothing ordinary.

17
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,876
It's a troop called the Mute Riders.

18
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,209
The Mute Riders?

19
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,542
Wait a minute.
That name is really strange.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,792
Mute,

21
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,834
means they can't speak.

22
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:11,334
So, the team...

23
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:14,501
is made up of mute individuals,
be it the general or the soldiers.

24
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,042
Only a team like this...

25
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,417
can keep secrets.

26
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:21,417
As their job is to raid tombs.

27
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,250
Whenever they found a tomb,

28
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:26,999
they would not
take the treasure first.

29
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,292
Instead, they'd mark its location,

30
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:31,792
and seal that place.

31
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,626
Then they'd return to dig it
only when it was needed.

32
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:39,959
So, those were the locations of
ancient tombs written on the cloth?

33
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:41,542
My goodness.

34
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,000
Then, won't your family tomb explode?

35
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:44,459
I mean,

36
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:47,959
your ancestor must
have been rich then.

37
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,709
But my ancestor couldn't read!

38
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,709
By the time he was old,

39
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:57,250
his family ruling had declined.

40
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,834
When he died,

41
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:00,876
it was a real pity.

42
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,751
He was buried with the broken
clothes he used to wear years ago.

43
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,250
After that,

44
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:11,209
my family had gone through
many years of ups and downs.

45
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,876
During late Qing Dynasty,

46
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,876
my great-grandfather's era,

47
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,292
he was quite wealthy.

48
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,667
So, he became a landlord.

49
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:21,292
And then, it occurred to him
to move the family tomb...

50
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,042
to a place with good feng shui,

51
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:26,167
so that the family's
descendants can be lucky.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,250
But in the process of moving,

53
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,751
they found that everything
inside the tomb was broken,

54
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:37,959
except for this cloth that
was still in perfectly kept.

55
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,999
What is it?

56
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:48,626
I heard something.

57
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:54,834
It's okay.

58
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:57,375
It's just the animals as
we're in the mountains.

59
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:58,250
Forget it.

60
00:04:58,334 --> 00:04:59,083
Go on with your story.

61
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,125
Okay.

62
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,000
So, my great-grandfather
couldn't read the words...

63
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,375
no matter how hard he tried.

64
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:09,959
Therefore,

65
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,584
he brought the cloth
to an antique merchant,

66
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:17,125
and found that the cloth was
actually something extraordinary.

67
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,834
The words were written in Braille.

68
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,501
It's said that only
a mute understands it.

69
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,751
The cloth happened to be
the legendary Tombs Collection.

70
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,959
In it lies the locations of tombs.

71
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,501
Are these the tomb locations
that you've found over the years?

72
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,959
Whenever I found a tomb,

73
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,125
I'd check the trap inside,

74
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:45,250
and seal it off again.

75
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,250
If His Majesty needs it,
I'll go and excavate it again.

76
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,375
The ones marked with
ink were already raided,

77
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:57,834
but the others aren't yet.

78
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,417
You mean,

79
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,334
take out all the burial
objects in these tombs...

80
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:04,000
to exchange for money and food,

81
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:08,542
so that we can recruit our own
soldiers to fight the Grand Marshal?

82
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,250
Everybody has different fate.

83
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,042
It should've been Li family
who became wealthy.

84
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,292
Mr. Li, since you have
such a precious thing,

85
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,125
you should've given us a bigger cut.

86
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:28,584
Things handed down by
ancestors will come to an end one day.

87
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:32,042
Furthermore, this cloth is incomplete.

88
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:35,083
It only shows the
locations of 24 tombs.

89
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,959
And we're already
on our way to the last one.

90
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,876
But,

91
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:43,834
this should be the richest
one among the 24 tombs.

92
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:45,375
Mr. Li,

93
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:47,000
is there anything about...

94
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,459
what's inside the tomb on the cloth?

95
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,083
It wasn't written in details.

96
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,292
But it stated that...

97
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,083
the treasure in this tomb...

98
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,167
are more than enough
for ordinary people.

99
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,834
It's of the best quality!

100
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:08,042
Best treasures come with grave danger.

101
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,125
Therefore,

102
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,584
we can't let our guard down.

103
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,834
He's right.

104
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,209
Let's tail them.

105
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,334
We can have what we want
even if we hide behind them.

106
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,667
Let's not look for that stupid altar!

107
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,083
Uncle Tai, what's wrong?

108
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,000
Looks like there are more than
just animals in the mountains.

109
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,167
Er Mazi,

110
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,042
follow me.

111
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,334
It's the mountain patrol! Hurry!

112
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,292
Let's get out of here!

113
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,709
Hurry up.

114
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:11,459
Uncle Tai, let's go.

115
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:12,626
Let's go!

116
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:13,709
Come on.

117
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,000
Are we going after them?

118
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:23,542
Why?

119
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,834
It's so dark now.

120
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,292
If we go after them like this,

121
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,584
they'll notice us sooner or later.

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,042
Let's find a place to rest.

123
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,417
We'll follow their
footsteps tomorrow morning.

124
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:33,876
I believe they won't go far,

125
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,459
as they also need rest.

126
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,375
Where is this?

127
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,626
What are you two doing here?

128
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,792
Sir, madam.

129
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:16,000
Can you tell us how far are we...

130
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,250
from here to the village
up that mountain?

131
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:20,667
You mean, our village?

132
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:21,209
Yes.

133
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:25,125
Why did you come all the
way to our run down village?

134
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,209
We're just passing by.

135
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,834
And we were entertained
by a man there 2 years ago,

136
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:31,584
so we wanted to visit him.

137
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:35,042
But we forgot the way
there as it's been 2 years.

138
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,334
You look so sneaky!

139
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,083
Who knows what you're up to?

140
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,876
I've seen many people like you!

141
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,167
You're either tomb raiders or hunters!

142
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,584
You're still not up to the
standard to deceive me!

143
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,584
Hey, madam.

144
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:48,626
Sister,

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,042
this brother of mine is quite rude,

146
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,918
but he's not a bad guy.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't look nice either!

148
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,167
I know many toy boys
who do bad things too!

149
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,459
Didn't your family teach
you speaking manners?

150
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,167
Did you see us raiding
tombs or hunting illegally?

151
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:00,584
Enough.

152
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:01,959
We're just asking for directions.

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,667
Yet you keep babbling.

154
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:03,292
How about this?

155
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,250
Speak politely,

156
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,542
and this hundred dollars is yours.

157
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:09,999
Don't be so greedy!

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,417
Enough.

159
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:12,542
Brothers,

160
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,125
my wife isn't so good with words.

161
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:14,999
Please don't mind her.

162
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:15,709
It's okay.

163
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,083
You're headed to our village, right?

164
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,125
Choose the left path ahead,

165
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,000
and you'll see a mound.

166
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,000
There's a waterfall.

167
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,999
Just go straight following the water.

168
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,292
That's the fastest route to
climb over the mountain.

169
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,334
Sir,

170
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,918
don't lie to us, okay?

171
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,459
Why would I?

172
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,542
Brothers, it's late now.

173
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,292
You may not make it
to our village tonight.

174
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:36,918
You'll have to spend
a night on the mountain.

175
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:38,209
You're not familiar with this place,

176
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,125
and might go the wrong direction.

177
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:41,834
If you do,

178
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,459
you'd really get lost.

179
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:44,959
How about this?

180
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,751
We're collecting our
pig feed at the front.

181
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:47,999
Please wait for us.

182
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:49,626
When I'm done,

183
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:50,584
we'll leave together tomorrow.

184
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:51,626
You'll be safe then.

185
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:53,999
But...

186
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:56,751
We've been here for 3 days,

187
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,417
and we're running out of food.

188
00:10:58,626 --> 00:10:59,626
Let's just go with them.

189
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,375
We can also ask more details
about the place to avoid getting lost.

190
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:04,167
Okay.

191
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:05,542
Sir,

192
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,542
we'll have to trouble you then.

193
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,209
No trouble at all.

194
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:13,584
Please lead the way.

195
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:14,459
Sure.

196
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:15,918
Let's go, dear.

197
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,792
Come on.

198
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:17,999
Sir, what's your name?

199
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,042
Brother,

200
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm Da Shan.

201
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,667
How has the village
been this couple of years?

202
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:23,751
It's still the same.

203
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,459
What a perfect shack.

204
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:32,959
There are even 2 rooms.

205
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,209
Did you build it yourself?

206
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:36,459
No.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,375
All the villagers
raised fund to build it.

208
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,292
Sometimes we can't make
it back home late at night...

209
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,042
after we enter the mountain,

210
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:46,834
this is where we'll spend our night.

211
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:48,459
See,

212
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,125
all these bags...

213
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,417
are filled with rations.

214
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,167
Just in case.

215
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,167
Da Shan,

216
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,375
stop chit-chatting.

217
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:58,417
Get some early rest.

218
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,584
We have to wake up early tomorrow.

219
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,000
Got it.

220
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:02,834
You sleep first.

221
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,918
You too should go to bed early.

222
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,334
I'm going to sleep now.

223
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,083
Rest early.

224
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,918
The sound seemed to
have came from here.

225
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:17,876
You're right.

226
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,209
It was from here.

227
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:25,959
Cigarette butts.

228
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:27,792
They're still hot.

229
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,083
What's that?

230
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:31,334
Pull it out!

231
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:32,334
I'll cut it off!

232
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:32,959
Don't!

233
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:35,709
It's a person.

234
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:36,918
Whoever's in there,

235
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:37,999
please let go.

236
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,999
Or I'll cut your hand off.

237
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:48,250
Who's there?

238
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,417
Who's inside this hole?

239
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,876
My son is being locked up inside.

240
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,292
He has mental illness.

241
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,626
Then you should take him to a doctor.

242
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,876
Even if he has mental illness,
you can't lock him here!

243
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,751
You're his father,

244
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:22,709
how could you be so heartless!

245
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,417
He's my only son!

246
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,042
I can't bear to see him like this too!

247
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:36,918
But I have no choice.

248
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,876
He's too sick.

249
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,334
It's all my fault.

250
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,792
I didn't take good care of him.

251
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:48,459
He entered the jungle with his cousin.

252
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,584
Although we've been living
in the mountain for generations,

253
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:56,626
there are many areas in 800-mile
Qinchuan that one cannot set foot on.

254
00:16:57,334 --> 00:17:02,250
Even an experienced hunter dares not
wander around in these mountains.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,834
However,

256
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,167
the 2 kids were too bold.

257
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,999
They said they were going hunting.

258
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,417
When we realized
they had gone missing,

259
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,292
we looked for them immediately.

260
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,626
But we couldn't find
them no matter how.

261
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,209
After over 10 days,

262
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:32,959
we thought they would
never be able to return.

263
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,709
My wife almost became
blind for crying too hard.

264
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,125
But who knew,

265
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,834
they came back out of a sudden.

266
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,959
It wasn't a prey that
they brought back,

267
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:50,042
but a bronze twig instead.

268
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,709
A bronze twig?

269
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:55,375
Yes.

270
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:58,292
I assume that was bronze.

271
00:17:58,918 --> 00:17:59,709
It was heavy,

272
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:02,709
and full of green rust.

273
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,209
They said they found
a huge pit in the mountain,

274
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:12,334
and a big bronze
tree was inside the pit.

275
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:13,834
Don't you think...

276
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,834
they were talking nonsense?

277
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:19,459
They even said that...

278
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,834
those twigs will make
their dreams come true,

279
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,792
or help them gain longevity.

280
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,125
Even if I'm uneducated,

281
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,792
I know this is absurd!

282
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,083
But as if being cursed,

283
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,417
they wouldn't step
away from that twig.

284
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,083
Gradually,

285
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,999
we thought there was
something wrong with them.

286
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,459
The way they looked
at others was creepy.

287
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,417
What's so special about that thing?

288
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:12,876
Why do you keep staring at it?

289
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,334
What will you get from that?

290
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:16,459
Don't you need to work?

291
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:19,667
I'm real.

292
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,042
What? You're fake.

293
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,042
I'm real!

294
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,501
I'm real.

295
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,250
I'm the real one!

296
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,417
Don't lie! You're dead!

297
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,542
Don't you think you
can have it your way.

298
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,125
Don't dream about
harming people when I'm here!

299
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:35,292
I didn't harm anyone!

300
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,999
He killed his cousin.

301
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,667
We paid his uncle 20 thousand
dollars as compensation,

302
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,167
and tried very hard
to persuade them...

303
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:04,876
that my son will take care
of them when they're old,

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,375
and attend their funerals
and mourn for them.

305
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,125
Then only they let him off.

306
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,000
As if things are not
ridiculous enough,

307
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:16,667
he insisted that his
cousin had died in the pit.

308
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,042
And that the person who came
back with him was a fake one.

309
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:21,792
Well,

310
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:24,375
isn't this nonsense?

311
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:28,167
We watched him grew up.

312
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,792
Can't we tell if he's real?

313
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:33,876
Then,

314
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,834
he became even more insane,

315
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,792
saying that even me
and his mom are fake,

316
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:44,501
as both of us were killed by a wolf
when we were collecting mushrooms...

317
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:47,000
in the jungle.

318
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,626
It was probably because...

319
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,334
two bodies were found in
the jungle those few days.

320
00:20:55,834 --> 00:21:00,042
They were bitten
off to almost nothing.

321
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,501
I shouldn't have let him see that.

322
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,292
It was too shocking for him.

323
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,083
That's why...

324
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:11,667
he became so hysteric that
not even cows could stop him.

325
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:16,000
He stood by our bed holding
an axe in the middle of the night.

326
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,876
It had us shaking in fear!

327
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:24,584
Then,

328
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,209
he even beat us.

329
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:29,542
So I thought, this can't go on.

330
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,250
I had to tie him up.

331
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,876
But his pitiful mom,

332
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,709
when she was feeding him rice,

333
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:41,751
he bit her at her neck.

334
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:45,959
Her blood could've filled half
a basin, and she almost...

335
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,751
I had no other options.

336
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,999
The villagers were all against him.

337
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,876
Who wasn't afraid that
he might kill someone?

338
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,918
I can only lock him up here.

339
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,209
And bring him food...

340
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:11,876
once in a while.

341
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,125
He's my only son.

342
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,459
He's my only son!

343
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:20,751
Fake.

344
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,125
Everything's fake.

345
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:25,375
Everything's fake.

346
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:27,334
Everything's fake.

347
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:39,709
Then,

348
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,167
what about the bronze twig?

349
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,959
My son wanted to stay
with it no matter what.

350
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,959
So, I buried it inside the hole.

351
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,918
That bronze twig is useless to you.

352
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,209
How about this?

353
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,792
Sell it to us.

354
00:22:58,999 --> 00:22:59,709
No way.

355
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:01,083
That thing is cursed.

356
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,125
It'll bring misfortune!

357
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,876
It's okay.

358
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,417
We're experts in ethnic studies.

359
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:06,501
We're really interested in that.

360
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:07,375
We're not afraid.

361
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,626
No way!

362
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:10,876
My son has gone crazy,

363
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,000
do both of you want to go crazy too?

364
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:22,083
Fake.

365
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,417
Everything's fake.

366
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:25,250
Everything's fake.

367
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:27,459
Everything's fake.

368
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:28,876
Everything's fake.

369
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,042
Everything's fake.

370
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,501
Do you think he's telling the truth?

371
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,626
Fake, everything's fake.

372
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,459
I think so.

373
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,792
When someone suddenly goes nuts,

374
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,792
the whole village must know it.

375
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:45,292
If he was lying to us,

376
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:47,334
-we would know once we ask.
-Everything's fake.

377
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:51,167
So, he's gone crazy
because of a bronze twig?

378
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:58,876
If a bronze object can
make someone insane,

379
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:02,542
then with so many
bronze objects dug out before,

380
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,459
countless people must have gone crazy.

381
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:06,918
You're right.

382
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,083
Maybe he was just carried
away by his greed for wealth.

383
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,209
When he killed his cousin,

384
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,751
he must've been thinking
that he wanted his treasure.

385
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:15,542
But,

386
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:18,751
a person who was once normal
is now being locked up under a mound.

387
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,000
That's really cruel.

388
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,667
What could he have done otherwise?

389
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,375
He's too poor to go to the hospital.

390
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:28,542
Not to mention,
the son is a violent murderer.

391
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:29,834
What else could he have done?

392
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:31,417
Enough. Let's go.

393
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:33,542
Every family has its own problems.

394
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,083
Let's get back and rest.

395
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,292
We have a long journey tomorrow.

396
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:41,667
Everything's fake.

397
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:43,999
Everything's fake.

398
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:48,876
Fatty,

399
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:50,501
I've thought about it.

400
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,834
Let's visit Da Shan when we're back,

401
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,918
and take his son to an asylum.

402
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:56,250
I'll pay for it.

403
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,209
How many people can
you help like this?

404
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,792
Frankly speaking, not many.

405
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,459
But I happened to know this matter,

406
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,584
so I have to help them.

407
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:08,876
Why?

408
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:27,292
Fatty.

409
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:29,042
That's Da Shan.

410
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,417
When did you two get in front of me?

411
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:42,083
Let's go.

412
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,000
You lead the way.

413
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:55,667
He...

414
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,083
Look.

415
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:41,792
Brothers,

416
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,125
you've been busy all night long.

417
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:44,459
Get some rest now.

418
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,542
I'll be guarding tonight.

419
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:47,375
Never mind.

420
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:48,542
I'm fine with this.

421
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:49,459
And we're not sleepy.

422
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,042
This is just great.

423
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:52,834
Seriously.

424
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:53,626
I'm sorry.

425
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:55,751
You see, we're...

426
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:56,417
too impolite.

427
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,125
We're too impolite.

428
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:03,375
What is it?

429
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:04,042
Then...

430
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:05,167
Then you should rest now.

431
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,125
I'll rest too.

432
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,000
I think he's alive.

433
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:28,959
Could it be a hallucination?

434
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,000
This is really creepy.

435
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,375
Wu Xie woke up from his sleep,

436
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,918
and felt more at ease emotionally.

437
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:22,959
The exhaustion from the long journey,

438
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,626
and Fatty's sudden jitters...

439
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:27,125
almost drove him crazy too.

440
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,834
Wu Xie knew that the
strange story that Da Shan told...

441
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,999
was just a groundless assumption.

442
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:33,918
In this late jungle night,

443
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,709
with the respiring plants and
decomposing animals and insects...

444
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,292
the levels of oxygen
will easily reduce,

445
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:45,584
thus forming fog that
causes hallucination.

446
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,125
You didn't sleep well?

447
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,209
I had a nightmare.

448
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,959
Uncle Da Shan, where's your wife?

449
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,542
She returned to the village
earlier to prepare meals for you.

450
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:17,834
How much further are we?

451
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,125
We'll arrive...

452
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:21,292
after this mountain.

453
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:23,417
Da Shan!

454
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,584
Da Shan!

455
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:25,751
Da Shan!

456
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,751
Da Shan.

457
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,667
What is it? Tell me quickly.

458
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:33,042
Widow Wang and
Madam Zhang are fighting again!

459
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,375
It was really rough.

460
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:35,459
No one could stop them.

461
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:36,709
Hurry up and take a look!

462
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,876
Those troublemakers!

463
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:40,459
Guys,

464
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:41,209
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,709
Something happened in our village,
I have to handle it.

466
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:44,959
No!

467
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,000
We have to...

468
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,459
-You promised to show us the way.
-That's right.

469
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:51,626
I don't quite know
the paths in the mountain.

470
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,584
I only heard it from others.

471
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:54,834
How about this?

472
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,167
I'll find someone for you.

473
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,459
He'll know for sure.

474
00:29:57,584 --> 00:29:58,167
Okay?

475
00:29:59,042 --> 00:29:59,584
But...

476
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:03,375
Widows are troublesome.

477
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,459
Are you Mr. Liu?

478
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,209
Sorry for disturbing.

479
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:15,584
We're here for ethnic
studies on the village.

480
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,876
We have some questions for you.

481
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:19,667
Studies?

482
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,709
I bet you're tomb raiders.

483
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,292
Don't try to cheat me.

484
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,876
I've seen many people like you.

485
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,334
Sir,

486
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:30,626
please believe us.

487
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:32,209
-We're really...
-Don't start that with me.

488
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,999
I don't care and I won't care.

489
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,626
Fine.

490
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,584
Then who is going to lead us there?

491
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,834
I don't care what you're here for,

492
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,752
but you can't go to Jiazi Falls now.

493
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:46,459
I won't let you work for nothing.

494
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,709
It's not about money.

495
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,167
The mountain is in
its evil period now.

496
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,042
Ghosts are roaming there.

497
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:55,918
At night,

498
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,459
there is ghost fire everywhere,

499
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,417
as if it's a city full of ghosts.

500
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:02,667
Sir,

501
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,792
there are things that are
inexplicable by science,

502
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:08,542
but the ghost fire you were talking
about is actually phosphorescence,

503
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:10,667
which means human and animals.

504
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,459
Don't you dare say that.

505
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,375
If the King of Ghosts heard that...

506
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:17,751
and got angry,

507
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,292
he'll smash the whole
mountain into nothing.

508
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:22,834
Exactly!

509
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:24,709
See, even King of Ghosts exists.

510
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:25,667
Come and sit.

511
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:26,501
Seriously.

512
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:30,209
There is a King of Ghosts.

513
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:32,626
How scary.

514
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:33,999
It's a Ghost General.

515
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:34,959
Is it?

516
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:37,959
So, tell us.

517
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:39,584
We're all ears.

518
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,459
This story is passed
down by our ancestors.

519
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,042
Try asking around in the village.

520
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:56,709
During Northern Wei dynasty,

521
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,501
there was a spooky army.

522
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,250
None of them spoke.

523
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:05,501
Since then,

524
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:11,250
sounds of horses galloping
are often heard around here.

525
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,083
Your destination...

526
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:16,417
is the same place where they headed,

527
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,501
Jiazi Falls.

528
00:32:23,626 --> 00:32:25,292
When can we start a fire?

529
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:27,083
I'd like a cup of hot coffee.

530
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,959
We'll do it after we
get past this village.

531
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,167
I really wonder when they will leave.

532
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,709
Here, have a Zihai hotpot.

533
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,334
Wu Xie will leave at
first light the next day...

534
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,834
after he stops for a day.

535
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:45,667
Just as expected from Ms. Ning.

536
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:47,459
You know your target well.

537
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:50,792
But I think,

538
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:52,959
though he's said to be the
descendant of the Mystic Nine,

539
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,584
Wu Xie doesn't seem capable.

540
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:57,999
He does whatever you tell him to do.

541
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,375
How stupid.

542
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:01,999
How do you know
he's not suspicious at all?

543
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:03,584
If he is,

544
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,334
why would he follow our arrangement?

545
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:13,125
He's bursting with curiosity.

546
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,584
He'd even walk straight into a trap...

547
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:18,000
just to find out what's in there.

548
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:19,999
I guess kindness pays.

549
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,000
He managed to
escape danger every time.

550
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,501
Don't underestimate him.

551
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,417
So, he's dangerous?

552
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,834
Can you take us there then?

553
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:55,334
I have aged,

554
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,792
I can't take the trouble to do this.

555
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:00,375
And other villagers
have never been there.

556
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,209
How about this?

557
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,083
If you really...

558
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:08,834
want to go there,

559
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,417
I'll give you the direction.

560
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:13,375
Just follow my instructions,

561
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:17,375
and you'll be there
within 7 or 8 days.

562
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,125
But after you get in,

563
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:23,000
you're on your own.

564
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,125
I want to ask something else.

565
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:26,999
Did Uncle Da Shan's son...

566
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:29,751
become crazy after he
brought back a bronze twig?

567
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:35,292
Uncle Da Shan told me this himself.

568
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:37,375
And this brother of mine is too kind.

569
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,751
He wants to find out the whole story.

570
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,667
What if the son can recover...

571
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,250
after he's sent to
the asylum in the city?

572
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:49,876
No, he can't.

573
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,042
Why did you say that
before even trying?

574
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,584
In our village,

575
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,876
he's not the first person who got mad.

576
00:34:58,292 --> 00:34:59,626
Since a very long time ago,

577
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:03,125
many villagers went to the
mountain to pick bronze objects.

578
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,250
Some also picked ceramic shards...

579
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,167
or jade pieces.

580
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:10,292
But this is really strange.

581
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:13,751
Only those who
picked bronze objects...

582
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:17,250
would go crazy in a few days' time...

583
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:20,417
if they didn't throw
the bronze objects away.

584
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,209
And when they did,

585
00:35:22,382 --> 00:35:25,006
they'd either kill
others or themselves.

586
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,083
If throwing it away is the way,

587
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,125
why does Da Shan's son still keep it?

588
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:30,542
Back then,

589
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:33,918
I've reminded Da Shan
to throw away the twig.

590
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,042
But it was really creepy.

591
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,999
Whenever Da Shan took that twig away,

592
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,667
his son would go out of
control for a very long time.

593
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:45,834
Da Shan could not stand this,

594
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,501
so he kept it.

595
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:48,417
But,

596
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:51,459
he was also worried that
the twig will affect others.

597
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:52,959
Then,

598
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,834
he moved out of the
village with his son,

599
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,083
and took the twig along.

600
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:47,083
I've spent almost
1,000 yuan in the village.

601
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,417
Consider it a little
money for bribery.

602
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,542
They don't make much money every year.

603
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:54,792
The kids...

604
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:56,751
were so excited when they saw...

605
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,000
-my dried food and Hardtack crackers.
-Look there.

606
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:00,334
Fatty.

607
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:02,918
Who's peeing over there?

608
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,999
How much do you believe in the
story about the Tombs Collection?

609
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:19,792
Most of it.

610
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,876
But there are 2 parts
that are bugging me.

611
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:24,751
Firstly,

612
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,918
people in those times are uneducated.

613
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:29,834
The old people don't
even recognize their leader,

614
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:31,918
let alone their own dynasty.

615
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,667
But he kept talking
about Northern Wei.

616
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:38,334
So the dynasty must be one
of the fixed details in this story.

617
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:39,292
Secondly,

618
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,876
they had an army
that doesn't speak at all.

619
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,250
Even though there were sounds,

620
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:45,459
people only heard the
sounds of weapons and horses,

621
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:46,584
there was no human voice.

622
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:47,375
So,

623
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:49,959
Northern Wei and a mute army,

624
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:50,876
what can you relate?

625
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:55,000
Could it be the Tombs
Collection that guy mentioned?

626
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,876
I'm pretty sure it is.

627
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,334
Don't jump about like a monkey.

628
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:08,417
"Crossing the high
and dangerous peaks,"

629
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:12,667
"the road ahead is long and endless."

630
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,876
What's the next line?

631
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,083
I only found these
2 lines on the internet.

632
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:20,083
"I shall search my own hope."

633
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,584
Not bad.

634
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,584
Anyway, we'll still go on...

635
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:27,042
even if the path
ahead is full of hardships.

636
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:35,250
Fatty,

637
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:37,417
didn't I place my bag here?

638
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:39,751
Yes, but where is it?

639
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:45,918
My bag was stolen.

640
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,334
It was just here.

641
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,042
Is it the monkeys?

642
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,542
Fatty, we must find the bag.

643
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:54,584
The bronze bell is in it.

644
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:56,834
But there's still nothing I can do.

645
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,834
Have you been to Emei Mountain?

646
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,375
Have you seen the monkeys
returning what they've stolen?

647
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,334
Stupid monkeys.

648
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:06,000
Let's go.

649
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:06,999
It's useless.

650
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,250
We can forget about the bell,

651
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,792
but what about our equipments?

652
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,751
I have them in my bag too.

653
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:14,751
Use them carefully and
we'll make it to the tomb.

654
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:15,834
Furthermore,

655
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:18,250
you can get as many bells
as you like on the tomb's altar.

656
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,125
Okay?

657
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,417
And it's not valuable.

658
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,083
Let's go.

659
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,876
Come on!

660
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,918
We have to go before the night comes.

661
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:28,375
Hold on.

662
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,876
What were you doing?

663
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,542
In case those monkeys attack us.

664
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,999
I'll let them know who's
the boss in the jungle now.

665
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,083
Wait, I have to stop here.

666
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,167
Take a break, I can't go on anymore.

667
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,083
This place is so beautiful,
like it's heaven-made.

668
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:04,959
So, enjoy the view.

669
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:05,834
I'm tired.

670
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:07,959
Can you stop babbling?

671
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:10,375
It's the fault formed
by crustal movement.

672
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:11,125
Who?

673
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:13,000
Crustal movement.

674
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,292
What's the fault thing you said?

675
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:15,667
Here, give me your bag.

676
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,250
It's the fault.

677
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:22,334
Let's go.

678
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:28,375
Is he related to Duan Yu?

679
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,250
What a steep road.

680
00:40:46,918 --> 00:40:48,375
Promote physical culture.

681
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,459
Build up the people's strength.

682
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:52,542
Do exercises.

683
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,626
Is that a hole up ahead?

684
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:56,792
Is it the entrance?

685
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:00,626
Fatty.

686
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,459
What is it?

687
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,250
Look.

688
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:16,626
What's up with the face?

689
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,167
It's a Terracotta Sacrifice.

690
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:20,792
In ancient wars,

691
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:22,709
success was measured
by the number of kills.

692
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:24,417
A whole body would
be too heavy to move.

693
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,292
So, they'd cut off the head instead.

694
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,125
See, this head is
stuck on a terracotta...

695
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,250
because he was buried as a sacrifice.
