1
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,530
"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,200
"Episode 10"

3
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,240
These are all poorly displayed.

4
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Besides,

5
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,720
look at those in the middle,

6
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,960
they are not exactly eye-catching.

7
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,320
What kind of style is this?

8
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,120
The ones on the sides,
the middle one...

9
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,800
Just leave them be.

10
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,680
Let's look around for the
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

11
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Snake Eye Copper Horse.

12
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
Snake Eye Copper Cow.

13
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,200
Fatty, look at that.

14
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,440
This painting's lifespan
will be reduced.

15
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,000
This painting should be
kept away from dust and light.

16
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,000
In particular the ultraviolet rays,

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,760
which will cause a great
damage to the paintings.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
It will make them
hardened and brittle.

19
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,960
I need to talk to the curator.

20
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,240
This is so unprofessional.

21
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,880
Hold on, this isn't really
necessary for you to...

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not your shop.

23
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,200
Though it's true that
the lighting is so...

24
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,360
I mean you can't even look
at the painting properly.

25
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,040
Excuse me, sir.

26
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,640
Hello.

27
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
I need to talk with Hendry.

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,520
Hendry?

29
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,920
You can find him over there.

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
-Okay, thanks.
-That's fine.

31
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,040
It really isn't
necessary for you to...

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,520
He's so meddlesome.

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,120
Those are the things...

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,560
that everyone try to
get their hands on.

35
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,720
And of course,

36
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,800
if you ask...

37
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,920
how much are these,

38
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
but it's really hard for me
to give you any idea.

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,120
These things need to be organized.

40
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Excuse me, sir.

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,000
May I talk with...

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,760
Hendry?

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,320
Wait a moment.

44
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
-I'll find you later.
-All right.

45
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,120
What's the matter? May I help you?

46
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,280
Good to see you.

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,360
My name is Wu Xie.

48
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,720
Hello, Mr. Wu.

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,440
You're so fluent in Chinese.

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
I had lived in China...

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,680
for a long time.

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
It's a beautiful country.

53
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,600
Thank you.

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,840
How may I help you?

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,480
Here's the thing,

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,960
I'm truly passionate about artifacts.

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,960
It's such an honor...

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
to visit your museum.

59
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,040
But I've noticed...

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,960
some slight issues.

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,360
The preservation of certain...

62
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,560
precious artifacts could be improved.

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,720
For example, those paintings.

64
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,800
If the lighting...

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
could be...

66
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,960
slightly adjusted,

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,320
-they could...
-Precious?

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,560
Mr. Wu, is that a praise...

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,080
on those waste paper?

70
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,080
Waste paper?

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,760
Most of those paintings...

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
were artifacts from Ming
and Qing dynasties.

73
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,560
The painters were nobodies.

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,680
They don't worth much.

75
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,200
For me,

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,520
they are not much different...

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
to waste paper.

78
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,880
But you collected them,

79
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,480
you have the duty to protect them.

80
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,480
That is your responsibility.

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,160
An investment, sir.

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,640
It's just an investment.

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,360
I have many artifacts...

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,680
in my museum...

85
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,080
that are much more valuable than them.

86
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
Though, it still needs
some embellishment.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,680
I see it now.

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,240
You don't love artifacts.

89
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,080
You're just a businessman.

90
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,480
Businessman, art collector...

91
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,920
It's just a label.

92
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
No matter what,

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
Chinese people should thank me...

94
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
and other people like me.

95
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,320
All right.

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,320
I get it.

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,720
But you should know that...

98
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,560
these artifacts...

99
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,920
could worth more...

100
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,280
if they got better preservation!

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,200
Yes.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,520
It isn't hard...

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,320
and it won't cost me much.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,320
But,

105
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,840
unless I could live long,

106
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
and these artifacts
could belong to me forever,

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
otherwise, their future...

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,120
is worthless to me.

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,040
Couldn't you at least...

110
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,040
consider the future generation?

111
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,840
Appreciation or hatred...

112
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,320
is meaningless...

113
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,360
for a dead man.

114
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,680
Mr. Hendry!

115
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,600
What's the most important...

116
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,400
for you?

117
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,280
Life and death.

118
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,560
So that's Hendry.

119
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,760
I saw that you two were arguing.

120
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,680
What were you fighting about?

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
I've walked around.

122
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,320
There's no fish.

123
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,520
That reminds me,

124
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
I've forgotten to ask
about the auction.

125
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,720
Chill, relax.

126
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,440
Let's ask around.

127
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,320
Hello, hello.

128
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,040
Come here, come.

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
Go on and ask him.

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Excuse me, sir.

131
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,920
Do you know about the auction here?

132
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm sorry, sir.

133
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
You must've been mistaken.

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,760
There's no auction here.

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,760
That's fine.

136
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,880
I'll show you the picture.

137
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,840
Give me a second.

138
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,320
Do you know about...

139
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,160
this Chinese snake?

140
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I know that your museum...

141
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,360
has the Chinese snake.

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,240
Do you know about this?

143
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm sorry, sir. I've
never seen this before.

144
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,320
Why is he shaking his head?

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
He's never seen the
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

146
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,120
And there isn't any auction.

147
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,640
No?

148
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,080
No...no...no.

149
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,480
We came here for this.

150
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,760
Coming to this foreign country.

151
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,680
We flew from Beijing.

152
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,560
It's impossible that
you don't have it here.

153
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,760
Sorry, sir.

154
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,320
We saw that...

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,120
on your...

156
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,920
museum's website.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,480
We came here just
for the Chinese snake.

158
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,400
A kind of snake-shaped
Chinese artifact.

159
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,280
Have you seen it?

160
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,520
I have no idea.

162
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,080
I knew it.

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,040
It was a scam message.

164
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,360
We should've checked it through...

165
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,480
before we came.

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,200
What a waste of time.

167
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,000
This is so strange.

168
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,240
Uncle San Xing?

169
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,160
What?

170
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,600
What are you doing?

171
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,960
What are you after?

172
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,720
I saw Uncle San Xing.

173
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,680
Your Uncle San Xing?

174
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,400
What is your uncle doing here?

175
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,280
It's not possible.

176
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,680
I'll look around.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,560
No, wait...

178
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,880
And you were so sure about...

179
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,000
the auction of
Snake Eye Copper Fish too!

180
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,320
You...

181
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,960
Where is he?

182
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,320
Where is he?

183
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,320
It really is Uncle San Xing.

184
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,840
What is he doing there?

185
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,720
Why is he talking...

186
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
to that guy?

187
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,320
Who is that?

188
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,160
I saw him talking with the curator...

189
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,560
in the museum just now.

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,000
But I don't know...

191
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,800
who he is.

192
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,640
Hendry?

193
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,360
Go and ask him then.

194
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,120
Go now.

195
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,160
Hello, can you take a photo for us?

196
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Never mind, go ahead and
take the photo for them.

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,080
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

198
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Okay, thank you.

199
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,240
Fatty.

200
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,240
Fatty, where is my Uncle San Xing?

201
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,280
He's gone!

202
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,120
Just disappeared
like the Little Master.

203
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,800
Seriously.

204
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,600
He's totally gone. What should we do?

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,400
Let's go.

206
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,400
Let's go after the foreigner.

207
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,920
Let's go.

208
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
Hurry, follow him.

209
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,840
You drive this same car in China.

210
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,200
You chose to rent this model
in a foreign country as well.

211
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,560
Do you have any obsession with this?

212
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,040
Is you ex-girlfriend called Maserati?

213
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Stop it.

214
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,400
Say, the guy in front...

215
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,760
has taken the box that my uncle...

216
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,680
gave him.

217
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,360
Where is he going?

218
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,000
He certainly can't be
meeting Uncle San Xing.

219
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,120
He surely can't be meeting him
both morning and evening.

220
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
It's not like they're dating.

221
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,120
Fatty,

222
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,480
what do you think is going on...

223
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,160
between Uncle San Xing,

224
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Hendry...

225
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,120
and this tall guy?

226
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
And what about the auction?

227
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
Is the Snake Eye Copper Fish...

228
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,400
even in the museum?

229
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:52,960
Hey,

230
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,560
can't you ask me questions
that I know the answers to?

231
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,600
Fatty,

232
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,600
I feel like...

233
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
my life...

234
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,040
is a giant puzzle.

235
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,240
It's like there's an
exit everywhere,

236
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,800
but you only notice when
you walk out of it that...

237
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,800
it's all leading to a dead end.

238
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,320
Hey,

239
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
can you please control...

240
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,720
your emotions?

241
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,160
Stop being so serious all the time.

242
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,472
What if...

243
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,480
-you get depressed?
-I won't.

244
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,920
Listen,

245
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,920
the message that we
received in Beijing,

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
and the website...

247
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
they were all guiding us here.

248
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,160
And we both thought that
we could find the...

249
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,880
Snake Eye Copper Fish here.

250
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,920
But we found nothing...

251
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
now that we're finally here.

252
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,440
I've been trying to say this,

253
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,800
this whole thing is full of...

254
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,760
one word, schemes and...

255
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,880
sorry, two words,

256
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
schemes and tricks.

257
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,920
You're saying that...

258
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,920
someone is setting us up?

259
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,520
There are only few people...

260
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,480
who are capable of drawing you away...

261
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,280
from China.

262
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,280
It's not the kind of thing...

263
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,080
Uncle San Xing would do.

264
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,040
Stop bringing up...

265
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,400
your Uncle San Xing...

266
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,520
all the time.

267
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,320
What about the other one?

268
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,920
Ning.

269
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,120
Ning?

270
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,320
Her company?

271
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,760
But why?

272
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,880
Since you've managed to
survive the underwater tomb,

273
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,000
she's been waiting
to kill you overseas.

274
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,800
Besides, the investigation
will be harder...

275
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
if you are killed overseas.

276
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,560
Not to mention,

277
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,280
the cost of killing you...

278
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,320
is so affordable this time,

279
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,560
since we paid for our
own plane tickets.

280
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,760
What a smart move.

281
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,040
But Ning doesn’t know about...

282
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,200
the Snake Eye Copper Fish.

283
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,160
Not necessarily.

284
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,320
Like in the underwater tomb,

285
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,880
it was Ning who tricked you there...

286
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,480
through your Uncle San Xing.

287
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,560
And she was so convincing...

288
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,920
when she told you
about Uncle San Xing...

289
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,880
and the archeology team.

290
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
She might even know...

291
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,680
Xie Lian Huan was holding the...

292
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
Snake Eye Copper Fish when he died.

293
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
But the copper fish photo...

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,720
on the website...

295
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,680
was real.

296
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,680
Ning has the Snake Eye Copper Fish.

297
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,720
You're good!

298
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,000
She's exposed now.

299
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,880
Good for you.

300
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,040
You actually figured it out
and cracked the case!

301
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,040
Look at their firearms.

302
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,920
Could this be a military base?

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
Doesn't look like one.

304
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,080
Hello, sir.

305
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,000
Your invitation card, please.

306
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,320
Fatty,

307
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,440
looks like we need an
invitation to go in there.

308
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
You're right, what should we do?

309
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,960
How would I know?

310
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,640
Do I look like an
invitation card to you?

311
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,560
-Come up with something.
-Do you take me as...

312
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,720
Sir.

313
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,720
Forget it, get off the car.

314
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,480
Here...here...here.

315
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,640
This...this...this.

316
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,600
Get off now, go.

317
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,200
Let's just get in separately.

318
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,840
-See you in there.
-Fine.

319
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,960
-Fine.
-See you later.

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
What should I do?

321
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,480
Please wait a moment.

322
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,640
Please show us your invitation.

323
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,400
Hello.

324
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,560
I am the VIP here.

325
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,880
I just forgot to bring
my invitation card.

326
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,440
Could you let me...

327
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,280
attend the event tonight?

328
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,120
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,960
You're only allowed in...

330
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,640
with the invitation card.

331
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,800
I really have the invitation card.

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,160
But I'll miss tonight's event...

333
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,280
if I go back to get it.

334
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,320
And tonight is...

335
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,080
such a big deal for me.

336
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,840
I'm sorry, sir.

337
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,600
I can only let you in...

338
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,520
with the invitation card.

339
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,160
But...

340
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,160
You invitation card is here.

341
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,320
Hold on.

342
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,480
Please show us your invitation card.

343
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm with her!

344
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,440
Tina.

345
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,400
Go home, talk next time.

346
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,040
Putting a boy ahead of your friend.

347
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,760
Come on!

348
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Why are you helping me?

349
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,200
It's such a beautiful night,

350
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
I need a...

351
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,160
young and handsome date.

352
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,640
Put it on for me.

353
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,880
My pleasure.

354
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,120
What should I do? What should I do?

355
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,120
Let's go.

356
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Are you serious?

357
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,480
-Hello.
-What is wrong with you?

358
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,200
So sorry.

359
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,000
Take a look at it.

360
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,320
You ruined my shirt.

361
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,240
I didn't mean it.

362
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,440
I'll make it up to you.

363
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,640
Good evening, sir.

364
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,840
Please.

365
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,480
Please, sir.

366
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,960
Please, go ahead.

367
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,320
Hands up.

368
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
-Okay, please.
-Please.

369
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,160
-Please.
-Good evening.

370
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,080
Put your hands up.

371
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,280
Okay.

372
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,520
Where's your invitation card?

373
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,080
He's with me.

374
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,560
That's my friend.

375
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
If he's not coming,

376
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,360
I'm not coming.

377
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,240
We're sorry, please.

378
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,040
This way, please.

379
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,440
Hands up.

380
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,200
Thank you.

381
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,320
It's nice to meet you.

382
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,080
I think it's going to be...

383
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,480
a wonderful night.

384
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,000
Hi, Alice.

385
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,880
My friend is over there.

386
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,960
Let's go over there.

387
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,240
I'll introduce you to each other.

388
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,040
Sure.

389
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,040
But...

390
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,240
my friends are here too.

391
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,240
I would like to find them first.

392
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
I'll meet you later, is that okay?

393
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,480
But you could see my friend first...

394
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,760
before you find yours.

395
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,080
I'll be back soon.

396
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Okay.

397
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,160
Father.

398
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:02,311
Whenever I look at the silk book,

399
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,920
I think about...

400
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,760
the human history.

401
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,080
There are so many...

402
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,200
mysterious treasures.

403
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:11,960
You see,

404
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,760
if it wasn't for the inspiration...

405
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,200
I got from the silk book...

406
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,720
in the Chinese tapestry,

407
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,320
who would have thought that the
silk book would've been a pattern.

408
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,800
This is the pattern...

409
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,040
from the silk book?

410
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,880
Yes.

411
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,240
What does it mean?

412
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,280
We're still working on it.

413
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,480
What?

414
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,080
I can't believe we've got it...

415
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,000
after so many years of searching.

416
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,160
Yes,

417
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,200
I've spent most of my life...

418
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,800
solving this puzzle.

419
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,400
You know,

420
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,520
soon,

421
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,960
my time will be up.

422
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,960
I know...

423
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,640
vampires are timeless.

424
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,680
But for them, there's only darkness.

425
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,360
Where's the meaning in that?

426
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,000
You're right, Ning.

427
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
If there's a way...

428
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,000
to live forever...

429
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,960
without the need to
hide in the darkness...

430
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,960
like a vampire,

431
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,520
will you use it?

432
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,520
For sure.

433
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,840
Me too.

434
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,240
But that's...

435
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
extremely unlikely.

436
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,920
Otherwise, the world...

437
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,280
would be...

438
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,440
full of...

439
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,160
ageless humans.

440
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,200
Maybe it's something...

441
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,280
only few people can access.

442
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,920
And it's full of...

443
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,120
unpredictable changes.

444
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,520
Father,

445
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,440
you make it sound real.

446
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,320
Is the auction ready?

447
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Everything's ready.

448
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,480
The person you asked for has arrived.

449
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,040
I hope this man will
not disappoint me.

450
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm so gonna talk about
this with your manager!

451
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,440
I didn't mean it.

452
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm so sorry.

453
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,480
Sorry.

454
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,640
Come with me.

455
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,080
No...no.

456
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,080
Come with me, come with me.

457
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,800
Come.

458
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,040
My phone...

459
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,760
Have you found it?

460
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,920
The angle is not good enough.

461
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,800
Look towards your 11 o'clock.

462
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,800
Done.

463
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,880
This should be enough.

464
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,880
I'm looking like a fool.

465
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,680
And I don't think this catalogue...

466
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,280
contains all the exhibits.

467
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,960
Yes.

468
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,560
Let me take a look at it.

469
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Exhibit No.105.

470
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,840
Do you like this one?

471
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,880
This exhibit looks good.

472
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,520
Yes, honey. I like this one.

473
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Miss, would you like to
have a drink with me?

474
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,760
Sorry, today I'm...

475
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,560
Excuse me.

476
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
Why didn't you have a drink with him?

477
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,600
I will have a drink with you though.

478
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,200
How is it?

479
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,520
Can you hear me clearly?

480
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,280
Do you need me to walk over there?

481
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,360
-Hello.
-Sir.

482
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,280
Do you have cocktail?

483
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
I have wine...wine.

484
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,160
No...no...no.

485
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,320
-I don't want any wine.
-Good...good.

486
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,840
-This is good.
-I want a cocktail.

487
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,600
-Very good wine.
-No...no...no.

488
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,760
Okay, never mind.

489
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,040
Sorry...sorry.

490
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,160
How did you get in here?

491
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,160
That's not the way to talk to a VIP.

492
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,760
No way.

493
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,760
We got in here together.

494
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,040
How are we in different classes?

495
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,360
I want to be a VIP too.

496
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,520
I don't want to be a waiter.

497
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,320
So do you want a wine?

498
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,080
No, thanks.

499
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,240
-Let's get to business.
-What a poser.

500
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,000
The Snake Eye Copper Fish
is really here.

501
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,800
What is its number?

502
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,320
Find out its number.

503
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,600
It really is here!

504
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,240
Turns out our trip
isn't a waste of time.

505
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

506
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,840
this auction will start soon.

507
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,080
If you like any items,

508
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,680
just raise your hand
with the bidding number.

509
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,800
Go and find a seat now.

510
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,400
-Don't stand with a waiter, go.
-Please leave your contact...

511
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,520
if you want to bid.

512
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,440
Someone will contact you...

513
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,840
about the payment and how
to take away the property.

514
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,240
That's for sure, of course.

515
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,280
It's called delivery.

516
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,880
Now,

517
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,200
everybody,

518
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,800
so let's see...

519
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,680
the first item of the day.

520
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,240
Please.

521
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,560
Ladies and gentlemen,

522
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,280
as you can see,

523
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,640
this is a Buddha's statue from India.

524
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,960
It was brought to the United States
by an American businessman...

525
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,480
in the 17th century.

526
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,040
So the bidding price
for this item is 2 million.

527
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,120
2 million.

528
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,520
3 million.

529
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,200
4 million over there.

530
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

531
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,400
4 million for the statue.

532
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,000
5 million here.

533
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,120
What about 6 million?

534
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
6 million for the item.

535
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,160
Anyone?

536
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,760
6 million once.

537
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
That gentleman, 6 million.

538
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,800
6 million once.

539
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,920
Let's wrap it up.

540
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,160
Deal.

541
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,320
Congratulations to this gentleman.

542
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,920
Wonderful piece of art.

543
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,800
Look at that.

544
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,640
He's here.

545
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,360
Look at him sneaking out.

546
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,520
Start the car.

547
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,880
Let's go after him.

548
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,240
Fatty.

549
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,800
Are we done?

550
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,600
Let's go now.

551
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,760
Who?

552
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,560
That Audi in front.

553
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,080
That one? Okay.

554
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,760
Why's he coming back to this place?

555
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,640
These guys...

556
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
get their hands dirty in the business,

557
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,280
yet they still pray for...

558
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,920
the blessings of Buddha.

559
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,960
What's the meaning of it?

560
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,400
This place is filled with
different kinds of people,

561
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,280
and lots of tourists.

562
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,760
It's just a camouflage for them.

563
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,240
Come on.

564
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,520
Let's look around.

565
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,080
I think I've seen that guy before.

566
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,880
Where did you see him?

567
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Yes, in Panjiayuan.

568
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,080
He's an expert in Chinese culture.

569
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,560
He has a particular interest in...

570
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,480
traditional handicrafts.

571
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,880
He learns from masters all around.

572
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,440
Though he uses his
skills to do bad things.

573
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,280
He has dealt with
Mr. Han, Mr. Sun...

574
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,800
and Mr. Zao before.

575
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,600
Selling artifacts overseas.

576
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,520
An auctioneer...

577
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,440
and an artifact seller.

578
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,760
I'm guessing that...

579
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,200
they are the ones...

580
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,160
who's selling those stuff...

581
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,520
in the auction.

582
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,520
It won't be a pity even if...

583
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,520
they were executed by
having their bodies shot at...

584
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,560
for 5 full minutes.

585
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,160
What's wrong with you?

586
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,960
Are you having a temper
because you haven't slept all night?

587
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,960
Fatty,

588
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,000
did you take a look at
the construction behind?

589
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,320
A magnificent...

590
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,320
golden pagoda like this...

591
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,560
can't be constructed without faith.

592
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,720
It serves as the support of faith...

593
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,600
that's guarding this little town...

594
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,920
and protecting the people in town.

595
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,760
Therefore,

596
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,160
faith...

597
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,800
is very important.

598
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,680
What are you talking about?

599
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,800
Fatty,

600
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,320
do you have faith?

601
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,640
I have.

602
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,000
You know it.

603
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,760
This.

604
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:19,800
Why?

605
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,240
What is your faith?

606
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,080
I want to do...

607
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,240
things that are meaningful.

608
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,400
Fatty,

609
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,120
tonight,

610
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,320
we must win the bidding of...

611
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,040
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

612
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,320
Mr. Wang.

613
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,320
It's fine for you to joke
around other times.

614
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,960
Can't you be helpful
at this critical moment?

615
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,120
Go to hell!

616
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Fine, cut it out. Get lost.

617
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,440
I've known you for many years.

618
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,920
I've never asked for your help before.

619
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,360
But this time,

620
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,840
I'm really in a crisis.

621
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Can you lend me some money?

622
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,960
Any progress from your side?

623
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Yes, yes.

624
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,800
I understand.

625
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,080
Then about the money...

626
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,840
Hello? Hello?

627
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,195
"Beike Real Estate"

628
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Hello, Mr. Li.

629
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,000
It's me, I'm Wu Xie.

630
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,920
Wu Xie.

631
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,240
Yes, I was the one who called you.

632
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,920
I know you're busy,

633
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,800
you probably didn't see it.

634
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,280
I heard about you,

635
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,440
you want to borrow some money, is it?

636
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,000
Yes...yes.

637
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,360
You heard about it.

638
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,240
I'm sorry to disturb you.

639
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,240
Can you lend me some money?

640
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,760
I don't want it.

641
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,520
I said I don't want it.

642
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,440
What do you mean by this?

643
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,160
I sold a house in a
real estate listings site.

644
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Just take it. It's heavy.

645
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,480
I'll put this down for you.

646
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,160
I might...

647
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,800
need some time to pay you back.

648
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,720
By the way,

649
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,640
let's say that...

650
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,840
I've paid you back for my debt.

651
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,760
Stop asking anything from me.

652
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,880
I'm really not paying you back then.

653
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,360
Let's go.

654
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,080
Be ready.

655
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

656
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,600
it was a wonderful evening.

657
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,160
I'm very glad that everyone...

658
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,360
could come to today's auction.

659
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,240
And I'm very pleased...

660
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,880
to introduce a new item to you.

661
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,600
Please.

662
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,280
This is good stuff.

663
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,360
What is this doing here?

664
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,280
Isn't this normal?

665
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
China's relics were lost...

666
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,880
in the fire of Yuanmingyuan Park...

667
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,320
during the Anglo-French
expedition to China.

668
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,080
But this is even rare in China.

669
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,760
I've never seen one in
such good condition...

670
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,200
despite my years in the industry.

671
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,560
They're all in foreign collections.

672
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,440
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

673
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,640
it's the most beautiful vase...

674
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,480
in Yuanmingyuan of the Qing dynasty.

675
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,680
There's a touching story...

676
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,600
behind this porcelain vase.

677
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,160
No way.

678
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,680
China's artifact...

679
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,520
can't fall into the hands...

680
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,480
of foreigners.

681
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,040
There are hundreds and thousands...

682
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,960
of these artifacts overseas.

683
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
And they are all good stuff.

684
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,200
Do you think you can save all of it...

685
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,280
by just saving this one?

686
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,160
Just let it go.

687
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,440
Of course.

688
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,720
Let me tell you...

689
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,880
the touching story behind it.

690
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,120
Only the luckiest man...

691
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,040
could have this beautiful vase.

692
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,080
It was in Qing Dynasty,

693
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,120
and it is right now
in the modern world.

694
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,040
He is right.

695
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,800
The porcelain vase...

696
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,200
is from the era of Kangxi.

697
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,120
It's valuable and very rare.

698
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,640
What is he talking about?

699
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,960
They used this beautiful vase...

700
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,400
as the symbol of their love.

701
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:29,840
He is introducing...

702
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,600
the history of this artifact.

703
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,120
He said it's from Yuanmingyuan,

704
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,400
the Empress Dowager Cixi's...

705
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,320
favourite item.

706
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,520
See, he got the time right.

707
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,560
But Uncle Sam does not...

708
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,120
wish this to happen,

709
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,880
he must let her go now.

710
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

711
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,160
the price of this
porcelain bottle is...

712
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,640
10 million.

713
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

714
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,960
I got a 11 million over there.

715
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,640
Xiu Xiu.

716
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

717
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,480
11 million.

718
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

719
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,520
11 million going once,

720
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,160
11 million...

721
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,960
12 million now.

722
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

723
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,600
over here.

724
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,160
Think it through.

725
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,000
That's porcelain vase.

726
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,400
Not...

727
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,160
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

728
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,400
I know.

729
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,000
But I can't let it...

730
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,960
fall into the foreigner's hands.

731
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,760
It's him.

732
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,000
I will play with you.

733
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,200
This lady,

734
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,280
bids for 13 million.

735
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,000
Hold on,

736
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,640
Chinese, Chinese.

737
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,440
That's Chinese.

738
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,040
Stop bidding for it...

739
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,920
since that's a Chinese now.

740
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,160
Don't you move.

741
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,120
Don't be impulsive.

742
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,440
13 million.

743
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,920
14 million now from the gentleman.

744
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,400
14 million,

745
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,560
ladies and gentlemen.

746
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,720
I've got a 15 million.

747
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,160
What are you doing?

748
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,320
15 million,

749
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,480
ladies and gentlemen.

750
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,080
16 million from the...

751
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,960
first row of woman in the middle.

752
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,520
It's done, it's done.

753
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,320
Just let her bid for it.

754
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,600
Do you really need
to compete with her?

755
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,200
Why has she got on you?

756
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,080
Is 16 million the highest of bid,

757
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
ladies and gentlemen?

758
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,560
Anyone else?

759
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,840
16 million going once,

760
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,120
16 million...

761
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,120
Isn't that Wu Xie?

762
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,840
What is he doing here?

763
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,360
Who's that guy sitting next to him?

764
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
That's Fatty Wang.

765
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,600
16 million going twice.

766
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,760
17 million...

767
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,080
from the young gentleman sitting
in the first row on my right.

768
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,640
17 million.

769
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,440
17 million.

770
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,960
Think it through.

771
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,360
Between the Snake Eye Copper Fish,
your Uncle San Xing,

772
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,720
and the porcelain vase,
which is more important?

773
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,080
Stop bidding.

774
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,040
Stop bidding, give that to me.

775
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,480
Stop bidding, give it to me.

776
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,440
18 million.

777
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,080
Still the young gentleman...

778
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,000
on my right in the second row.

779
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,360
18 million,

780
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,520
ladies and gentlemen.

781
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,920
Hello, is this the police station?

782
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,560
Wonderful, ladies and gentlemen.

783
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,840
18 million now.

784
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,480
Since when did Wu Xie...

785
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,680
become so wealthy?

786
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,560
Ladies and gentlemen,

787
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,240
18 million sold!

788
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,160
This vase belongs to this...

789
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,320
young gentleman now.

790
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
That's my money there!

791
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,960
The police will be here in 10 minutes.

792
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

793
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,080
please calm down.

794
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,480
I just received a tip saying that...

795
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
the police will arrive...

796
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,960
in 10 minutes.

797
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,480
Are you the one who did it?

798
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,480
You know it.

799
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,120
Stop smiling.

800
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,600
What should we do now?

801
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,680
Get off work.

802
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,640
There is no need to panic.

803
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,520
10 minutes is enough
for everyone to leave.

804
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,120
Thank you.
