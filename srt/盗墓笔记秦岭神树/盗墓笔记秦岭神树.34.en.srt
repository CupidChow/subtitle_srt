00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:10,375
Bu Xun.

4
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,250
The immortality spell...

5
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:14,125
is a rare find.

6
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,334
Whoever sees it...

7
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,667
can never resist it.

8
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,542
You're my brother-in-law,

9
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,626
my family.

10
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,125
You're the one I trust the most.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know where you're coming from.

12
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,751
Even though I want...

13
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,667
to get the immortality spell,

14
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,083
I've never thought of...

15
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,751
excluding you.

16
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,959
So,

17
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,751
don't you forget your brother.

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,709
Gao Yuan,

19
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:49,626
my brothers...

20
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,083
died in front of me.

21
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:55,667
There's no...

22
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,292
immortality spell in this world!

23
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,209
If you don't come to your senses now,

24
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,501
more people will die because of you.

25
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:16,375
If you still see me as your brother,

26
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:19,167
give it to me.

27
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,125
Gao Yuan,

28
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,125
we're made of blood and flesh,

29
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,292
how can we be immortal?

30
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:35,999
I can't bear...

31
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,000
to see you destroying yourself.

32
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:39,834
We've worked so hard...

33
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:41,751
to build this military force.

34
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,000
Are you going to
let that be destroyed?

35
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,667
Because we've given so much,

36
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:47,709
that is why I want
an equivalent reward!

37
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,918
Do you know how slim our chances are?

38
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,375
I will try it no matter the chances.

39
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,834
Even if it's only a 1 percent,

40
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,000
0.1 percent,

41
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,792
or 0.01 percent chance of success,

42
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:59,250
I'll take the chance!

43
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:03,542
What the ancients couldn't achieve...

44
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:06,626
doesn't mean that I can't.

45
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,876
Have you forgotten...

46
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,000
how I managed to...

47
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,334
get to where I am today?

48
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,667
It was with my wisdom,

49
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:21,000
my skills,

50
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,709
and my ambitions!

51
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,042
I'll be frank.

52
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,709
If I can be the general,

53
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,334
I can be the president too!

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,876
However,

55
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,042
I'll need time...

56
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,834
to achieve that.

57
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,542
But with all my plannings,

58
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,999
the only mistake I've made...

59
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,417
is to have trusted you!

60
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,292
I didn't expect that the one...

61
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,709
who would betray me...

62
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,542
was you!

63
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,459
Since you won't believe a word I say,

64
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:08,375
then you may as well think...

65
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,000
I betrayed you.

66
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,334
Do you really want to be a betrayer?

67
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,417
Don't you know the consequences!

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,711
"Classified Information"

69
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:40,459
Lieutenant,

70
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:52,959
I'll go with you.

71
00:05:59,125 --> 00:05:59,709
All right.

72
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:07,792
What's the matter?

73
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:09,876
Lieutenant,

74
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,459
I've searched every
corner of the tomb.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,083
Where exactly did you go?

76
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,000
What happened after that?

77
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,417
Where did he go?

78
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,125
It's not stated.

79
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:23,709
But this incident...

80
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,334
has troubled Dou Cheng ever since.

81
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,042
He mentioned this
quite a few times afterward.

82
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,542
He didn't understand...

83
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,792
what happened to the Lieutenant.

84
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:33,375
According to him,

85
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:35,584
Lieutenant Zhang was
preoccupied ever since.

86
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:36,375
Preoccupied, okay.

87
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:37,417
What happened afterward?

88
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,584
Then they entered the tomb again.

89
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,083
Did they find the immortality spell?

90
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,042
No idea.

91
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,542
Most probably.

92
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,751
He knew that Zhang Gao Yuan...

93
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:48,751
wouldn't let him off.

94
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,375
Why did they insist on
returning to the tomb?

95
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:55,334
General,

96
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:56,501
I've found them.

97
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,000
Zhang Bu Xun and Dou Cheng...

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,959
have both entered the tomb.

99
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:01,334
They've brought everything.

100
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:02,375
Perhaps...

101
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,459
they're staying for good.

102
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,375
What do you think?

103
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,083
You said that...

104
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,250
he was lost in there for days.

105
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,167
Since he's going in again,

106
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,167
he must have found something.

107
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,417
I'd suggest to stop
beating around the bush.

108
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,751
We can command an elite troop...

109
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,375
and point a gun at him.

110
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:26,709
That'll make him talk.

111
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,876
Even if you shoot him...

112
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,459
with your gun,

113
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,876
he still won't talk.

114
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,501
I knew him since young.

115
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,209
He is stubborn,

116
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,501
and can only be reasoned with logic.

117
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,501
Forcing him like that...

118
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,959
won't do us good.

119
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,125
What do we do then?

120
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,125
Summon Qing Ping.

121
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:03,584
Understood.

122
00:09:59,459 --> 00:09:59,999
Lieutenant,

123
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:01,626
letter from Qing Ping.

124
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,709
What did she say?

125
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:29,918
She wants me home.

126
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:32,792
Dou Cheng,

127
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,292
arrange a time...

128
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:35,751
to bring Qing Ping here.

129
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,209
I'll feel better when...

130
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:38,834
she's with me.

131
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:40,709
Lieutenant,

132
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,542
she's the General's sister.

133
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:43,417
Aren't you worried that...

134
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:44,667
I know her better.

135
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,999
She, the General and you...

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,542
are the most important
people in my life.

137
00:10:58,834 --> 00:10:59,751
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

138
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,501
I shouldn't have suspected her.

139
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,292
The General treated you badly.

140
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,000
Why are we still back here...

141
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,959
to guard this place?

142
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,792
He won't give up.

143
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,876
I can't bring myself to...

144
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,501
see him succumb to that.

145
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:21,792
What's your plan then?

146
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,417
Lieutenant,

147
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:24,209
please excuse us.

148
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,501
I don't have a plan yet.

149
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:36,375
Let's guard here for now.

150
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:38,751
It makes me more at ease.

151
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,375
But, you can't live here forever.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,250
Living here forever...

153
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:48,459
doesn't sound too bad.

154
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:49,999
This is a quiet place.

155
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:52,584
It won't be long...

156
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:55,125
before Gao Yuan comes back.

157
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,375
He's given up on you.

158
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,292
Why are you doing this to yourself?

159
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:00,626
He may have given up on me,

160
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:03,000
but I won't give up on him.

161
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:04,918
Nobody moves!

162
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:10,250
How dare you!

163
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,167
I can't believe...

164
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,250
you really betrayed me!

165
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,125
Gao Yuan,

166
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,751
I'll listen to you for anything else.

167
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,209
But, not this.

168
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,292
Not even if you kill me!

169
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:26,042
You just want to
save it all to yourself!

170
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:29,250
Do you still not get it?

171
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,876
Immortality is nothing but witchcraft!

172
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:33,709
If you continue,

173
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,375
millions of innocent
lives would be lost.

174
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:37,876
All those wars...

175
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,626
have already killed so many!

176
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,042
I'm telling you this.

177
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,584
If I become immortal,

178
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,209
I'll bring prosperity to the people!

179
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:44,876
No,

180
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:46,959
you'll only be more insane!

181
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,501
Lieutenant!

182
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,751
Brother! Bu Xun!

183
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:53,501
Bu Xun!

184
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,250
What happened to you?

185
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:00,000
Stay put!

186
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,125
Your husband has gone crazy!

187
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,667
He wants to kill your brother!

188
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,083
Bu Xun.

189
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,918
I've told you...

190
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,417
that I won't kill you.

191
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,584
I'm here to bring Qing Ping with me.

192
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,042
Keeping the immortality spell...

193
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,209
for yourself is like killing me.

194
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,751
Gao Yuan,

195
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:31,999
you're obsessed.

196
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:34,626
Have a walk with me.

197
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,459
Brother, Bu Xun.

198
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,584
Can't you two talk nicely?

199
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:42,918
Do you have to do this?

200
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,000
I treat you as my brother,

201
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,626
but you play me like a fool!

202
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:49,334
Bu Xun!

203
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,250
I'll explain to you...

204
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,292
when we get out.

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,792
Freeze!

206
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,959
Qing Ping, I'm sorry.

207
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,959
The car can only reach here.

208
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,459
You'll have to walk with me.

209
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:55,918
Lieutenant.

210
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,125
It's freezing on the mountains,

211
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,501
don't catch a cold.

212
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,209
We're far from home.

213
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:09,542
You're bleeding!

214
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:10,834
Where did you get hurt?

215
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,083
It's fine, this isn't my blood.

216
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:15,250
Let's go.

217
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,375
Bu Xun.

218
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,792
What is it?

219
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:24,542
Bu Xun,

220
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,250
can you tell me what happened...

221
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,626
between you and brother?

222
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:33,000
Haven't I told you this?

223
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,417
Gao Yuan wanted me to find...

224
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,334
the immortality spell in the tomb.

225
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,167
He'll come back for you.

226
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,542
And you have to
get information from him.

227
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,292
But brother said that you've found it.

228
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,626
I've found it,

229
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,501
but not completely.

230
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:48,999
I've only found some leads.

231
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,334
If that bomb filled with virus...

232
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:52,501
is detonated,

233
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,918
The destruction would be unmeasurable.

234
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,334
If anyone wants...

235
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,042
to get that power,

236
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,250
a price has to be paid.

237
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:02,501
Think about it,

238
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,125
how great of a cost...

239
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,417
it would be for immortality?

240
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,959
When one becomes the walking dead,

241
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:11,375
what meaning is there...

242
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,501
to becoming immortal?

243
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,999
So, you and brother...

244
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,083
have both turned against each other?

245
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,250
Where will we go next?

246
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:30,918
Qing Ping,

247
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,751
will you struggle
for a few years with me?

248
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,000
With the immortality spell,

249
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:36,501
we can both...

250
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,000
reign above all!

251
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,042
Qing Ping,

252
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:49,542
can you cope with...

253
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:50,626
the environment here?

254
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:53,834
I was yours when I became your wife.

255
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:55,042
Wherever you go,

256
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:55,709
I will follow.

257
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:57,000
A family...

258
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,709
should always be together.

259
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:01,334
That's good.

260
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:03,000
Settle down,

261
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:05,292
Dou Cheng got us a rabbit...

262
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,334
for us to eat.

263
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,792
Join us soon.

264
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,459
We're family.

265
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,167
Can't we talk things out nicely?

266
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,209
Do we have to do this?

267
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,417
Family?

268
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,751
I see Bu Xun as family,

269
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,417
but does he treat me like one?

270
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:48,542
But,

271
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,584
he's my husband after all.

272
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:56,584
Qing Ping,

273
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,209
I know that you love Bu Xun very much.

274
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,918
And I certainly wish we can...

275
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,959
live together happily as a family.

276
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,876
Bu Xun has turned against me,

277
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,334
he won't listen to me anymore.

278
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:13,751
Bu Xun...

279
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,125
Brother,

280
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,792
Bu Xun can be stubborn sometimes,

281
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:18,876
but he...

282
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,709
still thinks of you as a brother!

283
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,083
I'm sure!

284
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,083
He won't betray you.

285
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,125
Qing Ping,

286
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:35,083
Bu Xun is my brother.

287
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,250
Even if I'm mad at him,

288
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,167
I won't abandon him.

289
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:44,334
But first, you have to help me.

290
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:49,626
Persuade him...

291
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,542
to hand it out.

292
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:56,417
Then, we can live together...

293
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:58,459
for all eternity.

294
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:01,626
Sound good?

295
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,918
Zhang Bu Xun found out that...

296
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,000
Qing Ping is a spy
sent by his brother.

297
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,250
He knew them too well.

298
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:25,083
He knew that...

299
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,709
Zhang Gao Yuan wouldn't give up...

300
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:27,751
the immortality spell that easily.

301
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,626
Why did he still...

302
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,584
ask Qing Ping to live here together?

303
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,375
Why?

304
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:33,501
For information?

305
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,250
But he lived here,
what was he afraid of?

306
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:39,375
There's another suspicious aspect.

307
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,334
According to the diary,

308
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,042
the day when the
main chamber tomb opened,

309
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,375
all soldiers were inflicted...

310
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,417
with corpse poison.

311
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:48,792
Lieutenant Zhang asked
Dou Cheng to get guns...

312
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,709
for backup.

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,167
But when he returned,

314
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:52,626
Lieutenant Zhang was gone.

315
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,125
For two days,

316
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:55,292
he searched everywhere...

317
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,375
but to no avail.

318
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,167
Lieutenant Zhang explained...

319
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,250
that he fell down the cliff.

320
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,083
But that doesn't make sense.

321
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,626
It was clearly a lie.

322
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:05,876
That is rather strange.

323
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,959
Everyone had turned into zombies,

324
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,626
all except him.

325
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,709
Isn't that strange?

326
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,876
Just like in the movies,

327
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,501
when people get bitten,

328
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:14,918
they turn into zombies right away.

329
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:15,584
-Isn't that so?
-Cut it out.

330
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,792
Stop fooling around!

331
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,042
This isn't a TV drama.

332
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:18,876
But, then again...

333
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:37,167
Lieutenant.

334
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:39,959
Is Qing Ping asleep?

335
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:41,542
Yes.

336
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:43,792
Lieutenant,

337
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,000
it's humid in the tomb.

338
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,542
Her coughing isn't recovering.

339
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:48,459
Shall I...

340
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:49,667
look for a doctor in town?

341
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,459
All right.

342
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:54,959
Lieutenant,

343
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:56,918
it was my fault...

344
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,375
for suspecting Qing Ping...

345
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,918
as a spy sent by the General.

346
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,042
She is here to spy on me.

347
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,334
Dou Cheng,

348
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,042
do you believe in immortality?

349
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:12,501
No, I don't.

350
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:13,709
It's a sorcery.

351
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:17,417
Maybe...

352
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:19,375
we've experienced...

353
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,918
a lot of things that are...

354
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:22,709
beyond our comprehension.

355
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,042
But one thing is always certain,

356
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,125
we will lose as long as we possess.

357
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:28,709
We need to give in order to get.

358
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,375
Nothing comes easy...

359
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,459
and stays forever.

360
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,876
Many people...

361
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,042
are busy chasing after immortality.

362
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,501
All while forgetting...

363
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:37,751
the youth they possess.

364
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:42,000
They have forgotten...

365
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,250
the most fundamental thing.

366
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:44,999
There is no...

367
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,042
shortcut to life.

368
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,042
Lieutenant,

369
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,334
what's gotten into you today?

370
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:53,626
You're talking...

371
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,334
theories of life I don't understand.

372
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,000
Dou Cheng,

373
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:06,459
you've been a good friend.

374
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,042
I'm here...

375
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,959
to protect what I believe.

376
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,042
But you,

377
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,083
should lead a life...

378
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,000
the way you want.

379
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,042
I've told you before,

380
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:17,459
the best life I can get...

381
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:18,667
is by protecting you.

382
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,125
For as long as I live,

383
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,292
I hope that they can...

384
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,292
break free from the...

385
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:36,667
nightmare of immortality.

386
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,459
That is all I can do for them.

387
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:55,751
The words after this...

388
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,250
is unreadable.

389
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,501
But I feel like...

390
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,292
there's a secret behind.

391
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:04,999
I think that..

392
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:06,709
he had a...

393
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:07,959
new perception on immortality.

394
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:10,876
He seemed to have...

395
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:12,083
acknowledged its existence.

396
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:13,834
But he still didn't support it.

397
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:15,999
I got it right then.

398
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,125
He's found the immortality spell,

399
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,542
just as Zhang Gao Yuan suspected.

400
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,083
And he didn't want to let others know.

401
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,542
He's seen how Zhang Gao Yuan...

402
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:24,834
has become corrupted...

403
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:26,083
chasing after immortality.

404
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:26,834
And back in that...

405
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,042
Warlord Era,

406
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:28,999
if news...

407
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:29,876
broke out,

408
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:30,999
many more...

409
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,876
like Zhang Gao Yuan would've emerged.

410
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,709
This is what he had been thinking.

411
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:36,209
A situation deadlier...

412
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:37,709
than the virus.

413
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:39,876
So,

414
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,375
he'd rather keep this secret buried.

415
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,999
Even if it cost him his life.

416
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:53,542
Come on,

417
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:54,959
let's move around.

418
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,334
The people up there are coming down.

419
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,292
There should only be two of them.

420
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,501
It's five against two.

421
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:01,334
We can take them.

422
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:02,542
We still have to be careful.

423
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,999
The Puppeteer...

424
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:04,834
is unpredictable.

425
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,334
If he still has explosives,

426
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:08,000
it'll be our disadvantage.

427
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,083
They don't seem...

428
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,125
like ordinary people.

429
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,375
Don't you forget,

430
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:12,999
we still have no idea...

431
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:13,834
who knocked Fatty out...

432
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:14,501
and put him...

433
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:15,292
on the bed.

434
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:16,918
Neither their exact number,

435
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,125
nor their hostility toward us.

436
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:19,292
We know nothing.

437
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,250
He's the one I'm looking for.

438
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:23,918
Well,

439
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:24,834
what should we do then?

440
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:38,751
Do you still remember...

441
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,209
the two-leveled tomb chamber?

442
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:41,959
Secret coffin passage?

443
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,083
I got you eventually!

444
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:51,542
Don't touch it!

445
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,542
According to Dou Cheng's diary,

446
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,459
this body might be filled with poison!

447
00:24:58,501 --> 00:24:59,417
Let's have protection.

448
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,709
He looks just like Little Master.

449
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:28,751
Where is it?

450
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:31,667
Underneath this?

451
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,334
Where is it?

452
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,584
There really is a secret passage!

453
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:47,792
Let's go,

454
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:48,834
before they get us.

455
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:49,999
Give it to me.

456
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,000
We're going upward again.

457
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,584
Will we get back to first floor?

458
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:31,083
Let's find out.

459
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:48,626
Is that the Puppeteer?

460
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,167
Hold on!

461
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:56,834
Brother!

462
00:26:58,209 --> 00:26:59,000
Xing Yao!

463
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:01,709
Brother, I've finally found you.

464
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:02,876
Why are you here?

465
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:03,999
How did you get in?

466
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,209
When we entered Fog Village,

467
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,459
Master Zhai sent me a message...

468
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,626
asking for our whereabouts.

469
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:10,417
So I told him accordingly.

470
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:13,209
Technology doesn't function well here.

471
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:14,876
I struggled quite a bit.

472
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:15,751
Brother,

473
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:16,792
look at this.

474
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:19,125
I've scanned this tomb.

475
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,375
There's a gate up ahead.

476
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:24,375
Gate?

477
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:26,250
Have a look.

478
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:27,709
Master Hua,

479
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:29,292
is your brother reliable?

480
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,209
Don't overestimate...

481
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:32,834
your own capability.

482
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,417
It's not necessary to..

483
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:35,918
explain technology to you.

484
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:37,459
I don't think you'll understand...

485
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,209
with your intelligence.

486
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,000
What's with that attitude?

487
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,792
How dare you speak to me like that.

488
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:42,709
Xing Yao!

489
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:46,501
We'll know...

490
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:48,042
if it's true when we see it.

491
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,167
Let's go.

492
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,959
This tunnel is
identical to the last one.

493
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:17,626
We must memorize the route.

494
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:18,792
Don't split up.

495
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,417
There are too many tunnels here.

496
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:22,459
It's complicated.

497
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,999
But our direction is correct.

498
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:42,501
Sunglasses!

499
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:43,542
Qi?

500
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:44,876
Why are you here?

501
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,375
It's been a while!

502
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,292
Who are you?

503
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:51,375
Don't be pretentious.

504
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,876
Why are you wearing shades in a tomb?

505
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,542
You're the Black Blindman?

506
00:28:58,334 --> 00:28:59,250
Hello there.

507
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:00,250
Qi,

508
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:01,626
why were you running?

509
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:02,542
Yeah,

510
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:03,375
tell us.

511
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:06,584
There's a zombie.

512
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:09,667
Where is it?

513
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,000
Blindman,

514
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,834
you're not as good as I've been told!

515
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,042
It's just a phantom soldier,

516
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,250
and you're frightened to death?

517
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:24,709
I can't believe you.

518
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:26,959
Hey there,

519
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,167
are you lost?

520
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:30,209
Looking for mother?

521
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,125
It's durable!

522
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,083
I've tried it.

523
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:45,834
It's no use.

524
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,042
The clothes look like...

525
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,959
it's a Mute Rider from Northern Wei.

526
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:06,167
They're the treasure troops.

527
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,209
Watch out, Fatty!

528
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:12,292
The equipment is interesting.

529
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:34,709
Naughty!

530
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:43,876
Looking for your mother?

531
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:46,083
Wu Xie,

532
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,083
I'm going too.

533
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:58,250
Run!

534
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,334
Get out of the way!

535
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:24,501
It's worn down,

536
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,250
has to be opened forcefully.

537
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:26,584
Let's go.

538
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,042
They might still be out there.

539
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,250
They stopped attacking
as there's no target.

540
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,918
We should be safe for now.

541
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:46,999
Blindman,

542
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,709
how did you encounter these soldiers?

543
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,709
They are not phantom soldiers.

544
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:53,667
According to legend,

545
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,334
there's a kind of insect...

546
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:56,709
capable of causing hallucination.

547
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:57,626
The flame...

548
00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:58,667
is generated when they...

549
00:32:58,667 --> 00:32:59,459
move their wings.

550
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:00,999
I guess these insects...

551
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:02,000
are traps designed...

552
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,083
to protect the tomb.

553
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:04,042
We accidentally...

554
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,250
triggered it when we entered.

555
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:06,876
Legend again.

556
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:09,083
How was...

557
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:11,542
the coffin, was it comfortable?

558
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:20,834
You hit me?

559
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:22,792
I was...

560
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,999
only in charge of lifting your pants.

561
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,834
And casually found you a coffin.

562
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,459
As for why you were...

563
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:29,626
in the wilderness without pants,

564
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:31,501
I have no idea.

565
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:32,751
And I certainly
don't want to know why.

566
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:35,334
I'm telling you,

567
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:37,542
you better stop with nonsense.

568
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:41,167
I'm looking for the Excavator.

569
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,000
Got it?

570
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:55,999
Qi,

571
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,250
why are you here?

572
00:33:58,999 --> 00:33:59,918
I'm looking for something.

573
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:01,292
But I can't tell you...

574
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:02,709
what that is yet.

575
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:08,792
Golden fan.

576
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,374
Judging from the shape,

577
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,041
it should be from Tang dynasty.

578
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,333
Buddha's head.

579
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,625
Should be from Northern Wei period.

580
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:33,751
This is the bronze horse
from Warring States Period.

581
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:40,459
Have you fully discovered the tomb?

582
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:41,374
No.

583
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,375
The tomb has three levels.

584
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:44,375
The first floor...

585
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,375
is only a deception.

586
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,333
Lieutenant Zhang had
modified the third floor.

587
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:48,918
Here's the second floor,

588
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,833
the place I don't want you to be in.

589
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,125
What are you talking about?

590
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,417
The tomb has three levels?

591
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:57,542
Lieutenant's tomb
is on the third floor,

592
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:58,834
and this is the second floor?

593
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:13,918
Watch out!

594
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,667
Don't touch it, look out for traps!

595
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,709
I'm all right.

596
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:33,709
I'll die if it's destined.

597
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:34,542
Hold on,

598
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:38,083
the carvings look like buildings.

599
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,125
The Paracel Underwater Tomb.

600
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,375
Right?

601
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:47,209
Mine looks like...

602
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:48,501
King Lu's Seven Star Palace.

603
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:50,417
Come on,

604
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:51,125
have a look.

605
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:52,751
Look at this,

606
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,584
did we enter from here?

607
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:57,834
The carvings...

608
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,542
correspond to the exact location.

609
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,542
Could this be
Wang Zang Hai's tomb too?

610
00:36:02,918 --> 00:36:03,584
It can't be.

611
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:05,334
Wang Zang Hai was from Ming dynasty.

612
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:06,751
But this is a Han dynasty tomb.

613
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:07,584
Lieutenant Zhang...

614
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:08,959
was a republican, mind you!

615
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,292
Didn't he still make this his home,

616
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:12,584
like stealing someone's nest?

617
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:15,375
Isn't it a party?

618
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:18,584
Mute Riders, Wang Zang Hai,
Lieutenant Zhang.

619
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,125
Coming one after another.

620
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:22,584
It's like the alley in Beijing.

621
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:23,751
The streets...

622
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:24,501
got all...

623
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,959
the history of Beijing...

624
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,042
overlapped...

625
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,167
and combined together.

626
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:29,584
Isn't this the same?

627
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:31,042
It's not bad.

628
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:34,334
Something's not right.

629
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,417
The Paracel Underwater Tomb...

630
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,083
belonged to Wang Zang Hai.

631
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:40,667
Are these tombs...

632
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,250
somehow connected?

633
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,834
Cao Cao is said to
have 72 decoy tombs.

634
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:46,501
Wang Zang Hai had
raided so many tombs.

635
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:48,042
He was afraid that...

636
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,501
his tomb would be raided too.

637
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:50,792
Hence, he arranged himself
decoy tombs too.

638
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:52,209
Nothing wrong with that.

639
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:58,250
You're maybe right.

640
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,250
Look at this.

641
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:01,584
This doesn't seem like a tomb.

642
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:06,999
The shape is unique.

643
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,501
He might be missing home.

644
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,542
That's why he...

645
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,292
built his tomb to look like his home.

646
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:11,918
Fatty,

647
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,584
have a rest.

648
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:16,459
There's a small city out there.

649
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,417
This must be Wang Zang Hai's hometown.

650
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:19,417
Wu City.

651
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,083
The tomb is huge.

652
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:25,334
This could be a combined tomb.

653
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:26,751
He included all...

654
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:27,918
his family here.

655
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:33,751
Look at this,

656
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,626
he built a tomb...

657
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:36,209
just like his hometown,

658
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:37,751
and written Wu City here.

659
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:40,626
Carving his hometown...

660
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,250
along with these tombs.

661
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:44,375
Wang Zang Hai
wasn't superstitious at all.

662
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:49,876
He even went to
the sacred tree at Qinling before.

663
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:50,626
Let me see!

664
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:56,125
He really was a lucked out leprechaun.

665
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,584
He's been to every single place.

666
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:03,542
Come on,

667
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:05,167
take a photo.

668
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:10,042
The tombs Wang Zang Hai...

669
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,959
had been to were all major tombs.

670
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,292
We haven't explored these yet.

671
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,584
We must study these after we get out.

672
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:17,751
There must be...

673
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:19,209
treasure for me somewhere.

674
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:20,918
Good stuff!

675
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:23,417
You're always have
your mind on business!

676
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:24,792
No wonder you're
famous in the field...

677
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:26,501
at this young age.

678
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:27,999
I'm flattered!

679
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:28,709
Look here,

680
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:29,834
say cheese.

681
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:35,250
Fatty,

682
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,501
we have to get out fast!

683
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:40,918
I...

684
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:42,584
don't want to intrude.

685
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:43,918
But we shouldn't stay here too long.

686
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,584
Shall we look for an exit?

687
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,042
There's a room in there.

688
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:48,918
Room?

689
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:03,834
Hey, no!

690
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:07,542
Wait for me, my darling.

691
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:09,751
Wait for me.

692
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:12,918
Let's check for traps.

693
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:13,751
I've checked,

694
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:14,501
there are no traps.

695
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:15,542
It's a sliding door.

696
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:17,542
That's impossible.

697
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:42,999
Come on,

698
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,876
don't just stand there and watch!

699
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,334
Help me out!

700
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:48,792
Come on.

701
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:05,542
Like a blind cat with a dead prey.

702
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,501
Who's the blind one?

703
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,876
This tomb chamber is well preserved.

704
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:05,667
It doesn't have
traces of modification.

705
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:07,792
Qi,

706
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:09,375
do you know this place well?

707
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:10,584
I don't know much.

708
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,042
But I've heard that...

709
00:41:12,167 --> 00:00:00,000
there's a Snake Eye Copper Fish here.
