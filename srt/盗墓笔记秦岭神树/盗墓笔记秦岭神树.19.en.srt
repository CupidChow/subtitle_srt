00:02:04,086 --> 00:02:06,606
"Episode 19"

3
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,083
That's right.

4
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,042
I think...

5
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,334
we better not talk about...

6
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:12,501
feudal superstitions...

7
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,459
in this sort of place,

8
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,334
all right?

9
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,584
I beg you.

10
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:18,459
Okay, I won't tease.

11
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,209
Underworld, the Yellow Spring.

12
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:22,876
The waterfall that washed us down.

13
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,709
Due to the hot spring,

14
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,083
what color is the water?

15
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:27,709
Yellow.

16
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,167
Yellow Spring!

17
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,792
The one that the feng shui master...

18
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:32,709
-said.
-Yes.

19
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:33,918
The Yellow Spring...

20
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,667
doesn't actually refer to
the real Underworld.

21
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:37,876
Now, let's talk about...

22
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,083
this place.

23
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,167
The Mute Army built it...

24
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,709
according to the natural
terrain of this mountain,

25
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:45,375
including these underwater chains.

26
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,083
Legend has it...

27
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,167
that the Yellow Spring...

28
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,334
is the path that connects
the living and the dead.

29
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,709
Did you forget?

30
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:54,876
These chains connect straight
to the back of the waterfall.

31
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,292
If what Mr. Wang said is true,

32
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:58,959
behind this...

33
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,417
lies the entrance to the tomb.

34
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:02,334
Hence, why the ancient tomb...

35
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:03,751
is also known as...

36
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,250
the Kingdom of The Underworld.

37
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:08,501
How can you be so sure?

38
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,584
Let's talk about the dead soldier.

39
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,918
He was part of the treasure troop...

40
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,125
during the Northern Wei period,

41
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:17,250
the Mute Army.

42
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,876
They were the first to find this tomb.

43
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:21,459
But we don't know why...

44
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:22,417
they came back...

45
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,209
and then never left.

46
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:25,584
That's how...

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,209
the legend of the dead soldier...

48
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,417
came to be.

49
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,918
Wu Xie.

50
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,459
Stop scaring me.

51
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,334
If even the professional
treasure troop...

52
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:35,709
was decimated,

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,459
we stand no chance.

54
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,542
Stupid.

55
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:40,876
If everyone had died,

56
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:43,751
how come this tomb exists?

57
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:46,626
We're going to go down...

58
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,584
to the Kingdom of the Underworld.

59
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:48,709
Who knows...

60
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:49,751
we might find a way out.

61
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:50,834
Also,

62
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,125
it's been more than 1000 years...

63
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:53,667
since that time.

64
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:54,709
Our equipment...

65
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:55,792
is much better
than what they had then.

66
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,792
This? This bit of equipment?

67
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,083
That's more than enough.

68
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,876
What worries me most now...

69
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,209
is that we have no torchlight.

70
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,459
We can't go underwater
with a fire torch.

71
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:09,000
I have an idea.

72
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's make that fire pile bigger.

73
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,209
We'll swim through
using the fire as a guide.

74
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,792
If we can't reach the other side,

75
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:19,334
we can swim back towards the fire.

76
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,292
Nice.

77
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,709
You didn't turn dumb inside the tomb.

78
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:24,542
Of course not.

79
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:35,834
Let's take off our clothes.

80
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:36,751
It'll be easier to swim.

81
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,542
Smart,

82
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:38,834
Mr. Know-It-All.

83
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:47,918
I'm good in water.

84
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:48,667
I'll go first.

85
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,626
I'm physically stronger.

86
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:53,792
I'll go first.

87
00:04:58,876 --> 00:04:59,834
Or...

88
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,209
Or maybe you should...

89
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,250
Okay.

90
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:05,876
Be careful.

91
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:10,626
-Wu Xie!
-I'm coming.

92
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:11,918
You pushed me!

93
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,000
-Cold, huh?
-Very cold.

94
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,834
Cold is better than
being eaten by the giant fish.

95
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:28,083
I don't want to die.

96
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:33,876
Hang in there, Lao Yang.

97
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,501
Wu Xie, the water is too cold.

98
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:40,250
Listen, I can hear
the sound of water ahead.

99
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:41,584
We should be close.

100
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,250
I can't...

101
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,417
I am almost at my limit.

102
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:45,501
Lao Yang,

103
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:46,667
just a bit more.

104
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:47,834
Hang in there.

105
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,918
Come on.

106
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,000
Lao Yang.

107
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:58,417
Look!

108
00:05:58,584 --> 00:05:59,751
The sound is coming
from the waterfall.

109
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:01,834
I can't anymore.

110
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:05,959
There's land.

111
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,501
Quick, let's get ashore.

112
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:14,542
Give me your hand. Here.

113
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:40,709
Lao Yang.

114
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:42,501
Someone's been here.

115
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:44,250
I'm going to check.

116
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:46,501
Wu Xie.

117
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,417
Watch yourself.

118
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:48,959
I will.

119
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,250
Wu Xie!

120
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,083
You're awake.

121
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,876
Where... did you get the torchlight?

122
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:20,959
I found it.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,834
Wu Xie,

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,667
did you find an exit or anything?

125
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:27,876
I checked everywhere
but I didn't see an exit.

126
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:29,876
Apart from where we entered,

127
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,501
there's only the waterfall left.

128
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:35,125
So we swam here for nothing?

129
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,751
Are we going to swim back?

130
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,042
Wu Xie!

131
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:53,584
Wu Xie!

132
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,626
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

133
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,751
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

134
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:52,459
Wu Xie!

135
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:57,584
Wu Xie!

136
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:20,751
Wu Xie.

137
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,501
Why are we back
in the same spot again?

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,792
Is that... the same waterfall?

139
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,584
That...

140
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,876
That color.

141
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:31,876
Yes.

142
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:33,626
The color is different from before.

143
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:34,667
Yes.

144
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,209
That's what I wanted to say.

145
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:38,125
Wu Xie!

146
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:18,584
What the hell?

147
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:21,000
It's still the same.

148
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:23,375
Wu Xie.

149
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,250
What is it?

150
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:42,959
What is that?

151
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:44,375
Do you remember...

152
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,000
how many times we've
been to the waterfall?

153
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,167
Three times.

154
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,375
Yes.

155
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:52,918
This is a maze...

156
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,000
made up of three waterfalls.

157
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:55,709
No way.

158
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,626
For those who aren't mentally strong,

159
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,417
they would think of this...

160
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:01,999
as some supernatural occurrence,

161
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,083
scaring themselves to death...

162
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:05,918
or get stuck here until they die.

163
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,751
Wait, so... How are we...

164
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,876
suppose to escape?

165
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:18,626
Trust me.

166
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,375
We will still come back here...

167
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,250
after seeing the waterfall twice more.

168
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,542
Wu Xie!

169
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,209
Wu Xie.

170
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:06,834
What's that?

171
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:07,751
Z.

172
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:08,542
L.

173
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,125
Truth.
(Zhen Li)

174
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:11,918
Let's go.

175
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:13,709
Let's find our torchlight.

176
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,125
Wu Xie.

177
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:43,375
Did you find the torchlight?

178
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:47,250
Where is it?

179
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,459
Didn't you say...

180
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:49,626
we'd find the torchlight back here?

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,959
Where is it?

182
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,167
What...

183
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,375
What do we do now?

184
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:55,667
We're stuck here!

185
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,918
This is a supernatural event.

186
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,209
But the cigarette butt is here.

187
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,250
Cigarette butt? So what?

188
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,751
Can the cigarette take us back?

189
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:04,876
It can't!

190
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,125
I'm going to pray to the gods.

191
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:38,834
The gods will protect us.

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The gods will protect us.

193
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:42,626
The gods will protect us.

194
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,792
The gods will protect us.

195
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,959
The gods will protect us.

196
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,042
The gods will protect us.

197
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,375
-The gods will protect us.
-Lao Yang.

198
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:01,709
The gods will protect us.

199
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,667
What kind of cigarettes are those?

200
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,918
Just a normal cigarette.

201
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,000
Wu Xie.

202
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:39,667
Wu Xie.

203
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:49,167
I'm sorry, Wu Xie.

204
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,125
Little lifesaver!

205
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:29,792
Little lifesaver!

206
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,667
Little lifesaver!

207
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,459
Little lifesaver.

208
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:41,999
Lao Yang?

209
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:44,000
Little...

210
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:45,459
Shut up.

211
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:09,083
Only Wu Xie can get us out of here.

212
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:10,792
Only he...

213
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:12,334
can guide us...

214
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,918
to what we both want.

215
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:16,709
I get it.

216
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:18,083
I understand.

217
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,626
I didn't see anything just now.

218
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:22,999
I saw nothing.

219
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:24,417
Smart move,

220
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,584
mister.

221
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:30,918
Lao Yang.

222
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:34,999
Lao Yang?

223
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,042
Is that you?

224
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,626
Little lifesaver.

225
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:40,584
Teacher Liang?

226
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,709
How did you get here?

227
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,709
I must be the luckiest person...

228
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,751
to meet you here.

229
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,125
Wu Xie.

230
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,250
Are you okay?

231
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:49,626
Go on, Teacher Liang.

232
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:50,918
What happened?

233
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:55,417
After being washed away with you...

234
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,626
from the waterfall,

235
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,334
I had to fend for myself alone.

236
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,334
It was so dark the whole way.

237
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,792
I had to scramble and dig,

238
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:05,334
climb and dive...

239
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,125
-all by myself.
-Old man.

240
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:08,667
Get to the point.

241
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:13,792
After falling...

242
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,918
from the waterfall,

243
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,167
I lost consciousness.

244
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,999
When I woke up,

245
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,876
I found myself here.

246
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,792
I walked and walked...

247
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,999
for tens of rounds...

248
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,250
but couldn't find a way out.

249
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:28,626
Tens of rounds?

250
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,751
Are you sure?

251
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,042
Yes.

252
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,292
Why would I lie to you?

253
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:36,876
I did walk many, many rounds.

254
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:38,584
Teacher Liang.

255
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,501
Is this your torchlight?

256
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,375
This... is not mine.

257
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:44,792
Listen.

258
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,375
This is too creepy.

259
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,125
I've been walking around,

260
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,250
round and round and round.

261
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:53,000
As if I walked into mirrors.

262
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:55,959
I couldn't find a way out.

263
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,083
While I was walking about,

264
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:00,751
I saw that torchlight...

265
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,751
at that spot over there.

266
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,083
I saw it there...

267
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,167
so I picked it up.

268
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:10,542
That proves it then.

269
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,083
If you did find...

270
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:13,709
the torchlight here,

271
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,167
it means my deduction is correct.

272
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:16,292
This area...

273
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,751
is a giant maze.

274
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,167
And the spot where we're standing...

275
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:20,584
is the beginning of the maze.

276
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:25,834
So are we supposed
to find the trap door...

277
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,876
in such a huge area?

278
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,918
That's harder than becoming emperor.

279
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,292
According to all
my years of research...

280
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,375
on this ancient tomb,

281
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:35,959
the trap door...

282
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,501
is most likely located...

283
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:41,083
at a very special, hidden spot.

284
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,834
So hidden that it's invisible
to the eye,

285
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,751
unfathomable to the mind.

286
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:49,999
Not to mention...

287
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:55,542
Boy.

288
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,375
Why didn't you jump in too?

289
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:03,792
If you won't stop talking,

290
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,459
I'm going to kill you.

291
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:08,417
I'll stop.

292
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,250
I won't talk.

293
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:18,459
Boy.

294
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,584
Did he...

295
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,999
Did he go looking...

296
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:22,999
for the secret trap door?

297
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:25,501
Yes.

298
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,999
The trap door is right below.

299
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,292
The little lifesaver has been gone
a while.

300
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,876
I hope he's okay.

301
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:37,250
You think?

302
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,501
What's happening?

303
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:43,042
Oh my goodness!

304
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:51,542
I found it!

305
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:53,083
I found it!

306
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,999
What did you find, little lifesaver?

307
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,250
Be careful, Wu Xie!

308
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,000
Look!

309
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,667
The waterfall stopped flowing.

310
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,042
This is...

311
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:08,999
What is going on?

312
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,083
Little lifesaver,

313
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,542
we should get out of here!

314
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,542
Save ourselves!

315
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:25,709
A bridge!

316
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,083
Little lifesaver,

317
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,667
let's hurry!

318
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:29,834
Go.

319
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:35,667
Hurry...

320
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,459
Hurry...

321
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:48,542
Go, let's get up there.

322
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:19,375
See that?

323
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:20,459
Got myself a bag of stuff.

324
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,792
Back then, how did we handle
the zombies...

325
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,000
without guns and bullets?

326
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:26,250
It was all through plundering.

327
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,209
We've been walking a long time.

328
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:42,876
Why haven't we found an exit?

329
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,083
Mr. Naive.

330
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:47,542
Mr. Naive!

331
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,459
I hear water.

332
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,542
There's the sound of water.

333
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,501
Water again.

334
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:19,501
Doesn't this seem like a maze?

335
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:21,584
It's a dead end.

336
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:24,417
I'm going to sit.

337
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:25,709
And rest.

338
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,834
You're not going to look
for Wu Xie anymore?

339
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:28,876
I am.

340
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,000
Of course I'll continue looking.

341
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,083
I have to.

342
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,834
But it's time for plan B.

343
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:35,000
Operation Howling Wolf.

344
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,459
Mr. Naive!

345
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,167
Where are you?

346
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,334
Fatty Wang misses you so!

347
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:51,125
Mr. Naive.

348
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,167
Look.

349
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,375
The signs are showing something's off.

350
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,667
Listen,

351
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,959
either there's a magnetic mine...

352
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,042
within the mountain...

353
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:14,125
affecting the magnetic field,

354
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,167
or...

355
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:18,459
the tomb is impure.

356
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:23,999
What now?

357
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:49,542
I can do it too.

358
00:23:50,918 --> 00:24:01,042
♪ A big river with a strong current ♪

359
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:03,042
♪ The river flows east ♪

360
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,999
♪ Stars in the sky
join the Big Dipper ♪

361
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,042
♪ Join the Big Dipper ♪

362
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:13,042
Welcome back.

363
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,542
Anything at the neighbor's house?

364
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,000
I got lost.

365
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:19,125
Got excited for nothing.

366
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And so?

367
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,584
We have to climb back down?

368
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:36,083
Mr. Naive, oh Mr. Naive.

369
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,209
Fatty Wang is on the way to you.

370
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,959
How do we get down?

371
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:59,167
You must be sick!

372
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,584
You have the cure?

373
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,751
Doing crosstalk now, are we?

374
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,125
Dummy Zhang.

375
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,083
Just you wait.

376
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:23,584
Playing with me, huh?

377
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:27,292
Toying with me?

378
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:29,792
The road ahead is long.

379
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,542
There will be a time
when I crush you.

380
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,417
I'll kill you with my own hands.

381
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:52,876
Oh my gosh!

382
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:00,667
I've never had to walk...

383
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,417
such a route in my entire life.

384
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:04,667
If I fall,

385
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,918
I will be shattered to pieces.

386
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:15,334
Little lifesaver.

387
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,876
The road...

388
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,542
The road ahead.

389
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:19,834
Do you...

390
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,584
Do you know how it goes?

391
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,125
There's no way I'll turn back...

392
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:27,459
and go through this path again.

393
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:29,999
I can't do anymore of this.

394
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:31,626
If in front...

395
00:26:31,918 --> 00:26:32,501
is a...

396
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,542
is a dead end...

397
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:37,459
Shut up.

398
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:39,125
Or I'm going to push you over.

399
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:40,125
Little lifesaver,

400
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:42,125
did you hear that?

401
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,542
What kind of person is he?

402
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,792
I'll help you across.

403
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:55,667
Lao Yang.

404
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:57,999
What has come over you?

405
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,999
What's wrong with me?

406
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:02,542
There's...

407
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,834
There's a big drop ahead.

408
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:05,459
Little lifesaver,

409
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,417
I can't cross it on my own.

410
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,417
I...

411
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:09,792
You have to...

412
00:27:09,876 --> 00:27:10,751
You have to help me.

413
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:12,501
Help me.

414
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:19,292
Here.

415
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:20,334
Give me your hand.

416
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,959
Little lifesaver.

417
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:23,501
Hold onto me tightly.

418
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,000
-I'm too old...
-Hurry up!

419
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:29,751
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

420
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:45,792
Wu Xie.

421
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,584
Why did we jump down here for?

422
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:12,250
Not like Mr. Naive is here.

423
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:15,959
Mr. Naive.

424
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,667
When are we going to find you?

425
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,125
We'll meet sooner or later...

426
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,709
as long as we're all in the tomb.

427
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,792
Come on, do you have to
be so condescending?

428
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,125
Gosh.

429
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,000
Mr. Naive.

430
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,209
Mr. Naive.

431
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,000
Calling out for one,

432
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:17,999
but got another.

433
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,334
Guo Guo.

434
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,083
Why are you hanging out
with the fake foreigners too?

435
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,542
Foreign companies
have better benefits.

436
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:24,751
Why can't I join them?

437
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,667
Wearing a sailor's uniform,

438
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:28,125
pretending to be so cool.

439
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,459
That foreign company?

440
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:31,083
It's just a foreign looting group.

441
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:32,834
You've become a traitor
to the country, you hear?

442
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:33,918
A thief shouldn't accuse another.

443
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,501
We're all in the same business.

444
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:36,542
You're no better.

445
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,167
I'm loyal to my country.

446
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:39,959
A law-abiding citizen.

447
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,417
Anyway, why did you send Mr. Ma...

448
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:43,292
over to me?

449
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,375
It must be your idea.

450
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,834
You baited Mr. Naive and I here.

451
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,959
How are you going
to endanger us again?

452
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,751
What do you think?

453
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,542
Who's to know...

454
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,584
what kind of crap's in your brain.

455
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,584
You tell me.

456
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,751
What are you doing?

457
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:05,250
If I tell you,

458
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:06,751
you'll give me back the copper fish.

459
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,209
What fish? Grilled fish?

460
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:09,626
Are you hungry?

461
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:13,709
Don't leave yet.

462
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:14,959
Come back.

463
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:19,876
Do you know how to use it?

464
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,042
Go ahead and kill me.

465
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,334
Go on, kill me.

466
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:32,751
Why did you butt in?

467
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:33,792
Didn't need your help.

468
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:42,584
Let's work together.

469
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:03,167
Little lifesaver.

470
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:04,209
We...

471
00:31:04,584 --> 00:31:06,292
We should take a break here.

472
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,292
Wu Xie, listen to me.

473
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,042
-Just now...
-You listen.

474
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:27,334
The three of us...

475
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,250
came here with different goals.

476
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,459
But we are the only three left.

477
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,584
The road ahead will get harder.

478
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:38,709
Danger is lurking behind every corner.

479
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:40,584
Lao Yang.

480
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,417
You've been here before.

481
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,292
You know about its terrain.

482
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:46,417
Teacher Liang.

483
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:47,999
You're a veteran.

484
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:49,584
You are knowledgeable in archeology.

485
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:51,334
Just now at the waterfall,

486
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:53,000
I dived underwater to
look for the trap door...

487
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,709
because of what you said.

488
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,375
At the same time,

489
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:01,999
we all know very well...

490
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:04,501
that even with all our
equipment combined,

491
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:05,999
it wouldn't be enough to get....

492
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:08,083
anyone of us out alive
if we tried alone.

493
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:10,083
So,

494
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:11,876
for the following journey,

495
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:14,334
it's imperative that
all three of us...

496
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:15,667
work together.

497
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:22,792
Teacher Liang.

498
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:25,334
Do you agree?

499
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:27,876
Little lifesaver,

500
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,375
I'll do as you say.

501
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:32,999
Meeting you...

502
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,667
this time around...

503
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,042
is really a blessing to me.

504
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:37,167
Actually,

505
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,250
with my vast knowledge...

506
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,918
and both your experiences,

507
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,042
our combined strength...

508
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,292
will overcome any obstacle.

509
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,209
You really are an opportunistic leech.

510
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:51,459
Lao Yang.

511
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:53,167
What about you?

512
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,834
I...

513
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:05,584
Okay.

514
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:07,876
Since we all agreed,

515
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,667
I will lead the way next.

516
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,083
I don't want...

517
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,876
anymore disputes between you two.

518
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,167
Yes, sure.

519
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:21,542
You heard that?

520
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,292
The little lifesaver is on my side.

521
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,501
If you dare bully me again,

522
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,584
I'm going to tell him...

523
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:28,584
everything you're hiding.

524
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,000
Go on then.

525
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:34,375
If you tell him,

526
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:36,042
we'll all die.

527
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:37,501
Lao Yang.

528
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,292
Little lifesaver.

529
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:43,501
Be careful, old man.

530
00:33:50,584 --> 00:33:51,542
Watch yourself.

531
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,959
The path's uneven.

532
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,542
Right now, the things below us...

533
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:00,959
are known as hanging coffins.

534
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,000
It is...

535
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:07,667
a burial method used by...

536
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,334
one of China's ancient
tribes in the south.

537
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:14,751
It's a kind of burial
method used on cliffs.

538
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,918
Watch your step.

539
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,167
The people would chisel...

540
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,042
on the cliffs...

541
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,584
I dropped my torchlight.

542
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:31,999
The coffins look dangerous.

543
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:33,250
Careful.

544
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,083
Just be careful.

545
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:40,751
Be careful.

546
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,083
I can't lift my arm.

547
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:51,459
So whiny.

548
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,751
Look at yourself.

549
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,209
Your arm got numb, is all.

550
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:55,584
It'll be okay in a bit.

551
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,125
Your boss seems very well-informed.

552
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:01,999
He's overseas...

553
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:02,999
so how did he know...

554
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,626
about the tomb in the mountains?

555
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:08,334
Does he have a personal
satellite in space,

556
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:09,834
or does he depend on you bunch...

557
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,000
of sniffer dogs he keeps in China?

558
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,667
Watch your mouth.

559
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:17,459
This tomb contains a lot.

560
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:18,709
Nobody can claim everything.

561
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,167
We baited you guys here...

562
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:22,292
because we could use
your expertise, that's all.

563
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:24,667
We'll split the findings in half.

564
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,959
We're not here for the relics.

565
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,250
Mr. Naive...

566
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:33,042
came because he wants
to protect cultural artifacts.

567
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,250
Then we'll take everything.

568
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,250
Thirty-seventy.

569
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:37,000
Forty-sixty.

570
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,042
Deal. There's three of us
so we get 60.

571
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:40,250
Three of you?

572
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,375
Do you have an invisible member?

573
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:44,626
Just because Mr. Naive...

574
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:45,834
is temporarily unreachable,

575
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,501
it doesn't mean
he's not getting a cut.

576
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,042
Well, we had two other members.

577
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,167
Even though one died
and one went missing.

578
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:53,292
But that doesn't mean
they should be omitted too.

579
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:54,999
They at least deserve
some death pension.

580
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,584
I don't know them
nor know who they are.

581
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:58,918
You.

582
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,000
Kylin Zhang.

583
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:02,417
What do you say?

584
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:05,167
There's no need for me
to work with you.

585
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:07,501
That's right.

586
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,542
Little Master has got a point.

587
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,751
With our abilities, we can traverse
this tomb without problems.

588
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:14,501
You guys are relying on us...

589
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:15,459
to figure out the map.

590
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:17,792
You're actually slowing us down.

591
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:18,834
We're sacrificing more.

592
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:19,667
How about 20, 80?

593
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:21,209
We get 80, you get 20.

594
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:23,751
You fooling me?

595
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,000
Bite me then.

596
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:29,292
We'll go our separate ways then.

597
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:30,709
No.

598
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:34,999
What do you mean?

599
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,834
We'll move together, no tricks.

600
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:41,167
Or else I'll just kill you.

601
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,667
Didn't Wu Xie come with you guys?

602
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:10,042
Missing him?

603
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:24,999
Lao Yang.

604
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:27,918
Teacher Liang.

605
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:29,834
I thought there were 5 of you...

606
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:30,667
at the time.

607
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,542
There's one named Li, right?

608
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,042
Where is he?

609
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:35,459
Why's he not here?

610
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:36,459
Forget about him.

611
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:38,542
Mr. Li was really unlucky.

612
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:41,834
While on our way
down from the mine,

613
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:44,709
he went to wash his face by the river.

614
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:48,501
Suddenly, a huge fish appeared...

615
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:50,584
and swallowed his head.

616
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,375
I think this person
just got bitten to death.

617
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,999
-Is he your friend?
-Impossible.

618
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,375
My friend is fat and has a big head.

619
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,334
It can't be him.

620
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,876
There's a small mud gun too.

621
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:25,292
What's the story behind Mr. Li?

622
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,792
Both Mr. Li and Mr. Wang...

623
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:31,250
came from Guangdong.

624
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,751
Mr. Li is called Li Pi Pa.

625
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:36,584
Mr. Wang is called Wang Qi.

626
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:39,083
They are pretty famous...

627
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:41,292
antique collectors in the region.

628
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,959
Mr. Li made a name for himself...

629
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:45,792
thanks to a Tombs Collection...

630
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,334
he inherited from his ancestors.

631
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,417
I heard...

632
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:53,751
it's supposed to be notes
written by the Mute Riders,

633
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,876
a royal treasure-hunting army
of Northern Wei dynasty.

634
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,125
It contains...

635
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,125
countless locations of ancient tombs.

636
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:00,626
As for Mr. Wang.

637
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:03,125
His ancestor was a famed appraiser.

638
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,209
Do you know what an appraiser is?

639
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:07,751
The person...

640
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:08,999
responsible for identifying
high-grade items...

641
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,459
and handling administrative
work in a pawn shop...

642
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:11,584
is called an appraiser.

643
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:13,501
Normally, the head appraiser
of a big pawn shop...

644
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:15,334
gets to see all sorts
of treasures in the world.

645
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:16,167
You could say...

646
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,125
that they've seen every weird,

647
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:17,959
fantastical thing.

648
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:19,375
That's right.

649
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:23,459
You sure know a thing or two,
little lifesaver.

650
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:25,834
Mr. Wang's ancestor, Wang Xian Chu,

651
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,125
was exactly that.

652
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,125
During his later years,

653
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,792
he wrote a journal,

654
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:35,292
called The Fantastic
and The Magnificent.

655
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:36,876
It contains...

656
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:39,334
all the wonderful and
extraordinary gems he had seen.

657
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,751
He noted down the owners' details,

658
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,834
his appraisal and such.

659
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:46,999
If that's the case,

660
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,125
the journal...

661
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:50,125
will be an invaluable
reference for archeology.

662
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:53,292
You really come across...

663
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:54,751
as a very cultured man.

664
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:58,792
If you got your hands
on the journal,

665
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:01,667
you'll definitely be
able to put it to good use,

666
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,709
creating new heights
for our country's...

667
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,250
archaeological studies.

668
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:07,667
Continue your story.

669
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:08,751
You don't have to flatter me.

670
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,125
Mr. Wang is not a very...

671
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:16,709
educated person.

672
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,501
But he has a remarkable memory.

673
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,709
He managed to memorize...

674
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,876
the whole journal.

675
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:22,999
One time,

676
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:24,709
at a gathering,

677
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:28,792
he saw a jade lion...

678
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:33,751
and quickly connected it
to something he read in the journal.

679
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,417
It looked like a
Tibetan box with head.

680
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,417
So he followed what
he read in the journal...

681
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:41,834
and put the jade lion...

682
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:43,709
into tea water.

683
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,000
Not long after,

684
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:47,792
the jade lion...

685
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:49,751
opened its mouth on its own...

686
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:53,751
and spat out a golden leaf.

687
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,792
Everyone present was shocked.

688
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:58,292
From then on,

689
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,083
his reputation spread far and wide...

690
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,334
and beyond his control.

691
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:06,834
So Mr. Li had the Tombs Collection...

692
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,042
while Mr. Wang has
the head appraiser's journal.

693
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:10,626
The two together...

694
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,125
make the perfect combination.

695
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:13,626
That's right.

696
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,667
I only got to know them...

697
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:17,709
this time around.

698
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:20,000
I came to join the fun,

699
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:21,751
learn a thing or two.

700
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,375
But the two of them...

701
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:25,167
worked together previously.

702
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:27,834
They managed several big dealings...

703
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,083
and made good money.
