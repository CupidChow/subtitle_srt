00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,389
"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:07,392
"Episode 7"

3
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:12,855
Stuffy.

4
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:20,973
The position of this
entrance is rather odd.

5
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,053
And there's no symmetrical
entrance or passageway.

6
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,733
Which means it's not
for balancing anything.

7
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,973
Why then did Wang Zang Hai
make this entrance?

8
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:30,253
Being a wild archaeologist,

9
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:32,813
I believe there are 2 possibilities.

10
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:33,693
Talk to me.

11
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:35,653
Show some respect!

12
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:39,813
Kindly start your performance.

13
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:42,973
The first possibility is
they placed a mirror here...

14
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:45,093
as a cover because the tomb
owner hid some treasures inside,

15
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,973
and wanted to keep it
away from outsiders.

16
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:50,053
If it's really to hide treasures,

17
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:52,373
it should be more covert, isn't it?

18
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:53,373
It's like child's play...

19
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,413
if the treasure is just
casually placed behind a mirror.

20
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,373
The second possibility is feng shui.

21
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:01,693
The mirror is an important
tool in the study of feng shui.

22
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,733
Maybe there's a theory behind of it.

23
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:04,653
Feng shui?

24
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:06,213
According to feng shui,

25
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,613
if a window is built in a space,

26
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,413
it represents a pathway.

27
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,933
It means letting something out,

28
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:13,973
or something in.

29
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,053
What sort of a thing can
go in and out of a tomb?

30
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,173
There are only ghosts.

31
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,293
Nonsense, step aside.

32
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:20,453
There's no such thing as ghosts.

33
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,733
Don't swing your torchlight around.

34
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:39,773
Why is there water?

35
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,733
I might need to get in one more time.

36
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,253
No.

37
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:12,093
You got into trouble
the last time you were here.

38
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:14,093
I can't allow you to risk again!

39
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,213
To you guys,

40
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,813
this might be just an odd experience.

41
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:23,093
But to me,

42
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:25,813
it's a huge preoccupation of mind.

43
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,773
Is this preoccupation
of yours that crucial?

44
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:30,613
Is it even more
crucial than your life?

45
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,973
Dummy Zhang finished
a full sentence on this.

46
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:34,293
So, it must be crucial.

47
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:34,973
Fine.

48
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,173
Stuffy.

49
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,093
If you insist on going in,

50
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,453
I shall go with you.

51
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:41,733
Even if we die inside
from running out of oxygen.

52
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:43,013
You saved me just now.

53
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:45,653
If this secret chamber
is that important to you,

54
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,693
I shall stick with you till the end!

55
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,293
Wait a minute. Keep your heads cool.

56
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:50,973
I think we should head up,

57
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:53,173
and get the food and
oxygen ready first...

58
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,613
before we get down here again.

59
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:55,933
With the experience just now,

60
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:58,773
it will be as easy as
a piece of cake to us.

61
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:01,973
Stuffy,

62
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,980
we came to this underwater
tomb together in the first place.

63
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:07,453
I will not allow anything
to happen to you.

64
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:17,973
What has gotten into you?

65
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:18,973
Are you possessed?

66
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:19,853
Let's go quickly!

67
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,733
Quickly!

68
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:24,733
What has gotten into you? Seriously.

69
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:26,453
Wait a moment!

70
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,733
Look who we have here.

71
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,773
Try ditching us again.

72
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,973
You must have thought
highly about yourself.

73
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,413
Stop shouting.

74
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:43,973
She doesn't seem right.

75
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:45,733
Has she gone crazy?

76
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,093
I was also a little dazed while
I was entering the tunnel.

77
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,013
I thought it was her trick,

78
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:57,693
but she's not clear-headed either.

79
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:58,413
Furthermore,

80
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:00,973
look at the wound on her neck.

81
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:02,373
Simple.

82
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:03,973
We will know whether
she is pretending...

83
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,933
by seeing her reaction
when we slap her.

84
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:07,973
How could you do it
when she's like that?

85
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,733
-Why couldn't I?
-Go ahead then.

86
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:16,733
No way.

87
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,013
I only toy with women,

88
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:18,773
I don't beat women.

89
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,053
So, tell me what should we do.

90
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:21,813
She is full of tricks.

91
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:24,093
We don't even know
whether she's pretending now.

92
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:25,973
Let her taste her own medicine.

93
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:27,613
Tie her up,

94
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:28,973
and send her to the police station.

95
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:31,093
Are you dumb?

96
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,733
Are you trying get yourself killed?

97
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,213
We don't have the permit...

98
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:38,933
to enter the underwater tomb,
but she does.

99
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:39,733
If the police shows up,

100
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,253
who will they arrest? Her or us?

101
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,733
We're here because she cheated us.

102
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,693
Besides, I'm here to
look for Uncle San Xing.

103
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:45,973
You'll be an accomplice then.

104
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:46,613
You...

105
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,413
Stop fighting.

106
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:50,933
She looks sluggish
and her reaction is slow.

107
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,973
She looks way worse
than being plain dumb.

108
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:54,413
She's not pretending.

109
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:55,533
Little Master,

110
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,013
this place is so strange.

111
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:58,853
I think we should head out first.

112
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,293
Wait a moment, let's think about it.

113
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:05,653
What is she trying to
do hiding here alone?

114
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,053
Enough, stop looking.

115
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:09,013
There's something there!

116
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:10,973
I told you to stop.

117
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:11,973
Why don't you just give up.

118
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:12,733
What's that?

119
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,533
Is that red thing a tree?

120
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:16,613
So what if it's red?

121
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:17,773
Even if it's golden,

122
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,293
or a gold bar,
you still can't move it.

123
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:19,853
Let's go.

124
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,733
We'll only find out
if we go check it out.

125
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:24,933
What if there's something
smaller beside it?

126
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:26,533
If we hadn't came in,
then fine we could forget about it.

127
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:27,173
But since we're here,

128
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:28,973
let's take a look around.
It'll be like sight seeing.

129
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:29,613
Furthermore,

130
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,973
we've been in here for so long
yet nothing has happened to us.

131
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:32,853
What are you afraid of?

132
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:33,733
Isn't it, Dummy Zhang?

133
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:35,973
I'm not afraid.

134
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:38,853
I'm just worried about Little Master.

135
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:42,973
Follow me.

136
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:43,973
Don't fall behind.

137
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:46,173
Follow me.

138
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:47,533
Don't fall behind.

139
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:49,173
Get back here.

140
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:57,773
You...

141
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:10,373
Little comrade,

142
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:13,053
how much do you think
this coral tree is worth?

143
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:14,924
Not that I want to break your spirit.

144
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:15,813
Sixteen Yuan.

145
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:17,453
Not 16 Yuan per gram,

146
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,653
but per kilogram.

147
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:19,853
Who are you trying to cheat?

148
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:21,973
Dummy Zhang, is it true?

149
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:27,813
What's wrong with my fate this year?

150
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:29,813
Why is it so different from
what my fortune-tellers told me?

151
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:32,413
Did I do something wrong
or did they get it wrong?

152
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,773
I've such bad luck in wealth.

153
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:36,973
What do you think about this bell?

154
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:38,373
A bell should be worthy.

155
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,973
Can you be more knowledgeable?

156
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:42,653
Bell is made from metal.

157
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:43,973
It's rarely seen in a tomb,

158
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:46,293
and is small with complex structure
which makes it difficult to preserve.

159
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:47,933
But take a look at the pattern on it.

160
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:49,653
You can tell it was made
before Ming Dynasty.

161
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,533
That's why it's still in
a good condition now.

162
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:52,733
Do you know what does this mean?

163
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:53,453
Of course.

164
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:54,773
It's more valuable than pure gold.

165
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:55,973
Here I come.

166
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:56,853
Don't touch it.

167
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:00,173
What? Do you protect
historical relics too?

168
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:05,973
Do you still remember where we saw...

169
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,053
this kind of bell before?

170
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:11,933
The bead lines of this bell is rusty.

171
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,733
From the looks of it,
it's made from brass.

172
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,733
I have only ever seen
one type of brass bell.

173
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:20,773
The zombie turtle at King Lu's Palace.

174
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,093
Don't panic, don't panic!

175
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:16,973
Hang in there, hang in there.

176
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:25,293
Get down there!

177
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,013
Get into the water!

178
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:50,813
What exactly is this?

179
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:52,733
Don't mess around!

180
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:54,293
Sit still!

181
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:55,413
Be careful.

182
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:00,813
Did the sound we hear
come from this bell?

183
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,653
How is it able to delude people?

184
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:06,653
What's the secret in it?

185
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:09,373
Kid, look at this.

186
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:10,933
This centipede...

187
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:13,693
might have gone into it's stomach...

188
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:15,533
through this tube...

189
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:16,933
to eat its flesh.

190
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:19,733
I'm impressed that...

191
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,253
they can figure out
such a method of symbiosis.

192
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:24,773
Look at me.

193
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:26,453
There's nothing to be afraid of.

194
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:40,533
These bells are the same as
the one on the zombie turtle.

195
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:42,973
Uncle San Xing then told me that...

196
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:44,933
this bell is from
before Warring States.

197
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:46,373
He didn't get into details.

198
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,053
But there was only 1 bell back then,

199
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,653
and it almost killed us.

200
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:51,653
And there are dozens of them now.

201
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:53,733
If it starts to ring...

202
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:58,613
Don't worry.

203
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,733
This bell is different from others.

204
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:02,373
If wind could make it ring,

205
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,413
it would have rung already.

206
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:05,973
It appeared in King Lu's Palace,

207
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,253
and it appears here too.

208
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:08,413
isn't that too coincidental?

209
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,733
I'm guessing Wang Zang Hai
also raided tombs.

210
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:14,173
While he was practicing
feng shui for people,

211
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,933
he must have saw some
good stuff and swiped them.

212
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:17,453
I don't think so.

213
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:18,453
Usually when one raids tomb,

214
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:20,293
one will leave his mark
all over the tomb after a raid...

215
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:23,093
to gain respect from
the people who come after.

216
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:23,973
Little Master,

217
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,173
did you find any markings in the tomb?

218
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:30,853
No.

219
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:32,293
If he's not a raider,

220
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:34,533
how did he find all the
treasure underground?

221
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:35,653
Wasn't he an architect?

222
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,733
Perhaps when he dug the foundation,
he found treasures and kept them.

223
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:43,013
I reckon that he must have done
construction around King Lu's Palace.

224
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:46,373
So, he dug all these bells
out and placed them here...

225
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:47,693
as home decor.

226
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:50,733
No scent at all.

227
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:54,733
That's right.

228
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:59,213
There was a scent when
Little Master fainted in the tunnel.

229
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,373
But the bells here
have no scent at all.

230
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:04,373
Furthermore, we have
been here for some time,

231
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:05,973
but nothing happened to us.

232
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:10,653
This proves that this place
isn't the source of the scent.

233
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,813
It's probably the Scented Bone
of Forbidden Maiden.

234
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:13,733
Impossible.

235
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:15,733
We have fought her so many times.

236
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,013
We even burned her,

237
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,733
but not a slight scent was there.

238
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:20,413
Also,

239
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:22,933
where are the archeologists
who were on a mission...

240
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:25,733
with Little Master back then?

241
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:21,733
Is there really...

242
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:24,053
a kind of scent...

243
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,933
that can make people
suffer from amnesia,

244
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,613
or even gain longevity?

245
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,973
Amnesia in exchange for longevity?

246
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:33,293
I'd like to try that.

247
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:34,253
By the way,

248
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:37,973
Dummy Zhang, aren't you around
the age as Uncle San Xing?

249
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:38,933
Little comrade,

250
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:40,453
you shouldn't address
him as Little Master,

251
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:42,293
but Master Stuffy instead!

252
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:48,413
What's wrong?

253
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:49,733
I'm helping you with your seniority.

254
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,733
Fine.
There's nothing fun here anymore.

255
00:15:53,813 --> 00:15:54,853
Except this tree here,

256
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:56,253
what else is there?

257
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,213
She kept the good stuff to herself.

258
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:06,973
Okay, stop wasting time.

259
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:07,973
Let's get out of here.

260
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:19,973
I'm at my limit.

261
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,373
Quick. Come and help.

262
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:24,213
My goodness.

263
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:28,653
Look at you.

264
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:29,973
You look like a skinny twig,

265
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:30,973
yet you're quite heavy.

266
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:33,213
How confident are you?

267
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,173
This tomb is under the sea.

268
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:39,733
In order to resist the water pressure,
the top of the building has to arched,

269
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,853
with high center and low sides.

270
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:42,973
We need to look for
the weakest point force.

271
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:43,933
Let me find it.

272
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:50,733
But looking at the tomb now,

273
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:55,093
it somehow resembles a ground
built palace with a flat ceiling.

274
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:57,733
The building structure is
complex and very sturdy.

275
00:16:58,173 --> 00:16:59,813
But this is a good news for us.

276
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:01,053
We can punch a hole anywhere we want.

277
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:04,973
You're a way better bluffer than me.

278
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:07,933
I'm playing it by ear according
to the theory of architecture.

279
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:09,293
I'm just worried about one thing.

280
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,773
Will we die from the
seawater that gushes in...

281
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,253
if we punch a hole up there?

282
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,973
That's why, we need to
figure out the right time...

283
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:17,413
and punch a hole during low tide.

284
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,973
Or else the whole pressure
resistant system will be destroyed.

285
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:23,213
And the entire dome might crumble
when the seawater rushes in.

286
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:25,373
We'll either drown or be crushed.

287
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:27,413
So, there's a slim
chance of surviving?

288
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:28,773
Well, yes.

289
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:35,733
If only Ning is conscious.

290
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,453
She must have a backup plan.

291
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:40,973
She might have hidden the
oxygen cylinders somewhere safe.

292
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:41,733
That's easy.

293
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:43,373
I can beat her until she
regains her consciousness.

294
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:45,093
Enough.

295
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:46,973
It's better to save up
energy for those pillars.

296
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:48,413
Let's come up with a way to get up.

297
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,733
It's so slippery and thick.

298
00:17:58,413 --> 00:17:59,253
I'm not a lizard.

299
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,613
I'll slip and fall.

300
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:01,733
How am I going to climb?

301
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,013
Do you really want to try?

302
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,013
Listen, if you fall from it,

303
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,413
you will definitely die.

304
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,693
Are you going?

305
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:12,973
For sure.

306
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:50,733
Fatty.

307
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:52,053
Be careful.

308
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:10,973
Fatty!

309
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:13,533
Are you all right?

310
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:17,973
I'm fine.

311
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:01,413
Hey.

312
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:04,093
Don't come up if you can't.

313
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,613
You can't help with anything anyway,

314
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:07,733
why are you coming up?

315
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:08,973
Do you think I actually want to?

316
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:11,613
I'm going up only as your
technical support and to protect you.

317
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,973
Didn't you say it's not
dangerous up here?

318
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,173
I didn't say that.

319
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:18,213
Who knows that there might
be a mezzanine up there.

320
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:23,013
The mezzanine might bury
you when you get up there.

321
00:21:24,053 --> 00:21:27,733
It better not have booby
traps like the land tombs.

322
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,373
It won't, right?

323
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,173
The master of this tomb
has a different mind.

324
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:32,613
Who knows what will happen?

325
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:33,973
We all have our own fate.

326
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:35,453
Now isn't the time to be scared.

327
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:36,813
Here, pull me up.

328
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,293
Little comrade, how lucky you are.

329
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:00,733
You don't even need to climb.

330
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,053
It's quite far from the ground.

331
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,093
So technical support,
what should we do?

332
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:10,253
Let me take a look around.

333
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:23,733
It's solid.

334
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,173
Looks like Wang Zang Hai
isn't that sick after all.

335
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:27,933
Move aside.

336
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:38,213
steel concrete.

337
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:39,733
The cracks are filled
with steel concrete.

338
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:40,973
It's like reinforced concrete.

339
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,693
You can't break it even
with a huge hammer.

340
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:44,213
I don't believe it. Move aside.

341
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:45,973
I just don't believe it.

342
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:58,973
It seems to be 6 or 7 layers thick,

343
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:00,213
and are all intertwined.

344
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,773
It's impossible to punch through
without professional equipment.

345
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:09,973
This is all my fault.

346
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,773
The ceiling is of flat roof structure
which has a weak pressure resistance.

347
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:16,373
So the stone will then be reinforced.

348
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:17,853
I didn't even think of it,

349
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:19,413
and had you worked hard for nothing.

350
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:22,973
As long as we try hard,

351
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:24,733
we can achieve anything.

352
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,093
We can scrape it slowly.

353
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:27,453
That's impossible.

354
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:30,853
It'll take forever to scrape through
such a thick steel concrete layer.

355
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:32,933
I did some calculation,

356
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:35,653
it will be low tide
in roughly 30 minutes.

357
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:37,853
If we miss this one,

358
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:39,053
it'll be difficult for us to leave.

359
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:40,253
It's almost windy season too.

360
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:40,853
Listen.

361
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:41,973
If we don't head out now,

362
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,693
we'll have to wait for another week.

363
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:44,653
That's 7 days.

364
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,533
We'd either die of
suffocation or starvation.

365
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:48,653
The Sea Monkey stinks of bad fish.

366
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:49,773
I'm definitely not eating it.

367
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:50,253
Why not we return to
where we came from?

368
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:52,213
Who knows,

369
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:55,693
maybe the side chamber with our
oxygen tanks will reappear.

370
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,093
That's impossible.

371
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,213
Unless there's a miracle,
or else it's impossible...

372
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,813
for us to find the way out of
Qimen Dunjia in such short time.

373
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:04,693
And Forbidden Maiden
is still out there.

374
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:16,813
Little Master.

375
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:19,453
I have to apologize to you.

376
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:21,933
When we were at the looters' tunnel,

377
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:24,293
I was testing you when I
said your memory was fake.

378
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:27,453
I was afraid that your memory
was unfavorable to Uncle San Xing.

379
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,013
But I only thought
about Uncle San Xing,

380
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,093
and had neglected your feelings.

381
00:25:33,253 --> 00:25:33,933
I'm sorry.

382
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:40,773
There's less than...

383
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,653
thirty minutes from the low tide.

384
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,733
This is what I found
on an old broken ship.

385
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:50,533
You did come here before.

386
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:53,093
Everyone back then had
disappeared, except you.

387
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:54,973
You can definitely think of a way out.

388
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:17,613
Forget about it.

389
00:26:19,653 --> 00:26:20,733
If you can't remember,

390
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:23,733
then don't force yourself.

391
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:19,253
There's hope for us!

392
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:21,773
He must have found the way to
break the steel concrete wall.

393
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:25,733
Little Master didn't recall
how he got out back then,

394
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:28,213
but he should have recalled
the trap that might be...

395
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:29,213
hidden in the mummy.

396
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,733
A trap triggered by a secret
switch with a hidden explosive.

397
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:32,973
It should be the tomb owner's idea.

398
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,693
If the people are disrespectful
towards the mummy,

399
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,653
the explosive will go off.

400
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:39,173
He sure is vicious,

401
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:41,453
for placing an explosive
in his own body.

402
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:42,533
But I have a feeling that...

403
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:44,933
this mummy here isn't Wang Zang Hai.

404
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,653
So do you think Dummy Zhang...

405
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,693
knew all along that there's
an explosive in the mummy?

406
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:50,973
That's why he didn't touch it.

407
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:52,973
Who knows.

408
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:55,693
Do you think the
explosive is still working?

409
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:13,733
Why?

410
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:15,533
Do you want to molest the mummy?

411
00:28:15,973 --> 00:28:16,453
Shut it.

412
00:28:16,973 --> 00:28:19,693
I'm just worried that
it's not human flesh.

413
00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:21,733
It's possible that
it's sculpted by hand.

414
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:23,653
It shouldn't be so light then.

415
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:24,973
Maybe it's not made from jade,

416
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,053
but some other special material.

417
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,693
Plastic? How's that?

418
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:29,733
Are you kidding me?

419
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:32,733
Little Master.

420
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,293
This mummy is so odd.

421
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:37,253
Do you think the
explosive in it still works?

422
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,213
If the secret switch works,

423
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:40,653
then the explosive will work.

424
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:43,853
I'm just afraid that
the trap has gone rusty.

425
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:46,693
It's time to roll the dice.

426
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:47,973
Put it on top of the dome.

427
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,773
We will ignite it when
we are down there.

428
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,293
If it works,

429
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:52,653
we can go out successfully.

430
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:53,813
No problem, little comrade.

431
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:57,093
Hand me my Royal 502 tape.

432
00:28:58,293 --> 00:28:59,013
How else do I fix it?

433
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:01,733
Do you want me hold it
and let it explode in my hand?

434
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:03,733
Where can I find some 502 now?

435
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:04,973
You might as well use me as the tape.

436
00:29:05,053 --> 00:29:07,773
There isn't a place to hang it too.

437
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:10,213
Tie it on this pillar.

438
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,653
That's the only way.

439
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:12,733
Hold the torch for me.

440
00:29:15,973 --> 00:29:17,093
Here I go.

441
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:21,933
Wait a moment.

442
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:23,973
What did I grab?

443
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:28,173
Why is there a tail?

444
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:33,533
The tail wasn't here
when we moved it just now.

445
00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:35,173
How can it grow all of a sudden?

446
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:39,293
I have heard of dead bodies
growing nails and hair.

447
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:41,413
But I've never heard
of one growing tails.

448
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:42,733
Is it atavism?

449
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:44,733
Enough, stop wasting time.

450
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:45,853
If you continue to analyze,

451
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:47,733
we'll be the ones who get
analyzed by others in a few years.

452
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:48,733
Get to work now.

453
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,773
This mummy should be
more than enough...

454
00:29:57,933 --> 00:29:58,813
to deal with the steel concrete.

455
00:29:58,933 --> 00:29:59,453
Let's go.

456
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:00,733
Wait a moment.

457
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:01,733
Come over here.

458
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:02,733
A little bit over there.

459
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:05,973
Follow what I do.

460
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:09,653
Mighty Tail Lord.

461
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,733
No matter if you're human or monkey,

462
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:15,973
or the relative of
the lady with 5 nipples.

463
00:30:17,093 --> 00:30:18,973
Well, you both had
something extra anyway.

464
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:21,613
But since you're already dead,

465
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,733
your physical body is useless now.

466
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:24,933
And of course,

467
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,973
we tied you up and
made you the explosive...

468
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:29,013
because we were left
with no other options.

469
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,733
Mighty one with big heart,
please forgive us.

470
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:35,453
You can see it as doing sauna or...

471
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:37,253
Whatever. That's it.

472
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,973
We come in peace,
so don't take it to heart.

473
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:41,973
Little comrade, do as I did.

474
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:42,733
Little comrade.

475
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:46,613
You!

476
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:48,933
How heartless!

477
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,693
You didn't even tell me
you were going down!

478
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:54,453
You...

479
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:55,733
I...

480
00:30:57,813 --> 00:30:58,853
Wait for me.

481
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:23,373
Little Master,

482
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,653
there's 20 minutes more
until the lowest tide period.

483
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:27,693
But it takes time for the
escape path to get wide enough.

484
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:30,733
So you need to trigger the trap
and blow it earlier with your dagger.

485
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:32,253
Which means...

486
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:34,733
you need to do it in 10 minutes.

487
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:35,973
Little comrade,

488
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:40,013
tell me, will we make it?

489
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,733
How would I know?

490
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:42,813
Let's wait and see.

491
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:44,933
I'm more anxious hearing that.

492
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,693
If that thing over
there doesn't explode,

493
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:50,413
do you have a plan B
to make me a little more at ease?

494
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:52,653
Yes, there's a plan B.

495
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:55,373
We'll return to where we
came from like you suggested,

496
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:56,653
and see if the oxygen
cylinders are still around.

497
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,253
If that doesn't work too,
there's plan C.

498
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:02,853
We wait here and see
if we'll be saved.

499
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:05,013
God knows how long we'll have to wait.

500
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:09,293
I guess I'll wait for my demise here.

501
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:19,213
Do you think...

502
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,373
the people from Ning's company
will leave her behind?

503
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:24,213
Is she that important?

504
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:25,973
Foreign companies are the worst.

505
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,773
She's lucky enough if
they get her insurance.

506
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:29,533
They won't waste their
resources for saving her.

507
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:30,533
That's impossible.

508
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:37,613
Little Master, do it in 5 minutes.

509
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:47,773
Where is the mummy?

510
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,013
Look at its eyes.

511
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:01,453
Did the Sea Monkey get into it?

512
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:02,653
The rope is still on the mummy.

513
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,093
But it can't hold any longer.

514
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:05,733
Blow it up now before it gets away!

515
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:07,453
Little Master, what do you think?

516
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:10,453
Stuffy!

517
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:11,413
Let go of me.

518
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:12,933
I know what you're trying to do.

519
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:13,973
I will tie the mummy up again,

520
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:14,933
and you trigger the explosive.

521
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,173
But you'll die!

522
00:33:16,613 --> 00:33:17,773
If the mummy is gone,

523
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:19,173
this place will explode anytime.

524
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:20,733
Then, everyone will die.

525
00:33:20,813 --> 00:33:21,693
But what about you?

526
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,853
Will you come back alive?

527
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:23,973
There's no time left!

528
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:07,293
Where's Little Master?

529
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:11,973
Fatty,

530
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:13,693
didn't he escape with us?

531
00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:15,213
Didn't you see it?

532
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,373
Didn't he kill the Forbidden Maiden?

533
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:20,733
He killed her.

534
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:21,693
No.

535
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,173
We can't leave Little Master behind!

536
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,773
Don't worry, you don't
have to worry about him.

537
00:37:25,853 --> 00:37:27,453
Ning, Ning.

538
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,773
Fatty, take care of Ning.

539
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:30,973
I have to go back!

540
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:34,733
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to rescue Little Master.

541
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:36,733
Do you really think you're Superman?

542
00:37:36,973 --> 00:37:38,093
The underwater tomb is destroyed.

543
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:39,813
There's no oxygen in it.

544
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,013
No matter how well he can fight,
he's still human!

545
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:44,933
I have to save him!

546
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:46,733
We came here together,

547
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,093
so we should go back together!

548
00:37:49,053 --> 00:37:52,093
Why didn't you inherit your
uncle's cold-bloodedness?

549
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:54,093
Wait for me here!

550
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:55,533
I will be back in no time.

551
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:48,013
Little Master, Little Master!

552
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,413
Look clearly. Who am I?

553
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:51,693
Fatty.

554
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:52,933
You saved me.

555
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:53,733
You're welcome.

556
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:55,213
Where's Little Master?

557
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:56,413
I have to save Little Master!

558
00:39:56,973 --> 00:39:57,693
Little Master.

559
00:39:57,733 --> 00:39:58,613
Stay put!

560
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,013
If you wish to die,

561
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:03,613
find yourself a quiet place
and die there alone!

562
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:05,533
Don't do it in front of me!

563
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:06,973
-Are you sick?
-Since we came together,

564
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:08,733
we must go back together!

565
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:10,733
Get back here!

566
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:14,293
Nonsense!

567
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,853
He's more capable than you!

568
00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:18,293
And he has more experience
with tombs than you!

569
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:22,253
What if he comes back later,
and you die in the tomb?

570
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:24,733
You know what? Come here.

571
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:25,933
Look at me.

572
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:27,853
I'm a believer of fate.

573
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:29,693
Everyone has their own fate.

574
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:31,973
Humans will eventually die.

575
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:33,933
No matter how much one longs to live!

576
00:40:34,453 --> 00:40:35,533
But those who aren't
supposed to die...

577
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:38,733
Someone like Little Master.

578
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:40,253
He's even able to kill
the Forbidden Maiden,

579
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:41,733
you don't need to worry about him.

580
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,813
He is skilled,
and invincible like god.

581
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:46,293
It's impossible for him
to die in a mere tomb.

582
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:51,733
He's still alive, you know?

583
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:53,253
He's still alive!

584
00:40:57,013 --> 00:40:57,973
Little Master.
