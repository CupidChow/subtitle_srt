00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:03,671
"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:07,187
"Episode 3"

3
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:08,792
I believe that...

4
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,999
Uncle San Xing had been here before.

5
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,334
But it still doesn't explain...

6
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:14,375
why this side chamber...

7
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,375
suddenly look different?

8
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,834
Are you saying I
digressed from the subject?

9
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:19,292
Fine.

10
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:21,083
I was here before.

11
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,626
I don't remember it clearly.

12
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,751
I need something to trigger my memory.

13
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:32,959
Little Master,

14
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,042
you lost your memory?

15
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:36,959
I want to retrieve my memory.

16
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,584
What are you thinking now?

17
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,667
If you find the name
list of the archaeologists,

18
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,834
my name should be on it.

19
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,083
I thought you happened
to have the same name.

20
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,709
Stop bluffing.

21
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,417
That team was formed decades ago.

22
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,417
How come you never age?

23
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,709
How do you maintain your youth?

24
00:02:58,834 --> 00:02:59,584
Goat placenta?

25
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:00,584
Botox?

26
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,083
Don't tell me you
had genetic mutation...

27
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,834
due to some radiation?

28
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,250
I also want to know why.

29
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,626
How much do you remember...

30
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,000
about this underwater tomb?

31
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:21,373
"Qiong Sanya 2036"

32
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,959
Xiao Mei, look.

33
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:24,834
Look over there!

34
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,250
Isn't it stunning?

35
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,125
Sister Wen Jin!

36
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,000
-Sister Wen Jin!
-What are you looking at?

37
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,250
Come up and have a look!

38
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:35,751
I'm going down first.

39
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:36,999
Don't stay up there.
Come down now!

40
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:39,959
Hurry.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,999
They need your help.

42
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,918
Kylin, what are you looking at?

43
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,209
The sea.

44
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,626
We've been on the sea
for almost half a month.

45
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,000
Even the most gorgeous
sea view looks boring.

46
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,334
Honestly, right now...

47
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,459
I kind of miss the
feeling of being on land.

48
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,626
Where is Lian Huan?

49
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,125
Did you see Xie Lian Huan?

50
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,250
Where did he go?

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,792
No.

52
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,042
I've checked.

53
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,959
A set of diving gear and
a rubber boat have gone missing.

54
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,918
Maybe he went scuba-diving?

55
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:27,626
Wen Jin,

56
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,000
did he tell you about it?

57
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,626
If he goes diving alone,

58
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:33,751
it will be too dangerous.

59
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:36,083
We don't know when he left...

60
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,000
and how long he's been in the sea.

61
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,876
We need to find him now.

62
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:41,584
No.

63
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,334
We have to venture in the tomb today.

64
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,834
Don't delay it because of him.

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,876
Maybe he'll come
back after he's had fun.

66
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:47,626
Xiao Li,

67
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,209
you live by the sea.

68
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,876
You know how dangerous the sea is.

69
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,083
Who should be held liable
if something happens?

70
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:54,709
It's all right.

71
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,584
I can't believe it.

72
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,375
Lian Huan didn't even
tell us before going out!

73
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,209
He is so irresponsible!

74
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:10,667
How could he go out alone...

75
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:12,042
without asking permission?

76
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:12,876
Exactly.

77
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:13,751
It's been quite some time.

78
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,250
What if something happened to him?

79
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,334
Look!

80
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:18,667
On that rock!

81
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:19,792
Where? Where?

82
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:20,667
Where?

83
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:21,751
I see it!

84
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,999
We couldn't preserve the body,

85
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:52,167
so we decided to let one of us
take the body back on shore...

86
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,709
for the funeral.

87
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,167
The rest kept the gear and food...

88
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,125
to uncover the underwater tomb.

89
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,600
"There are 9 of us now."

90
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,020
"I'll check it out."

91
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:48,653
"All right."

92
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,584
Is the extra one the sea monkey?

93
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,751
Uncle San Xing and
the gang were carried in...

94
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:14,751
by water like us.

95
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,375
Did they come to this chamber...

96
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,876
or the one with baby coffin?

97
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:18,792
Neither of them.

98
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:12,292
It smells so nice.

99
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,250
Can you smell it?

100
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:15,584
Yes.

101
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:17,083
Where is that scent from?

102
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:18,667
Could it be...

103
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,125
that this tomb belonged to
a woman who liked spices?

104
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,167
So after she died,

105
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,584
a large quantities of
spices were buried with her.

106
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:25,501
San Xing,

107
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,209
have you encountered this before?

108
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,918
The tombs I've been
to were all stinky.

109
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,626
This is the first time I entered...

110
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,209
a scented tomb.

111
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:00,209
Are they all pregnant women?

112
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,450
How come all of them have big bellies?

113
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,667
-True.
-What is this?

114
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:05,999
Sea ghost!

115
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,167
There's a sea ghost here!

116
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,250
This is a sea ghost's tomb!

117
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,167
Sea turtle?

118
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:13,459
What sea turtle?

119
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:18,000
Look.

120
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:19,709
What are these drawings about?

121
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:20,542
And also this one.

122
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:23,834
Look at this.

123
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,250
Scent?

124
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,709
There's only a rotten
smell in this tomb.

125
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,042
There's no scent here.

126
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:33,999
I don't smell any scent.

127
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,083
Maybe...

128
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,292
only the tomb that
Uncle San Xing went smelled good.

129
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,083
Or perhaps...

130
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,417
the scent has gone
after so many years.

131
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:42,375
Little Master,
what happened after that?

132
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:51,999
We better leave.

133
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,042
-It's eerie here.
-I think...

134
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,999
you're afraid the sea turtle would
ask you to be the Dragon King, right?

135
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:00,626
Stop there!

136
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:06,834
Where are you going?

137
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,918
Don't you worry
something will happen again?

138
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,417
Listen, everybody!

139
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,751
The tomb is a complex place.

140
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,167
If we're not careful,

141
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,375
all of us will get into trouble.

142
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,000
Our mission now...

143
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,209
is to take a break here...

144
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,250
to conserve energy.

145
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,667
No one is allowed to touch...

146
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,999
these things without my permission.

147
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,167
Neither can you wander around.

148
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:34,542
Do you hear me?

149
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,501
San Xing is experienced in this.

150
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:38,876
You should listen to him.

151
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,542
All right, we get it.

152
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:42,125
Alright.

153
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,334
Be careful.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,751
San Xing.

155
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:51,751
Are you tired?

156
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,959
Why don't you take a nap here?

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm fine.

158
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:58,667
Don't push yourself too hard.

159
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,209
We're counting on you
for the coming operation.

160
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:02,459
All right.

161
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:03,584
I'll rest for a while then.

162
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,042
Then, what happened?

163
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't remember.

164
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,792
Maybe you should eat a
walnut to tonify your brain.

165
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:11,542
Enough.

166
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,417
Speaking of aroma hypnosis.

167
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,959
Something suddenly came to mind.

168
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:19,792
What is it?

169
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:22,751
Well...

170
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,709
Tell us.
Don't keep us hanging.

171
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,292
When I was in Pan Mansion,

172
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,417
I saw something.

173
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:28,459
It looked like...

174
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,083
a small black stone.

175
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,626
The owner put it in a sealed box.

176
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:33,626
Once the box was opened,

177
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,542
there was a faint fragrance.

178
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,042
I don't know what the smell is.

179
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,667
I never knew you were such a romantic.

180
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,042
Hurry, go on.

181
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:40,626
No joke.

182
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,876
I was also a
famous hooligan in Beijing.

183
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:44,375
The scent...

184
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,584
was so calming.

185
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,125
It made me sleepy just by smelling it.

186
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,667
What exactly is it?

187
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,083
The bone of the Forbidden Maiden
is known as Scent of Bone.

188
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:56,918
Bone?

189
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,918
Ambergris is the whale's poop,
like a piece of wood.

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,918
Yet it's valuable.

191
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:02,709
In your eyes,

192
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:04,209
all things valuable are good.

193
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:05,292
Of course.

194
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:08,042
What is the Forbidden Maiden?

195
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,250
Forbidden Maiden...

196
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,918
It's hard to explain.

197
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,334
People living by the sea consider...

198
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,417
all bad things as Forbidden Maiden.

199
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,751
If they're injured or
their poultry went missing,

200
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,083
they'd blame it on
the Forbidden Maiden.

201
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,542
In other words...

202
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:22,876
An evil spirit, perhaps?

203
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,334
Nonsense.

204
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:26,584
There's no ghosts in this world.

205
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,334
Forbidden Maiden?

206
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,250
Scent of Bone?

207
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,542
I remember it now!

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,999
Regarding the scent,

209
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,959
Uncle San Xing did mention it.

210
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:43,875
"Shan Qing"

211
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,999
The Scent of Bone is very rare.

212
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,501
It's mainly because...

213
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,876
everyone thinks it is
the Forbidden Maiden's bone.

214
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,751
It's ominous.

215
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,542
If you see it in the future,
stay away from it.

216
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,792
Unless if you suffer from insomnia,
you can use it.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,959
You'll fall asleep
faster than passing out.

218
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,709
And have a scented dream.

219
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:04,375
Scented dream?

220
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,334
You'll be lucky if you
don't have a nightmare.

221
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:10,501
I fell asleep in the tomb.

222
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:12,209
I was in shock when I woke up.

223
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,918
Why?

224
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,000
It was like I was given anesthesia.

225
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,042
When I woke up...

226
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,083
Wen Jin.

227
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:51,876
Wen Jin.

228
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,250
Wen Jin!

229
00:13:59,209 --> 00:13:59,918
Where are they?

230
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:01,751
Where are they?

231
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,375
Wen Jin!

232
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:06,999
Wen Jin!

233
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:13,709
Where are the porcelains?

234
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,501
I was then rescued
by a fishing boat...

235
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,250
and sent to the hospital.

236
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,083
I almost died.

237
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:24,584
And then?

238
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,042
And then...

239
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,918
And then, I heard that
I was the only survivor.

240
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,250
The rest were missing.

241
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,000
What happened after that?

242
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,542
After that...

243
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,209
There was no after that.

244
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:44,042
Nephew,

245
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,209
be a good boy.

246
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:46,125
Don't be mischievous.

247
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,959
Don't follow my footsteps.

248
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,292
I'm not sure if Uncle San Xing...

249
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,125
was talking about
what happened in here.

250
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,083
This must be it.

251
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,083
We've got scent, tomb and sea.

252
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,334
Do you think...

253
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,417
I should watch more
magic trick revealed shows?

254
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:20,042
A man was put inside a box.

255
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,834
Spin it twice, and bam!
That man is gone.

256
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:22,918
A tiger came out of nowhere.

257
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,209
Don't you think it's like witnessing
a magical moment in this tomb?

258
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,626
There is a partition...

259
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:33,999
Spin it twice...

260
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,375
There is a cave...

261
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:40,792
I get it!

262
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:41,918
Get what?

263
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:43,918
Elevator.

264
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:47,209
It's an elevator!

265
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:48,501
Let me give you an example.

266
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:49,501
You'll get it.

267
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,167
Let's assume
there's a two-story house.

268
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,626
You came out from the second story.

269
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:55,292
At the same time,

270
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,250
I'm building another
story below the first story.

271
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:58,417
When you come back,

272
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,167
the first story will
become second story.

273
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,000
The second story will
become the third story.

274
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:02,751
So,

275
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:04,626
you actually go
back to the first story...

276
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,834
but not the second story.

277
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:07,375
First, second.

278
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:08,999
Second, first.

279
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:09,709
First, second, third.

280
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:10,834
Can you speak human?

281
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,667
Alright, let me put it this way.

282
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:16,292
There's another story above...

283
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:17,501
or below this side chamber.

284
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,459
These 2 side
chambers are like elevators.

285
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,709
They can move up and down.

286
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,501
The sizes are pretty much the same,

287
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:24,626
but the things inside are different.

288
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,751
So after we went out and came back in,

289
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:27,959
the oxygen cylinders were gone,

290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,792
that's because...

291
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:29,918
this side chamber...

292
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,334
had been lifted or lowered.

293
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:33,501
I get it now!

294
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:34,250
Isn't it...

295
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:37,250
Isn't it a trick to fool kids?

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,209
I thought it was very intricate.

297
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:41,167
Right.

298
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,000
This is a trick that fools kids.

299
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,876
Yet we're trapped inside, aren't we?

300
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,542
Didn't I tell you?

301
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,167
We shouldn't over-think.

302
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,999
Just think simple!

303
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,375
Shall we wait at the passage?

304
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:53,667
When the side chamber moves back,

305
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:55,500
we can take back the oxygen cylinder.

306
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:56,209
That's not right.

307
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,876
What's wrong?

308
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,042
Am I wrong?

309
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,542
I've been thinking
about what your uncle said.

310
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,083
There's a big flaw in his story.

311
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:10,042
What flaw?

312
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,334
He said he had fallen
asleep in the side chamber.

313
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:13,792
He didn't walk out,

314
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,959
but had gone inside the passage.

315
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,417
Then no matter how
this chamber moved,

316
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,792
he should have stayed
inside the same chamber.

317
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,250
How could there be any changes?

318
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,292
You're right.

319
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,709
Could it be that
while he was sleeping,

320
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,375
someone moved him to another chamber?

321
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,876
When he woke up,
he realized everyone was gone.

322
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,000
Wait.

323
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,417
Uncle San Xing
came in from the cenote.

324
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,501
He also went out...

325
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:35,918
through the cenote.

326
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:37,501
How many cenotes
are there in this tomb?

327
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,167
We got in from the cenote too.

328
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:40,125
Also,

329
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,375
the side chamber with baby coffin...

330
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:45,333
is different from the 2 chambers
that Uncle San Xing was in.

331
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,209
My only concern now is that...

332
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:49,709
I don't know...

333
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,626
the movement pattern of this chamber.

334
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,417
It's still alright if
it goes by hours.

335
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,918
If it is by days or months.

336
00:19:58,292 --> 00:19:59,626
I'm not sure how
long the oxygen here...

337
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:00,918
can sustain us.

338
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,375
Forget about the oxygen,

339
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,334
we also lack of food and water.

340
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,667
Don't worry too much.

341
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,542
Let's just wait in the passage.

342
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:08,876
When the chamber moves back,

343
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,667
we'll take back the cylinders.

344
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,459
Great!

345
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,709
Terrific!

346
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,042
Awesome!

347
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,417
Based on our speculation,

348
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,209
the side chamber has 2 stories.

349
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,459
And the side chambers in this tomb...

350
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:42,792
are in left-right symmetry.

351
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,999
So it's no surprise seeing this here.

352
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,834
The coffin inside...

353
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,792
is probably made of
Phoebe Zhennan wood.

354
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,999
The front.

355
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,000
Let me tell you.

356
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,542
The diameter of this log
must be about the same as...

357
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:57,626
the logs used to build the
32 pillars in the Ming Tombs.

358
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,584
Even taels of the same price...

359
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,709
are not as valuable as this.

360
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,709
Wu Xie,

361
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:07,417
this probably is the coffin...

362
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:09,501
your uncle found when he woke up.

363
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,375
We have too much
time to spare anyways.

364
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,250
Let's check it out.

365
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:26,417
Classy.

366
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:29,334
A coffin like this is
found in the side chamber.

367
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,751
Imagine how fancy the
coffin of the owner would be.

368
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:37,700
The feng shui in this
chamber is too weird.

369
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,125
The traps set here
are more like a prank.

370
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,083
I wonder what the
tomb owner was thinking.

371
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,459
Why do you care so much?

372
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,584
It's fine for me as long
as I can find my treasure.

373
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:52,626
Keep quiet.

374
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:54,209
Why?

375
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:57,876
What are you doing?

376
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,375
Take it easy.

377
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,209
I thought you always behaved yourself.

378
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:03,459
Why'd you become so bold
like me after seeing a coffin?

379
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:08,417
Light a candle before opening it.

380
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:09,918
We have to follow old rules.

381
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,626
Get it?

382
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,167
Where is south-east?

383
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,584
We don't have much oxygen here.

384
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:17,375
And you want to light a candle.

385
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:18,250
Do you want to die?

386
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,876
How much oxygen can a candle use?

387
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,501
I'll breathe in less oxygen then.

388
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:34,626
What is this?

389
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,375
It's a poop scooper.

390
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,834
A cat was buried with him.

391
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,125
What are you scared of?

392
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,626
Don't be superstitious.

393
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,918
Who's scared?

394
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,792
Let me tell you.

395
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:53,292
You have to thank me, you know?

396
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,459
When we run out of oxygen,

397
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,459
this serves as a reminder.

398
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:02,584
Naughty.

399
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,792
Everything looks so weird in here.

400
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,209
Everything doesn't make sense.

401
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,751
He just puts
whatever's forbidden here.

402
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,292
Totally against the rules.

403
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:17,918
If it goes on like this,

404
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,209
when we get to the next main chamber,

405
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,792
there must be more surprises.

406
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,834
The stench!

407
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,417
It's so dirty.

408
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:51,667
It's all body fat.

409
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:54,876
I couldn't bring myself to touch it.

410
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,000
So many arms are stuck together.

411
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:58,918
What kind of custom is that?

412
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,999
This kind of joint burial is so cruel.

413
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,209
It is brutal.

414
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:04,667
The bodies are all twisted together.

415
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:06,083
Perhaps it's not a joint burial,

416
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:07,459
but they were buried alive?

417
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,292
This is the so-called,
"nourishing corpses with qi".

418
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:10,459
The men are stacked up...

419
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:11,918
and killed by gas poisoning inside.

420
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,209
Nourishing corpses with qi?

421
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,709
You have no idea right?

422
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,417
Uncle San Xing really
didn't teach you much.

423
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,375
This is known as a nourishing coffin.

424
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:19,709
It is a feng shui philosophy,

425
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,292
commonly applied in mausoleum.

426
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:22,751
It is believed that in a tomb,

427
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:24,459
there are 2 locations
with supreme feng shui.

428
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:26,709
If there are no
coffins at those locations,

429
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,626
the empty space will gather...

430
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:29,999
spiritual energy of the ocean...

431
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,083
and attract evil spirit.

432
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,751
So the owner's coffin will
be put at one of the locations,

433
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:36,125
while the other coffin...

434
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,950
must belong to a blood relative.

435
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:38,999
And the coffin must...

436
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,459
look exactly the same
as the owner's tomb.

437
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:41,709
This is known as "nourishing qi".

438
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:42,584
Get it?

439
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:45,959
So many of them were
buried alive with the dead?

440
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,834
Human minds are so complex.

441
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,334
Because of the delusive feng shui,

442
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:54,459
their lives were taken
like they were hay.

443
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:57,542
So, I think we should get few vases...

444
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,876
from next door and
scoop the water out.

445
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,042
Having water in a
coffin is inauspicious.

446
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:02,999
Fatty,

447
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,292
you're doing it for
the burial objects, right?

448
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:06,709
You... Didn't we...

449
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:07,876
come here for them?

450
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:09,209
I didn't.

451
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:10,167
I did.

452
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:20,459
Fatty.

453
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:23,834
What is it?

454
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,083
There is only 1 person in here.

455
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:30,042
Pay attention to his head.

456
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,167
Six persons with 6 heads,
it is correct.

457
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:36,292
No.

458
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:38,334
There's only 1 person.

459
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:39,334
Look.

460
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,167
Apart from the head on top,

461
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:43,125
the rest don't have faces...

462
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,209
nor even the shape of a head.

463
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:46,334
Most importantly,

464
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:47,626
the joints of these hands...

465
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,167
are attached to the same torso.

466
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:52,209
This is a huge human insect.

467
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,876
A deformed man
born with so many limbs.

468
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,751
He'd be killed as a
monster as soon as he was born.

469
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:58,292
There's no way he
could grow to such age.

470
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:59,501
This is definitely fabricated.

471
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,450
Both of you are talking nonsense.

472
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,751
I think we should go next door,

473
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:06,292
take a few vases
and scoop the water out.

474
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,584
So we can see clearly.

475
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,792
Maybe there is a clue inside...

476
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,999
to help us get out of here.

477
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:14,999
I want to find out
why the tomb owner...

478
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:16,751
did such inhumane things.

479
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,250
There.

480
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:32,250
Are you a Virgo?

481
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:33,542
Pisces.

482
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,334
You're so picky.

483
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,830
Get down off your high horse.

484
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,250
How long will I
take if I do this alone?

485
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:11,751
Can you be more sensitive?

486
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,125
The paintings on
these porcelains are...

487
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:37,250
about a group of people
working on a construction site.

488
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,459
Some are sculpting rocks.

489
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,792
Some transporting logs.

490
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:43,417
Some building bridges.

491
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:45,459
Just nice!

492
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,876
The arrangement of the vases...

493
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,580
is in line with the
construction progress.

494
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,250
This is so amazing!

495
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:55,626
The scale of this can be
compared to the Palace Museum.

496
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:01,334
But the architecture doesn't
look like its from Central Plain.

497
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:02,999
Fatty,

498
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,459
help me think.

499
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,667
Where can we find such
huge buildings in ancient China?

500
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,375
Stupid fatty.

501
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:14,083
He just left without telling me.

502
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:34,876
What's going on?

503
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:38,375
Where is the door?

504
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:01,209
Why hasn't Wu Xie returned yet?

505
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:02,667
He has difficulty in selection.

506
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,250
Takes so long just to pick a vase.

507
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,751
It's a female body.

508
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,000
One, two...

509
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,501
There are 12 hands.

510
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:16,000
Shouldn't there be 12 nipples?

511
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,292
How come there are only 5?

512
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,334
It's unbalanced.

513
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:19,417
Take it out and have a look.

514
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,000
Fatty!

515
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:23,501
Little Master!

516
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,083
Fatty!

517
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:37,584
Don't panic. Don't panic.

518
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:40,167
As of now,

519
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:42,709
the door moves very frequently.

520
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,501
Maybe after a few minutes,

521
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,834
it will move back again.

522
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:49,042
Don't panic.

523
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:50,999
Calm down.

524
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:52,417
Take a deep breath.

525
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:58,667
Wait, no.

526
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,000
I can't waste the oxygen.

527
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:14,292
The body looks terrible.

528
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:26,417
It's only been a minute?

529
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,584
Is my watch broken?

530
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,083
Little Master!

531
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:38,751
Right.

532
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:41,459
Theory of relativity!

533
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:43,959
That's right!

534
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:00,667
A dark and quiet
environment like this...

535
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:02,042
deepens fear.

536
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:04,584
A dark and quiet
environment like this...

537
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:05,876
deepens fear.

538
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:06,834
So under...

539
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:07,876
such circumstances,

540
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,660
time would seem
to be passing slowly.

541
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:10,250
Right.

542
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,125
It's good to know this.

543
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:13,792
I'm not scared anymore.

544
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,200
The scariest thing in this world...

545
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,167
is probably this underwater tomb.

546
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:20,959
No!

547
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:23,083
A human's heart...

548
00:31:23,626 --> 00:31:24,999
is the scariest.

549
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:29,709
Why am I scaring myself?

550
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,250
The cat has come back to life.

551
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:40,792
Move the corpse first.

552
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,542
This lady looks absolutely awful.

553
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:01,542
It's hideous.

554
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,542
So gross.

555
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,751
There are some
words on the coffin weight.

556
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,042
The tomb owner had it all planned out.

557
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:21,250
Even if the airtight structure...

558
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,250
is destroyed and water floods in,

559
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,874
the coffin weight will
prevent the coffin from floating.

560
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,083
What is written on it?

561
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:34,000
Fine, I won't worry about it now.

562
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,918
I'll know when little comrade is back.

563
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,167
What is taking Wu Xie so long?

564
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:45,918
Where did the door go?

565
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,709
Stop beating.

566
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,042
The mechanism is activated again.

567
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,834
The tomb owner is fooling us.

568
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,125
He is looking for trouble.

569
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:02,834
Let me tell you.

570
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,000
When I find the main chamber,

571
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,160
I will turn it upside down.

572
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:08,709
Let's go.

573
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,542
Take the coffin weight out first.

574
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,292
One, two, three!

575
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:34,167
The stone is not that big.

576
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,375
Why is it so heavy?

577
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,209
There is rosin around it.

578
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:52,250
It is glued to the base.

579
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,042
It's hollow underneath.

580
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,125
Why haven't they come out?

581
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:17,501
How much time has passed?

582
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,160
Is it because the
tomb is centuries-old...

583
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,167
so the mechanism is stuck?

584
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:27,459
Forget it.

585
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,459
No point getting anxious.

586
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:35,125
Does it have something
to do with these porcelains?

587
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,209
These are from Ming dynasty.

588
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:39,918
Maybe I'll discover something.

589
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:53,042
What are you pushing for?

590
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:54,042
You got a problem?

591
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:55,417
There are so many fishes
for you to eat in the sea.

592
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,000
Why must you come
to the underwater tomb?

593
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:00,834
You think you can eat me?

594
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,167
Let me tell you.

595
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,042
I've been drinking gutter
oil since I was a kid!

596
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm filled with poison!

597
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:05,959
I'll kill you.

598
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,918
There's a hole in the coffin.

599
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,959
I've never seen this before.

600
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:46,042
It's the looters' tunnel.

601
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:46,751
Looters' tunnel?

602
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:47,542
This is so cool.

603
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,459
It's right below the coffin.

604
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,584
The man who dug
it is really something.

605
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,040
How did he make it?

606
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:54,876
It is under the sea.

607
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:56,292
Doesn't this side chamber...

608
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,999
move up and down?

609
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,417
There should be another
side chamber below this coffin.

610
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:01,375
If not,

611
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,999
how come the hole is so deep?

612
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,918
Wu Xie's speculation is wrong.

613
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:11,999
This hole has ruined
the feng shui layout.

614
00:38:19,626 --> 00:38:21,417
Despite the fact that wax
has formed on this corpse,

615
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,292
it won't come to life.

616
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,751
But this auspicious site
has become inauspicious.

617
00:38:25,876 --> 00:38:28,542
The feng shui layout
of the entire tomb...

618
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,292
has been ruined.

619
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:34,792
Let me tell you.

620
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:35,834
We have to be careful.

621
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:37,042
If we couldn't figure it out,

622
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:38,542
let's just wait for Wu Xie.

623
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,375
What the heck is this?

624
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,209
It's totally different
from what we expected.

625
00:38:58,626 --> 00:38:59,751
We won't be able to kill it. Run!

626
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,083
It's a coffin!

627
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,501
Why did the tomb owner...

628
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,792
make his coffin into a bathtub?

629
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,250
He must have loved bathing.

630
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:49,417
How deep is this?

631
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:03,667
In the first side chamber we were in,

632
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,125
there was a deep cenote too.

633
00:40:05,918 --> 00:40:06,626
Maybe...

634
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,000
the water here...

635
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,792
goes to the lowest part
of the underwater tomb?

636
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:13,292
No.

637
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:16,667
Isn't there an
elevator-like mechanism?

638
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,000
There is so much water.

639
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,667
How was it channeled in here?

640
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:27,834
My current location is...

641
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:39,167
The left.

642
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:40,751
The left hall.

643
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:42,542
If it is symmetrical,

644
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:44,542
there should be a right hall.

645
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,334
Since this is an underwater tomb,

646
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,250
the owner must be a man of wealth...

647
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,125
and position.

648
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:52,792
According to...

649
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,083
the tomb layout for aristocrats,

650
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,584
there should be a white
marble coffin platform...

651
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:57,292
in the left and
right hall respectively.

652
00:40:57,709 --> 00:40:58,999
In the middle of the platform,

653
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,167
there should be...

654
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,792
a rectangular golden
well filled with soil.

655
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:11,125
But none of those are found here.

656
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:15,709
Wait a minute,

657
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:19,626
the coffin should
be put in the rear hall.

658
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,792
Why is the coffin in the side hall?

659
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,083
Moreover, it is a basin coffin.

660
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,542
Basin coffins are from
the Warring States Period.

661
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,999
So...

662
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:33,000
this tomb isn't from Ming dynasty?
