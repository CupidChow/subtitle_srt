"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:07,267
"Episode 15"

3
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,880
This is so unusual.

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,680
The bronze tree...

5
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,120
excavated from Sanxingdui...

6
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,760
is only 4 meters high...

7
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,560
and it was cast in sections.

8
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,200
The 100 meters bronze tree you said..

9
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,360
required to be cast
not only in sections...

10
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
but also in one entire piece.

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,400
How is it possible?

12
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,040
I'm telling you the truth.

13
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,520
There's nothing I can do
if you don't believe me.

14
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Fatty Wang,

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,560
just take it as a story then.

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,040
No, then...

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
did you...

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,000
dig something out?

19
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
I did.

20
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,960
I found some jades,

21
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,720
some ancient ceramics...

22
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
and this bell.

23
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,400
After coming out,

24
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,840
my cousin went missing.

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,480
When I was reselling...

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,120
these things in my hometown,

27
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,200
I was arrested by the police.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
As a result,

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,480
I spent 2 years in jail.

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
I was just released...

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
and am completely broke.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,400
Luckily,

33
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,640
I hid the bell at the beginning.

34
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,760
Right now,

35
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,840
I depend on it to turn things around.

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,880
it's up to me whether
you can turn things around.

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,640
But have you finished the story?

38
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,240
Have you finished it?

39
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,840
Have you?

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,480
I have.

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,000
All right, do you accept WeChat Pay?

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Is WeChat pay okay?

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,520
Better pay in cash.

44
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Who are you taking to?

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,880
My brothers.

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
My brothers from my hometown.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
Take this money first.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,720
it's great!

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,160
Guo Guo,

50
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,360
thank you so much.

51
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,480
I was just out of jail...

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,880
and you helped me make so much money.

53
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,920
If you have other good deals,

54
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,560
take me with you.

55
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,560
Of course.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,280
This is only small money.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,560
You can earn...

58
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
a lot more working for me.

59
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,000
Awesome.

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,440
If you have any great opportunities,

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,800
don't forget me.

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,680
All right then.

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,840
Goodbye.

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Bye.

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,800
Please be seated.

66
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,160
Ms. Ning, have a seat.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,280
The prison has driven Mr. Ma crazy.

68
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,120
He's so excited
just talking to the air,

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,440
like there really is a person.

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
It freaks me out.

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,440
But it's good that...

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,360
he's mentally ill.

73
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,200
If not, it'd be tough to coax him...

74
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,200
into going to Fatty's.

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
He should thank me...

76
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,800
for helping him sell these things.

77
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,800
With this money,

78
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,280
he can live a good life...

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,600
back in his hometown.

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,480
He also told me that...

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,800
the bronze tree was cast...

82
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,800
with human blood...

83
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,440
and the bell is sinister too.

84
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,680
Carry it and one will see ghosts.

85
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,680
Can you believe that?

86
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
God knows if the bronze tree...

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,640
he mentioned is real.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,760
I'd like to see for myself.

89
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
Maybe you'll have
the opportunity soon.

90
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,920
It's common for buyers
to name a price to...

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,280
mystify things.

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,120
This is my first time meeting one
pretending to be schizophrenic.

93
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,080
But I don't think
the guy was faking it.

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,680
Fatty.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,960
You said the bronze
bells were found in both...

96
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,280
the underwater tomb
of Paracel Islands...

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,320
and King Lu's Seven Stars Palace.

98
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,960
Now Qinling also has it.

99
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
A rare thing like it can't possibly...

100
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
appear in so many places, right?

101
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,840
Also,

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
the bronze tree that
Mr. Ma mentioned...

103
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,320
is 100 meters high.

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,880
How big is that supposed to be?

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
I don't know about the bell.

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
But he was definitely boasting...

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
about the bronze tree.

108
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,600
There were limited manpower...

109
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,440
and resources in Bronze Age.

110
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,400
Even if it was an official
production in late Qing dynasty,

111
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,800
no way it could be made.

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,560
Moreover, it's few
hundreds meters high.

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,040
If a huge thing like this...

114
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
was created,

115
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,680
wouldn't it be recorded in history?

116
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,960
There's nothing.

117
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm going to bed.

118
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,560
Don't think too much. Go sleep.

119
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,320
You didn't drink
much last night, right?

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
What are you looking for?

121
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,440
You look so absorbed.

122
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,440
Xiu Xiu...

123
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,040
asked me to view a house for her.

124
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,760
Let me tell you.

125
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
Mr. Qi used to be
an antique dealer but...

126
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,280
he's a master in Chinese Studies now.

127
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,040
The man who did foot binding...

128
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,160
is now a master in Chinese Studies.

129
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
Is he reliable?

130
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Mr. Qi is really a man of knowledge.

131
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,640
He's a visiting professor...

132
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,320
in several universities.

133
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
He specializes in ethnic minorities.

134
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,680
By the way,

135
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,120
I've showed the photo you sent me...

136
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
to Mr. Qi.

137
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,560
He's very interested.

138
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,400
You hear that?

139
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,400
Hurry, hurry.

140
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,520
Don't waste my gaming time.

141
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,200
You'll soon find...

142
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,080
the answer to your question.

143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,760
Say Mr. Qi,

144
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,880
you've been looking at it for 3 hours.

145
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,480
Have you found anything?

146
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,520
I've already finished a book.

147
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm embarrassed.

148
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,560
I've been studying ancient
history of minority groups...

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,080
for so many years.

150
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,080
This is the first time...

151
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,480
I've seen this thing.

152
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,000
Xie Zi,

153
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,320
where did you get it?

154
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
This is a knickknack...

155
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,880
I found in my storeroom.

156
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,800
I don't really know...

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
where it came from.

158
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,800
Your family...

159
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,880
Xie family always has the good stuff.

160
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,800
Mr. Qi,

161
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
is there something special...

162
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,520
about this bell?

163
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,880
The bell is made of bronze.

164
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,400
Judging from its
material, craftsmanship...

165
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,840
and the degree of weathering,

166
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,600
I can tell...

167
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,080
it's from the Pre-Tang Era.

168
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,320
No doubt about it.

169
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
I deduce that it should be...

170
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
between Xia and Western Zhou dynasty.

171
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,280
It appeared in...

172
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,200
a vanished ancient kingdom...

173
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,880
between Shaanxi and Hubei now.

174
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,080
Serpent Kingdom.

175
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,160
Serpent Kingdom?

176
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:54,475
Right, Serpent Kingdom.

177
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,120
The historical records
of Serpent Kingdom...

178
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,520
is sporadic in the
bamboo slips we unearthed.

179
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,360
It had been very prosperous...

180
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,520
for a period of time.

181
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,560
But during the middle of
Western Zhou dynasty,

182
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,960
it suddenly disappeared.

183
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Even so,

184
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,560
we still can find traces of it...

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,080
in some of our classics.

186
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,440
Such as,
"The Classic of Mountains and Seas".

187
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,880
In this classic,

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,920
there is a narrative...

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,040
about a country...

190
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,840
called Savanna Snake Kingdom.

191
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,960
The people in this kingdom...

192
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,560
saw a two-bodied snake
with human face...

193
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
as God.

194
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,480
They carved this image...

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,040
on various artifacts.

196
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,560
Savanna Snake Kingdom...

197
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,480
is probably the Serpent Kingdom.

198
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,480
Speaking of Serpent Kingdom,

199
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,800
I can tell you...

200
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,040
I've studied its history.

201
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
What is the origin of Serpent Kingdom?

202
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,480
Current studies generally believe...

203
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,600
that Serpent Kingdom
was branched out...

204
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,040
from ancient Kingdom of Huaxu.

205
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,040
Its previous existence traces back...

206
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,040
to the matriarchal society.

207
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,160
There is a myth in the
ancient Kingdom of Huaxu...

208
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,400
depicting Fuxi as a creature
with human face and snake body.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
So, Serpent Kingdom is probably...

210
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
a tribe split from the
ancient Kingdom of Huaxu.

211
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,880
Mr. Qi,

212
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,600
the Serpent Kingdom you mentioned...

213
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,040
and its related stories,

214
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,760
how authentic are they?

215
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
Young man,

216
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,120
China has thousands
years of history...

217
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,480
which can be divided into 3 parts.

218
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,400
The future will be...

219
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,600
revealed in future.

220
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,880
The present...

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,200
is unfolding itself now.

222
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,160
But what happened in the past,

223
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,800
especially the history
of Serpent Kingdom...

224
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,160
that has no written records.

225
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,880
We'll never know the truth.

226
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,720
Understand?

227
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,840
So we can only
investigate and justify,

228
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,840
but never will we...

229
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,880
achieve 100 percent accuracy.

230
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,520
This is the charm of history.

231
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,240
Mr. Qi,

232
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,000
what you told me today...

233
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,640
has been really helpful.

234
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
But in addition to that,

235
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,280
do you have anything
else to share with me?

236
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,520
Well,

237
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,000
let me give you 2 books.

238
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
One.

239
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,280
Two.

240
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,160
Take these books...

241
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,160
with you and read them

242
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,120
One more thing.

243
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,120
I met an archeology fanatic before.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,880
This guy explored an ancient tomb...

245
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,520
deep in Qinling...

246
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,080
many years ago.

247
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,480
Look, do you know what it is?

248
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,160
Look carefully.

249
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
It's the ancient tomb
of Serpent Kingdom.

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,280
He took some photos.

251
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,920
This is the rock painting
in the ancient tomb,

252
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,680
portraying the sacrificial
ceremony of the Serpents.

253
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,800
Then, the news spread.

254
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,480
Many experts and researchers...

255
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,720
followed him to Qinling yet again...

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,640
to look for the ancient tomb.

257
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,680
But the tomb vanished...

258
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,800
and was never found again.

259
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,240
But based on the way...

260
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
this fanatic...

261
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,800
told me the story...

262
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,160
and my judgment on him.

263
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
I believe what he said is true.

264
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,680
But how the ancient
tomb disappeared...

265
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,680
and why was it never found?

266
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,280
It's a mystery.

267
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,640
Mr. Qi is unreliable.

268
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,160
The things he said...

269
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,760
are all written in books.

270
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,520
If you didn't...

271
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,640
listen to Mr. Qi's explanation,

272
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,360
would you know...

273
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,600
which book to look it up in?

274
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,160
You can search it on Baidu.

275
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,360
Wu Xie,

276
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,600
what are you going to do next?

277
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,440
I want to finish these books first...

278
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,640
to learn more about Serpent Kingdom...

279
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,840
and this.

280
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,880
After that,

281
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,360
I'll go to Qinling myself...

282
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
for a field trip.

283
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,920
I...I...I'm not going.

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm not going.

285
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,480
It...it's just a huge pit.

286
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,600
If what...

287
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,520
Mr. Qi said is real,

288
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,840
the guy is now a madman.

289
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,120
So many people went there...

290
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,000
and they found nothing...

291
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
but a huge pit.

292
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,400
Such a big bronze tree.

293
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,560
This is a miracle...

294
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,520
in the history of bronze forgery.

295
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,880
Don't you want to see it for yourself?

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,320
The miracle I want to see...

297
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,440
is when I get back home,

298
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,240
I see a roomful of cash.

299
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,360
Don't be so depressed.

300
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,480
Cheer up.

301
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,120
I'll treat you hotpot tonight, okay?

302
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't want it.

303
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,880
Anyway,

304
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,920
the plushy you're holding...

305
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
is a gift I redeemed by
collecting Yuwan points...

306
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,080
in Yuwan Mall.

307
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Doesn't the cartoon look like you?

308
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
Maybe even more handsome than you.

309
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,640
Looks like you all right!

310
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,520
All right, cheer up.

311
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
You can order as
much food as you like.

312
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,920
I want mutton hot pot,

313
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,800
blanched tripe, fried liver
and bittern flapjack.

314
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,680
Okay.

315
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,280
What okay?

316
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,920
We can't find none
of these over there,

317
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,480
except a huge pit.

318
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,680
We have dumplings.

319
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,320
I'll feed you with a zombie dumpling.

320
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,447
"To Qinling"

321
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,760
Is this the bloke...

322
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,680
who drives the Maserati?

323
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
The car which was in front of us?

324
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
Must be new money.

325
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,640
How is it possible that
he was not kidnapped?

326
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,720
Mazi, you surprise me.

327
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,600
Don't tell me...

328
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,000
you've kidnapped someone before...

329
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,000
while working under Uncle Tai.

330
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,720
No, no.

331
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,800
You think too much.

332
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,200
We're craftsmen.

333
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,200
We don't do dirty jobs.

334
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,560
Hurry, let's go inside.

335
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,360
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds?

336
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,760
Arena of Valor.

337
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,480
Xiao Xie is really a powerful player.

338
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,200
He can kill opponents
like killing ants.

339
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,680
You call him Master Hua
in front of him,

340
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,880
but Xiao Xie behind his back.

341
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,400
I was showing him respect.

342
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,080
Hurry up and eat.

343
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,000
The food is getting cold.

344
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,840
Hurry.

345
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
What's the rush,
the tomb's not going anywhere.

346
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,960
Wonderful!

347
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,400
That's it!

348
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,760
Where are you headed...

349
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,120
to sell local products?

350
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,880
Where are you going...

351
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,040
to do business?

352
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,960
Are you digging for
some local product?

353
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,480
What local product?

354
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,736
We're here for travel.

355
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,920
What are the local specialties?

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,240
Can you recommend us?

357
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,000
The walnuts here are good.

358
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,920
It can tonify the brain.

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Really?

360
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,800
Don't forget...

361
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,240
to buy some walnuts later.

362
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,640
Here you go.

363
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,360
My treat.

364
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,480
You're too polite.

365
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,280
Thank you.

366
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,120
Too polite.

367
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,760
Thank you!

368
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,440
Stop looking, let's eat.

369
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
The food's turn cold.

370
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,960
No worries.

371
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,280
Two cubs just coming up the mountain.

372
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
They know nothing.

373
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,680
Just ignore them.

374
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,960
Thank you, madam!

375
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,560
Something's fishy about those guys.

376
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,120
They were speaking in codes.

377
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,720
"Coming up the mountain"
means cave explore.

378
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
"Cub" means...

379
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,600
we're not one of them.

380
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,840
They smell of dirt.

381
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,280
They must be here to explore caves.

382
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Wasn't I a bit loud when
I mentioned cave explore?

383
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,920
That's why the guy
came and interrogated us.

384
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,280
When I came back...

385
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,040
from toilet,

386
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
I also ran into them.

387
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
They did look weird.

388
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,240
Let me tell you.

389
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,040
Those who have explored a cave
and those who haven't...

390
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,920
are different.

391
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,480
People in the same line can smell it.

392
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,040
Not to mention they're
a bunch of old hands.

393
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,800
Are they going to the same place...

394
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
like us?

395
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,120
Don't you wish.

396
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,760
There are many caves in Qinling.

397
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,160
The one we're going to...

398
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,200
is not a normal cave.

399
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
It's just a giant pit.

400
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,440
If we really run into each other,

401
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
I'll buy lottery when I go back.

402
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,840
All right.

403
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,280
You better buy it if it happens.

404
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,040
Fatty,

405
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,960
you're right.

406
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,760
I saw Luoyang shovels.

407
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,680
Everyone carries Luoyang shovels...

408
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
when exploring a cave these days.

409
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,880
Don't know if they know how to use it.

410
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,720
Look at you.

411
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,040
Do you feel like vomiting?

412
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,560
Your friend...

413
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,280
really has a terrible car sickness.

414
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,040
Drink some water.

415
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,120
Thank you.

416
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll give him some medicine later.

417
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,560
Thank you.

418
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,600
All right, sorry for the trouble.

419
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,800
it's so challenging
driving on a winding...

420
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,480
mountain road.

421
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,280
There are twists
and turns every 5 seconds.

422
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,880
When I got off the car,

423
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
I was spinning too.

424
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
Would you hear what you're saying?

425
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,320
Sister Wang!

426
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,480
Coming!

427
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,920
Here to lodge.

428
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,520
-Do you have rooms?
-Yes.

429
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,240
Come.

430
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
Please come in.

431
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,320
Come.

432
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,640
What a coincidence!

433
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,840
We meet again!

434
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,560
Tell me about it.

435
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,720
Are you also here...

436
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,960
to hunt monkeys?

437
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,840
Hunt monkeys?

438
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,720
I've got you wrong.

439
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,160
I've got you wrong.

440
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,280
I thought you were here
to steal my business.

441
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,880
What's wrong?

442
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,920
Go to the toilet if
you're going to throw up.

443
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,880
Think of the environment.

444
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,120
Hurry, go!

445
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,120
You better not tell anyone.

446
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,920
Why are the two boys here?

447
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,840
They seem to be
smuggling wild animals.

448
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Will they get in our way?

449
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Everything's fine.

450
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
We're after different things.

451
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,760
It better be true.

452
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,000
Otherwise, nobody will know if
one or two people go missing...

453
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,720
in the mountains.

454
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
All right.

455
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,080
Let's go.

456
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,880
Who is it?

457
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,200
Go check it out.

458
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,200
Hello,

459
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,640
it's humid in the mountains at night.

460
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,800
You city folks have sensitive skin.

461
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,640
You can get eczema easily.

462
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,840
I came to give you
a box of Piyanping cream.

463
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,320
This cream works
well to relieve itching.

464
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
I know this medicine. It's good.

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,280
I won't disturb you then.

466
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,960
Do you think...

467
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
they followed us here?

468
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,000
Looking at the way they behaved,

469
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,080
this bunch is no ordinary people.

470
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,160
They definitely don't sell walnuts.

471
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,840
Since ancient times,

472
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,640
the 800-mile Qinchuan
has been a famous place...

473
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,040
where many heritage sites are located,

474
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,080
especially Beipo.

475
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,920
There are many mausoleums there.

476
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,480
The tombs of the rich...

477
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
and the noble...

478
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,720
are uncountable.

479
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,760
So...

480
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,040
since ancient times,

481
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,040
many treasure hunters...

482
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,120
have been swarming this place.

483
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,520
That's so outrageous.

484
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,160
Tell me honestly.

485
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,360
Have you been outrageous before?

486
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Me?

487
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,280
Ever since I met you,

488
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,240
anything we found...

489
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,600
must be reported
to national authorities.

490
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,040
I couldn't be even if I wanted to.

491
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,840
All right.

492
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,240
Let's talk about
our current situation.

493
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,840
Seriously.

494
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,440
Although we're after different things,

495
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,600
their group has more people.

496
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,800
The old man...

497
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,040
behind with the glasses...

498
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,400
really gives me the creeps.

499
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,560
Maybe he has killed...

500
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,880
a few lives before.

501
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,960
No.

502
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,000
You rest first.

503
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm going to dig
a few clues from them.

504
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,600
Be careful.

505
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,320
We've been outrageous before.
Don't worry.

506
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,400
Should I get you...

507
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,360
something to eat?

508
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,640
No need.

509
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,680
I'll get some sleep.

510
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Be careful.

511
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,600
All right.

512
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,720
Come, have a drink.

513
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,160
I don't know...

514
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,440
if you like the food.

515
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,600
But anyway,

516
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,280
if there's anything unsatisfactory,
please bear with us.

517
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,200
Madam!

518
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,320
Coming!

519
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,240
What specialties do you have here?

520
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,480
We serve home-cooked dishes.

521
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,200
But the chickens and pigs...

522
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
are raised by us.

523
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,680
We grow our own vegetables too.

524
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,880
The mushrooms and
wild herbs are also picked...

525
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
by my man from the mountains.

526
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,480
It's guaranteed all
natural and pollution-free.

527
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,120
All right,

528
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,840
you see to it.

529
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,880
I have a big appetite,

530
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,080
just give me 4 dishes and 1 soup.

531
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,800
Isn't your friend joining you?

532
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,800
He's suffering from
vomiting and diarrhea.

533
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,400
He finally fell asleep.

534
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,200
No problem.

535
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,080
Madam,

536
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,880
do you know any guides?

537
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,880
What guide?

538
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,560
I was thinking of
doing some research...

539
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,640
at the ethnic village.

540
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,840
Then you have to find a local...

541
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,680
to take you there.

542
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
The Snake Head Mountain...

543
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,240
has a peak of...

544
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,720
more than 1000 meters above sea level.

545
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,160
Your car for sure can't get in.

546
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,480
You have to walk up there.

547
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,800
It's okay if you just wander...

548
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,960
around the scenic spot.

549
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,720
But if you want to go
deep in the mountains,

550
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
there are many people who...

551
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,160
can't find their way out.

552
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
Then you have to...

553
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,120
introduce me a good guide.

554
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,480
A reliable one.

555
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,040
Sure.

556
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,080
I'll ask for you and...

557
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,640
see if anyone wants to take this job.

558
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,280
Cool.

559
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,000
Thank you, Madam.

560
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,680
Sit back then.

561
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,520
I'll go prepare your food.

562
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,200
All right!

563
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,120
Are you all also going...

564
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
to the ethnic village?

565
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,320
Us?

566
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,640
We're here to hunt monkeys!

567
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,680
Just kidding.

568
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,720
We're here to do business.

569
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,040
Selling local produce.

570
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,840
Walnuts?

571
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,880
Great.

572
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
You're making contribution...

573
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,120
to the local economy.

574
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,800
How's the local produce business
coming along these days?

575
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,840
Our local specialty business?

576
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,960
We're making hard-earned money.

577
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,640
Unlike you.

578
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,280
You make much more money...

579
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,840
in researching ethnic tribes...

580
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,120
and wild animals, right?

581
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,040
That's not true.

582
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,000
Doing research...

583
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,640
requires going on field trips
and writing reports.

584
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,920
Huge investment but little payback.

585
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,200
We're doing it for interest.

586
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,000
Cheers.

587
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,720
Cheers.

588
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,000
Fatty...

589
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,160
Fatty.

590
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,040
Fatty.

591
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,480
Fatty!

592
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,560
Fatty!

593
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,120
Why are you hiding here?

594
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,600
I was copying what
they do in movies...

595
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,720
for precaution.

596
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,680
They've left.

597
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,480
All right.

598
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,120
We should also get going.

599
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,360
I'll take a shower
to freshen myself up.

600
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,280
No need for this right?

601
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,280
It's for chopping trees.

602
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,560
Why are you leaving so early?

603
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,800
You're not waiting for the guide?

604
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,400
No, we're not.

605
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
We changed our minds.

606
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,000
Considering his
physical condition now,

607
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,400
it's not bad if we can explore...

608
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,080
the scenic bits.

609
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,280
We're not going to the mountains.

610
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,960
Bring some dried food
with you then. Take it.

611
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
It's not easy surviving in the wild.

612
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,560
You take care.

613
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,160
All right.

614
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,440
Thank you, Madam.

615
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,000
Goodbye.

616
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,760
Thank you.

617
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,840
Let's go.

618
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,840
Is that them?

619
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,360
It's them.

620
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
I should really buy lottery.

621
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,480
They really have good stamina.

622
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,880
My clothes are wet with sweat.

623
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,320
Looks like it's still
too early to dry it by fire.

624
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,160
-We'll have to eat the dry food cold.
-Uncle Tai,

625
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,240
can you estimate...

626
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,080
how much longer
will it take to get there?

627
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,560
My legs have already slimmed down.

628
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
Who told you to...

629
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,240
lead a dissipated life with...

630
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,600
women surrounding you always.

631
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,840
You're so weak.

632
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,320
You're the youngest,

633
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,800
but you're the one holding us back.

634
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,400
Look at Mr. Wang and Mr. Li.

635
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,600
They live in ease and comfort.

636
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,040
But they're not as weak as you.

637
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,040
I did become weaker lately.

638
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,920
But don't worry, Uncle Tai.

639
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,640
After this trip,

640
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,920
I'll cultivate...

641
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,320
my body and soul like you.

642
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,640
It may take two days to get past...

643
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,280
the Snake Head Mountain
even with trails.

644
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,760
If there aren't, it's hard
to say how long it'll take.

645
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,600
If you can't take it,

646
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,320
just go down the mountain.

647
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,400
Stop holding us back.

648
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,280
Uncle Tai, please don't.

649
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm counting on...

650
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
this trip to make a fortune.

651
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,440
The bosses eat meat
while I drink soup.

652
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,680
Maybe this soup...

653
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,320
can let me enjoy a wealthy life...

654
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,880
for the rest of my life.

655
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,840
Don't worry, it's all right.

656
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,880
Don't we have a deal?

657
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,960
You...

658
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,560
get the items for me.

659
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,280
We'll take as many as you find.

660
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,000
This is the business of a lifetime.

661
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,800
If we make it,

662
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,280
we can all retire.

663
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,360
When that happens,

664
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,440
we can splurge like kings...

665
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,040
in Hong Kong and...

666
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,040
many other wonderful
places in the world.

667
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,360
Don't be so sure about that.

668
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,640
We don't know if
the treasure is there.

669
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,600
We only heard it from you.

670
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,560
You're always being way too sensitive.

671
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,200
Since we are partners,

672
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,160
we have to trust each other.

673
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,440
To be honest with you,

674
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,720
if we get to where...

675
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,960
we are going now,

676
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,280
you won't...

677
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,560
even want to excavate...

678
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,800
Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum in future.

679
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,200
It's really...

680
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,560
hard to believe what you're saying.

681
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,440
If you don't mind,

682
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,200
tell us...

683
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,560
where did you get...

684
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
the information from.

685
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
Let us learn something as well.

686
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,880
That's right.

687
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,680
Tell us.

688
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,280
Look at the two of you.

689
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,000
What do you...

690
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,000
want me to say about it?

691
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,760
Mr. Li,

692
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,800
we've known each other for long.

693
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,800
Just tell us.

694
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,280
Right, tell us.

695
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,440
Anyway, we have nothing to do now.

696
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,080
Just tell us like it's a story.

697
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,040
Tell us.

698
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,080
Just tell us.

699
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,080
Since you all want to know,

700
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,760
I'll tell you.

701
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,240
Normally,

702
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,160
I don't tell...

703
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,840
anyone about these things.

704
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,560
But I regard you all as family...

705
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,560
so I'll tell you.

706
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,280
You mustn't tell anyone.

707
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,960
Do you have some special skills?

708
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
That you can just locate...

709
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,480
the tomb in a blink of an eye.

710
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,360
I'm not that powerful.

711
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,480
In fact,

712
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,960
this is not a secret.

713
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
It has something...

714
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,240
to do with one of my ancestor.

715
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,520
There is this incident...

716
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,680
in my family archives.

717
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,320
It's said that during
Northern Wei dynasty,

718
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,280
the empire was in the turmoils of war.

719
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
There were numerous battles...

720
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,800
going on everyday.

721
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,240
The emperor barely...

722
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,720
sat on the throne...

723
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,320
and he was already dead.

724
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,360
Let alone the common people.

725
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
Almost every single
adult was sacrificed.

726
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,040
My ancestor was at the age of 6.

727
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,960
He worked as a shepherd...

728
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,440
to maintain livelihood.

729
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,040
One time...

730
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,120
Qian Zhi,

731
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
no need for formalities.

732
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,560
It was a...

733
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,880
tough journey.

734
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,040
Have a seat.

735
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,040
Qian Zhi,

736
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,880
thank you.

737
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,800
The medicine is mixed with
the flavor of crunchy sugar.

738
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
It's really weird.

739
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,560
It's said that Peng Zu
lived over 800 years.

740
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,320
I wonder if he ever fell sick...

741
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
in those 800 years.

742
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,800
Qian Zhi,

743
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,000
I take such...

744
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,040
bitter medicine everyday,

745
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,120
do you think I'll live till I'm 18.

746
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,680
Emperor Daowu was smart and powerful.

747
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,080
But he merely lived till he was 39.

748
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,680
Emperor Taiwu
had remarkable abilities.

749
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,480
Yet he died at the age of 44.

750
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,040
I have no talent and ability.

751
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,600
I can't catch up with
my 2 predecessors.

752
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,240
Qian Zhi...

753
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,200
I'm willing to risk
my life protecting you.

754
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,280
Qian Zhi.

755
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,040
You can't speak...

756
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,600
and the Mute Army you lead...

757
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,400
has been doing unscrupulous things.

758
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,840
But as long as you can stand aside,

759
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,840
even the Grand Marshal...

760
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,720
can't harm you.

761
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,320
Besides,

762
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,000
he needs...

763
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,080
your Tombs Collection...

764
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,360
and...

765
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,800
your help to find more treasures.

766
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,440
This way,

767
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,640
you can keep your family and...

768
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,920
your subordinates safe.

769
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,880
Everything I did,

770
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
I did it for you.

771
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,400
The Grand Marshal
wants to seize power,

772
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,120
he will need a...

773
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,520
young and innocent emperor.

774
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,000
What if when the new
emperor ascends to throne,

775
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
someone stupid jumps out...

776
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,720
and rebels in my name?

777
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,120
Wouldn't the Grand Marshal...

778
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,040
be very awkward?

779
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,920
I'll kill all who betrays you.

780
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,360
With my weak body.

781
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,960
I won't live long.

782
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,720
If I die earlier,

783
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,280
I won't have to take...

784
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,040
so much of this bitter medicine.

785
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,760
Are these the
locations of the tombs...

786
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,840
that you've found all these years?

787
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,400
Whenever I found a tomb,

788
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,440
I'd figure out the traps within,

789
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,680
and seal it off again.

790
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,160
If His Majesty needs it,

791
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,360
I'll go and excavate it again.

792
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,520
The ones marked by ink...

793
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,800
are those which were excavated.

794
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,520
The rest are not.

795
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,480
There are so many yet to be excavated.

796
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,240
You mean...

797
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,640
we can take...

798
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,240
the burial objects from the tombs...

799
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,080
and exchange them for gold and food.

800
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,520
Then we can recruit an army...

801
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,120
to fight against...

802
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,480
the Grand Marshal?

803
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,200
Qian Zhi,

804
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,840
do you know?

805
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm not...

806
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,640
so afraid of death now.

807
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,280
Power.

808
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,200
What is the use of it?

809
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Think about it.

810
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,520
Emperor Qin and
Hanwu united the world...

811
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,440
and enjoyed utmost power.

812
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,360
Yet,

813
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
they were unable to
achieve immortality.

814
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
And you want me...

815
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,160
to put so much effort into...

816
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,560
fighting for power in my short life.

817
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,520
What is the point?

818
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,040
Get back what you deserve...

819
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,320
afterward.

820
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Whenever I enter a tomb,

821
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,560
I'd read a large number...

822
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,560
of bamboo slips in the tomb.

823
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,800
Among which, I found...

824
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,400
some clues about immortality.

825
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,640
If...

826
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,560
Run!

827
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,720
My ancestor was very lucky.

828
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,960
He stayed quite far away.

829
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
So no one discovered him.

830
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,120
The battle...

831
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,040
lasted until dawn.

832
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,080
My ancestor was too young.

833
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,920
to know which side won...

834
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,640
and which side was defeated...

835
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,640
in the end.

836
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,040
Only until when everyone was gone,

837
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,360
he had the courage to climb out...

838
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,240
from the bush.

839
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,120
He came out and saw...

840
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,280
dead bodies everywhere!

841
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,240
But no choice.

842
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,960
He had to walk past...

843
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,360
the barren land...

844
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,240
covered with dead bodies to get home.

845
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,280
He could only force himself...

846
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,520
to keep walking.

847
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,440
Water! Water!
