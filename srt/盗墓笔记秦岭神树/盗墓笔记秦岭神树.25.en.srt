3
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:23,789
Wu Xie, you're awake.

4
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,509
It's really you!

5
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,069
Why?

6
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,509
Why?

7
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:37,429
Why?

8
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,629
It's impossible!

9
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:40,149
Why?

10
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:41,949
Why didn't it work?

11
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,029
How can this be?

12
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:44,189
It can't be!

13
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:45,829
Lao Yang.

14
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,389
-It was supposed to work.
-Lao Yang!

15
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:48,269
Why doesn't it work?

16
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:49,069
Why!

17
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:51,589
-What happened?
-It should work!

18
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:53,389
-What's up with you?
-How could this be?

19
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:54,389
Lao Yang!

20
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:05,229
Wu Xie!

21
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:06,469
Help me out here.

22
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:07,229
Think!

23
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:08,429
Think of a way!

24
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:09,309
What do you need me to think?

25
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:09,869
My mom!

26
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:10,829
Think of my mom for me!

27
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:11,909
Think of my mom!

28
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:13,429
Think of my mom for me!

29
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:14,709
What does it have to do with your mom?

30
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:15,869
Think of my mom for me,

31
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:17,069
and she will be...

32
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,429
resurrected from that cocoon.

33
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:19,069
Hurry up!

34
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,469
Think of my mom for me!

35
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:21,309
Lao Yang!

36
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,309
There's no way that could happen!

37
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:27,269
No.

38
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:28,389
This can't be.

39
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:33,149
This can't be!

40
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:36,589
Why won't you help me?

41
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,189
You won't help.

42
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,229
What about my mom?

43
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:42,789
What can I do?

44
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:47,549
Wu Xie, help me out.

45
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:49,389
What should I do?

46
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:55,469
Lao Yang.

47
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,349
Don't be sad.

48
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:58,749
I'm here.

49
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:00,509
I've promised...

50
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:01,749
to bring you home,

51
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,429
and help you along the journey.

52
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,869
But first,

53
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,629
you have to tell me
everything you know.

54
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:09,869
Including your mom.

55
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:23,709
If you are willing.

56
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:35,229
Wu Xie.

57
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,429
My mom passed away 3 years ago.

58
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:41,269
I've never stopped
missing her ever since.

59
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,229
I want to see her again!

60
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:46,149
Wu Xie, I miss her so much.

61
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:48,349
I really miss her!

62
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:52,949
Mom.

63
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:55,429
I'm home, mom.

64
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,509
Dinner is almost ready.

65
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:04,909
All right!

66
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:07,229
Mom,

67
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:09,589
what have you prepared?

68
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:11,189
They are all your favorites!

69
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:12,309
Wash your hands,

70
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:13,149
we'll eat soon!

71
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:14,029
-Go on!
-Okay.

72
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:16,549
I'm not washing my hands.

73
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:25,429
Naughty boy! Don't be sneaky!

74
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:26,949
Go wash your hands!

75
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:27,589
Mom,

76
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:28,909
they still taste the same.

77
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:29,789
Like what?

78
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,149
Taste of Mom's.

79
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,109
My cooking...

80
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,469
can never be the same as grandma's.

81
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:34,309
Go wash your hands.

82
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,269
All right.

83
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:37,909
I'll wash them now.

84
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:53,869
Mom,

85
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:18,389
Mom!

86
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:26,909
Mom!

87
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:25,509
Mom.

88
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:49,549
Mom!

89
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:53,709
Mom...

90
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:11,389
Mom!

91
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:14,989
Mom!

92
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,069
Mom!

93
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:38,029
Dinner is almost ready!

94
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,829
Naughty boy! Don't be sneaky!

95
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:40,749
Go wash your hands!

96
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,429
Mom's cooking...

97
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,309
won't be the same as grandma's

98
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:46,509
Go wash your hands!

99
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:54,549
Dinner is almost ready!

100
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,709
Naughty boy! Don't be sneaky!

101
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:04,709
Go wash your hands!

102
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:06,909
Like what?

103
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:09,309
My cooking...

104
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,909
can never be the same as grandma's.

105
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:11,909
Go wash your hands!

106
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,109
Naughty boy! Don't be sneaky!

107
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:29,029
Go wash your hands!

108
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:43,509
I know it now.

109
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:54,869
Mom!

110
00:09:58,989 --> 00:09:59,389
Mom.

111
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:00,189
It's me!

112
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,229
It's me, Lao Yang!

113
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:01,869
Mom!

114
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:03,229
Mom!

115
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,949
Wu Xie?

116
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,069
I haven't seen you in a while.

117
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:09,989
Have you been busy?

118
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:11,189
Have a seat inside.

119
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,549
Come in.

120
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:16,149
Mom, mom!

121
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:18,949
Your hair is so long!

122
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:20,429
Go groom yourself.

123
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:22,229
Mom.

124
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:23,989
It's been a while!

125
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:25,789
I can see you, mom!

126
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:29,829
Look at you.

127
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:30,909
Bet you haven't eaten well.

128
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:32,309
You've lost weight.

129
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:33,829
Look at your face,

130
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:36,309
so dark and skinny.

131
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:37,429
Mom.

132
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:44,429
Mom.

133
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,909
Lao Yang.

134
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:53,389
Mom?

135
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:55,229
Mom?

136
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:58,189
Mom!

137
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:01,469
Wu Xie!

138
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:03,149
My mom is gone.

139
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:04,549
She's gone!

140
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,389
Help me out here!

141
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,989
Lao Yang.

142
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:07,149
Wake up.

143
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:08,971
All you saw were illusions.

144
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,150
They're not real!

145
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:10,989
Impossible!

146
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,189
I saw it with my own eyes.

147
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:13,869
My mom was here just now!

148
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,949
You saw it too.

149
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,149
She was right in front!

150
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,429
Help me out.

151
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,029
Help me out here!

152
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:19,709
Wu Xie!

153
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,109
Snap out of it!

154
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,149
Why didn't you tell me
this right from the start?

155
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:28,229
Do you know how many lives
were sacrificed along the way?

156
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:30,269
It was you that they lost their lives!

157
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,069
How can you be so selfish?

158
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:33,229
I don't care!

159
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,349
I'm willing to sacrifice it all
to resurrect my mom!

160
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,629
Who gave you the right
to sacrifice people's lives?

161
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:04,349
Wu Xie.

162
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:05,909
Please.

163
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,069
I'm begging you.

164
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:08,469
Please!

165
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:09,189
Wu Xie!

166
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:10,909
Lao Yang.

167
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:12,309
Hear me out.

168
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,109
Your mom is dead.

169
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:15,549
She can't be brought back to life.

170
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:16,749
Lao Yang.

171
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:19,109
Do you want to
live in this tree forever?

172
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:21,669
We can only accept and face it!

173
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,589
What we can do now is to leave.

174
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,429
Otherwise, we'll both die here!

175
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:28,429
Go away!

176
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:29,669
I don't care!

177
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:31,669
It took me so long to get here.

178
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,149
I'll stay even if I die!

179
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,909
Lao Yang.

180
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:48,509
Lao Yang!

181
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,269
Lao Yang!

182
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:54,189
Let's go.

183
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:57,709
Hurry up!

184
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:09,629
Why are we doing this?

185
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,549
Didn't they promised
to come back for us?

186
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:16,269
Then...

187
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,469
why do we have to...

188
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:21,389
suffer like this now?

189
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,189
I'm exhausted.

190
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,749
I'm dead beat.

191
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,909
I can't go on, young lady.

192
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:39,429
Give me the bag.

193
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:43,709
All right.

194
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,509
Thank you.

195
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:52,709
Kind lady.

196
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:10,269
Why do we suffer?

197
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,509
Whose tomb is this really?

198
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,189
Isn't this the Serpents?

199
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,109
Why is the body
of a Mute Rider in there?

200
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,349
I'm confused, whose tomb is this?

201
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:22,749
The coffin...

202
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:25,589
has been opened before.

203
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,069
The Mute Riders were too rude then.

204
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,829
They moved
the Serpent leader's body...

205
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:37,789
and put their men's body in instead.

206
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:43,189
But why?

207
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,829
This body is too well preserved.

208
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,949
It even has a little warmth.

209
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:54,749
Could it be that...

210
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,109
the coffin can preserve the body well,

211
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:57,509
hence they all wanted to get in.

212
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:03,589
Look behind you.

213
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:08,709
Have you noticed?

214
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:10,189
Ever since we opened the coffin,

215
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,229
the PM 2.5 here has
exceeded standard level.

216
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:33,669
He's alive!

217
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:52,189
Little Master,

218
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,749
his sword can fend off
your Ancient Black Blade.

219
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:56,029
Watch out!

220
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:56,829
That sword is valuable,

221
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:57,669
don't break it!

222
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:58,749
Keep it!

223
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:11,829
Hurry up!

224
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:18,029
Go!

225
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:31,469
Lao Yang.

226
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,149
Jump!

227
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:03,949
Little Master.

228
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,789
Give me a scope,
I'll make him explode!

229
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,789
Why are you showing him mercy?

230
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,389
We can just kill him
and be done with it.

231
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:28,869
Where's the King and General?

232
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:30,789
He can even talk?

233
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:34,869
Who art thou?

234
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:35,829
Thou?

235
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:38,269
Who art thee of whom I speak?

236
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:45,429
Art thou bandits?

237
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,389
We're tomb raiders.

238
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,069
Where's the body
of the Serpent leader?

239
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,189
It's burned.

240
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,229
Who is the Emperor now?

241
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:01,789
It's been a millennium.

242
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:32,549
Lao Yang!

243
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,149
Are you all right?

244
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:35,269
I'm fine.

245
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:35,989
Let's get going!

246
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:37,589
Hurry up!

247
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:50,789
Wu Xie!

248
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:51,509
Here!

249
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:15,349
Wu Xie!

250
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,309
Here's a hole!

251
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:17,469
Do we go in?

252
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:20,709
Go!

253
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,669
What was that?

254
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:52,469
This hole is small.

255
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:54,229
The snake can't come in.

256
00:20:58,429 --> 00:20:59,669
But it's big in here,

257
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,949
could there be
another snake like that?

258
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:13,429
Take this.

259
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:15,389
Stay here.

260
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:16,589
I'll take a look inside.

261
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,229
No way.

262
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:19,509
What about you?

263
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:26,949
I've got this.

264
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,389
Be careful.

265
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,029
You too!

266
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:48,469
So,

267
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:50,629
this place is really capable
of time traveling.

268
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,389
There was no one in there just now.

269
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:00,789
Why are you shaking?

270
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:01,949
Speaketh thy mind.

271
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:04,109
There's just one.

272
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:05,309
There's two!

273
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:07,109
One.

274
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:09,229
I can feel it.

275
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,669
Art thou from Northern Wei dynasty?

276
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:23,429
Is Tuoba thy Emperor?

277
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:24,469
Art thou...

278
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,909
one of the Mute Riders?

279
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:27,949
No,

280
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,509
he can talk.

281
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:30,989
You know of Mute Riders?

282
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:33,829
What we know of doesn't matter.

283
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:37,069
What thou knoweth of
is way more important.

284
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:38,669
This thing,

285
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:40,029
and you.

286
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,029
What exactly happened?

287
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:43,949
I was severely injured,

288
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,309
and wasn't capable
of serving His Highness.

289
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:50,389
His Highness was kind.

290
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:53,309
He wanted to utilize this lodging...

291
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:55,269
to sustain mine life.

292
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:57,709
The general hath tried to stop this.

293
00:22:58,069 --> 00:22:59,629
He hath said this lodging
was filled with devilish essence.

294
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:01,829
An idea lacking valor.

295
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,309
I was greedily longing to liveth.

296
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,349
Hence I ignored
General's fair counsel.

297
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:33,309
I deserve this ill fate.

298
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:36,989
A thousand years.

299
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:39,669
A thousand years.

300
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:43,989
Yet the ending remains unchanged.

301
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:48,349
Why do you have a doppelganger then?

302
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:05,909
He's dead.

303
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:35,549
A thousand over years.

304
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:38,629
It feels like an eternity.

305
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:42,189
Even after a thousand years,

306
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:43,709
he's still skillful.

307
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:46,829
He was able to fight you
at the brink of death.

308
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:51,189
This is good too.

309
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:54,109
It's better than...

310
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:55,229
you getting out alive...

311
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:57,389
and be put into a research.

312
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:00,629
Peace.

313
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:27,549
His life...

314
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:30,789
should have ended
a thousand years ago.

315
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:35,149
So should mine.

316
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,669
Don't you say that!

317
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:40,189
If Mr. Naive heard this,

318
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:42,269
he'd turn into a fountain of tears!

319
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:09,909
Rest in peace.

320
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:43,069
Wu Xie!

321
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:45,549
Wu Xie, are you all right?

322
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:18,749
My goodness,

323
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:21,989
what kind of road is this?

324
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:23,589
How...

325
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,869
How should I cross this?

326
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:27,589
Give me your hand!

327
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:41,269
Wu Xie!

328
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,349
Wu Xie, where are you?

329
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:07,029
What is happening?

330
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:35,069
Who's there?

331
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,469
Show yourself!

332
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:13,709
Twenty-six?

333
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:27,949
Wu Xie!

334
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:29,309
Is that you?

335
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:31,629
Wu Xie!

336
00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:32,429
Lao Yang!

337
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:33,749
Are you all right?

338
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:34,669
I'm all right.

339
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:35,869
That snake...

340
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:37,709
knocked the exit and blocked it.

341
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:39,789
How's the situation in there?

342
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,149
I'm all right.

343
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:43,309
It might be due to the snake,

344
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,389
the exit here is blocked too.

345
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:46,869
I'll get you out now!

346
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:52,949
I've tried,

347
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:54,149
save your breath.

348
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:56,509
There are a lot of caves here.

349
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,789
Let's see if there's another exit.

350
00:33:59,189 --> 00:33:59,869
Watch yourself.

351
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,189
Lao Yang.

352
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:26,069
When there's a will, there's a way!

353
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:29,469
I'm finally free!

354
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:48,429
Is anybody there?

355
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:51,149
Anybody?

356
00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:55,309
Who's there?

357
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:20,309
No.

358
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:38,549
Who are you?

359
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:39,149
I...

360
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:40,709
Who are you?

361
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,869
You're an impostor!

362
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,629
Fat chance!

363
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:48,349
I got out, so I'm the real one!

364
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:49,709
You're just my imagination!

365
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:51,189
You're an impostor.

366
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:53,069
A clone, duplicate!

367
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:54,149
Impostor!

368
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:56,949
Impostor!

369
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:00,749
Don't go!

370
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:01,549
Don't go.

371
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,829
Don't go!

372
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:04,709
You're just my imagination!

373
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:06,629
You can't do this to me!

374
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:08,029
Impostor, was it?

375
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:27,029
You want me dead?

376
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:29,309
You think you can
replace me once I'm dead.

377
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,269
You'll always be an impostor!

378
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:33,869
You'll never replace me!

379
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:58,149
Lao Yang.

380
00:36:58,429 --> 00:36:59,509
Be careful in there!

381
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:02,869
Are you there?

382
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:03,629
Guys,

383
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:05,269
you heard that?

384
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:06,989
Brother,

385
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:08,989
there's really a strange sound.

386
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:11,629
What sound?

387
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:12,829
Don't scare yourself.

388
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:13,869

00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:15,669
I really heard that.

00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:31,269
Black snake!

391
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:32,789
Run!

392
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,029
Anybody there?

393
00:39:06,149 --> 00:39:06,989
Anybody there?

394
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:08,029
Anybody there?

395
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:09,909
Anybody there?
