00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,922
PERSONNEL RECORDS

3
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,966
Is that everything from 1989?

4
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,051
Yes.

5
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,804
Who are you looking for if I may ask?

6
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,641
I don't know why you came to work here,

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,518
but you'll have to fight me for life.

8
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,479
I'm telling you for your sake.

9
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,647
Don't end up like your mom.

10
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,734
Never mind.

11
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,951
-Hello.
-Hello.

12
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,889
Please come downstairs and eat.

13
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,183
Where's my mom?

14
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,603
She wasn't here yesterday,
and she's not here today.

15
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,064
Please get up.

16
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,649
The chairman is waiting.

17
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,320
Come along.

18
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
Hello.

19
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,300
Hello.

20
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,095
Hello.

21
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,055
Hello.

22
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,523
Don't smile.

23
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,360
Stop smiling.

24
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,368
Don't smile!

25
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,787
I said stop smiling!

26
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,447
Don't smile.

27
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,827
Stop smiling.

28
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,301
This is my spot.

29
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,636
Excuse me?

30
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,390
This is

31
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,226
my spot.

32
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,851
So you know how to cry?

33
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,529
I'll allow it for a moment.

34
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,741
Stay still.

35
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,475
Let's go.

36
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,478
I'll take you home.

37
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,362
It's okay. I can go on my own.

38
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,718
Get in.

39
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,697
Where's your umbrella?

40
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,324
It flew away.

41
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,955
You should've held on to it.

42
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,294
I didn't want to.

43
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,257
It was carried far away by the wind…

44
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,430
and for some reason,
it made me feel at ease.

45
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,311
Maybe I should've let go a lot earlier.

46
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,648
Is this about your umbrella?

47
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,112
Or is it about your love life?

48
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,747
You can drop me off anywhere
near a subway station.

49
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,826
EPISODE 5

50
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,716
Hey.

51
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,513
-Phony Cheon.
-Yes, sir.

52
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,310
What?

53
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,937
Where are we?

54
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,149
Here.

55
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,361
What is this?

56
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,612
It probably won't fit.

57
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,322
Just wear it today and throw it out later.

58
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,531
Wait, sir.

59
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,576
Let's eat.

60
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,870
It's your birthday.

61
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,129
What the…

62
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,297
Your outfit…

63
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,133
Wait.

64
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,102
People will think we're a couple.

65
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,020
No one will think that.

66
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,814
I could do so much better.

67
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,442
All right. Please look over here.

68
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,696
You two look so good together.

69
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,448
Do you want another picture?

70
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,199
No, we're not together.

71
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,409
I'm sorry.

72
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,245
I thought you were
because you looked so good together.

73
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,914
-Then what should I do with…
-You can just leave it here.

74
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,999
Okay.

75
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,834
Have a wonderful time.

76
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,377
Thank you.

77
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,130
I told you.

78
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,965
She got the wrong idea.

79
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,675
Is it that unpleasant

80
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,178
to be mistaken for my girlfriend?

81
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,929
Why did you buy a matching outfit?

82
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,099
I just asked them to give me anything.

83
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,560
You're not worth my time and effort.

84
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,354
That's true.

85
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,192
I've never bought clothes
for someone else.

86
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,112
Although it wasn't worth my trouble

87
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,864
and I knew you wouldn't like it,

88
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,116
it's better than your wet clothes.

89
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,457
Thank you, sir.

90
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,251
I told you not to be fake.

91
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,295
I'm truly thankful.

92
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,923
The shoes are just the right size too.

93
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,007
That's a relief.

94
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,884
I just picked a random size.

95
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,523
Your food is ready.

96
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,108
Please enjoy.

97
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,361
How are we supposed to eat all of this?

98
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,862
Why do we have to finish it?

99
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,197
Just eat whatever you want.

100
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,533
But that's so wasteful.

101
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,202
I didn't know what you liked.

102
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,121
So you ordered all this food?

103
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,372
Then you can tell me.

104
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,083
-What?
-The things you like.

105
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,335
Your favorite food,

106
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,462
your favorite weather,
your favorite color.

107
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,966
Tell me everything you like.

108
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,137
Why do you want to know that?

109
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,638
That way I won't waste anything

110
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,182
and can focus on what you like.

111
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,078
This meal will be on me.

112
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,126
It's your birthday.

113
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,587
Just let me buy you a meal.

114
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,507
I don't usually celebrate my birthday.

115
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,425
Why not?

116
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,638
Because it's a day
that makes me feel insignificant.

117
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,308
I get my hopes up,
and I'm constantly let down.

118
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,479
Not having any expectations
gives me peace of mind.

119
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,606
But that's a fake feeling.

120
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,151
You're fooling yourself.

121
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,527
It's a false comfort.

122
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,155
You're so fake.

123
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,878
I hope you enjoy the food.

124
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,755
It's on me.

125
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,682
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

126
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,395
Your total is 1,684,000 won.

127
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,312
Why?

128
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:21,897
Pardon?

129
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,899
It's nothing.

130
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,324
I'll pay with this.

131
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,286
-Here you go.
-No, this is on me.

132
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,497
It's your birthday privilege.

133
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,999
Enjoy it to the fullest.

134
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,917
Excuse me, sir.

135
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,503
I need your signature.

136
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,011
Thank you.

137
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,806
Thank you.

138
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,285
Thank you. Get home safe.

139
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,202
Hang on.

140
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,842
You might think it's an insignificant day,
but end it on a sweet note.

141
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,139
What? Do you not like cake?

142
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,475
No.

143
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,978
I love cake.

144
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,314
Thank you. I appreciate it.

145
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,568
I asked our hotel's head chef to make it,
so it'll probably taste good.

146
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,487
The head chef? When?

147
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,156
I asked him to have it made and delivered

148
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,366
as we walked into the restaurant.

149
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,994
He was probably getting ready to go home.

150
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,581
That is why I very politely made
a special request.

151
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,583
That's what you call being a nuisance.

152
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,753
It was a special request
from the head manager.

153
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,214
It may seem like a simple favor to you,

154
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,050
but for us,
it's an order that must be obeyed.

155
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,053
He probably couldn't get off work
because of me.

156
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,056
I didn't think that far ahead.

157
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,183
I'll be more mindful next time.

158
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,981
Thank you so much for today.

159
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,484
Thank you for the cake too.

160
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,237
-Head inside.
-Okay.

161
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,076
Of course.

162
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,539
I knew it.

163
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,582
Something was fishy.

164
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,292
Is this why you broke up with me?

165
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,711
This was your plan all along.

166
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,131
Why are you here?

167
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,298
Why is he here?

168
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,302
Who are you?

169
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,345
Who are you?

170
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,055
Me? I'm Sa-rang's boyfriend.

171
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,182
How are you my boyfriend?

172
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,308
You're my ex.

173
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,310
Your ex? Who, me?

174
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,313
We broke up so that makes you my ex.

175
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,690
Who is this jerk?

176
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,150
It's none of your business.

177
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,569
-Why is it none of my business?
-You're her ex.

178
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,572
Then it's none of your business now.

179
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,698
You stay out of this.

180
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,410
This is enough.

181
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,870
I know you're regretting it.

182
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,997
Just swallow your pride
and come back to me.

183
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,665
Police. How can I help you?

184
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,583
Hello?

185
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,252
A stalker keeps following me to my house.

186
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,462
-The address is--
-Hey, are you serious?

187
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,089
You won't listen if I ask nicely.

188
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,175
I have no choice but to report you.

189
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,467
You better leave, or else.

190
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,219
Why do you keep telling me to leave?

191
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,512
Do you feel guilty?

192
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
You were two-timing, right?

193
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,931
-Hey!
-What?

194
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,603
It was the right decision
to break up with you.

195
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,772
I should've done it a lot sooner.

196
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,442
If you

197
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,029
ever show your face again,
I'll kill you. Got that?

198
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,243
If you walk away, it's over.

199
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,412
There's no going back.

200
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,581
It's really over for us!

201
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,125
That little…

202
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,921
-What's your deal?
-She told you to leave.

203
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,131
-Let go.
-Didn't you hear her?

204
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,259
She was crying alone
on her birthday, no less.

205
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,637
I just barely got her to smile.

206
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,430
Don't ruin it. Just leave.

207
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,681
Who are you to…

208
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,768
Let go.

209
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,019
I said let go!

210
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,273
Let go.

211
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,234
Let go, please.

212
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,486
She doesn't want to see you anymore.

213
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,365
Stalking someone and harassing them
is considered violence.

214
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,659
If you ever want to meet her,

215
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,410
ask her politely in advance.

216
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,788
Got that?

217
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,005
Gosh, darn it.

218
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,094
You'll pay for this.

219
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,172
Happy birthday.

220
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,680
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

221
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,312
Does she not know it's me?

222
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,356
THANK YOU

223
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,448
You know who this is, right?

224
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,957
-Hello?
-It's me.

225
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,584
I know.

226
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,086
Then why didn't you reply?

227
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,838
You didn't give me the chance to.

228
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,966
By any chance,

229
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,552
if something like that happens again,

230
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,596
just call me.

231
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,389
Don't bother the overworked police.

232
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,475
It won't happen again.

233
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,351
Don't worry and get home safe.

234
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,397
As your boss,
I'm only trying to keep my employee safe,

235
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,982
so feel free to call me.

236
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,985
Okay. I understand.

237
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,537
Hello?

238
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,124
Happy birthday.

239
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,838
I didn't get the chance
to tell you that earlier.

240
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,426
Thank you.

241
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,055
All right then. Get some rest.

242
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,640
All right. You--

243
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,781
Let's go.

244
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,992
Congratulations

245
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,870
Congratulations on being in last place

246
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,042
Our team is finally
the only team that ranked last!

247
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,588
Why the long faces?

248
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,382
Are you trying to screw me over?

249
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,303
I was just humiliated
in front of all the managers.

250
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,473
Since we achieved our goal,
we should celebrate.

251
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,852
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

252
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,314
"Sorry"?

253
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,149
Is this how you act when you're sorry?

254
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,151
Listen.

255
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,236
Are you all in cahoots to get me sacked?

256
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,447
Who's in charge of in-flight sales today?

257
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,241
Me.

258
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:58,205
In-flight sales begin
the moment passengers board.

259
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,706
You have to grovel,

260
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,041
put on a pretty smile,

261
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,500
lift their luggage,

262
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,710
serve them their food,

263
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,587
and do all that you can

264
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,548
so that the passengers
can't help but think,

265
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,967
"Wow, I really should
buy something from her."

266
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,844
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mark my words.

267
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,640
If we don't come in first this month,
we're all going down together.

268
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,309
Is that clear?

269
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,977
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

270
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,608
Here you go, ma'am.

271
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,946
Speak casually when we're alone.
We started at the same time after all.

272
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,281
Okay.

273
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,783
You should get that promotion this year.

274
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,787
I want to,

275
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,956
but I might have to give up on it.

276
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,959
You don't want to be looked down on
your whole life, do you?

277
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,920
All of our colleagues are pursers now.

278
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,506
Only you wear a white scarf.

279
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,928
Because of that,
they all secretly think little of you.

280
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,514
They even made a group chat without you.
How childish.

281
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,017
There's a group chat without me?

282
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,811
That's what I'm saying.

283
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,855
All the more reason for you
to get that promotion.

284
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,609
What good are your top scores
in some language certifications?

285
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,195
You don't have anyone
to pull strings for you.

286
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,572
I'll help you.

287
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,617
Really?

288
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,078
Increase the in-flight sales in return.

289
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,871
If we rank first,

290
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,207
I'll make sure
to pull some strings for you.

291
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,585
Okay, I will.

292
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,838
I'll do my best.

293
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,353
I'm home.

294
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,771
Hey.

295
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,317
There you guys go again.

296
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,422
-What?
-Why would you do that?

297
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,257
Hey, what's--

298
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,015
So,

299
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,600
there's nothing going on,

300
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,561
but he bought you something
from Thom Brownie for getting wet?

301
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,646
I know, right?

302
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,857
And you're not going to tell us who he is?

303
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,195
Okay. Fine.

304
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,990
Whoever he is, he's definitely trying
to win you over with money.

305
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,283
It's not like that.

306
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,702
I just asked them to give me anything.

307
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,579
You're not worth my time and effort.

308
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,623
Do you know how much this costs?

309
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,416
He bought all this
when he doesn't even like you?

310
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,879
Hey, men don't spend money
on women they're not interested in.

311
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,340
If he's this into you, just date him.

312
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,759
I'm all for it too.

313
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,388
He even bought you shoes
because yours were wet.

314
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,431
How did he know your shoe size?

315
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,432
Did you tell him?

316
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,060
No.

317
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,144
That's a relief.

318
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,063
I just picked a random size.

319
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,691
You're going to show your appreciation
for this precious gift, right?

320
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,568
I'm not sure.

321
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,447
Think about it, ma'am.

322
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,032
He gave you a gift and his heart.

323
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,660
You'd be a horrible woman
if you didn't get him anything.

324
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,953
Where's your conscience?

325
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,163
That's true.

326
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,416
But I don't know what he likes

327
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,251
and he's very particular.

328
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,378
Don't worry, ma'am.

329
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,256
At Alanga, we have
a brand-new card wallet that's perfect

330
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,966
for even the pickiest of customers.

331
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,468
Stop trying to sell me stuff.
You don't even know who he is.

332
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,095
I'll give you a big discount.

333
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,639
Forget it. I'm not buying anything.

334
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,476
Ma'am, what do you think of this cologne?

335
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,104
It's not too expensive
and it's the most popular item

336
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,522
among young men these days.

337
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,692
I think it'll be perfect
for his sophisticated style.

338
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,318
Would you like one?

339
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,195
Why are you butting in all of a sudden?

340
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,113
You brat.

341
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,282
I'm desperate.

342
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,867
Please understand.

343
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,784
What?

344
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,703
Did you not meet your sales quota again?

345
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,288
We came in last again.

346
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,914
Please help me out, Ms. Gang.

347
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,000
Buy the cologne.

348
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,501
Buy two while you're at it.

349
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,712
I said I'm not going to!

350
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,007
Please buy something!
You can't deplane without buying anything.

351
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,509
What's wrong with you?

352
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,511
Are you Gang Da-eul?

353
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,055
What happened to our kind Pyeong-hwa?

354
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,516
Snap out of it. Come to your senses!

355
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,686
The flight attendants at King Air
reduce our own luggage

356
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,814
to have a large stock of duty-free items.

357
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,899
We have everything.

358
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,318
Please buy something from me.

359
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,116
-I won't.
-Hey, come on!

360
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,243
Ma'am?

361
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,870
You can't do this to me.

362
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,748
If you didn't like that product,
there are many others, ma'am.

363
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,459
Please buy something from me.

364
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,378
No thanks.

365
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,214
Hey!

366
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,300
Ms. Lovely Sa-rang, please come out and…

367
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,916
Next week will be Super Farmer Week,
hosted by the purchasing team.

368
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,877
We ask for King the Land's support
this year as well.

369
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,504
Super Farmer Week…

370
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,297
What is that?

371
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,676
It's a week where we visit
vendors all across the country

372
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,386
who provide our hotel with premium produce

373
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,055
and ask for their continued partnership.

374
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,393
So we're soliciting.

375
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,271
Nothing is free in this world.

376
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,106
Great value demands great effort.

377
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,733
Why does it have to be King the Land
and not the team in charge?

378
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,277
That's why we hired them.

379
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,029
They're too competent
to be running such errands.

380
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,155
Find other people to do it.

381
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,240
This is my hotel.

382
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,493
That's for me to decide.

383
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,498
That's true for every part of the hotel,

384
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,586
except for the area that I'm in charge of.

385
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,339
Meeting adjourned.

386
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,382
I'm off.

387
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,703
I know you feel comfortable around me,
but you should at least knock.

388
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,831
-Where are you going?
-To knock.

389
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,584
Don't come in.

390
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,798
I told you not to come in.

391
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,140
-What?
-Are you finally going head-to-head?

392
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,183
What do you mean?

393
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,060
Ms. Gu worked hard on this event,

394
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,478
but you messed everything up.

395
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,438
How is that an event? It's a scheme.

396
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,149
That's not acceptable in this day and age.

397
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,818
I know you're just trying to help,
but you don't have that power yet.

398
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,905
So why don't you just give in this time?

399
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,573
In this case, losing is winning.

400
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,534
I'm not trying to win.

401
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,995
I just don't want people
to run such errands.

402
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,165
So long as you're here,

403
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,833
there will be no peace.

404
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,547
While I was in the UK,

405
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,091
I dreamed of the day

406
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,051
that I would return to Korea

407
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,720
and make you the chairman
of King Group at all costs!

408
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,640
That is why

409
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,936
I've been giving you
weekly trend reports of the group.

410
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,105
Why haven't you looked at them?

411
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,586
-What is this?
-Hey.

412
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,587
Hey!

413
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,172
-What is this?
-Give it back.

414
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,883
-Fine. Here you go.
-Give it back.

415
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,176
What is that?

416
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,344
You could've torn it.

417
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,846
Is it something you cherish?

418
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,972
It's nothing.

419
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,141
How so? You were wearing matching outfits.

420
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,226
Don't be absurd. It's nothing like that.

421
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,352
Yes, it is.

422
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,980
Well, it was her birthday.

423
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:44,939
Her birthday?

424
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,316
Why didn't we ever wear
matching outfits on my birthday?

425
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,735
It was an employee benefit.

426
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,780
Then can you get me a matching outfit
as an employee benefit?

427
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,198
I want one too!

428
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,538
I'm sorry.

429
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,915
Get over here!

430
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,803
He almost ripped it.

431
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,819
Are you busy after work today?

432
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,447
No, not at all.

433
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,367
Wait.

434
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,123
ARE YOU BUSY AFTER WORK TODAY?

435
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,756
Of course I am.

436
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,178
All right, then.

437
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,096
What?

438
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,263
That's it?

439
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,349
This isn't what I wanted.

440
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,021
What's the matter?

441
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,953
I will probably have
a few minutes to spare.

442
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,841
Shall we meet for a moment after work?

443
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,567
Why aren't you responding?

444
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,113
Oh, gosh.

445
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,908
Did I have to come here myself?

446
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,286
-Why are you here?
-Why didn't you reply?

447
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,413
-Reply to what?
-My text.

448
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,373
-I did.
-And I replied to your reply.

449
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,583
I'm working right now.

450
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,751
Give this to me.

451
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,463
We're not allowed
to check our phones while working.

452
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,679
Why did you

453
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,431
want to see me?

454
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,184
I thought you were busy.

455
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,104
What

456
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,647
is it about?

457
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,903
What is it?

458
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,322
Well…

459
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,075
I was just wondering…

460
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,663
if we could meet up after work.

461
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,651
I'm extremely busy.

462
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,195
But I shall give up

463
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,489
my precious time for you.

464
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,366
It's fine. You don't have to.

465
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,533
I'll give you

466
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,744
my precious time.

467
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,957
See you later.

468
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,185
-He's so cool.
-What makes you think that?

469
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,063
We don't have to participate
in Super Farmer Week this year.

470
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,023
-Really?
-We were always made to go

471
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,858
when it's the purchasing team's job.

472
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,569
Mr. Gu didn't approve,
saying it wasn't in our job scope.

473
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,614
It feels like heaven
now that our manager changed.

474
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,491
Even his name means "salvation."

475
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,201
He came here to save us.

476
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,954
He's our hero.

477
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,834
I hope he becomes the chairman too.

478
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,919
Is not participating in that event
such great news?

479
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,259
You've never been, have you?

480
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,678
-No.
-Then you shouldn't comment.

481
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,889
By the way,
what did you talk about with Mr. Gu?

482
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,850
Did you get on his bad side?

483
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,774
He gave me words of encouragement.

484
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,900
"You got this."

485
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,487
-"You got this"?
-Yes.

486
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:01,922
Don't…

487
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,382
Don't get out.

488
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,385
Why not?

489
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,887
People can see us.

490
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,180
Are we committing a crime?

491
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,806
No, please.

492
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,934
Can you just lower your window?

493
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,937
Jeez.

494
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,608
What is it?

495
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,652
Here.

496
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,491
What is this?

497
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,826
It's nothing much.

498
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,245
It's just to express my thanks
for the other day.

499
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,168
You didn't need to give me anything.

500
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,504
-Then give it back.
-Wait.

501
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,714
I appreciate your kindness.

502
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,092
-So I'll accept it.
-You don't have to.

503
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,719
I'll accept it.

504
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,513
Sa-rang.

505
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,390
-Yes.
-Are you not going home?

506
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,475
Goodbye. Take care.

507
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,441
Get home safe.

508
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,568
You're leaving already?

509
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,487
Yes. I thought you were busy.

510
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,447
You should go.
I won't waste your precious time.

511
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,494
Gosh.

512
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,497
Let's eat.

513
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,457
Sorry?

514
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,503
I'm hungry.

515
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,303
Okay.

516
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,721
I'll buy this time.

517
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,516
Hurry.

518
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,814
Customer number 159.

519
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,232
-Yes.
-It's not us.

520
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,905
What number are we?

521
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,906
Just wait.

522
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,036
All this just for one meal?

523
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,706
This place is popular,
so they don't take reservations.

524
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,791
I've never waited for anything in my life.

525
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,334
Clearly.

526
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,301
How good must this restaurant be
for people to line up

527
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,635
and waste their time?

528
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,722
For someone like me, time is--

529
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,016
Let's go. We can come next time.

530
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,143
Why?

531
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,437
I don't want to waste your precious time,

532
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,606
so I'll make a reservation next time.

533
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,816
You didn't listen to
what I had to say next.

534
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,235
Suddenly…

535
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,654
Suddenly,

536
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,450
I became curious to know
what waiting feels like.

537
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,411
I will try experiencing what it's like.

538
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,247
You don't have to.

539
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,373
I will,

540
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,250
even if I don't have to.

541
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,712
Sit down.

542
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,889
I've always had to wait for everything.

543
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,100
Whether it was for the bus or the taxi,
I always waited.

544
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,853
"When will it be my turn?"

545
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,814
"What if the line cuts off
in front of me and I lose my chance?"

546
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,275
But someone told me

547
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,153
that the countless people waiting in line

548
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,739
work for those
who never have to wait in line.

549
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,576
Looking at us, I think they were right.

550
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:22,581
Why would you segregate people
over something as trivial as lining up?

551
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,582
You're so heartless.

552
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,253
Customer number 161.

553
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,712
It's not us.

554
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,381
Oh, it is us.

555
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,723
Is something on fire?

556
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,394
Have you never seen that before?

557
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,563
Don't tell me

558
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,149
they're going to be that rowdy
when they cook our food too.

559
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,359
They will. Why?

560
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,695
Food should be eaten quietly.

561
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,573
This place is so chaotic
and uncomfortable.

562
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,326
I only come here on special occasions.

563
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,828
If you're going to whine, we can leave.

564
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,745
Wait.

565
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,541
It's very uncomfortable,

566
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,418
but I'll suck it up.

567
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,629
Are you ready to order?

568
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,591
Yes, can you give us two special sets?

569
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,093
-What will you have to drink?
-Louise-Conti.

570
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,511
Sorry? What was that?

571
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,513
Louise-Conti.

572
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,181
Two draft beers, please.

573
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,683
-All right.
-Thank you.

574
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,644
I'm buying tonight, so it's up to me.

575
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,071
Does the beer taste better
if the mug is cold?

576
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,742
People focus too much on the packaging
while neglecting the essence.

577
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,118
You don't know anything.

578
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,078
Give it to me. I'll drink it.

579
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,789
I appreciate the gesture,
so I'll drink it all.

580
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,875
Are you doing me a favor?

581
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,502
"I'll make time, I'll wait,
I'll suck it up for you."

582
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,547
I'll also clink my mug for you.

583
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,885
It is such an honor
to be able to clink mugs with you, sir.

584
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,603
What in the world?

585
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,146
What do you think?

586
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,190
-Isn't it amazing?
-It's good.

587
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,525
What? Why is it good?

588
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,291
Why is this so good?

589
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,670
Can I get a refill?

590
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,805
When will our food come out?

591
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,574
You scaredy-cat.

592
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,992
I wasn't scared.

593
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,452
I…

594
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,663
I was just acting startled

595
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,915
in return for his performance.

596
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,542
Yes, sure you were.

597
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,004
The finger thing was slightly…

598
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,425
Can we eat now?

599
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,717
Yes, try it.

600
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,267
Isn't it tasty?

601
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,664
That…

602
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,336
He made a heart.

603
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,172
How in the world…

604
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,382
One, two, three.

605
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,302
Let me take some more pictures. One, two…

606
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,636
Look, it's a heart.

607
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,681
Who gets to eat it?

608
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,727
What should we eat next time?

609
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,438
With me?

610
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,439
Then…

611
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,399
is this it?

612
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,526
Yes, this is it.

613
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:20,861
Why?

614
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,324
Because I feel uncomfortable
eating alone with you.

615
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,161
But I don't.

616
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,538
When should we meet again?

617
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,499
I said I'm not going to.

618
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,417
-Why not?
-Because it's uncomfortable.

619
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,711
-Not for me.
-Is that all that matters?

620
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,339
Fine.

621
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,508
Be comfortable around me now.

622
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,052
I'll allow it.

623
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,849
What?

624
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,018
You know how to smile?

625
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,315
If you knew how to smile,
you should've smiled in Jeju.

626
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,070
You're mistaken. I don't like smiling.

627
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,954
How about some meat next time?

628
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,747
I know an excellent restaurant.

629
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,667
No, thank you.
You can go with your friends.

630
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:18,961
I don't have any friends.

631
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,296
Why not?

632
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,757
Because I don't need any.

633
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,721
Then what do you think about pasta?

634
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,684
-Well--
-Fine. I'll decide.

635
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,352
Excuse me.

636
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,896
-You said no to meat, so pasta.
-Can you not hear me?

637
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,773
-Types of pasta…
-Hello?

638
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,108
-There's clam pasta,
-Hello?

639
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,818
-garlic pasta,
-Can't you hear me?

640
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,821
-and creamy flying fish roe pasta.
-Hello? I said I'm not going.

641
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,447
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm going.

642
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,658
I'm going. Won't you join me?

643
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,212
Were you trying to surprise me?
You came unannounced.

644
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,016
Did you have dinner?

645
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,892
Should I order something?

646
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,234
I have something to tell you.

647
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,405
Let's get divorced.

648
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,534
I'm in love with someone else.

649
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,120
How long will this one last?

650
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,456
Just have some fun.

651
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,374
I'm really in love with her.

652
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,296
Okay.

653
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,423
Love her with all your heart.

654
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,717
I'm not stopping you.

655
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,636
But we can't get divorced now.

656
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,095
I don't need any money.

657
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,513
I just want a divorce.

658
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,557
I'm at war with Won right now.

659
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,560
Father hasn't chosen a successor yet.

660
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,812
Don't get in my way and wait.

661
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,398
I'll do what you want
after I inherit King Group.

662
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,026
-Hwa-ran.
-You don't get to abandon me.

663
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,696
You can't leave until I let you.

664
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,802
Surprise!

665
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:32,761
What is this?

666
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,305
Isn't today your wedding anniversary?

667
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,600
This is my special gift
for the two of you.

668
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,143
From the bottom of my heart,

669
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,937
I wish you a happy anniversary!

670
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,358
Thank you. You can place them inside.

671
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,452
Dr. Yoon is back in Korea?

672
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,872
He flew in urgently because of work,
so he couldn't contact us.

673
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,458
I heard he was seeing someone.

674
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,585
It's just a fling.

675
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,505
Make sure word doesn't get out.

676
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,048
I will. Don't worry.

677
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,384
I'm not worried for your sake.

678
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,136
If people start to gossip,

679
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,596
we'll waste money
trying to block the articles.

680
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,902
Give your approval for Super Farmer Week
by tomorrow morning.

681
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,821
Didn't I tell you we're not doing that?

682
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,990
Do you think you're doing them a favor?

683
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,784
The employees are there to get paid.

684
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,745
We can make them do anything.

685
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,998
Even if we pay them,
I won't make them do stuff like that.

686
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,001
How heroic of you.

687
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,920
You don't know
what they truly desire, do you?

688
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,464
It's money.

689
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,631
Nothing else.

690
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,967
Quit acting up and sign the papers.

691
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,360
Welcome.

692
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,361
Welcome.

693
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,113
Welcome.

694
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,619
I'm sorry, but your dog could be
an inconvenience to other customers.

695
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,537
Do you think you can hold your dog?

696
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,623
I'll leave right after buying one thing.

697
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,208
We ask for your understanding.

698
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,668
If I have to carry Charles while I shop,

699
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,545
it'll be an inconvenience for me.

700
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,506
Am I the only one that has to suffer?

701
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,885
It's okay, buddy.

702
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,595
We'll leave after buying one thing.

703
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,764
You know who she is, don't you?

704
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:41,932
The national mom,

705
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,600
actress Mo Seong-ae.

706
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,479
I'm sorry, but your dog
might scare the other customers.

707
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,147
Please understand.

708
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,690
Are you trying to start something?

709
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,108
Fine.

710
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,736
I normally wouldn't care
if I couldn't shop at a store,

711
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,822
but I will make sure to shop today!

712
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,328
Oh, my.

713
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,748
Ms. Gang, it's pooping!

714
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,089
That feels nice, doesn't it?

715
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,758
Charles, did you poop?

716
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,968
Good job.

717
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,136
-Let's go.
-Excuse me, ma'am.

718
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,930
You have to clean it up.

719
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,349
-What?
-Charles' poop.

720
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,227
That's not for me to do.

721
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,855
You guys are here
to do that kind of stuff.

722
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,984
Also, Charles' poop is clean,
so it won't smell.

723
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,153
Since it doesn't smell,
can you clean it yourself?

724
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,030
You're so ridiculous.

725
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,032
Earlier, you didn't even let me
enter the store.

726
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,118
Now you want me to clean up some poop?

727
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,078
Get me the manager!

728
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:46,955
I'm the manager.

729
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,456
How convenient.

730
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,458
Manage the store and clean it up yourself.

731
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,585
Ms. Gang, I'll do it.

732
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,628
Don't. That's not our job.

733
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,591
Ma'am, I'm sorry
but can you come inside and clean it up?

734
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,800
Hey,

735
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,304
I'm Mo Seong-ae, the national mom!

736
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,597
Don't you know who I am?

737
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,557
Hey, where are you going?

738
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,767
What are you doing?

739
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,771
Hey, why would you clean that up?

740
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,316
Didn't I tell you
to know when to get involved?

741
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,318
People are watching. Compose yourself.

742
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,403
If someone posts this online,

743
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,905
you'll come under fire again.

744
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:24,242
I'm telling you, it's the lowlifes
that go on more power trips these days.

745
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,078
I'll let this go
since I'm a kind, simple person.

746
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,081
Consider yourself lucky
for meeting someone like me.

747
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,875
I'm never coming here again!

748
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,001
How ridiculous.

749
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,503
Goodbye.

750
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,507
Should I get a bag of salt
and throw it at her?

751
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:41,801
Forget it.

752
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,971
We just got unlucky.
Let's get over it with some spicy food.

753
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,973
-Goodness.
-What should we eat?

754
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,394
What's good here?

755
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,647
That dish is the most popular these days.

756
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,024
RECOMMENDED BY NATIONAL MOM, MO SEONG-AE

757
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,279
I'm sorry. We'll come back next time.

758
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,573
-Let's go.
-We ate before coming here.

759
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:04,741
Sorry.

760
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,957
Do we really have to do this?

761
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,375
It's our job.

762
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,085
Just do as you're told.

763
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,003
That's what the junior members do.

764
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,546
I'm going to go rest,

765
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,342
so you better call
every single number on this list.

766
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,511
Yes, sir.

767
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,244
Hello, this is Cheon Sa-rang
from King Hotel.

768
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:50,996
How have you been?

769
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,874
I'm just checking in
because I haven't seen you in a while.

770
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,501
No, not at all.

771
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,505
I should thank you
for always saying such lovely things.

772
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,174
All right then.
Please stop by when you get a chance.

773
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,176
Thank you.

774
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,850
Hello, this is Cheon Sa-rang
from King Hotel.

775
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,018
It's been a while.

776
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,102
Hello.

777
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,812
Good afternoon.

778
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,313
This is Cheon Sa-rang from King Hotel.

779
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,192
I'm just checking in
to ask you to stop by sometime.

780
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,030
All right. I'll see you next time.

781
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,197
Thank you.

782
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,539
Hello, sir.

783
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,832
What are you doing?

784
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,918
-Sorry?
-Who were you calling?

785
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,256
I was calling VIP guests
to check in on them.

786
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,425
You went out of your way
to call them yourself?

787
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,136
Is this because of the incentive?

788
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,055
It's just some extra money.

789
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,058
I was just following orders

790
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,477
to manage the VIP guests
in order to increase sales.

791
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,645
What orders? Who ordered you to do that?

792
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,439
And even so,

793
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,524
shouldn't you keep your dignity intact?

794
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,652
I could ask you the same thing.

795
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,738
As the person in charge,
you could've helped

796
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,656
instead of insulting me for working hard.

797
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,493
Watching you suck up to people like this

798
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,952
is even more insulting.

799
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,790
I'm not sucking up to them.

800
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,374
I'm just doing my job.

801
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,292
Your job?

802
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,712
You're in the operations team.

803
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,924
How commendable of you
to help out with sales too.

804
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,356
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

805
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,276
Mr. Gu?

806
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,489
Do all employees do their job like that?

807
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,074
What do you mean?

808
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,826
Calling guests one by one

809
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,494
and laughing on the phone, saying,

810
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,579
"Please stop by, sir."

811
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,207
How outrageous.

812
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,667
They work that hard?

813
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,837
I guess the big bonus
was a good incentive.

814
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,547
How do you call that working?

815
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,175
Was it Super Farmer Week?

816
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,219
Send the employees.

817
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,388
I thought you weren't going to.

818
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,807
It seems I was a villain, not a hero.

819
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,269
I should help seeing how
they all just want to make money.

820
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,146
You can proceed.

821
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,981
Good thinking, sir.

822
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,858
Losing is winning.

823
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,694
If you continue to listen to me,

824
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,529
everything will be as easy as pie.

825
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,613
Like this.

826
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,368
I shall proceed.

827
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,709
That annoying mouth of his…

828
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:43,793
Attention, everyone.

829
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,755
It has been decided

830
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,716
that we'll be attending Super Farmer Week.

831
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,429
-Pardon?
-I thought we weren't going to this year.

832
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,930
He must've approved in the end.

833
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,516
Since it's been decided,
let's make it quick.

834
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,102
Discuss the locations
among yourselves and let me know.

835
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,021
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

836
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:03,980
Hang in there!

837
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,773
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

838
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,451
He acted like he cared in front of us.

839
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,745
Was it all an act?

840
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,706
I knew it. He looks like the type
to stab people in the back.

841
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,834
A person's face
says everything about their character.

842
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,961
There's nothing we can do about it.

843
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,671
Let's get ready.

844
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,437
I'll pick first.

845
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,605
Any objections?

846
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,446
I didn't get to pick.

847
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,574
You have no choice.

848
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:57,617
You're ginseng.

849
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,577
Ginseng?

850
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:03,498
It's the most important location,
so make sure to dress nicely.

851
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,834
You have to give him
the present in person.

852
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,586
Take a change of clothes with you.

853
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,880
All right.

854
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,554
The Super Farmer Week schedule is set.

855
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,390
Royal walnuts and dried black persimmon
will leave on Wednesday.

856
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:24,269
Tongyeong oysters, Wando abalones,
and wild ginseng left today.

857
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,436
Already?

858
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,313
They're late because you took so long.

859
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,526
SUPER FARMER WEEK SCHEDULE

860
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,989
MOUNT JIRI, CHEON SA-RANG

861
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,463
This is absurd.

862
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,049
She has to take the night bus from Seoul

863
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,218
and arrive in Gurye at 4:40 a.m.

864
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:01,139
From there, she needs to ride the bus
for another hour and 20 minutes

865
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,516
to get to the house
of the master ginseng digger at 7 a.m.

866
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,101
She has to greet them,

867
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,562
do house chores,
take promotional pictures,

868
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,814
ride the last bus
and arrive in Seoul at 1 a.m.,

869
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,482
-then come to work in the morning?
-Yes.

870
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,068
She has to go all the way there
and come back in a day

871
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,570
without getting any sleep?

872
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,113
She can sleep on the bus.

873
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,532
What's so great about this event

874
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,326
to work people to the bone?

875
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,578
You're the one who approved it.

876
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,665
They'll be getting paid 200,000 won,

877
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,667
so no one's going to complain.

878
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:50,313
WILD GINSENG

879
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,485
It looks like bellflower root.

880
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,953
Have a safe trip.

881
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,464
Take a day off if you need to.

882
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,680
Are you on your way there?

883
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,522
Why do you keep erasing what you typed?

884
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,817
If you're that worried, just call her.

885
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,694
What?

886
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,112
What are you talking about?

887
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,988
I'm not texting anyone right now.

888
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,199
I know. So you should just call her.

889
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,577
Just focus on driving.

890
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,329
That's what I'm doing.

891
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,540
Where's the honorific?

892
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:51,624
I'll make a left, sir.

893
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,565
Is anyone home?

894
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,028
Can I help you?

895
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,240
Goodness.

896
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,035
Hello, I'm here from King Hotel.

897
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,287
I see.

898
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,497
The old man's not here.

899
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,291
Here. I'll give it to him.

900
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,834
I have to give it to him myself.

901
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,586
There's no point.

902
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,173
You won't be able to
get around to him with this stuff.

903
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:46,095
We've had hotel employees
from the entire nation come visit us.

904
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,180
But what's the point?

905
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:51,642
My old man refuses to meet anyone
to remain loyal to First Royal Hotel.

906
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,479
I'll put in a good word for you.

907
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,981
Rest here for a bit,
then head back to Seoul.

908
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,191
No, it's okay.

909
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,651
Do you happen to know
where your husband is?

910
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,028
He's in the mountains.

911
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,156
Once he goes up there,
I never know when he'll come back.

912
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:09,202
I'd still like to meet him and say hello.

913
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,121
You're pretty stubborn.

914
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,707
Then are you willing to hike?

915
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,125
Which way do I go?

916
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:20,963
If you go straight up that path,
you'll see a small shack.

917
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,132
You'll be able to find him
anywhere near there.

918
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,179
Then how long of a walk is it?

919
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:29,806
It's super close.

920
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,266
But are you going in those shoes?

921
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,560
No, I brought another pair.
Everything's in here.

922
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,730
-You can get changed in there.
-Thank you.

923
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,971
She said it was close.

924
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,515
I've been hiking for two hours.
Where is he?

925
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,894
WEATHER MAP

926
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,317
-Is it going to rain today?
-The forecast says so.

927
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,695
But mountain and seaside weather
is so unpredictable.

928
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,447
It says severe thunderstorms
and strong gusts of wind.

929
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,908
Aren't the mountains too dangerous?

930
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,705
It's funny how you're worried
when you're the one who sent her there.

931
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,290
Who's worried?

932
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,333
If not, never mind.

933
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,794
I'm looking at today's sales trends.

934
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,130
-You don't need to see it, do you?
-No, I don't.

935
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,632
There's a government policy seminar.
You won't attend, right?

936
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:47,800
No, I won't.

937
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,760
You're worried sick
about Ms. Sa-rang, right?

938
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:50,928
Of course I am.

939
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,724
-What?
-You're so into her.

940
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,312
You should be treating her nicely.
Why are you so testy around her?

941
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,355
I don't like her.

942
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,857
You're giving me a headache. Get out.

943
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,780
By the way,

944
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,366
there's only a 30% chance of rain today.

945
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,952
So please stop worrying for no reason.

946
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,175
Gosh. What the…

947
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,135
What?

948
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,054
Darn it.

949
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:35,514
What the heck?

950
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,434
What now?

951
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,608
HEAD MANAGER GU

952
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:47,985
Yes, Mr. Gu.

953
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,279
Don't get me wrong.
I'm just checking in as your manager.

954
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,366
-Where are you?
-In the mountains.

955
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,662
It's not raining, is it?

956
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:58,913
Oh, gosh!

957
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,459
It is raining.

958
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,379
Hike back down.

959
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:10,424
I will after giving him
the gift in person.

960
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,093
Get down right now.

961
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:13,719
Why did you go up there when it's raining?

962
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,304
Are you out of your mind?

963
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,057
You're the one who sent me here.

964
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,186
I'll head back after I finish.

965
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,480
I don't care
about the ginseng or whatever.

966
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:25,773
Just get down from there.

967
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,068
Hang on.

968
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,736
What is it?

969
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,655
Hold on a second.

970
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,281
What is it?

971
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:35,825
What's going on?

972
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:39,537
My goodness! Wait.

973
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,337
HEAD MANAGER GU

974
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,435
No way.

975
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,617
HEAD MANAGER GU

976
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:40,139
HEAD MANAGER GU

977
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,295
Am I alive?

978
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,800
Oh no.

979
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,009
What do I do?

980
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:21,514
Hello?

981
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,516
Is anyone there?

982
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,019
There's a person down here. Please help!

983
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,233
Oh no.

984
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,952
I'll either starve or freeze to death.

985
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,623
Is this it for me?

986
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,139
They say you'll look good in the afterlife
if you ate well in life.

987
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,516
I can't tell if this is ginseng or not.

988
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,080
What was that?

989
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,207
I'm scared.

990
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,918
Am I going to die?

991
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,008
What do I do?

992
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,469
I'm scared, Grandma.

KING THE LAND

994
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:25,698
Thank you.

995
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:26,865
It was me!

996
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,325
I saved her!

997
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,035
Why should you two eat when I saved her?

998
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,204
Follow me.

999
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,123
-You've peeled onions before, right?
-Me?

1000
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,666
Just do as I say.

1001
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,835
My gosh! What are you doing there?

1002
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:39,503
It's me, Gu Won.

1003
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:40,462
Help.

1004
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:44,341
You're too old
to be living off your father.

1005
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,051
Do you have
a housing subscription account?

1006
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:48,554
Are you hurt?

1007
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:49,805
What are you doing?

1008
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:50,848
I said I'd protect you.

1009
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,311
I'll let you take me.

1010
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:57,938
It's a date.

1011
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:04,236
