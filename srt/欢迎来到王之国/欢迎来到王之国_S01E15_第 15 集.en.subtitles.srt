00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,010
Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

3
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,827
Sir,

4
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,329
is there something wrong?

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,770
It's been a while,

6
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:45,980
hasn't it?

7
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,193
How have you been?

8
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,487
I don't think that's
an appropriate question

9
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,826
coming from someone
who knows full well how I was banished.

10
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,745
Don't tell me

11
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,205
you expected me to be happy

12
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,208
after losing my son

13
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,836
and vanishing without a trace?

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,256
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,635
I had no power back then.

16
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,678
No.

17
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,847
Even if it were now,

18
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,350
you would've chosen the company.

19
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,894
That…

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,982
is who you are.

21
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,365
It must be a family tradition.

22
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,993
You got rid of her

23
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,954
while Won was on a business trip.

24
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,165
Like me.

25
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,002
If only you hadn't formed a union,

26
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,629
that wouldn't have happened.

27
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,882
The president's wife

28
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,010
incited the employees
to rebel against the company.

29
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,387
How was my father supposed to accept you?

30
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,681
It was you who broke our promise.

31
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,352
You cowardly turned your back
on everything we dreamed of together.

32
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,729
It was to protect everyone.

33
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,319
You chose the easiest thing to abandon,

34
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,905
and that was me.

35
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,578
There was only one reason why

36
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,080
I left quietly.

37
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,207
It was for Won.

38
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,837
Your father took that young child hostage

39
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,756
to threaten me.

40
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,382
He said he'd protect Won

41
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,677
if I disappeared.

42
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,265
That is why I lived as if I didn't exist.

43
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,477
Like I was never even born
in the first place.

44
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,397
I've…

45
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,651
always felt sorry about that.

46
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm not here to receive an apology.

47
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,990
I'm here to warn you.

48
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,538
Don't drive Won into a corner anymore.

49
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,250
If you continue to do so,

50
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,710
I'll no longer sit back and watch.

51
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,839
I…

52
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,972
never got to live my own life.

53
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,601
Did you…

54
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,691
get to live your own life?

55
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,371
Please let Won live his life
the way he wants to.

56
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,916
Let him live for himself

57
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,628
rather than for the company or the family.

58
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,591
That's what you should do as his parent.

59
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,891
Leading him in the right direction
is also what I should do.

60
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,855
Although he'll make his own decisions.

61
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,900
It's a relief

62
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,487
to hear that you'll let him decide.

63
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,157
I'll be leaving.

64
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,038
You're not going to show up
in front of Won, are you?

65
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,958
That's up to me.

66
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,918
He's doing fine right now.

67
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,254
Don't confuse him.

68
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,593
Those threats don't work on me now.

69
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:10,787
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

70
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,217
Won.

71
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,522
Won.

72
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,707
I'll do it for you.

73
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,625
This…

74
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,794
is a pocket watch.

75
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,713
Don't lose it no matter what.

76
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,298
Okay.

77
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,833
Won.

78
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,878
It's me, Mom.

79
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,006
Do you…

80
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,426
remember me?

81
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,889
What brings you here?

82
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,480
I came to apologize.

83
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,065
For what?

84
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,279
I was always afraid…

85
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,116
that I wouldn't be able to protect you.

86
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,702
This may sound like an excuse,

87
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,037
but I thought leaving

88
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,165
was the only way to protect you.

89
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,170
I heard about why you left.

90
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,007
Or sent away, to be exact.

91
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,177
The people of King Group

92
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,474
were too powerful for me to fight against.

93
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,437
I thought living
like I didn't exist in this world

94
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,733
would be what's best for you.

95
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,110
But…

96
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,988
I was wrong.

97
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,825
You grew up to be a wonderful person

98
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,328
even without

99
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,581
anyone's protection.

100
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,210
Back then,

101
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,174
you were but the same age as me.

102
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,012
It's an age in which
you're not quite an adult yet.

103
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,683
That's why I thought
you could've been scared.

104
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,395
I understand you a bit now.

105
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,563
So

106
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,232
don't feel guilty and be at ease.

107
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,075
You're even considerate enough

108
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,286
to say things that will ease my guilt.

109
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,956
You're all grown up.

110
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,502
I'm not making things up
to put you at ease.

111
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,464
And I'm not trying hard to understand you.

112
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,092
It's just…

113
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,430
I now know how it feels
to want to protect…

114
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,184
something precious to you.

115
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,608
So from now on,
you should live for yourself.

116
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,528
Don't try to protect anyone

117
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,155
or hide because of me.

118
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,950
Live for yourself.

119
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,790
Don't…

120
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,585
forgive me.

121
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,422
Whatever the reason,

122
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,049
I left you alone

123
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,760
and…

124
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,306
made you suffer.

125
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,684
I never once resented you.

126
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,729
Although I don't have
many memories of you…

127
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,359
I could still feel

128
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,697
how much you loved me.

129
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,577
"She's not someone who would abandon me."

130
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,371
"She just had no other choice,

131
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,790
so she left momentarily."

132
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,044
That's the thought I held onto

133
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,881
to make it through those long years.

134
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,929
Thank you for not letting me down.

135
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,515
That's all I needed.

136
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,731
I'm sorry that all I have to say

137
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,233
is that…

138
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,613
I'm sorry.

139
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,828
Please excuse me.

140
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,414
Be well.

141
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,874
Mom, I love you.

142
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,251
Me too.

143
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,785
EPISODE 15

144
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,961
You've still got it.

145
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,173
Cotton pads and swabs
should always be filled to only 90%.

146
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,342
I still remember your instructions.

147
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,136
You're so smart.

148
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,306
I need to sit for a bit.

149
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,602
I didn't know
I would be working in a sauna.

150
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,355
This place is so tough.

151
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,857
It's a place of exile.

152
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,276
They sent us
because it's so understaffed here.

153
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,653
Ever since I first got here,

154
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,156
they didn't hire anyone
saying it'd close down soon,

155
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,949
but that was already five years ago.

156
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,784
Is this place closing down?

157
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,787
We keep losing guests,
and sales figures aren't that great.

158
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,623
The hotel is holding out
thanks to weddings,

159
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,876
1st-birthday parties,
and 70th-birthday parties,

160
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,210
but that's not enough.

161
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,133
If this place closes down,
us exiles won't have anywhere to go.

162
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,011
Everyone treats each other
like family here.

163
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,306
It would be a shame
if this place were to disappear.

164
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,975
That's why everyone is holding out.

165
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,186
They want to save the hotel.

166
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,067
Let's keep our heads up.

167
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,194
We got this!

168
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,871
By the way,

169
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,624
how is everything going with Mr. Gu?

170
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,753
What do you mean?

171
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,505
Are you two still going strong?

172
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,633
You've been here for a while,
but he's never visited you.

173
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,470
That's why everyone keeps saying
you already broke up with each other.

174
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,682
He's just so busy.

175
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,404
Hello, Mr. Wang.

176
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,077
Why were you waiting for me?

177
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,079
Go ahead and eat.

178
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,373
Enjoy your meal, sir.

179
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,750
I already ate. It's way past lunchtime.

180
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,087
The reason why I asked
all of you to gather is…

181
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,552
Why don't you guys use your vacation days?

182
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,346
I told you I can't make payouts
even if you don't use them.

183
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,725
Make sure to use them all
by the end of June, okay?

184
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,853
It's not like we don't want to.

185
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,355
How are we supposed to rest
when we're so short-staffed?

186
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,732
I told you not to work hard.

187
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,069
If you have that much energy,
just find another job

188
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,822
because this hotel will be sold soon.

189
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,907
Has it been confirmed?

190
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,076
I'll be hearing good news soon.

191
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,705
So stop wasting your time

192
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,708
and just work on filling up your résumés.

193
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,548
Mr. Wang,

194
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,341
I know I may be out of line here,

195
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,179
but why don't we work together
to look for ways to save this hotel?

196
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,770
Why are you all so passionate
about this hotel that's about to go bust?

197
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,356
Everyone's sacrificing themselves

198
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,609
and doing their best
to protect this hotel.

199
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,319
If we all just--

200
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,905
You were kicked out of King Hotel, right?

201
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,284
I was reappointed here.

202
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,786
Reappointed, my foot.

203
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,789
You must be acting up
counting on a certain someone.

204
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,167
Get your act together.

205
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,295
Can you still not understand
after being banished?

206
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,923
Don't you understand it's over?

207
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,259
You should be embarrassed
and keep your head down.

208
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,388
It's not because I'm counting on anyone.

209
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,807
As an employee of King Tourist Hotel--

210
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,434
That's exactly my point.

211
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,895
You're an employee, so act like one.

212
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,065
How dare you talk back
to the head of the hotel?

213
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,902
I run this place.

214
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,529
I make the decisions. Got it?

215
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,877
How pretty.

216
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,882
Sa-rang.

217
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,679
Can you check the outdoor speaker
to see if the music can be heard?

218
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,973
All right.

219
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:40,233
TRUE RELAXATION BEGINS
WITH YOUR STAY AT KING TOURIST HOTEL

220
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,662
Sa-rang, did you check?

221
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,664
I can't hear anything.

222
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,429
I'm here to pick you up.

223
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,771
Did you have a good trip?

224
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,524
Yes.

225
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,070
I'm sorry I'm late.

226
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,908
It was hard on your own, right?

227
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,918
What about work?

228
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,212
Did everything go well?

229
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,007
Yes, it did.

230
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,345
Let's go back now.

231
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,186
I work here now.

232
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,271
It doesn't matter.

233
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,732
You're mine.

234
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:35,825
Hang on.

235
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,079
Yes, this is Cheon Sa-rang.

236
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,249
Right now?

237
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,548
All right.

238
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,014
What now?

239
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,642
Go ahead.

240
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,559
I'll wait.

241
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,124
Do you want to go with me?

242
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,921
Anywhere with you.

243
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,306
Here.

244
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,811
-You know how to do it, right?
-Did you forget?

245
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,397
I never forget anything once I learn it.

246
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,481
Of course.

247
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,152
Then can you set all the tables
starting from there?

248
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,195
I need to go to the kitchen.

249
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,657
My rate is expensive.

250
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,784
Will you be able to handle it?

251
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,126
After work, I'll recharge you
for the amount of time we were apart.

252
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,044
What do you think?

253
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,590
I'll get it done quickly.

254
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,137
Thanks.

255
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,438
Here we go.

256
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,989
Hey, you.

257
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,074
Over there.

258
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,118
Hey, tablecloth guy.

259
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,371
Come over here and grab this.

260
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,915
Yes, I'm talking to you.

261
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,917
Let's move quickly.

262
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,335
We're so busy right now.

263
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,754
Grab that end and align it with this end.

264
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,714
-Make it parallel.
-Me?

265
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,799
Then should I?

266
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:57,967
Quickly.

267
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,594
Stretch it out more.

268
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,054
Yes. Good.

269
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,348
Okay.

270
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,895
I did a good job.

271
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,066
But are the employees
in charge of this kind of stuff too?

272
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,776
Don't we usually hire agencies?

273
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,570
Doing this stuff on our own

274
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,531
gives us a competitive edge.

275
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,951
By the way,

276
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,869
have we met before?

277
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,664
No, it's my first time meeting you.

278
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,544
Then why do you look so familiar?

279
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,396
By any chance,

280
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,566
you're not Sa-rang's boyfriend
from King Hotel, are you?

281
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,698
What makes you think I'm not?

282
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,325
I am Sa-rang's boyfriend.

283
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,872
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a one-day part-timer.

284
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,874
I have committed a grave sin.

285
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:15,545
May I just ask you to do one thing?

286
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,589
Of course. It can be multiple things.

287
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,342
You spoke informally to me

288
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,970
from the get-go, right?

289
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,931
Even if someone works here for a day,

290
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,516
we're all colleagues.

291
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,643
Please respect everyone.

292
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,437
I couldn't agree with you more.

293
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,064
I will make sure
to keep that in mind, sir.

294
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,441
All right, then.

295
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,318
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

296
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,486
It's okay.

297
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,490
Sa-rang!

298
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,142
You're very experienced.

299
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,811
This is nothing.

300
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,230
Sit down. I'll do it.

301
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,440
No, I don't have time to rest.

302
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,109
After this, I have to put up signs
all over the hotel.

303
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,779
You just had to come on the busiest day.

304
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,740
It's a good thing
that I came on the busiest day

305
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,617
since I can be of help.

306
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,578
You're so reliable.

307
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,498
Okay. One, two, three.

308
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,074
Thank you.

309
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,496
It's so warm.

310
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,758
I met my mom.

311
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,471
Really?

312
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,057
When? How did you meet her?

313
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,103
She came to me.

314
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,649
She seemed like a good person.

315
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,319
She was warm-hearted.

316
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,282
That's good to hear.

317
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,952
I knew she would be a good person.

318
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,377
To be honest,

319
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,880
I thought I had forgotten about her.

320
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,133
I thought I didn't miss her

321
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,929
and that I didn't need her anymore.

322
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,058
But after meeting her, I realized…

323
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,436
that I had never once…

324
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,190
forgotten about her.

325
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,173
I'm really sorry

326
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,008
that you had to come here.

327
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,730
It's been a while
since I greeted guests in the lobby

328
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,067
and worked in the sauna,
banquet hall, and linen room.

329
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,778
I've been super busy,

330
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,738
but I like it here.

331
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,409
It reminded me of the start of my career.

332
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,289
I really do like it here.

333
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,168
I don't see anything good
about this place.

334
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,795
Well,

335
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,131
that's what everyone says.

336
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,175
But they're just not looking hard enough.

337
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,179
There's a small forest behind the hotel.

338
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,640
It's been left in its natural state,

339
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,226
so it's beautiful and mysterious.

340
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,730
Just looking at it

341
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,983
makes me feel healed.

342
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,710
Hello.

343
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,128
-Were you exercising?
-Yes.

344
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,129
-I see.
-Goodbye.

345
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,589
Be careful.

346
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,635
I thought I needed to know the area well
in order to guide the guests,

347
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,387
so I looked around on my day off.

348
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,388
Thank you.

349
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,100
And there were
a lot of hidden gem restaurants.

350
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,145
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

351
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,815
I only ordered one thing,

352
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,234
but they gave me
a bunch of other stuff to try.

353
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,986
I thought I was at a buffet.

354
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,991
I FOUND A GREAT RESTAURANT!

355
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,410
LET'S COME HERE TOGETHER SOMETIME

356
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,756
Excuse me, Miss. Have a yogurt drink.

357
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,508
Thank you.

358
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,511
The people here are so generous too.

359
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,847
A lot of them are family members
of the hotel staff,

360
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,558
so they give me drinks and ice cream

361
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,018
whenever they see me.

362
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,854
-Don't flatter me.
-You should marry my grandson.

363
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,899
And especially

364
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,776
this spot.

365
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,203
Doesn't it look like
all the stars in the galaxy are here?

366
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,205
It's beautiful.

367
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,300
You're right.

368
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,762
So beautiful.

369
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,308
Right? They're different
from the stars in Seoul.

370
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,771
If you just pay a little attention,
you can see everything.

371
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,773
It's such a shame.

372
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,238
But still, you should be in King the Land.

373
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,740
Let's go back now.

374
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,872
I'm sorry,

375
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,167
but I can't follow
the orders of my ex-boss.

376
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,919
What do you mean by ex-boss? That's harsh.

377
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,630
I came here as soon as I arrived in Korea.

378
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,549
It's my affiliation.

379
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,803
This is an official reappointment.

380
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,809
Let's go.

381
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,983
There are three banquets next week.

382
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,737
Let me finish those before I go back.

383
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,530
Why do you want to do that?

384
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,908
Because it's my responsibility.

385
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,993
I want to see to it myself.

386
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,914
Also, all the employees here

387
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,876
are working hard to protect this hotel.

388
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,463
I don't want to turn a blind eye
and run away by myself.

389
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,551
The employees are protecting the hotel?

390
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,806
I think this hotel
is going to be sold soon.

391
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,267
That's why everyone is troubled.

392
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,538
I hear your divorce story is out.

393
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,041
Let's go for a consolation drink.

394
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,460
Go away or I'll beat you up.

395
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,671
Your old feistiness is showing.

396
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,091
You know, your brusqueness is your charm.

397
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,552
Just swallow your worthless pride

398
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,679
and follow me.

399
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,974
Hey.

400
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,198
Why do I have to suffer
when you registered our marriage?

401
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,784
Live the rest of your life
in atonement, got it?

402
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,537
Try hitting on me one more time.

403
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,705
I'll tell your wife

404
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,125
how the father of her children
keeps begging me to get a drink with him.

405
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,758
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay, Mr. No?

406
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,843
Why you…

407
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,678
Has she gone mad?

408
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,308
Why would I hit on
a divorced woman like her?

409
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,809
Right?

410
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,602
Don't you agree?

411
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,772
Captain No Byeong-gu.

412
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,945
I like Pyeong-hwa a lot.

413
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,573
So what?

414
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,783
So I'm telling you

415
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,661
to watch out.

416
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,789
If you ever mess with her again,

417
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,710
I will no longer sit back.

418
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,514
-Does it not hurt?
-Are you okay?

419
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,147
Pyeong-hwa.

420
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,825
Why do you keep avoiding me?

421
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,370
Can you just leave me alone?

422
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,664
I want to disappear
to a place no one else exists.

423
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,583
That's why I can't.

424
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,211
It feels like if I do,

425
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,547
you'll really fly somewhere far away.

426
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,343
Let's go.

427
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,517
Why aren't you asking me anything?

428
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,232
Do I have to?

429
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,444
Everyone's curious.

430
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,405
It's in the past.

431
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,075
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested
in the Pyeong-hwa of the past.

432
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,911
I like who you are right now.

433
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,667
I have no hope.

434
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,920
I deceived everyone.

435
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,338
You didn't deceive us.

436
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,716
You just didn't reveal a painful memory.

437
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,510
Everyone has a side of themselves

438
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,013
that they don't want others to see.

439
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,483
Rain falls on everyone.

440
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,485
It's just that some
get wetter than others.

441
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,240
But eventually, the rain stops.

442
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,085
I'll be your umbrella.

443
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,236
-It looks good.
-Right? It was really good.

444
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,698
When I came by myself,
there was a huge line out there.

445
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,283
Here's the potato pancake.

446
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,243
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

447
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,121
-Thank you.
-I sent you a picture last time.

448
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,414
This place is good,

449
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,791
and there are
many other good restaurants here.

450
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,002
Let's go somewhere else next time.

451
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,218
-Hello.
-What a lovely couple.

452
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,097
She came here by herself last time.

453
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,390
But she's not alone today.

454
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,309
-I'm her boyfriend.
-I see.

455
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,519
I couldn't let her be by herself.

456
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,896
You two are a perfect match.

457
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,106
Don't we look good together?

458
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,691
Yes, you both have clear skin.

459
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,900
You…

460
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,441
This is how much I respect you.
Please enjoy.

461
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,817
I could've gotten my own food.

462
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,612
I wish you all the best
from the bottom of my heart.

463
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,491
I'll be fine thanks to your wishes.
Please sit.

464
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,700
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

465
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,371
Help yourselves. Thank you.

466
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,622
Thank you.

467
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,873
Thank you.

468
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,291
By the way,

469
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,295
may I ask if you're here because of that?

470
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,673
What do you mean?

471
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,466
Goodness, Mr. Gu!

472
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,928
Salute.

473
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,764
I heard you were here,

474
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,016
but I thought you would've already left.

475
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,520
You must like fishing.

476
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,939
Well of course.

477
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,692
Anglers like me
even only watch fishing shows.

478
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,111
You went fishing during working hours.

479
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,114
Because it's part of my job.

480
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,242
I went with the city's head
of urban planning development.

481
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,203
We discussed
whether we could use this land

482
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,373
for the city's cultural center
after demolishing the hotel.

483
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,462
So you went to a fishery
to sell the hotel?

484
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,423
You think that's all?

485
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,426
I also go to golf courses, saunas,

486
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,886
restaurants, and whatever else
you can think of.

487
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,766
Rather than trying to sell the hotel,

488
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,978
do you do anything to improve the hotel?

489
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,733
I don't think you understand
the situation here, sir.

490
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,277
This neighborhood is dead.

491
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,195
The tourist attractions closed ages ago.

492
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,531
There's no hope left for this place.

493
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,201
It's better to just sell the hotel
before its value drops even more.

494
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,203
But in the countryside,

495
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,581
only city hall can handle
land of this size.

496
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,834
That is why I'm working so hard.

497
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,544
I see.

498
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,921
Disposal is probably the easiest option.

499
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,549
But the head of the hotel
shouldn't do that.

500
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,510
You're not only responsible for the hotel

501
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,597
but also the future of your employees.

502
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,308
Jeez.

503
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,518
Okay.

504
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,313
Let's say I'm doing something wrong.

505
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:18,442
Even so, I don't think
you have any right to get involved.

506
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:22,112
This place is a subsidiary
of King Distribution, not King Hotel.

507
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,282
Ms. Gu ordered me to sell the hotel,

508
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,493
and I'm just working toward that goal.

509
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,286
You're right.

510
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,372
They're separate companies,
so I can't tell you what to do.

511
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,374
I mean,

512
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,959
since you're the chairman's son,

513
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,253
I guess you can boss me around…

514
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:45,427
but I'm just saying
I have no reason to follow your orders.

515
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,272
I'll buy this hotel.

516
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,026
-Sorry?
-You said you were selling it.

517
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:06,448
I will buy King Tourist Hotel
at your desired price.

518
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,244
Are…

519
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,205
Are you being serious?

520
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,250
I made this decision
after careful consideration.

521
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:21,129
Although I wasn't here for long,
I took a tour around this whole village.

522
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,673
Behind the hotel,

523
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,509
there is a dense forest
that has been left untouched.

524
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,346
The sun, the wind,
and the smell of the forest.

525
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,848
You can become one with nature.

526
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,018
Mountain fog fills the air at dawn,

527
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,063
and countless stars
light up the sky at night.

528
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,530
I can make this a hotel that people visit

529
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,576
to escape from their busy lives
and find perfect rest.

530
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,955
I mean…

531
00:47:55,706 --> 00:48:00,252
This all may look special to you
because you're from Seoul.

532
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,379
But there's nothing special
about this area.

533
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,506
All you see are mountains and fields.

534
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,634
-This hotel has no competitive edge!
-Exactly.

535
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,846
We need to create it.

536
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,849
I'm thinking of starting
a forest therapy program

537
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,226
that includes yoga,
tea ceremonies, and meditation.

538
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,769
The rooms will be remodeled too.

539
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,230
We'll have rooms with floor heating,

540
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,898
red clay rooms, and cypress rooms.

541
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,109
The annex that's in disuse

542
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,737
will be turned into a lounge
filled with music and books.

543
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,781
I am also thinking of creating a program

544
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,075
in which the village elders
can teach the guests

545
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,411
how to make traditional liquor
and crackers of this town.

546
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,412
If that happens,

547
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,874
our hotel itself
will become the best tourist attraction.

548
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,334
Well…

549
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,921
It could yield
a low or negative return on investment.

550
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,840
Didn't I tell you?

551
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,634
Disposal is the easiest option.

552
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,762
But since I've made the decision
to protect the hotel,

553
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,348
I'm not going to hold back
for fear of suffering a loss.

554
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,271
Congratulations on the sale.

555
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,899
Since you've achieved your goal,

556
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,484
you may leave now.

557
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,824
Eat.

558
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,576
Let's eat.

559
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,632
How tasty.

560
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,054
Thank you.

561
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,598
Everyone's so happy
because there's hope now.

562
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,684
You all deserve to have hope.

563
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,602
So does this hotel.

564
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,606
I…

565
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,817
want to create my own story.

566
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,194
I want to tell people

567
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:53,073
that I protected everything I wanted to
until the end.

568
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,455
I want to be as cool as you.

569
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,208
You're already so cool.

570
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,252
I wanted to be like you.

571
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,838
You rubbed off on me.

572
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,509
I was tinged with the most
magnificent color called Cheon Sa-rang.

573
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,892
Please excuse me for a moment.

574
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,604
Thank you.

575
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,777
Mr. Gu, thank you so much.

576
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,487
All of us will work really hard.

577
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,531
I look forward to working with you.

578
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,532
Me too.

579
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,494
Speaking of which,

580
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,122
you're not going to
take Sa-rang back to Seoul, are you?

581
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,128
Of course I am.

582
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,671
No, you can't.

583
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,966
You can't take our best employee away
while promising to revive the hotel!

584
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:53,925
Respectfully,

585
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,052
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang is mine.

586
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,513
Sa-rang was mine from the very beginning.

587
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,349
I was the first person
to show her the ropes and…

588
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,019
Tell him.

589
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,855
I'm the first person you met at the hotel.

590
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:12,819
I can grant you everything else but this.

591
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,615
The reason I even came here
was to take Sa-rang back with me.

592
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,658
I'm not going back on my own.

593
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,036
Mr. Gu,

594
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,289
I think it's because
you're in your honeymoon phase,

595
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,626
but if you're always with each other,
you'll get sick of each other.

596
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:31,004
In the long run,
long-distance relationships are the best.

597
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,589
You'll value each other more.

598
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:36,218
We value each other greatly
even though we see each other every day.

599
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,183
Sa-rang, why don't you decide?

600
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,519
Are you going with him or staying here?

601
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,687
Why would you ask her that?

602
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,898
She obviously wants to go with me.

603
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,316
Nothing is certain.

604
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,778
The choice is hers.

605
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:05,831
Fine.

606
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,167
I'll tell you.

607
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,222
KING TOURIST HOTEL

608
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,265
Sang-sik,

609
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,267
shouldn't we let her know now?

610
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,727
A surprise visit is the best.

611
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,271
We need to appear

612
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,232
out of nowhere
for her to be emotionally moved.

613
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:36,027
You're so clueless, Ro-un.
That's why you're not in a relationship.

614
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,612
Sorry?

615
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,114
But I am in a relationship.

616
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,157
You are? All of a sudden?

617
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,952
What a funny joke.

618
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,412
I'm being serious.

619
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,455
Congratulate me.

620
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,000
Really? Who are you dating?

621
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,795
An amazing woman.

622
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,299
-What? Who won you over?
-Really?

623
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,342
I wanted you to be Pyeong-hwa's boyfriend.

624
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,846
I know, right?

625
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,434
What?

626
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,937
It just happened.

627
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,689
Oh my.

628
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,024
What in the world?

629
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,942
Congratulations! What a surprise.

630
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,736
Thank you.

631
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,613
Really? This isn't a prank?

632
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,448
You two are dating?

633
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,283
Is love that easy for you?

634
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,535
I thought you were popular.

635
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,746
I am popular.

636
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,623
But nobody's bold enough to ask me out.

637
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,458
Are you sure you're popular?

638
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,544
Forget it. Let's go look for Sa-rang.

639
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,348
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang works here, right?

640
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,807
Can you call her for us?

641
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,142
We're her friends.

642
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,727
-Well, the thing is--
-Wait!

643
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,647
Don't tell her we came. It's a surprise.

644
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,483
I'm sorry, but she's not here.

645
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:57,901
Where did she go?

646
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,236
She went to Seoul a few moments ago.

647
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,363
Why?

648
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,323
For love, I suppose.

649
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,993
But we came all the way here for her.

650
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,245
Is she really not here?

651
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,538
No, she's not.

652
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,790
She really left?

653
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,583
We need to talk.

654
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,377
Really?

655
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,503
Thank you.

656
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,005
-Follow me.
-Have a great day.

657
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,721
This is why I said
we should've called her.

658
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,931
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

659
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:31,518
We all agreed to surprise her.
Isn't that right?

660
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,769
-No.
-No.

661
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:36,064
Who's the one who said
we were clueless about relationships

662
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,524
when we suggested we call her?

663
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,068
It was you.

664
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,278
Hey, Ro-un! How could you say that?

665
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,030
We talked on the phone about how--

666
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:44,990
Whatever.

667
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,909
From now on, you have no say.

668
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,662
I'm going to be the leader
of the six siblings.

669
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,331
-I approve.
-Me too. I approve no matter what.

670
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,920
I approve as well.

671
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,634
Since we came all the way here,

672
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,177
why don't we grab a bite to eat?

673
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,805
The meal will be on you, Mr. No.

674
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,600
Me? But we pooled our money.

675
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,482
I think I should pay. Yes, I want to.

676
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,819
Right! There's a cafeteria nearby.

677
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,904
They sell amazing stir-fried pork.

678
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,698
What do you think of stir-fried pork?

679
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,908
I'm the leader here.

680
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,702
All right, let's go.

681
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,079
We're going to get short ribs!

682
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,831
-Short ribs?
-Let's get short ribs!

683
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,624
-Short ribs.
-Short ribs.

684
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,335
We're getting short ribs.

685
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,971
-Hello, sir.
-Hello. Long time no see.

686
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,593
Congratulations on your inauguration, sir.

687
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,346
You don't need to do this from now on.

688
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,473
The chairman is waiting.

689
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,068
You want to take over King Tourist Hotel?

690
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:46,986
Yes.

691
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:48,947
Are you confident?

692
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:52,450
King Hotel is going to
rapidly rise as a global chain.

693
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:57,247
For that to happen,
we should have a strong domestic base.

694
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,374
I'm not doing this because I'm confident.

695
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,209
I'm doing it because I have to.

696
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,712
You're the president of King Hotel now.

697
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,589
Give it your best shot.

698
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,050
Yes, sir.

699
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,817
Where are your questions?

700
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,694
You probably have a lot to say.

701
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,866
Will anything change if I ask?

702
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,247
I don't care

703
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,458
what you think.

704
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,210
Because that's what you want.

705
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,253
And…

706
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,048
I'm going to do what I want.

707
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,133
Very well.

708
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,969
I did everything I could.

709
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,513
The rest is up to you.

710
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,641
But remember, whether you succeed or fail,

711
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,269
you have to deal with it.

712
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,859
Okay.

713
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,239
President Gu?

714
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,755
Don't think it's all over.

715
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,215
This is just the start.

716
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,384
I won't let you

717
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,929
take away a single thing.

718
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,096
I wasn't thinking of

719
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,016
taking anything from you.

720
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,559
Father wasn't either.

721
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,561
It's not that you didn't think of it.

722
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,980
It's that you never dared to.

723
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,190
Get your facts straight.

724
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,692
I'm just trying to say
that I don't want us to fight.

725
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,321
We're family.

726
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,242
"Family"?

727
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,997
You and I are family?

728
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,667
I've never thought that.

729
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,503
Not even once.

730
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:44,872
What did you do?

731
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,874
It was you, right?

732
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,418
No one else could've done it.

733
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,671
I gave her money

734
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,465
and she left on her own.

735
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,093
What you called love

736
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,470
was nothing much.

737
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,180
All it took

738
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,058
was some chump change.

739
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,773
What cheap love.

740
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,574
That's why I warned you.

741
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,410
I told you I'd divorce you
at the right time

742
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,579
and that you should stay put.

743
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,290
This is why you can't be loved.

744
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,293
You act like you're distinguished,

745
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,920
but you're just a poor soul
who's hungry for love.

746
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,840
So are you.

747
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,969
All the people you "loved" left you.

748
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,181
They're all fake.

749
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,684
If you still don't get it, keep trying.

750
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,688
Try finding out
if love even exists in this world.

751
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,485
I feel…

752
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,197
so bad for you.

753
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,735
Mom, don't cry.

754
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,321
I'll leave.

755
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,783
I'll go back to the US, so stop crying.

756
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,078
I'm sorry.

757
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,635
I'll be the one to do as you say.

758
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,097
Don't cry, Mom.

759
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,504
-Hello, Ms. Do.
-Hi.

760
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,298
Continue working.

761
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:45,803
After this month, fire the junior member.

762
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:46,846
Sorry?

763
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,474
You told us to reach the target
to maintain our staff,

764
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,391
so we did.

765
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,810
The higher-ups want me
to give someone the boot.

766
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,228
I have no choice.

767
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,610
-Does it only need to be one person?
-Yes.

768
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,528
It's good that it's not two people.

769
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,031
Then…

770
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:09,160
may I pick out someone
who is truly unnecessary?

771
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,328
Of course.

772
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,288
Now you're talking.

773
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,290
In my opinion,

774
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,504
I think Alanga will thrive
as long as we don't have you.

775
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,924
-What?
-I saw your social media posts.

776
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,092
You enjoyed beef omakase with your family,

777
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,928
but you reported it as a team dinner.

778
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,014
Wait.

779
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,184
Why do you have this?

780
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,603
You left it on top of the fax machine.

781
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,482
What's more,
you paid for a café date with your friends

782
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,234
with a corporate credit card.

783
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,819
The dates here match your posts.

784
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,154
That's wrong. Give it to me.

785
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,616
You even requested overtime pay.

786
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:54,080
I was the one who worked overtime
inspecting the goods in the warehouse.

787
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,375
Why do I see your name
when you didn't even show up?

788
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:01,254
That's just because
I got the dates mixed up.

789
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,172
Everyone makes mistakes.

790
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,508
Do you have to nitpick?

791
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,802
Don't try to just gloss over this.

792
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,514
You misappropriated company funds
for personal use,

793
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,307
regularly snuck out of work,

794
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,184
and even forged private documents.

795
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,271
These are serious offenses.

796
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,108
So please leave willingly.

797
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,531
How dare you threaten me
when you're just a contract worker?

798
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,577
I'm the one who reports
everything that happens here.

799
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,203
Who will you report this to?

800
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,330
Do you know someone at headquarters?

801
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,878
I wasn't going to say this,

802
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,047
but I'm friends with a director there.

803
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,091
We're super close.

804
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,344
People side with friends, not strangers.

805
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,805
Do whatever you want.

806
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,019
Ms. Gang. Look.

807
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,026
Hello, I'm Do Ra-hee of King Distribution.

808
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:07,653
-It is an honor to meet you.
-Yes. Thank you.

809
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,698
What brings you here?

810
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,533
I had a meeting here, so I stopped by.

811
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,952
I heard about your wasted trip
to King Tourist Hotel.

812
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:15,870
Yes.

813
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:18,039
-Because of someone.
-I know.

814
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:19,457
Why did you trust him?

815
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,586
I also heard you earned the highest sales
in the country this month.

816
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,338
You heard about that?

817
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,672
I told him.

818
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,342
Since you are the proud leader
of the six siblings.

819
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,551
"Six siblings"?

820
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,136
Yes, six siblings.

821
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,847
Mr. Gu, Ms. Gang,

822
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,975
me, and three other people

823
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,811
are the six siblings
that are closer than family.

824
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,105
"Family"?

825
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,780
Could you please take these?

826
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,033
Mr. Gu bought these
for you to enjoy together.

827
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,161
Please take good care of Ms. Gang.

828
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,121
Let me know if you need anything,

829
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,582
and call me right away
if there are any problems.

830
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,751
-Yes, I will.
-Keep up the good work.

831
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:04,877
See you next time.

832
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,295
Goodbye.

833
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,421
You got this.

834
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,923
"Do you know someone?"

835
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,475
He left.

836
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:20,434
Did he?

837
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,109
Ms. Gang.

838
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:31,070
I'm sorry for everything.

839
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,906
If you had sincerely apologized even once,

840
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,658
I would've given you a chance.

841
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,619
I'm going to make an official report.
Just follow HQ's decision.

842
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,456
Welcome to Alanga!

843
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,875
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

844
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,712
What's wrong?

845
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:52,091
It's nothing.

846
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,260
I told you I'm just here
because I missed you.

847
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,470
Did you two argue?

848
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,556
There's no reason for us to.

849
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,267
Then what's the matter?

850
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:02,768
Tell me.

851
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,687
Say something.

852
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,982
-Why you…
-Gosh! I'm sorry.

853
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:10,151
-What are you doing?
-Goodness.

854
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,154
That's why I told you to stay still!

855
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,573
Are you not going to tell me?

856
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,451
Do you want to see me die of frustration?

857
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,052
Can I see something more special?

858
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,430
All the items I've shown you
are limited editions

859
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:42,808
crafted specially
by the brand's head designers.

860
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:49,899
My girlfriend has a pretty smile.

861
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:56,405
I want her to smile brightly
when I present her with the ring.

862
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,948
Is there something that special?

863
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,202
Just one moment, please.

864
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,085
What do you think?

865
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,797
It is a design
that symbolizes unchanging love.

866
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,633
It is a symbol of eternal love

867
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,678
and also signifies
a celebration of a special moment.

868
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,184
"Eternal love"?

869
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,227
Yes, sir.

870
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,108
I'll go with this one.

871
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,415
Okay.

872
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,794
Isn't this the restaurant from back then?

873
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,255
That's right.

874
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,216
We had our first meal together here.

875
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,510
Do you remember?

876
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,013
Of course. It was my birthday.

877
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,518
People will think we're a couple.

878
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,020
No one will think that.

879
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,688
I could do so much better.

880
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:57,902
Back then,

881
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:01,488
I never imagined
that we would end up like this.

882
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,492
Did you?

883
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,410
No.

884
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,162
Did you?

885
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,582
No comment.

886
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,421
But we're the only ones here again.

887
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,341
Yes, you're right.

888
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,135
Anyway,

889
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,387
I'm glad we're here again.

890
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,223
Right?

891
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:29,266
Yes.

892
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,979
-Your food is ready.
-Okay.

893
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,608
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

894
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,004
Why do you keep checking your phone?
Is there a problem?

895
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:00,339
What?

896
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:01,966
No, there isn't.

897
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:03,676
Then what's wrong?

898
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:05,803
You look so anxious.

899
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,179
What are you talking about?

900
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,474
I don't know
the first thing about feeling anxious.

901
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:26,532
It'll start in three minutes.
Please get ready.

902
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,993
DRONE OPERATOR

903
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:51,932
Actually,

904
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,476
I have

905
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,354
something important to say.

906
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:04,069
I also have something I want to say today.

907
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:05,946
What is it?

908
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,575
-You can go first.
-No, go ahead.

909
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:11,660
What I want to say

910
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,663
is really important.

911
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,234
I want to call it quits.

912
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,548
What do you mean?

913
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:15,057
No matter how hard I think about it,
I just think this isn't it.

914
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:19,228
I feel out of place.

915
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,659
THE SHOW WILL BEGIN. YOU MAY NOW PROPOSE.

916
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,173
I'm done.

917
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,843
I want to leave.

918
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:45,522
KING THE LAND

919
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:29,441
