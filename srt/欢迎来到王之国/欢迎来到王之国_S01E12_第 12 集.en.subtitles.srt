00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,673
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,674
Goodbye.

4
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,176
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

5
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,678
-Is this enough beer?
-I think so.

6
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,889
We can always get more. We make money.

7
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,683
Hello, sir.

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,603
I'm sorry we're late, Mr. Yoo.

9
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,271
-Hello, Ms. Gang.
-Hello.

10
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,273
Thank you for coming at such short notice.

11
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,357
You're still in uniform.

12
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,902
We got your call at the airport
and came straight here.

13
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:09,986
Where's Sa-rang?

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,196
She won't pick up.

15
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,489
What about Mr. No?

16
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,782
He won't pick up either.

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,158
Let's call them in the car.

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,659
-Okay.
-Are we taking this?

19
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,578
-Let's go.
-You can sit in front.

20
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,538
-Goodness.
-I'll take that.

21
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,915
Thank you.

22
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,291
MR. NO

23
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,297
The person you have called is unavailableâ€¦

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,424
Mr. No is free today,
but he won't pick up.

25
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,551
It'll be the four of us today.

26
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,470
The Bangkok crew will get together soon.

27
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,971
-Okay.
-Okay.

28
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,267
But why won't the two of them pick up?

29
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,646
Maybe they're hanging out
behind our backs.

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,524
Have they finally become an item?

31
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,526
Really?

32
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,778
Gosh, he's amazing.

33
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,029
I knew he had it in him.

34
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,739
Have what? He's got nothing.

35
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,533
You say you're friends,
but you don't know anything.

36
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,617
What do you mean?

37
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,078
Things are already over between them.

38
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,412
What? Since when?

39
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,331
Were they ever together?

40
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,874
It ended before it began.

41
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,710
They went out by themselves
in Thailand, remember?

42
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,797
He asked her out on that day,
but I think he was turned down.

43
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,507
Really?

44
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,716
Did he tell you that?

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,469
How could I ask him?
It would only hurt him.

46
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,888
Yeah, it didn't seem like
things worked out.

47
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,432
I knew it would never work out.

48
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,934
I know Mr. Guâ€¦

49
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,853
I mean, Mr. No very well.

50
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,689
It's not in him to date anyone.

51
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,733
I'd give him one-on-one lessons
on the best tips for dating,

52
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,110
but he couldn't keep up.

53
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,487
Basic skills are everything for dating.

54
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,948
Were you in lots of relationships?

55
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:37,866
Me?

56
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,870
Well, many women were into me.

57
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,872
But nobody ever asked me out.

58
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,748
I'm not that hard to figure out,

59
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,876
but they all feel like
I'm too good for them.

60
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,588
So are you saying
you've never dated anyone?

61
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,507
I'm telling you. I'm very popular.

62
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,802
But nobody can find a way to ask me out.

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,807
You can ask them out first.

64
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,309
No. Ladies first.

65
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,019
A gentleman's duty. Don't you know?

66
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,687
That's why you have no girlfriend.

67
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,023
May I have some snacks? That one.

68
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,066
-Here.
-Thanks a lot. Thank you.

69
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,820
Anyway, he must be heartbroken

70
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,822
to be turned down before they got to date.

71
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,366
I should grab a drink with him later.

72
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,993
Have some snacks too.

73
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,413
-Thank you.
-Do you want to see something funny?

74
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,582
Magic!

75
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,043
You're hilarious. I want one too.

76
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,252
Thank you.

77
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,512
-Did you paint the stairs yourselves?
-How did you know?

78
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,889
It didn't look professional.

79
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,933
Come on in.

80
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,267
-Okay.
-Welcome.

81
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,102
-What are these?
-What?

82
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,854
Why are there men's shoes?

83
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,361
EPISODE 12

84
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,448
What's going on, you two?

85
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,075
Since when?

86
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,327
It hasn't been that long.

87
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,830
You insisted that you two weren't dating.

88
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:49,789
Sorry.

89
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,375
Well, things happened.

90
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,876
Why weren't you honest with us?

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,253
Why did you fool us?

92
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,421
We weren't fooling you.

93
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,631
We just chose not to tell.

94
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,133
That's fooling us.

95
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,302
What's with the mood?

96
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,262
We should celebrate
instead of getting mad.

97
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,597
We're not mad. We're just in shock.

98
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,684
We used to share everything
without keeping any secrets.

99
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,561
That's why I'm telling you now.

100
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,856
Please go easy on us.

101
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,525
Put your cutesy act away.

102
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,402
How dare you try to get away with this?

103
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,947
Congratulations.
You two make a great couple.

104
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,990
Thank you.

105
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,199
You have great judgment.

106
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,619
Anyway, is there anything else
you've lied about?

107
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,164
We weren't trying to hide anything.

108
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,167
If you fool us once again,
the six of us will disband.

109
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,628
Even if you tell us later that you're
an illegitimate son of the chairman,

110
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,255
we aren't going to excuse you.

111
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,429
No.

112
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,768
I'll tell you everything honestly.

113
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,313
I'm actually not an illegitimate son
of the chairman.

114
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,983
Of course you aren't.

115
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,069
It was just an example.

116
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,111
I'm just a son.

117
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,613
I know. We're just daughters.

118
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,452
-Whose son?
-He's right.

119
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,663
He's the chairman's son.

120
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,384
Come on. That scared us.

121
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,011
How can you make up such a lie?

122
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,639
Our chairman's last name is Gu,
and yours is No.

123
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,516
You're right. Come on.

124
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,392
I almost fell for that.

125
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,020
Yes, the chairman's son
is the head manager, right?

126
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,522
I hear he's a jerk

127
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,190
who has a rotten personality.

128
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,858
That rude nepotism guy

129
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,945
and our Mr. No here
are on a completely different level.

130
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,947
I'm that rude, rotten nepotism guy.

131
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,450
I'm sorry for accidentally deceiving you.

132
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,411
I'm Gu Won, the head manager.

133
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,456
The guy who's staring at the wall
isn't Department Manager Yoo.

134
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,083
He's Manager No Sang-sik.

135
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,168
Sa-rang, is this true?

136
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,504
Let me make a formal introduction.

137
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,966
He's Head Manager Gu Won,

138
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,177
and that's Manager No Sang-sik.

139
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,306
I'm Manager No Sang-sik.

140
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,391
Nice to meet you.

141
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,900
Are you serious? Wait.

142
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,236
Really? That's crazy.

143
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,284
Do you think that went all right?

144
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,911
Sure, I think so.

145
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,996
What a relief.

146
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,040
Mr. Gu.

147
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,876
The floor is quite cold.
Please sit on this.

148
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,170
-No, it's warm here.
-Please sit comfortably.

149
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,504
I'm very comfortable.

150
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,007
We don't have much to serve here.

151
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,092
A sitting cushion? Escort him to the sofa.

152
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,719
-Mr. Gu, please sit here.
-No.

153
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,804
I'm really comfortable here.

154
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,055
-I'm fine.
-Sit up here.

155
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,057
You're making us feel awkward.

156
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,726
That's enough.

157
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,978
We kept it a secret
because you'd feel awkward.

158
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,191
Of course it feels awkward.
He's the chairman's son.

159
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,775
It'd be weird if we were at ease.

160
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,152
This is even more awkward.

161
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,070
Please sit comfortably.

162
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,620
Why are you kneeling?

163
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,330
-Sit at ease.
-Please.

164
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,463
Well, Mr. Gu.

165
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,383
If I misbehaved in any way,

166
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,136
please show me your mercy.

167
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,180
No, you didn't misbehave in any way.

168
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:38,017
Da-eul, please treat me
as recklessly as you did before.

169
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,228
-It's easier for me.
-Oh my.

170
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,313
-Did I treat you recklessly?
-Yes.

171
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,607
No way, I wouldn't do that.

172
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,235
You did. You were absolutely reckless.

173
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,737
You tried to put him in his place
in Bangkok,

174
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,531
and even threatened him once.

175
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,741
I did? When did I do that?

176
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,909
"Mr. Exclamation Mark!"

177
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,662
"Back there."
Don't you remember saying that?

178
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,996
It's okay, really.

179
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,167
I know you were looking out for someone
just starting his career.

180
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,126
It's all right.

181
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,420
I'm so sorry.

182
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,297
I deserve to die.

183
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,466
I deserve to die!

184
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,926
I'm so sorry.

185
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,053
-I'm so sorry.
-What's with you?

186
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,513
-What?
-I'm so sorry.

187
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,973
You're going overboard.

188
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,684
Well,

189
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,769
Mr. Gu.

190
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:26,148
I'm so sorry,
but please excuse me for a moment.

191
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,525
-Where are you going?
-Me?

192
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,194
Over there.

193
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,281
Sure.

194
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,417
We need to talk.

195
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,377
We can talk here in peace.

196
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,546
Come on out.

197
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,589
Okay.

198
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,511
I mean,

199
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,473
why did you have to take things that far?

200
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,100
Why would you do that to your colleagues?

201
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,893
It's not like I have any power.

202
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,104
I also had to do as I was told.

203
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,983
Even so, you should've tipped us off.

204
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,319
How could you do that as a peer?

205
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,279
You know what it's like to be powerless.

206
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:17,033
And consider how I felt
when I couldn't call him Mr. Gu.

207
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,995
At the airport,
I was going to explain that I was Mr. No,

208
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,163
then Iâ€¦

209
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,915
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,634
Here you go, sir.

211
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,512
You treated me like a friend
up until five minutes ago.

212
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,181
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,515
Why are you sorry?

214
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,979
I don't have any brothers
or close male friends,

215
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,733
so I'm not sure
if I'll make a good friend,

216
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,110
but I'll do my best.

217
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,195
Let's be good friends.

218
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,739
Okay, Won.

219
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,992
Pyeong-hwa, please treat me like a friend.

220
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,535
Please sit comfortably.

221
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,081
Yes, of course, Mr. Gu.

222
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,124
Would you like more beverages?

223
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,459
Please don't do this.

224
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,752
I'm not the head manager.

225
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,296
I'm Sa-rang's boyfriend.

226
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,510
Yes, Mr. Sa-rang's Boyfriend.

227
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,429
If I can help you in any way,

228
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,806
I'll help you no matterâ€¦

229
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,183
Would he ever need my help?

230
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,394
Staying quiet would help.

231
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,603
Stop blabbering.

232
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,398
Okay.

233
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,151
Anyway, let's overcome
this state of affairs wiselyâ€¦

234
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,986
-What am I saying?
-Pyeong-hwa.

235
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,446
Yes.

236
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,658
Anyway, I'll go get Da-eul.

237
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,451
You can stay. I'll go.

238
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,619
Wait.

239
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,289
I'll take responsibility
for this state of affairs and bring her.

240
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,250
-Please sit.
-But stillâ€¦

241
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,835
-I'll go.
-Please sit.

242
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,837
-Please sit comfortably.
-Butâ€¦

243
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,215
Yes, Mr. Sa-rang's Boyfriend.

244
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,235
What are you doing?

245
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,657
How could this happen?

246
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,367
What do you mean?

247
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,077
You were never as popular as me.

248
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,745
How could you start dating first?

249
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,456
How does this make any sense?

250
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,333
I have

251
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,169
absolutely no idea.

252
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,712
No idea about what?

253
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,505
About what makes you think that.

254
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,217
And why didn't you tell me
you two were dating?

255
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,471
How could you hide it from me?

256
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,680
Goodness.

257
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,184
My gosh.

258
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,518
When did it start?

259
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,769
-No Sang-sik.
-Yes?

260
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,064
-You can cry.
-Okay.

261
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,525
You can cry. Was she really mad?

262
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,068
-Yes.
-You can cry.

263
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,197
Goodness.

264
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,450
I'm sad we're not going to Dubai.

265
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,576
It's empty.

266
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,120
I'm sad it's empty.

267
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,125
What are you two talking about?

268
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,004
Are you mad because I didn't tell you?

269
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,965
No, we get it.

270
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,550
We can understand that much.

271
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,929
Then what? Are you worried about me?

272
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,263
That I might get hurt?

273
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,641
Why would you get hurt?

274
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,892
Is Mr. No that bad?

275
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,018
Mr. Gu.

276
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,396
Yes, right. Mr. Gu.

277
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,940
Is he the bad boy type?

278
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,733
No, he's far from it.

279
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,486
I wouldn't be dating him if he were.

280
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,780
Then why? Why would you get hurt?

281
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,450
Well, you know.

282
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,329
I thought you two might be worried
about the difference in status.

283
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,872
Hey.

284
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,249
People are all the same.

285
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,750
Difference in status? As if.

286
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,960
She's right.

287
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,795
There may be a difference,

288
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,463
but it's nothing before love.

289
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,633
Then what were you two
discussing so seriously?

290
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,513
We were having a serious discussion

291
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,682
that you may have made a rash decision.

292
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,769
It wasn't a rash decision.

293
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,063
I thought about it for a while.

294
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,232
He's a great guy.

295
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,196
What do you like about him?

296
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,202
He's someone I dreamed of.

297
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,832
He doesn't make me anxious
or disappointed.

298
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,002
And he's always by my side
when I need him.

299
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,131
He really showed up almost magically
whenever I was in trouble.

300
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,509
Mr. No is more lovey-dovey than he seems.

301
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,511
Mr. Gu.

302
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,847
Whatever. "Mr. No" has already stuck.

303
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,308
Anyway, he seems like a great guy.

304
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,059
Congrats.

305
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,480
I hope our Sa-rang will be
dearly loved in this relationship.

306
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,609
Thanks, guys.

307
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,279
Now, we have a reason

308
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,574
to party hard all night!

309
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,868
Sounds great!

310
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,995
Weren't we partying this whole time?

311
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,079
-No.
-What?

312
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,623
We haven't even gotten started.

313
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,125
-Let's party.
-All right. Time to get started.

314
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,547
It's time to begin

315
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,383
My gosh.

316
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,308
"King Hotel became the first Korean hotel
to win the World of Best Talent,

317
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,144
surpassing many major global hotels."

318
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,563
"King Hotel gave all the credit

319
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,857
to its staff
for 100 years of its history."

320
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,487
"They showcased the class
of the best hotel in Korea to the world."

321
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,323
The class of our hotel skyrocketed

322
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,700
because I stepped up
as our representative.

323
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,995
You represented us?

324
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,540
-Since when?
-I welcomed the guests.

325
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,294
The first person to greet people
is the representative of the hotel.

326
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,047
And I carried out that difficult task.

327
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,801
You're right.

328
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,388
You successfully carried out
such a difficult task.

329
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,057
Great job.

330
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,850
You're the best.

331
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,728
You say that with such a mad face.

332
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,356
You've done well too.

333
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,857
If you keep this up,

334
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,150
you'll be in charge soon.

335
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,777
Stop talking nonsense.

336
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,487
The situation has already turned.

337
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,365
Slowly take over the Hotel,
Air, and Distribution.

338
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,742
The world is now yours, Mr. Gu.

339
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,495
It doesn't matter
who the world belongs to.

340
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,372
Let's wonder if it's worth living in.

341
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,333
It'll be worth living in
if you take over the group.

342
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,671
I'll cover every step of your journey
with flowers from now on.

343
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,341
Put your trust in me.

344
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,607
Seriously.

345
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,068
That event was quite touching.

346
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,321
I began to think of our old days.
I almost choked up.

347
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,490
I got to see Mr. Gu in a different light.

348
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:18,871
I honestly thought he'd ruin this event,
but it was a great success.

349
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,957
We just saved a fortune on marketing.

350
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,420
Other global hotel chains
have requested the video of the event.

351
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,840
And World Luxury Travel Guide
also asked us for an interview.

352
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,218
You all sound very satisfied.

353
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,346
Yes, our staff is satisfied,
and their spirits have gone up too.

354
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,268
I must have overestimated all of you.

355
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,647
I can't believe you shed tears
at that overly sentimental show.

356
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,819
Who should I put my trust in

357
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,197
as I lead this company?

358
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,660
Preying on people's sentiments
can win praise easily.

359
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,455
But will it bring us any money?

360
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,418
How does this help us
overcome the management crisis

361
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,295
faced by the group?

362
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,049
Is now the time to manage
with our emotions?

363
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,636
Other groups are discussing
going into survival mode,

364
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,596
not just contingency plans.

365
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,681
I also spoke

366
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,267
to the chairman a few days ago.

367
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,603
That I cannot trust him.

368
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,440
Don't make me lose my trust in you too.

369
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,900
I won't drag this out.

370
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,571
Only those who will follow me
are to attend the meeting today.

371
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,706
I'd like to commend you
for the 100th-anniversary event.

372
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,293
Anniversaries were usually excuses
to invite people who could be useful to us

373
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,503
and to treat them.

374
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,547
But this time, it was truly our occasion.

375
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,465
Head Manager Gu, great work.

376
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,634
Don't mention it, sir.

377
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,094
It's all thanks to our staff.

378
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,972
Well, the event may have ended well,

379
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,182
but it's too early
to open the champagne, sir.

380
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,308
What do you mean?

381
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,601
As a group,

382
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,728
our sales, profits, and stock price

383
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,105
are stagnant.

384
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,192
Don't you think we're doing well
in this time of recession?

385
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,362
If you consider inflation
and the increase in interest rates,

386
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,241
I wouldn't say we're stagnant,
but retrogressing.

387
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,286
What do you think, Ms. Gu?

388
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,829
I agree.

389
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,290
Six groups among the top ten corporations

390
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,125
have entered contingency management.

391
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,086
We must declare the same
before it's too late

392
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,589
and restructure our group.

393
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,842
What about others?

394
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,556
It looks like you're all on the same page.

395
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,486
You came thoroughly prepared.

396
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,197
At least I should keep it together.

397
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,866
We're already late.

398
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,493
I don't think now's the time to do that.

399
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,207
Contingency management is all a show.

400
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,294
It's an official threat to the staff
that they must tighten their belts

401
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,171
because we're in a crisis.

402
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,423
Don't you know cutting costs
is the most effective way

403
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,759
to increase short-term profits?

404
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,676
I do.

405
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,637
And that it's a move we always use

406
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,347
to pile up money in our company account.

407
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,433
Do you all agree with Ms. Gu?

408
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,061
Is this normal?

409
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,148
Mr. Gu, as you already know,

410
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,277
cutting costs isn't the biggest issue
just for us, but for all corporations.

411
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,322
You all wish to make King Group
into a world-renowned company,

412
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,949
yet all you can talk about

413
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,867
is extorting our employees.

414
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,245
Luxury brands exist

415
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,081
because history lies within their value.

416
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,208
If we wish to become
a world-renowned company,

417
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,877
I believe we must be equipped
with a worthwhile history.

418
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,878
Soâ€¦

419
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,214
do you wish to write the story

420
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,633
of chasing after short-time profits

421
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,468
by extorting the staff?

422
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,012
If we want to make history,
we must survive first.

423
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,931
The dead don't get to tell a story.

424
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,557
How will we live?

425
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,519
That's more important
than survival itself.

426
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,687
It's concerning

427
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,399
that you're in management
with that attitude.

428
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,776
Father.

429
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,486
If you can't decide, I will.

430
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,284
Is cutting costs the only way
of improving our business?

431
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,910
Yes.

432
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:33,208
Are you confident that we can do better
without cutting costs?

433
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,711
Yes, I am.

434
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,671
This is great news.

435
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,965
This means we're going to do well

436
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,217
whether we cut costs or not.

437
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,264
At the next meeting,

438
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,810
bring me reports on what you'll do
for the future of King Group.

439
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,895
You.

440
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,815
And you. Both of you.

441
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,901
Yes, sir.

442
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,338
The war has finally begun.

443
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,298
She has a million people on her side,

444
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,507
whereas you

445
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,051
only have me.

446
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,218
It's not just you.

447
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,095
It's you and me both.

448
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,099
Yes, you're right.

449
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,852
It's always been the two of us.

450
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,062
You're right.

451
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,688
What's with you?

452
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,356
Come on.

453
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,402
Mr. Gu,

454
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,613
please remember this.

455
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,199
That I'll always be by your side.

456
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,993
Even if we must face a million
or ten million foes, we'll be fine.

457
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,078
Because we areâ€¦

458
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,206
one.

459
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,834
I'd be better off alone.

460
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,796
You liar.

461
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,842
Today is my last flight.

462
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,386
I'll be working at headquarters
starting tomorrow.

463
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,847
I'll always remember
these beautiful flights

464
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,142
I shared with all of you.

465
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,229
Thank you for your hard work, Ms. Yoo.

466
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,609
I prepared this for you.

467
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,737
Gosh, you didn't have to.

468
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,658
Mi-na, you're the best.

469
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:36,081
Please take good care of our team,
Purser Hwang Mi-na.

470
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,875
I'll do my best, just as you taught me.

471
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,587
Thank you for your hard work.

472
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,881
Thank you so much for your service.

473
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,342
Thank you, everyone.

474
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,598
Hello?

475
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,810
Hey, did you see how my team
topped in-flight sales?

476
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,188
Yes, isn't it amazing?

477
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,400
I got promoted and got moved
to headquarters thanks to that.

478
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,526
Really?

479
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,446
Hey, one sec. I'll call you back.

480
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,742
What? Do you have something to say?

481
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,163
Don't you?

482
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,080
No.

483
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,332
At the very least,

484
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,503
you should have said sorry.

485
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,797
Why should I?

486
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,382
Do you even have to ask?

487
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,218
You weren't going to promote me
to purser anyway.

488
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,013
You took advantage of me
to increase sales.

489
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,682
You've been working long enough

490
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,018
to increase sales
without promotion at stake.

491
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,314
And you already know
it'll be tough for you to become a purser.

492
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,732
What?

493
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,030
Did you think
I didn't know about your divorce?

494
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,204
Everyone worries that divorce
could affect their performance reviews,

495
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,371
so they hide it.

496
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,332
Sure, that's fine.

497
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:01,917
However,

498
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,711
at the very least,
you should know your place.

499
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,007
The only reason I'm not blowing this up
is because we're friends.

500
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,927
I hope you do well.

501
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,720
Good luck.

502
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,030
REQUEST BY: OH PYEONG-HWA

503
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,115
MARRIAGE CANCELLATION APPLICATION

504
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,158
It's impossible.

505
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,701
Come on.

506
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,871
Her ex registered the marriage in secret
when she broke up with him.

507
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,624
But I can't help you
since it has been registered.

508
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,543
Why can't you help her?
This is total fraud!

509
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,544
That's the law.

510
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,089
You filled out the marriage form yourself.

511
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,508
Well, he wanted to write it up as a joke

512
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,218
for our 100th-day anniversary.

513
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,054
You shouldn't have signed
such an important form.

514
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,599
Anyway, your marriage registration
cannot be canceled.

515
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,643
Then what am I going to do?

516
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,854
Well, you can file for annulment,

517
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,481
but that's basically impossible.

518
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,358
All you can do is file for divorce.

519
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,943
-Divorce?
-What?

520
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,987
They weren't even married.
What do you mean?

521
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,697
Please cancel this registration.

522
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,532
Please cancel it.

523
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,492
There's nothing more I can do for you.

524
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,869
You should go find an attorney.

525
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,666
What am I going to do?

526
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,420
Please help her this once.

527
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,879
-Just once.
-Please look over it.

528
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,715
She's too young to get a divorce.

529
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,758
-Come on.
-Please help me.

530
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,052
What am I going to do?

531
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,470
You'll now become a divorcÃ©e

532
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,264
because you weren't careful enough!

533
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,027
You were the one who invited me.

534
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,653
And it wasn't just an invitation.

535
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,906
I came by because
you begged me to make a speech.

536
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,825
But to be humiliated like that?

537
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,328
I didn't know things
would play out that way.

538
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,497
Who could have known if you didn't?

539
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,752
I couldn't face my subordinates
after the humiliation that day.

540
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,547
You never mind
what your subordinates think anyway.

541
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,051
I'll continue to make it up to you
for the mistake that day,

542
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,552
so please don't be upset.

543
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:26,478
This is the finest premium
JamÃ³n 100% IbÃ©rico de Bellota,

544
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,480
made from the top 5% of pigs in the world.

545
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,273
Hey.

546
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,319
Why do you keep serving food
on this side and that side?

547
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,780
It's very distracting
as you go back and forth.

548
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,616
I'm sorry, sir.

549
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,576
Which side would you prefer?

550
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,746
I just asked why you distracted me
by going back and forth.

551
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,956
How is an apology your answer?

552
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,000
Are you deaf?

553
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,543
Don't you get it?

554
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,799
The serving ritual here at King the Land
follows the European royal families.

555
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,260
We serve wine and beverages on the right
and other dishes on the left.

556
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,679
If you find this inconvenient,

557
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,432
allow me to serve
from the side of your choice.

558
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,558
Oh my.

559
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,143
You really are something.

560
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,353
Very high and mighty.

561
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,440
All you had to say was sorry!

562
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,359
Are you trying to educate me?

563
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,069
Was that a lecture?

564
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,280
No, sir. I'm sorry.

565
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,157
Saying sorry won't cut it!

566
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,536
Ms. Gu, how come
your employees aren't trained?

567
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,706
Wasn't it enough
that I was humiliated by you?

568
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,875
Now I have to be belittled
by the likes of her?

569
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,212
Fire her!

570
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,299
If you don't, I'll never see you again.

571
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,972
Yes, ma'am?

572
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,433
Make sure everyone here is retrained.

573
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,434
And get rid of her.

574
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,437
-Sorry?
-Get rid of her.

575
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,565
Yes, ma'am.

576
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,026
Get rid of what?

577
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,528
Our staff aren't objects.

578
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,321
This isn't for you to meddle with.

579
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,823
I think it is.

580
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,284
Hello.

581
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,536
My name is Gu Won, head of King the Land.

582
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,580
Yes, and?

583
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,707
Sir.

584
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,460
Dining etiquette was formed

585
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,045
in the 19th century,
during Queen Victoria's reign.

586
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,506
It's what we usually call table manners.

587
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,385
A knife is a miniature version
of a dueling sword,

588
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,679
so the blade should be held

589
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,806
away from others.

590
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,103
Throwing a handkerchief means
you wish to fight the other.

591
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,981
So the napkin,
used here in place of a handkerchief,

592
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,816
should not be thrown.

593
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,862
Manners are unlike the law,
so it isn't compulsory to abide by them,

594
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,490
but it does display a person's worth.

595
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,285
Mr. Park, please show manners

596
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,579
appropriate for your position.

597
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,795
You aren't a man who's built for business.

598
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,964
King Hotel

599
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,092
has made many grave mistakes against me.

600
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,386
Let's meet again another time.

601
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,098
This is too humiliating
before my subordinates!

602
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,058
Too humiliating!

603
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:13,978
Mr. Park.

604
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,233
How dare you do this to me
to protect a mere employee?

605
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,236
Don't you realize how important
Assemblyman Park is to us?

606
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,071
She's not a mere employee!
She's a valued member.

607
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,116
I'll protect my own people

608
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,828
as long as I'm in charge here.

609
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,334
Is she just an employee?

610
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,919
Not something more?

611
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,630
What do you mean?

612
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,882
Blood never lies, so just in case.

613
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,636
You deployed the helicopter to save her.

614
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,653
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

615
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,866
No, you've done well.

616
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,536
If something similar happens,

617
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,996
protect our staff first.

618
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,290
That's your duty as the manager.

619
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,207
Yes, sir.

620
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,834
Do that in every situation.

621
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,919
I'll take responsibility.

622
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,186
It was such a tough day.

623
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,898
Yes, let's wrap up and go home.

624
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,107
It wasn't easy.

625
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,530
I'm sorry.

626
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,824
It wasn't your fault.

627
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,911
You can't deal with someone
who's trying to pick a fight.

628
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,121
Assemblyman Park is the worst.

629
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,498
He took it out on you
after Ms. Gu ticked him off.

630
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,126
But we were all saved thanks to Mr. Gu.

631
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,421
Remember how Mr. Park got drunk
and made a scene last time?

632
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,089
How could I forget?

633
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,091
We were all told to line up,

634
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,969
and he droned on for over an hour
about staff discipline.

635
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,597
It's that easy to pick on us.

636
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,223
Anyway, he's such an eyesore.

637
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,893
Don't even bring it up.
I don't even want to remember.

638
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,561
Hey, let's just call it a bad day

639
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,313
-and go out for a beer.
-Okay.

640
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,649
It was a bad day,
so let's chug it away with beer.

641
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,652
I'll wrap up here, so you can all go.

642
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,070
Aren't you coming?

643
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,365
I'm invited?

644
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,991
You're a part of our team.

645
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,576
Let's wrap up together and leave.

646
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,871
-Okay.
-Okay.

647
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,470
Sa-rang.

648
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,472
That Thai medicine you got me was great.

649
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,182
I've been in less pain.

650
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,142
I'm glad it was effective.

651
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,936
You're too nice.

652
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,313
If it were me,
I wouldn't have bought gifts.

653
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,272
Exactly.

654
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,899
We were quite mean to her.

655
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,277
Hey, it wasn't us. It was especially you.

656
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,988
What? So you're feigning innocence?

657
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,906
-You did it too.
-You were mean to her.

658
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,033
-That's enough.
-Seriouslyâ€¦

659
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,412
To be frank, I didn't like you.

660
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,124
We worked very hard to get here,

661
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,502
but you were promoted immediately
with one word from Chairman Gu.

662
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,796
But after spending time with you,

663
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,966
I realized you deserved to work here.

664
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,136
Thank you for being a competent worker.

665
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,556
Don't mention it.

666
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,934
You've always had a certain set of rules,

667
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,104
so I understood how odd it must've been
for me to suddenly join you.

668
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,107
That's why I worked very hard

669
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,276
to be worthy of this position.

670
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,903
You've done more than enough.
You're doing great.

671
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,905
Thank you.

672
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,574
Raise your glasses.

673
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,034
Okay.

674
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,786
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

675
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,464
Anyway, wasn't Mr. Gu
really amazing back then?

676
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,925
I never imagined
an executive would take our side.

677
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:13,926
Right?

678
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,555
We've always been told to beg
for forgiveness when guests got mad.

679
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,182
I was honestly surprised.

680
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,143
I can see something
like sincerity in Mr. Gu.

681
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,811
Did you check your bank accounts?

682
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,938
No, why?

683
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,233
We got a bonus for our 100th anniversary.
A million won each.

684
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,821
But we normally get vouchers
for the hotel or the buffet.

685
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,989
That was the norm,

686
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:39,368
but Mr. Gu sent out a survey
to see what we actually wanted.

687
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,412
Cash was the overwhelming first place,

688
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,623
so he gave it to us.

689
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,542
The hotel never gave us
something we really wanted.

690
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,379
I thought the survey was a show
just as it always had been.

691
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,297
Right?

692
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,218
The world changes
now that we have a new boss.

693
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,053
Let's all make a toast.

694
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,514
For Head Manager Gu Won!

695
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,766
-For Mr. Gu!
-For Mr. Gu!

696
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,729
Gosh, that's nice.

697
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,071
-It's pouring.
-It really is.

698
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,280
Oh no.

699
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,657
There's the taxi.

700
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,033
-Bye, Sa-rang.
-Bye, Sa-rang.

701
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,368
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

702
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,453
I'm this way. See you tomorrow.

703
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,913
-Bye, Sa-rang.
-Goodbye.

704
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,997
How will you get home?

705
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,291
I'll take the bus.

706
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,376
We'll go too.

707
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,794
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

708
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,756
How did you find me?

709
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,466
It began to rain,

710
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,093
and I heard you were still here.

711
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,470
You should've called.

712
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,390
I couldn't ruin your fun
just for my own happiness.

713
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,851
Did you have fun?

714
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,895
Yes.

715
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,440
It felt like I was finally
accepted into the team.

716
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,441
It was great.

717
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,443
I'm sure they already accepted you.

718
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,945
It just took more time to break the wall

719
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,822
even after they decided to take you in.

720
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,699
I was grateful to everyone.

721
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,244
And I think they organized this dinner
because of me.

722
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,789
Anyway, are you okay?

723
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,168
Ms. Gu looked really angry.

724
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,211
So what?

725
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,756
If the customer is king,
he should act like one too.

726
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,760
Our hotel is way too classy

727
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:04,013
to show courtesy
to someone as rude as him.

728
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,516
Shall we?

729
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,647
Here.

730
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,416
Did you see how quick I was?

731
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,388
Oh no.

732
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,442
What? What is it?

733
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,319
What is it? What's going on?

734
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,362
What? What now?

735
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,114
What? Why?

736
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,573
-What's going on?
-What?

737
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,702
I was just startled while watching TV.

738
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,624
Right.

739
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,049
So why did you come out half-dressed?

740
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,384
You surprised me.

741
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,762
Well, I thoughtâ€¦

742
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,766
I heard you scream, so I rushed out.

743
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,479
I'll make tea.

744
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,523
You should dry yourself off first.

745
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,801
Buttons.

746
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,723
Shirt off?

747
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,934
Fasten them.

748
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:19,065
You already saw everything.
Why are you acting so shy?

749
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,943
I didn't even see anything.

750
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,697
Go dry off. You'll catch a cold.

751
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,159
Why are you being so shy?

752
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,495
You're too cute.

753
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,123
I'm not.

754
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,586
I can't leave you alone

755
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,422
if you're this endearing.

756
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,260
It's your fault.

757
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,931
-Please relax and have some.
-Yes, ma'am.

758
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:34,932
Thank you.

759
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,227
You must be wondering

760
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,771
why I called you.

761
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:42,982
Yes.

762
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,276
May I ask why?

763
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,027
I hear you're an ambitious man.

764
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,156
Career-wise? Yes, very much so.

765
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,700
That's why I work for Mr. Gu.

766
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,619
And I'm the only one
who can deal with that personality of his.

767
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,000
Mr. No, you're with me from now on.

768
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:07,423
Make sure you report
everything related to Mr. Gu to me.

769
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,804
Thenâ€¦

770
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,640
what do you mean by everything?

771
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,600
Everything.

772
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,978
From his professional life
to his personal life.

773
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:24,482
Report everything back to me.
Do not leave anything out.

774
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,113
Let me have another sip of coffee.

775
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,871
In that case,

776
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,415
how high can I go

777
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,709
by helping you?

778
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,680
Hello.

779
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,655
-What are you doing?
-My gosh.

780
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,657
Make some noise when you come in!

781
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,160
I have to go to a reunion,

782
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,996
so I came to find something I could wear.

783
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,541
What do you do with your paycheck?

784
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,961
Don't be so cheap and buy some clothes.

785
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,837
These are ancient. My gosh.

786
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,257
Why are you going through my closet?

787
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,801
Family is supposed to share.

788
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,095
Family is supposed to have some privacy.

789
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,805
Mom, I'm hungry.

790
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,557
Auntie Da-eul will make something.

791
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,393
Da-eul, please make a snack for Tae-ri.

792
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,562
What?

793
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,818
-Here.
-You work at a duty-free shop.

794
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,153
They don't have to be name-brand,

795
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,698
but none of these are good enough.

796
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,034
I'll just wear these.

797
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,537
-Bye Da-eul.
-What?

798
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,705
Hey, wait.

799
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,707
What about Tae-ri?
Aren't you going to take him?

800
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,125
You're here. Why should I?

801
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,919
I'll be late.
Don't wait, and put him to sleep.

802
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,879
What? Bo-mi!

803
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,765
You're going to wake Tae-ri.

804
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,394
Bo-mi went too far this time.

805
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,980
You need to talk to her.

806
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,982
She snuck in here quietly

807
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,109
and took my clothes, shoes, and bag.

808
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,695
And the room was a mess too.

809
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,780
Hey, family is supposed to share.

810
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,282
Just share with her.

811
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,576
There are manners
between family members too.

812
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,911
Don't be so cold-hearted.

813
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,371
It'll all come back to you.

814
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,414
"Cold-hearted"?

815
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,168
Has she ever babysat Cho-rong before?

816
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,629
Or has she ever even bought her a toy?

817
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,132
Your parents never gave her
pocket money or bought clothes for her.

818
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,092
Why do you want so much from people?

819
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,553
You'll be punished.

820
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,805
Punished, my foot.

821
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,099
Tell her to do as much as I do.

822
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,851
"Tell her to do as much as I do."

823
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,894
I want dinner.

824
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,563
Do I owe you dinner?

825
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,649
You can cook for yourself.

826
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,196
Goodness.

827
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,156
My son, I'm home.

828
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,282
You're home.

829
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,409
-Grandma!
-Hey.

830
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,869
Start cooking. I'm hungry.

831
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,497
We have beef, right?

832
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,623
Grill some of that.

833
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,626
And if we have mackerel,
grill some of that too.

834
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,170
I don't have an appetite these days.

835
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,924
Make some spicy soybean paste stew too.

836
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,052
Okay, coming right up.

837
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,387
Have you had dinner?

838
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,180
I'm starving.

839
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,274
Oh dear.

840
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,444
Go lay in bed. The floor is cold.

841
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,988
I can't be bothered.

842
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,366
I don't want to move an inch.

843
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,036
Don't you ever get married.

844
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,956
You always nagged me to get married.

845
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,126
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

846
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,545
Just date and enjoy your life.

847
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,172
You have no idea how precious it is

848
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,091
to have the freedom

849
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,719
to eat when you want,
to lie down when you want,

850
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,847
and to do nothing at all.

851
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:26,932
What's wrong?

852
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,275
I went and checked myself,

853
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,985
but it wasn't in the room.

854
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,779
Could you please check one last time?

855
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,116
My daughter can't sleep without that doll.

856
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,701
I'm so sorry.

857
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,494
If we do end up finding it,

858
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,580
we'll call you immediately.

859
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,961
If it's all right with you,
may I look one more time?

860
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,631
If the room inspection team says
it's not there, then it's not there.

861
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,342
It could've been tucked away
in the sheets,

862
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,760
so I'll visit the linen room.

863
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,888
Will you really do that?

864
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,682
Yes, but it might take some time.

865
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,100
Is that all right?

866
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,853
Yes, it's fine. We can wait.

867
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,607
What does the doll look like?

868
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,608
She's Jenny.

869
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,651
She's my friend.

870
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,612
Please find her for me.

871
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,280
She's a stuffed rabbit.

872
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,200
Yes, I'll try to find it
as quickly as possible.

873
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,110
Who's she?

874
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,613
She's from King the Land.

875
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,366
She's looking for a doll
a girl lost in one of the rooms.

876
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,700
What about room inspection?

877
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,494
They said they didn't see it,

878
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,080
but she's been at it for half an hour
trying to find it.

879
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,425
Excuse me.

880
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,348
Hello.

881
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,850
I was wondering who you were.

882
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,144
How are you going to find that here?

883
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,230
Room inspection searched for it,

884
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,691
so tell her you'll call
if we find it later.

885
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,818
She said the doll is her dear friend.

886
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,736
Please let me look just once more.

887
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,665
Ms. Kim.

888
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,043
There was a question I wanted to ask.

889
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,797
Could you grant me your time
whenever you're free?

890
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,180
Sure.

891
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,349
Thank you.

892
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,119
-Jenny!
-Ta-da.

893
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,753
Thank you.

894
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,754
Sure.

895
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,719
You must know that
you shouldn't make promises to guests.

896
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,971
What if you can't find it
after saying you will?

897
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,514
How will you deal with that?

898
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,770
It seemed weirder to avoid looking at all.

899
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,189
I wasn't saying you were wrong.

900
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,108
It's just that I see hard workers

901
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,736
get in trouble more often than others.

902
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,115
It's not like anybody appreciates it.

903
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,743
But I know

904
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,412
if I gave my best or not.

905
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,250
What did you want to ask me?

906
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,293
Right.

907
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:28,256
There's a staff member
who worked here a long time ago,

908
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,843
but her personnel record is gone,
and nobody seems to know her.

909
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,599
Her name is Han Mi-so.

910
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,649
You know her, right?

911
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,532
She was my closest friend.

912
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,079
What was she like?

913
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,168
She was braver than anyone.

914
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,421
Such a beautiful woman.

915
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,298
She was a great person.

916
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,262
What a relief.

917
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,639
Did you hope she would be a great person?

918
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,476
Yes.

919
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,317
You seem like a great person too,
Ms. Cheon.

920
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:32,821
Thank you.

921
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,092
My gosh.

922
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,302
Did I keep you waiting?

923
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:56,928
No.

924
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,432
Did you run here? Where's your car?

925
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,226
There was too much traffic, so I ran.

926
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:04,978
You must be tired.

927
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,942
Is something going on? You look happy.

928
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,694
Of course I'm happy.

929
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,448
It's the first time you asked me out
and waited for me.

930
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,326
-Is that so?
-That is so.

931
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,995
I always waited for you.

932
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:25,749
I asked you out to dinner first

933
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,420
and suggested we go somewhere first.

934
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,258
That's why I'll ask you today.

935
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,093
I want to go somewhere.

936
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,222
-Let's go.
-You won't ask where it is?

937
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,265
It doesn't matter where.

938
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,142
Where are you going?

939
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:46,895
To get my car.

940
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,064
I'll go with you.

941
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,160
Should I step on it?

942
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,787
Sounds great.

943
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,294
Did you want to see the sea?

944
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,004
No.

945
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,089
I wanted to see my mom.

946
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,093
I came to the sea with Grandma

947
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,137
whenever I missed her.

948
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,475
It felt like my mom was there
at the end of the horizon.

949
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,147
It breaks my heart to thinkâ€¦

950
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,359
you came here with that heart.

951
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,070
It's all in the past.

952
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:25,076
One day, that wind turbine
was suddenly installed there.

953
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,748
I was a young girl then,
so it looked like a huge pinwheel.

954
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,417
I thought it'd be big enough

955
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,755
to fly me to where my mom was.

956
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,176
But it wasn't like
I could walk on the sea.

957
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,178
So I was about to turn around.

958
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,849
Then suddenly,
a trail appeared between the sea,

959
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,768
just like now.

960
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,691
It felt like my wish came true.

961
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,196
I couldn't actually meet my mom,

962
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,199
but after that day,

963
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:08,078
this trail forever became
the trail that leads to her.

964
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,292
Will you come with me?

965
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,340
Yes.

966
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,075
They say you can go anywhere

967
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,536
if there's a trail in your heart.

968
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,449
Ms. Kim Ok-ja

969
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,160
who works in the linen room

970
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,245
was her old friend, and she gave it to me.

971
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,918
I heard she was a brave, beautiful woman.

972
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,756
And she was a great person.

973
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,887
You should meet Ms. Kim
once we get back to Seoul.

974
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,896
I don't want you
to have any regrets like I do.

975
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,676
INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS

976
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,512
UNCONTESTED DIVORCE FORM

977
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,180
SIGNED: YOON SEONG-HUN

978
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,974
I told you to stop.

979
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,767
Avoiding it won't make it go away.

980
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,727
I never avoided it.

981
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,396
It's just not worth my while.

982
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,857
Go now.

983
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,024
I'm busy.

984
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,235
Let's not turn this into a lawsuit.

985
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,779
The news won't do us good.

986
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,865
I said not now.

987
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,366
Well, it has to be now for me.

988
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,993
Do you have to do this?

989
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,035
Please sign it.

990
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,839
JI-HU

991
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,342
Mom's busy right now.

992
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,677
I'll call you back.

993
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,971
What?

994
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,602
-Ji-hu.
-Mom!

995
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,312
Why did you come?

996
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,522
Because I missed you so much.

997
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,649
This is an important time.

998
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,651
Why are you adding to this too?

999
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,863
At the very least,
can't you not worry me either?

1000
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,364
Is that so difficult?

1001
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,783
I'm sorry.

1002
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,169
If you're sorry, go back.

1003
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,796
Go back and live your life.

1004
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,882
That's what you can do for me.

1005
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,592
Okay.

1006
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,024
These look great.

1007
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,236
My friend got these on her flight,
and they were delicious.

1008
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,446
I asked her for another one to share here.

1009
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,447
Try some.

1010
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,658
You're so considerate. Thank you.

1011
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,205
It's good.

1012
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,916
Yes, it's not too sweet.
It should be perfect with coffee.

1013
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,209
Right?

1014
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,255
Take a seat.

1015
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,716
Sa-rang.

1016
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,219
Have you heard of the Dream Team?

1017
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,054
No, I've never heard of it.

1018
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,766
What's the highest position
a concierge can hold here

1019
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,142
that you know of?

1020
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,395
Us, King the Land.

1021
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,147
The Dream Team is above that.

1022
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,026
Really? What does that team do?

1023
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,487
That team carries out
Chairman Gu's personal events.

1024
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,407
It's basically a fancy catering service
at his command.

1025
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,577
How do you always phrase it
to sound more vulgar?

1026
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,704
Why? I'm right.

1027
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,415
Only the best among the best are chosen.

1028
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,792
While most don't know such a team exists,

1029
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,420
for those in the know,
it's a dream to join.

1030
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,713
Hence, the Dream Team.

1031
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,049
He has an event this weekend,

1032
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,843
and his secretary called

1033
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,052
asking you to join.

1034
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,222
Hey, Sa-rang.

1035
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,099
It's your debut in the Dream Team.

1036
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,602
You're a big shot now, Sa-rang. Congrats.

1037
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,395
Thank you.

1038
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,565
I'm still not sure what this is,

1039
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,567
but I'll do my best not to be a nuisance.

1040
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,777
-Congrats.
-I'm happy for you.

1041
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,712
Where are we going?

1042
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,798
Are you Cheon Sa-rang?

1043
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:36,924
Your first time?

1044
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,384
Yes, ma'am.

1045
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,971
I'm with the secretary's office,
the manager of the Dream Team.

1046
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,307
You must abide by your NDA.

1047
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,268
Don't ask questions or get curious.

1048
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,020
Let's keep it classy.

1049
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,314
Yes, ma'am.

1050
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,661
The aprons look insane, right?

1051
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,622
I'm afraid I might get
a kimchi stain on it.

1052
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,583
I'd be grateful if it got splashed on me.

1053
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,669
What if it splashed to the chairman?

1054
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,088
The thought alone is terrifying.

1055
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,134
It does look quite classy,

1056
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,263
but it somehow reminds me
of a maid's attire.

1057
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,100
Dresses won't turn us into princesses.

1058
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,978
Let's be grateful
that we get to put on expensive aprons.

1059
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,125
Do you know why we're the Dream Team?

1060
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,334
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1061
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:57,922
The Dream Team
has never made a mistake in our service.

1062
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,341
And of course,
that will also be the case today.

1063
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,968
Keep your faces classy

1064
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,553
and your acts elegant.

1065
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,389
We create our own dignity.

1066
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,308
Now, let us get started.

1067
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,185
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1068
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:20,319
We're in a war,
so you either eat or get eaten.

1069
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,863
We have no time to look away.

1070
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,614
Stop talking nonsense.

1071
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,533
Do you want to make a bet

1072
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,535
and see if this is nonsense or not?

1073
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,786
Goodness.

1074
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:29,746
Dad.

1075
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,293
Oh.

1076
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,297
Let us serve the meal.

1077
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,506
Yes, sure.

1078
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,497
It's Ms. Best Talent.

1079
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,790
It's been a while.

1080
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,128
Hello, have you been well, sir?

1081
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,548
If she's titled the Best Talent,

1082
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,717
she must be very talented.

1083
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,387
Not at all.

1084
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,556
He's just being generous.

1085
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,143
Then let us serve the soup first.

1086
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,269
Yes.

1087
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,314
It's already been decided,
so there's no need to drag this out.

1088
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,982
Won, now that your position is settled,

1089
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,401
marry Yu-ri within the year
before it's too late.

1090
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:12,014
KING THE LAND

1091
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,842
The person you have called is unavailableâ€¦

1092
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,428
I'll keep this short. End it.

1093
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,305
It's going to be a head-to-head battle.

1094
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,016
Is there a reason
why you can't give up on the hotel?

1095
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,353
You will be on special duty.

1096
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,064
You won't be working
in King the Land for the time being.

1097
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,276
I'll take care of it.

1098
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,569
It's my problem.

1099
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,571
It's up to me to decide my future.

1100
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:16,829
