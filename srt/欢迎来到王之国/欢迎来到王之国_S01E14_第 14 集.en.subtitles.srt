00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,399
As long as you feel at ease now.

3
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,194
Thank you

4
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,822
for bringing me all the way here.

5
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,465
Yes.

6
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,925
They're together.

7
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,594
The photos will look nice.

8
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,845
Don't worry.

9
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,639
I always protect my informants.

10
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,184
EPISODE 14

11
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,652
It's Tiger Balm.

12
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,363
Apply it to alleviate any type of pain.

13
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,126
That's nice.

14
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,756
Mr. Han, you should try this.

15
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,926
It's from Won. It's nice and cooling.

16
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,011
-Sir.
-Yes?

17
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,930
The media wish to report on Mr. Gu Won.

18
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,348
They should.

19
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,058
Of course they should.

20
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,770
For the first time in Korea,
our hotel will launch a global chain.

21
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,231
They won't find a better story than that.

22
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,150
It's not that.

23
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,442
It's a love scandal.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,403
-Love scandal?
-Yes.

25
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,327
Chairman Han
must have leaked the story first.

26
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,579
It's all right.

27
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,540
They'll get married soon.

28
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,417
That's not the story.

29
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,086
Please take a look.

30
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,346
3RD-GEN CHAEBOL'S SECRET LOVE AFFAIR,
KING HOTEL SUCCESSOR AND ORDINARY WOMAN

31
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,932
It'll be published online soon.

32
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,894
Stop it immediately.

33
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,062
Offer to buy ads
or threaten to pull them out.

34
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,814
Stop it at any cost.

35
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,857
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,906
He'll offer to buy ads
or threaten to pull them out,

37
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,617
but I'll double
whatever my father proposes.

38
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,036
So publish the article.

39
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,548
Doesn't our cafeteria taste awful
after we outsourced the catering?

40
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,716
Right?

41
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,217
When we had full-time caterers,

42
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,303
I always looked forward to lunch at work.

43
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,722
Do you come to work to eat?

44
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,683
Learn to be thankful
for getting lunch vouchers.

45
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,228
You'll only learn
once you start paying for your lunch.

46
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,145
My gosh!

47
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,855
You surprised me.

48
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,857
Why? What is it?

49
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,735
There's an article on Mr. Gu.

50
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,279
-What?
-What surprised you so much?

51
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,616
My gosh!

52
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,452
"Third-generation chaebol's
secret love affair."

53
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,997
That's a feisty title.

54
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,415
She's an ordinary woman.

55
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,126
He's in love regardless
of her social status. How cool.

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,753
I always knew he was manly.

57
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,630
It says she's ordinary,

58
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,799
but she must be
a daughter of a small business.

59
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,967
It's a different world.

60
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,593
Even so, don't you envy her?

61
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,011
Her status just skyrocketed.

62
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,096
-Yes.
-Right.

63
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,598
People like us
wouldn't even have a chance.

64
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,808
Why would you envy her?

65
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,101
Don't even dream about it.

66
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,811
We're still free to dream.

67
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,604
-Isn't that so, Sa-rang?
-Sorry?

68
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,650
Why do you ask me that?

69
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,777
Aren't I allowed to ask?

70
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,988
Everyone is too uptight.

71
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,614
But wait.

72
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,325
The woman who got blurred out

73
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,538
kind of looks like Sa-rang.

74
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,258
What do you mean?

75
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,593
No, not at all.

76
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,929
No, she reminds me of you.

77
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,056
Yes, she has a similar vibe.

78
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,684
-I think so too.
-Right?

79
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,394
-That looks like her.
-The vibe.

80
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,812
-It looks just like her.
-Yes.

81
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,105
-They do look alike.
-Yes.

82
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,398
They're similar.

83
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,191
It's not like it's a Magic Eye.

84
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,985
She's all blurred out,

85
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,945
so how could you know if I look like her?

86
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,864
-But it looks like her.
-Yes.

87
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,158
It can't be Sa-rang.

88
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,367
-Right.
-No way.

89
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,618
-I think it's her.
-Maybe.

90
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,120
Anyway, Sa-rang.

91
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,122
Where are you going?

92
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,045
To the restroom.

93
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,421
It's that way.

94
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:44,385
I feel like going to the one
that's far away over there.

95
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,138
I get it.

96
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,015
-It makes no sense.
-No.

97
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,391
-It's her.
-It's nonsense.

98
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,825
Are you busy? Were you leaving?

99
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,672
Did you see it?

100
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,382
Yes, just now.

101
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,967
I got worried,

102
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,844
so I was coming over.

103
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,933
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

104
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,186
Did we do something wrong?

105
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,815
No, not at all.

106
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,316
Exactly.

107
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,568
It's nothing wrong, so don't be sorry.

108
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,363
But the article went out.

109
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,948
Are you okay?

110
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:50,952
Yes.

111
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,497
I'm not sure yet. I'm still out of it.

112
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:59,335
But I came to tell you I'm fine
and that you shouldn't worry.

113
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,214
You were worried about me?

114
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,760
Of course. You're the one I love the most.

115
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,016
If something ever happens again,

116
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,311
don't hesitate to come find me,
just as you did now.

117
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,814
If you can't come, you can call me.

118
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,608
If I do, will you come over right away?

119
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,818
Of course I will.

120
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,987
I'll run over right away.

121
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,406
Whenever it is, wherever you are.

122
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,453
Mr. Gu, this is bad!

123
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,080
My gosh, things are worse in here.

124
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,748
Sa-rang, you were here.

125
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,500
Knock first. This isn't your office.

126
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,796
Why are you two here together
in the midst of this turmoil?

127
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,423
Only I get the urgency.

128
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,884
-I get it, so leave for a moment.
-No.

129
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,845
I can't. This is a total emergency.

130
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,888
I'll go.

131
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,389
I have to go back to my shift.

132
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,226
Goodbye, Mr. Yoo.

133
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,312
I mean, Mr. No.

134
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,396
Okay, thanks.

135
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,901
Please take a seat.

136
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,196
What's happened has happened,

137
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,740
so our priority
is to resolve this scandal wisely.

138
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,742
Such a term only applies to gossip.

139
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,328
This isn't a scandal. These were facts.

140
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,371
Anyway,

141
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,916
make sure Sa-rang's identity
isn't revealed.

142
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,667
I don't care about me,

143
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,252
-but she must be protected.
-Yes.

144
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,754
I met with the head of the PR team.

145
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,672
They'll do whatever they can

146
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,050
to make sure
there aren't more articles on this.

147
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,135
You don't have to worry about that.

148
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,596
The problem is
that this won't be the end of it.

149
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,557
What do you mean?

150
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,727
Why was this article released
at this point in time?

151
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,021
I kept thinking about it

152
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,316
and concluded that it had to be Ms. Gu.

153
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,536
-No Sang-sik.
-Yes.

154
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,332
Don't jump to conclusions
unless you're sure.

155
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,834
I said it because
I have reason to be suspicious.

156
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,128
A few days ago,

157
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,255
Ms. Gu

158
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,298
summoned me.

159
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,056
Mr. No, you're with me from now on.

160
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,018
Make sure you report
everything related to Mr. Gu to me.

161
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,691
What do you mean by everything?

162
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,067
Everything.

163
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,071
From his professional life
to his personal life.

164
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,657
Report everything back to me.
Do not leave anything out.

165
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,702
In that case,

166
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,204
how high can I go by helping you?

167
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,043
How's head manager?

168
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,298
Doesn't that sound like a good deal?

169
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,259
Head manager?

170
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,053
That's nowhere near enough.

171
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,722
What?

172
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,559
I thought you'd offer to make me
president of a subsidiary company.

173
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,395
The head manager's position isn't enough

174
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,398
for me to betray my friend.

175
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,153
That trivial friendship?

176
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,239
To me,

177
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,327
he's too good of a friend
to call him trivial.

178
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,330
I'll pretend I never heard this.

179
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,040
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,465
She offered me your job

181
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,508
if I reported on your personal life.

182
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,844
When I wasn't shaken,

183
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,096
I suppose

184
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,807
she had someone else dig up dirt on you.

185
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,533
Why didn't you accept it?

186
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,204
Exactly. I should've accepted it.

187
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,414
I was just too loyal.

188
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,750
You lost that great chance
over some loyalty?

189
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,669
Exactly, it was a huge miscalculation.

190
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,170
I must be insane.

191
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,963
No Sang-sik, you crazy man. You fool.

192
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,632
You should've accepted it.

193
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,175
I must be crazy.

194
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,177
Thanks.

195
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,096
Sorry?

196
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,972
Forget it if you missed it.

197
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,016
"Thanks." I heard you.

198
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,771
I can't believe I lived long enough
to hear you thank me.

199
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,815
I knew it.

200
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,691
Isn't love great?

201
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,360
Good grief. Get out of here.

202
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,822
I will, but promise me one thing.

203
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,116
Once you become the president,

204
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,909
make me the head manager.

205
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,078
Of course, I know you'll do that.

206
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,183
Okay.

207
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,354
And Mr. Gu?

208
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,940
I'm more grateful.

209
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,876
He told you not to worry,

210
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,752
that the PR team will stop this.

211
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,546
Yes, he did.

212
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,506
It'll be fine, right?

213
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,842
The PR team of a major firm
must be well-equipped.

214
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,927
-They'll handle it.
-Of course.

215
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,221
Preventing articles
isn't a big deal for them.

216
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,016
What is this?

217
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,851
Why? What is it?

218
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:52,980
Oh my gosh.

219
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,736
"King Group's second Cinderella."

220
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,696
"Will the tragic love story

221
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,823
repeat itself?"

222
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,618
Let me see.

223
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,663
"Chairman Gu Il-hun married

224
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,541
a regular employee of his company,
but it ended in a divorce."

225
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,920
"His son, Head Manager Gu Won,
embarks on the same journey."

226
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,714
"His father's romance didn't end happily."

227
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,342
"Will his son be able
to turn this into a happy ending?"

228
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,139
Who wrote this article?

229
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,184
Is something wrong?

230
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,185
No.

231
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,312
I love it.

232
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,147
I wrote the draft.

233
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,732
It's getting lots of attention.

234
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,361
Release more articles
to keep the public's interest aroused.

235
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,071
That family's history

236
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,990
is quite interesting.

237
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,078
I mean, Reporter.

238
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,330
You can't publish her photo
without permission!

239
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,748
She has her portrait rights!

240
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,000
Another article just popped up.

241
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:55,960
Me?

242
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,920
I told you I'm her friend.

243
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,505
Her best friend.

244
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,382
I'm stepping in because she's a friend!

245
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,342
Water, please.

246
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,010
Okay.

247
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,055
How many pictures did they take?

248
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:15,521
You can't upload unblurred photos
of an ordinary person like this.

249
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,064
You need to take it down now.

250
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,524
We won't condone this!

251
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,485
No way.

252
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,112
It's still on the main page.

253
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,781
He's not even a celebrity.

254
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,075
Why are these articles flooding out?

255
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,494
It seems like a bigger deal
than celebrity news.

256
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,956
A story like this
is easy to get the people gossiping.

257
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,002
Anyway,

258
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,004
I wonder if he's okay.

259
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,048
Who? Mr. Exclamation Mark?

260
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,342
Yes.

261
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,094
Excuse me.

262
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,679
You should worry about yourself.

263
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,764
You're the one in a pickle right now.

264
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,392
Well, why should I worry?

265
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,768
It's already out there.

266
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,479
-Worrying won't change anything.
-But this is a relief.

267
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,273
The photos look great.

268
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,108
Yes, they do.

269
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,860
It's like a scene from a drama.

270
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,404
Guys, is that so important to you
in this situation?

271
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,657
Hey, people are going on and on
about how you're a Cinderella.

272
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,451
It'd be worse if they bashed your looks.

273
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,827
Sure, they'll insult you anyway,

274
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,787
so one less insult is better.

275
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,748
Why should I be insulted?

276
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,626
Is dating someone
something to be insulted over?

277
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,836
People feel sour when someone does better.

278
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,505
They're probably already
betting on when you'll break up.

279
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,590
She's right.

280
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,926
It's easy to sympathize
with someone worse off,

281
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,553
but it's not easy to applaud
someone better off.

282
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,804
Yes.

283
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,932
On that note,

284
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,600
let's give a round of applause!

285
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,517
Congrats.

286
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,061
Congrats.

287
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,858
I'm glad I have you two
who will gladly applaud me.

288
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,030
KING GROUP'S SECOND CINDERELLA?!

289
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,368
Stay away from social media for a while.

290
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,745
-And don't read the comments.
-Right.

291
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,247
Don't mind
what these nameless strangers say.

292
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,333
Yes, okay.

293
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,199
What do you want for lunch?

294
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,159
-Black bean noodles?
-I'm on a diet.

295
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,956
That's her, right? Mr. Gu's girl.

296
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,916
She's not much. Hey, you're better.

297
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,710
Of course. Don't even.

298
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,378
She has nothing on you.

299
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,180
I always knew Cheon Sa-rang
was up to no good from day one.

300
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,641
She was always flirting with him.
Look what happened.

301
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,809
Really?

302
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,270
Yes, didn't you see
her big smile with the flowers

303
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,896
at the inaugural ceremony?

304
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,856
I saw it.

305
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,150
It seemed like
she was determined to get him.

306
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,152
I feel so bad for Mr. Gu.

307
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,112
How did he end up
falling for someone like her?

308
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,739
It won't last long anyway.

309
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,741
Of course. A month at the longest.

310
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,867
Just wait and see.

311
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,621
Hey, Sa-rang.

312
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,915
Get in.

313
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,543
Hello.

314
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,014
Good for you, Sa-rang.

315
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,143
-Sorry?
-Your social status skyrocketed.

316
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,729
What's it like to be on that rocket?

317
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,316
It's not like that.

318
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,525
Don't try to pull that.

319
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,861
You approached him with a motive.

320
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,113
You can be honest with me.

321
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,698
How did you pick him up?

322
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,408
Share your secrets.

323
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,661
It's not like that.

324
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,332
Please don't make
such careless comments about my business.

325
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,376
Don't deny it.
I read everything on the news.

326
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,753
I hit on her.

327
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,927
Hello, Mr. Gu.

328
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,888
I went after her.

329
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,473
I hit on her first.

330
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,517
Well, not literally hitting.

331
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,188
So if you want to know some secrets,
you can come to me.

332
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,941
I'll give you a special lesson.

333
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,526
No, it's a misunderstanding.

334
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,736
Misunderstanding or not, remember this.

335
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,656
I'm the one who liked her first.

336
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,574
Got it?

337
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,701
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

338
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,247
Let's go.

339
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,010
From now on,
say confidently that I hit on you first.

340
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,053
Okay?

341
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,889
Let's see if you have some good moves.

342
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,975
Not everyone can do that.

343
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,727
What do you take me for?

344
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,396
I'm a very deliberate person.

345
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,523
I made a decision to go after you

346
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,275
and planned out my moves.

347
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,192
You didn't know?

348
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,819
I see.

349
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,197
Who would believe you?

351
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,699
They'll say I'm a nobody.

352
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,118
A nobody?

353
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,203
From the day I met you,

354
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,580
my world has been

355
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,082
full of you.

356
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,543
Stop it.

357
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,213
So don't say things like that.

358
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,092
I don't deserve someone like you.

359
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,139
Okay?

360
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,826
Why didn't you do your job?

361
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,036
I'm sorry, sir.

362
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,290
Tell them to write
as many articles as they want.

363
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,084
But take down all articles
that mention Won's mother.

364
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,712
Tell them that I won't let it slide

365
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,341
not just as the group,
but on a personal level.

366
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,051
Yes, sir.

367
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,720
What about Mr. Gu and Ms. Cheon?

368
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,930
What can I do?

369
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,890
They're in love.

370
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,975
-Sorry?
-Let them be.

371
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,855
They'll have to learn
that what they're doing is meaningless.

372
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,815
Yes, sir.

373
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,110
KING GROUP'S SECOND CINDERELLA.
WILL THE TRAGIC LOVE STORY REPEAT ITSELF?

374
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,793
Ro-un.

375
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,295
I got two tickets to a musical.

376
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,672
Want to go over the weekend?

377
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,257
I'm okay.

378
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,055
You know I have feelings for you, right?

379
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,560
I'm sorry. I like someone else.

380
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,896
Is it Pyeong-hwa?

381
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,443
Do I have to answer you?

382
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,738
I want to know exactly why
you're turning me down.

383
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,908
Yes, it's her.

384
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,373
As I expected.

385
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,499
Okay.

386
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,263
Have you all heard?

387
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,141
One of my colleagues got divorced,

388
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,935
but pretended she was never married
to get promoted and got busted.

389
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,270
So it caused a big scene.

390
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,565
My gosh, I can't believe
anyone would do that.

391
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,401
Do they have to go that far
just for a promotion?

392
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,488
Isn't it weirder to penalize someone
for getting divorced?

393
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,407
Divorce isn't a crime.

394
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,868
Even so, they still lied.

395
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,871
Don't they feel guilty?

396
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,706
What a fraud.

397
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,499
I can't believe that.

398
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,210
How can a team lie to each other?

399
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,964
I'm glad our team
doesn't have someone like that.

400
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,633
What? Yes we do.

401
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,844
What? On our team?

402
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,180
Really? No one knows?

403
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,442
Pyeong-hwa, you didn't tell them?

404
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,031
Wait, was your divorce a secret?

405
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,035
Oh, I'm sorry.

406
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,953
I thought everyone knew.

407
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,624
You don't have a kid though, do you?

408
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,627
Or do you?

409
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,920
Having fun?

410
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,838
Why are you so mad?

411
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,673
I was just sharing a fact.

412
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,884
It's all true.

413
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,555
And I know I was your junior,

414
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,851
but you shouldn't use that tone
to the purser.

415
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,188
This is just like you.

416
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,280
Wait.

417
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,158
Wait, Pyeong-hwa.

418
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,830
Will you please just go?

419
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,791
I'm incredibly embarrassed right now.

420
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,567
Sa-rang.

421
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,444
Yes, Ha-na.

422
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,696
You should take a break.

423
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,865
You don't have to try so hard around us.

424
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,367
No, it's all right.

425
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,451
She's right.

426
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,579
We got this. You should take a break.

427
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,538
Okay?

428
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,998
I'm fine.

429
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,416
You aren't fine.

430
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,710
This is a huge scandal.

431
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,004
Everyone talks about you
no matter where you go.

432
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,839
How could you be okay?

433
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,134
The article wasn't written properly.

434
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,143
The article was incorrect.

435
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,353
It's not a scandal.

436
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,730
It's a love story.

437
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,608
-I'm sorry, sir.
-No, I should apologize.

438
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,276
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

439
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,861
Don't say that.

440
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,032
-Please take these.
-Me?

441
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,783
Thank you.

442
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,373
Please be nice to my girlfriend.

443
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm asking you as her boyfriend,
not as the head manager.

444
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,254
Please share these.

445
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,672
Are you already helping her?

446
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,632
Hey.

447
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,967
Mr. Gu, may I share a word?

448
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,594
Yes, please.

449
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,556
Sa-rang is part of King the Land,
and she's our dear family.

450
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,475
Even without your request,

451
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,102
we'll look after her
and make sure she isn't hurt.

452
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,938
You don't have to worry so much.

453
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,358
Thank you.

454
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,487
Bye.

455
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,077
He's so cool.

456
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,454
He's such a romantic.

457
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,623
You must be so happy.

458
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,625
Even a man would fall for him.

459
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,670
-Thanks, Sa-rang.
-Thank you.

460
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,130
Thanks, Sa-rang.

461
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,924
This looks delicious.

462
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,841
It really does.

463
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,678
Did you all see the articles?

464
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,472
What do you think?

465
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,225
I thought it was quite serious.

466
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,310
It wasn't just a regular scandal.

467
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,311
She's our staff.

468
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,065
I met with a few reporters,

469
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,776
and it's highly likely
for the story to take a worse turn.

470
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,860
What do you mean?

471
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,530
That the hotel's successor…

472
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,951
is a player who seduces his staff members.

473
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,578
I agree with him.

474
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,872
No matter what the facts are,

475
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,667
this did have an impact
on the image of our hotel.

476
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,379
I even saw an awful comment that said,

477
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,757
"Is King Hotel
more like a motel for couples?"

478
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,426
We, the board of directors,

479
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,304
decided to come together

480
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,723
and oppose Mr. Gu's promotion
to president.

481
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,599
We should do that.

482
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,270
If the public doesn't approve of him,
our stock price will drop.

483
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,780
Why are you all here together?

484
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:57,866
I see.

485
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,827
You were having a meeting
without telling me.

486
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,745
Yes.

487
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,538
The hotel is in trouble.

488
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,790
So? Did the emergency meeting go well?

489
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,167
Yes.

490
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,462
The board members
have something to share with you, sir.

491
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,507
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

492
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,260
Because of Mr. Gu's recent scandal…

493
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,055
Hold that thought.
I have something to say too.

494
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,389
May I go first?

495
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,392
Yes, sir.

496
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,562
The articles…

497
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,775
were your doing, weren't they?

498
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,074
A reporter asked,

499
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,117
so I just shared the truth.

500
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,371
Did you think
this would make me disappointed in Won

501
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,123
and give everything to you?

502
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,958
Don't get ahead of yourself, Father.

503
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,754
You have caused greater damage
just for your personal gain!

504
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,172
Get your facts straight.

505
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,174
I'm not the one who damaged the hotel.

506
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,842
It's Won.

507
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:07,185
Politics suit you better
than business management.

508
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,648
You're to give up
every position you hold here

509
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,690
and leave King Hotel.

510
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,650
Father.

511
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,318
Yes, my daughter.

512
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,780
If you want to say something, go ahead.

513
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,992
This was your plan all along.

514
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,829
Everything was your son's.

515
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,624
Your honesty is way overdue.

516
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,252
If you have more to say, go ahead.

517
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,795
Like that would change anything.

518
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,132
You don't care about me anyway.

519
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,217
From a long time ago until now,

520
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,303
you've never cared about me,
not even once.

521
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,242
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT
GU HWA-RAN

522
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,288
-Hello, Ms. Hwa-ran.
-Where's Dad?

523
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,748
He's on the second floor.

524
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,924
Good job.

525
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,510
Now pass it to your mom. Okay.

526
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,847
All right! Good.

527
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,765
-Go.
-Nice.

528
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,349
You can do it this time, Won.

529
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,934
You shoot this time.

530
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,270
-Go, Won.
-It's my turn to block you.

531
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,480
Looking good.

532
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,358
Shoot! Great!

533
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,735
-Won, head it.
-Pass!

534
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,069
-Head it!
-Head it!

535
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,030
Nice job.

536
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,782
I'm going to score, okay?

537
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,033
Get ready.

538
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,118
Block it, Won. That's right.

539
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,078
Why don't you try shooting?

540
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,455
Hey, it's a goal!

541
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,751
Great job.

542
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,046
Well done.

543
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,841
Honey.

544
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,705
Grandma, we're here.

545
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,751
You two aren't even married.

546
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,294
-Don't say "we."
-Ma'am.

547
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,546
Your grandson-in-law is here.

548
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,714
You're here.

549
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,925
Grandson-in-law candidate number one.

550
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,637
Our relationship got on the news,
so please leave out "candidate."

551
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,138
That's what you want.

552
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,307
Why are you in such high spirits?

553
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,476
Looks like you're the one
who published them.

554
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,769
No.

555
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,563
It wasn't me.

556
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,856
I know you did that

557
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,108
to tell everyone
because I wouldn't approve.

558
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,652
I'm not that crafty.

559
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,529
You already know he wouldn't.

560
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,448
Goodness, you're already taking his side?

561
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,867
Do you like him that much?

562
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,077
My gosh.

563
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,579
Look at you.

564
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,331
Come this way.

565
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,221
If you ever make Sa-rang cry,

566
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,182
I'm going to kill you.

567
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,352
That will be the last day of your life,

568
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,813
so remember that.

569
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,401
I will never let that happen

570
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,028
and be good to her.

571
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,991
Stop smiling.

572
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,701
Don't. You might grow on me.

573
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,828
What should I begin with?

574
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,204
Peeling onions?

575
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,083
If you're dying to help,
get changed first.

576
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,086
-Yes.
-I saw a car parked outside.

577
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,588
Is your rich grandson-in-law…

578
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,466
He is here.

579
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,929
I had no idea
you were such an established man.

580
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,222
I should've noticed back then.

581
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,515
One moment.

582
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,976
Have one. Drink up.

583
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,312
Thank you.

584
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,565
He's here.

585
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,359
Do you even have to ask?

586
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,111
Our town's rich grandson-in-law.

587
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,077
Please take this.

588
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,913
Sa-rang is such a big shot now.

589
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,414
Okay.

590
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,874
Take a nice picture.

591
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,043
-A photo?
-Yes.

592
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,504
Why do you want a picture?

593
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,089
He's just a candidate.

594
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,966
Candidate or not,

595
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,969
it's my first time
seeing a chaebol in real life.

596
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,930
-Take it.
-Just one?

597
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,182
One, two, three.

598
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,101
-Okay.
-One more.

599
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,852
Just take one. We're all waiting.

600
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,729
Yes, one per person.

601
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,940
You know me, right?
The ginseng chicken soup.

602
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,066
Yes.

603
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,485
Give me your autograph.
I'll put it on the wall.

604
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,945
I don't have an autograph.

605
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,364
It's simple. Write out
three syllables of your name.

606
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,366
-Come on.
-I only have two syllables.

607
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,867
Yes, two.

608
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,705
And write down, "The soup is savory

609
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,665
and the meat is amazing."

610
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,791
Just do it.

611
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,836
-"The soup is…"
-Savory.

612
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,878
The meat is amazing.

613
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,213
"The meat is…"

614
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,924
-He's so handsome.
-His penmanship is impressive too.

615
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,676
-Okay, a selfie.
-Me too.

616
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,927
You look great.

617
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,639
-My gosh.
-My turn.

618
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,349
-Mine too.
-Give me one too.

619
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,559
Your autograph.

620
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,518
Sign here.

621
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,103
-Write "I love you."
-Here.

622
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,104
Aunties.

623
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,480
That's enough.

624
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,983
Then you should line up.

625
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,234
-Do one for me.
-Me too.

626
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,653
What autograph?

627
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,658
Why are you frowning?

628
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,577
Let's make the picture look good.

629
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,038
Do it quickly.
I have to open for business.

630
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,581
One, two.

631
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,208
-I'm taking it.
-Okay.

632
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,888
Move aside.

633
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,893
As soon as I get a job, it's over for you.

634
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,146
You should've been good to Mom
while she was nice.

635
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,356
You reap what you sow.
It's your punishment.

636
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,903
-Where did you learn those words?
-You always said that to Mom.

637
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:33,821
Dad.

638
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,490
You should wipe that place too.

639
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,617
Make it look sparkling clean.

640
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,499
Darn it!

641
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,375
There's no end to these chores!

642
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,127
That's the thing with chores.

643
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,922
Your work doesn't really show,
and no one gives you credit.

644
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,216
What are you doing?

645
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,842
Cho-rong told you to wipe there.

646
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,057
Cho-rong, Grandma is home.

647
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,141
Mom.

648
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,061
-Mom.
-What's going on?

649
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,772
Why is my son holding a rag?

650
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,108
You're home, Mother.

651
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,692
Forget your greetings.

652
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,946
Why is the head of this household
holding a rag in his hand?

653
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,740
I can't believe
I lived long enough to see this nonsense.

654
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,909
I must've lived for too long.

655
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,077
Good grief.

656
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,038
This house is such a mess.

657
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,168
Father, Mother,
I have something to say to you.

658
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,503
As if.

659
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,088
-Gosh.
-I want coffee.

660
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,966
Red ginseng honey tea
for Father and Mother.

661
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,552
Look at her.

662
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,305
My son

663
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,183
-really did that?
-Yes.

664
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,601
Your son did that.

665
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,230
He didn't tell us that he quit his job,
used up his severance pay,

666
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,774
and even took out a loan.

667
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,485
It wasn't a loan. It was a cash advance.

668
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,612
You punk. Shut your mouth.

669
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,239
Mom, indoor golf.

670
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,574
-Nice shot!
-Right.

671
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,367
He even played golf with that money.

672
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,744
Da-eul, listen up.

673
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,331
You are no longer our daughter-in-law.

674
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,712
You're the head of our household.

675
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,838
Dad.

676
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,798
Have you eaten?

677
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,967
Not yet.

678
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,969
The head of our household can't go hungry!

679
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,639
What are you doing?
The head of our household hasn't eaten.

680
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,849
Get cooking.

681
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,978
Me?

682
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,063
Mom!

683
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,274
Will you clean the house all day?

684
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,233
Go cook!

685
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,235
The head of the household must eat well

686
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,696
for our home to be in great condition.

687
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,743
Whatever. You do it, Mom.

688
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,412
You punk.

689
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,455
Grandma, nice shot!

690
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,458
Go make dinner!

691
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,376
Stop pestering me about food!

692
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,547
As for the hotel chain business,

693
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,091
handle every step yourself.

694
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,136
Yes, I plan on doing that.

695
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,472
Don't send your staff overseas.

696
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,265
You should go abroad yourself.

697
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,516
Yes.

698
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,727
Okay.

699
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,521
I need to get some rest.

700
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,652
Why…

701
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,279
won't you ask me anything?

702
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,244
If I do, will anything change?

703
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,664
No.

704
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,210
There are high expectations
for the chain business.

705
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,128
That also means

706
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,881
many are jealous of you.

707
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,802
Bring back good results
without making mistakes.

708
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,389
Yes, I'll do that.

709
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,267
Our best talent. Have you been well?

710
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,270
Yes, sir. Have you been well too?

711
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,731
It's always the same for me.

712
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,027
Allow me to serve your meal.

713
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,069
Okay.

714
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,084
When will your other party join you?

715
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,171
Should I warm up the rice and soup later?

716
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,173
Sit down.

717
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,342
That's your seat.

718
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,220
-Me?
-I came here to treat

719
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,056
our best talent to a meal.

720
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,892
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable?

721
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,561
No, sir.

722
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,906
You do know you're very dear to me, right?

723
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,369
Yes, sir. I'm always grateful for that.

724
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,997
I understand why Won likes you.

725
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,626
And it's scarier because of that.

726
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,592
You two aren't kids,

727
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,095
so I won't tell you to break up.

728
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,097
Instead,

729
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,226
go somewhere quiet
until things settle down.

730
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,820
Is this a request or an order?

731
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,987
It's an order

732
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,074
as the chairman of King Hotel.

733
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,333
If it's your order, I must do as you say.

734
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,171
Once you think things over away from him,

735
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:28,676
you'll realize what the best decision is.

736
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,305
I'm sorry. Let's eat.

737
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,515
It's getting cold.

738
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:04,962
My gosh.

739
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,924
-Did I keep you waiting?
-No.

740
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,304
Your face is cold.

741
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,347
I told you to wait somewhere warm.

742
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,849
The breeze was refreshing.

743
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,145
Is something going on?

744
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,441
No.

745
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,985
But you look so…

746
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,945
Why?

747
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,780
Do I look that ugly?

748
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,162
What kind of nonsense is that?

749
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,843
It's so cozy and nice.

750
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,930
I agree.

751
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,145
Anyway,

752
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,315
we can't meet for a while.

753
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,609
I have a business trip abroad.

754
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,694
For how long?

755
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,154
About three weeks.

756
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,242
That's not so bad.

757
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,451
I just said three weeks.

758
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,080
That's almost a month.
You're okay with that?

759
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,998
I already miss you to death.

760
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,086
You're leaving to work.

761
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,506
Go do a great job.

762
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:33,842
Okay.

763
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,428
I'll do my best.

764
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,515
But still,

765
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,726
since we can't meet for a while,

766
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,521
don't go home tonight.

767
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,190
What are we going to do?

768
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,572
Let's go somewhere.

769
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,242
At this hour?

770
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,994
Where?

771
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,172
See? I told you.

772
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,383
I knew it'd be closed.

773
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,885
You're right. It's closed.

774
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,430
Let's go.

775
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,640
Wait.

776
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,643
Ta-da.

777
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,827
Wait.

778
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,538
Did you rent out the entire place?

779
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,165
Wait.

780
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,666
I rented out the entire place.

781
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,587
Why? Do you not like amusement parks?

782
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,213
No, I love them!

783
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,341
It's so pretty.

784
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,217
Let's go.

785
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,595
Our night has just begun.

786
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:34,963
-Let's go.
-Go.

787
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,478
Why would anyone ride that?

788
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,814
Why would you come here
if not to go on the rides?

789
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,400
Well, you just come for the vibe.

790
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,985
What are you talking about?

791
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,405
We're already here,
so we have to go on the rides.

792
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,031
Let's go.

793
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,245
Wait, are you scared?

794
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,710
I'm a guy who doesn't know
what getting scared means.

795
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,381
-But you look scared.
-Come on.

796
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,091
I even go skydiving.

797
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,176
That's so cool. So let's go.

798
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,438
What now?

799
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,150
I thought about it,

800
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,361
and I should stay down here
to take pictures of you.

801
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,198
Don't get on if you're scared.
I can go alone.

802
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,366
Wait.

803
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,870
Let's go.

804
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,214
Not here.

805
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,852
-Are you crying?
-No.

806
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,262
Don't go on rides if you're scared.

807
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,306
I'm not scared.

808
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,975
I was just that thirsty.

809
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,978
If you go skydiving,
why are you scared of this?

810
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,147
That's very different.

811
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,984
Up there, I make the choice to jump.

812
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,363
But leaving my life
in the hands of that machine

813
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,864
is a totally different story.

814
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,950
It's different.

815
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,710
Thank you

816
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,213
for trying to do everything with me.

817
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,759
Of course I should.

818
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,887
I'll always do everything with you.

819
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,642
Good luck with your business trip.

820
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,812
If you miss me, tell me right away.

821
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,897
I'll give up everything and fly back.

822
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:39,815
Okay?

823
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,735
Don't worry about me.

824
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,571
Finish your job and take your time.

825
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,115
Okay.

826
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,744
-Let's go if you're done.
-What?

827
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,955
-Already?
-Yes.

828
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,292
-We have many more to ride.
-I'm not done yet.

829
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,961
I'm not done yet. Let's take a break.

830
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,132
Get up now.

831
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,050
Yes, ma'am!

832
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,345
Attaboy.

833
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,651
I'm on my flight.

834
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,235
I'll be back.

835
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:08,945
I love you.

836
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,625
Have a nice trip.

837
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,262
I love you too.

838
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,979
KING TOURIST HOTEL

839
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:05,228
MANAGEMENT POLICY
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

840
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,737
Hello.

841
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,074
-Bo-yeon.
-What?

842
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,576
It's you, Cheon Sa-rang.

843
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,038
-Have you been well?
-Why are you here?

844
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,124
I was appointed here.

845
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,460
Stop talking nonsense.

846
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,338
This isn't a place for people like you.

847
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,090
Who are people like me?

848
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,468
Big shots like you.

849
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,012
You made it to King the Land, didn't you?

850
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,974
Only the worst transgressors end up here.

851
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,900
Is this that…

852
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,109
Yes, you're right.

853
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:57,030
The place you can't escape
once you get in,

854
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,908
the infamous place of exile,
King Tourist Hotel.

855
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,125
Why are you here?

856
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,336
Don't ask. It breaks my heart.

857
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,256
Someone else got fired
from the room inspection team.

858
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,298
Again? Why?

859
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,591
For being fat.

860
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,094
That's why I told everyone

861
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,263
to stay out of Ms. Gu's way
when she shows up.

862
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,390
They never get the hang of it.

863
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,769
But Ms. Gu's too much too.

864
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,313
She wants to fit everyone
in a certain size.

865
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,692
Hello, ma'am!

866
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,864
Get rid of her.

867
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,411
Follow me.

868
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,505
You know that a tourist hotel
is different from a regular hotel, right?

869
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,506
Yes.

870
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,301
Hotels abide by the Public Health Act
as a lodging business,

871
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,511
but tourist hotels are
tourist accommodation businesses

872
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,638
under the Tourism Promotion Act.

873
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,473
You have the answer to everything,

874
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,142
just as you always do.

875
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,727
It's because I was taught well

876
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,563
from the very best when I began.

877
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,190
It's all thanks to you.

878
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,944
You've become good with words
while I was gone.

879
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,615
This is the lowest subsidiary
among King Group,

880
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,034
but there is one good thing
about this place.

881
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,493
Board and lodging for staff.

882
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,759
Use the bed by the window.

883
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,385
There's a uniform in the closet,

884
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,346
so get changed and come to the lobby.

885
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,348
Okay.

886
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:51,937
Sa-rang.

887
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,980
I saw the news.

888
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,152
I saw it too.

889
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:03,531
Everyone here was kicked out,
so we're like family here.

890
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,575
You don't have to worry.

891
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:19,024
CHEON SA-RANG

892
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,033
Hermès.

893
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,306
Are you okay? Is everything fine?

894
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:57,020
Pretty much, other than the fact
that my entire team knows now.

895
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,689
But you know, secrets don't last forever.

896
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,984
I was always worried
about when it would get out.

897
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,861
I think this is for the better.

898
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,113
Byeong-gu will stop blackmailing me too.

899
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,199
What about Ro-un?

900
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,453
He's just a junior.

901
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,539
What about you?

902
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,875
Is Chung-jae looking for a job?

903
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,044
No idea. He'll figure it out on his own.

904
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,089
He stopped going to indoor golf though.

905
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,341
Cho-rong says people never change,

906
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,467
but what can I do?

907
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,844
She said that?

908
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,137
Hey, she's better than me.

909
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,310
Sa-rang loves this.

910
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,603
Seriously.

911
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,231
I wonder if she's eating all right.

912
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,359
Should we call her?

913
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,861
She's too busy. She rarely picks up.

914
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,948
It's been two weeks,
and she hasn't visited Seoul.

915
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,283
She'll return soon, right?

916
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,702
No idea.

917
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,997
I have a feeling something is going on.

918
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,503
What is this?

919
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,421
Are you moving?

920
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,132
No, a business trip.

921
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,135
How long could that be
for you to pack so much?

922
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,512
I wonder. When will I come back?

923
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,057
What is it?

924
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,727
I'll be back.

925
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,688
Let's talk then.

926
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,860
She said she'd tell us
when she's back, so let's wait.

927
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,238
Right, she's not the type
who shares these things.

928
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,364
Exactly.

929
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,075
I'm sure she's troubled alone,
pretending to be fine.

930
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:39,831
Why don't we go see her?

931
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,959
-Shall we?
-Yes.

932
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,253
-When is your day off?
-What about you?

933
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,296
One second.

934
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,591
KING TOURIST HOTEL

935
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,843
You're checked in. Enjoy your stay.

936
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,224
-Sa-rang.
-Yes?

937
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,727
The restaurant needs backup
and called for help.

938
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,061
You should go.

939
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,313
All right.

940
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,288
Hey, miss!

941
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,373
Yes?

942
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,752
We stayed here for over three hours

943
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,129
and refilled our coffee twice.

944
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,422
Is there anything on the house?

945
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,925
What kind of hotel is this?

946
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,053
You didn't order anything else,
but just coffee?

947
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,012
Why?

948
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,556
Coffee is enough.
What more are you trying to sell?

949
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,518
Good grief, you charge 10,000 won

950
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,729
for this bitter coffee
just because you call yourself a hotel.

951
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,607
Where's your conscience? Isn't that so?

952
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:50,902
Exactly.

953
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:55,865
Your stomach must hurt so much
from drinking just bitter coffee.

954
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,160
I'll bring some hot water
and a few cookies in secret.

955
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:04,415
It must be because she's from Seoul.
There's some talking to her.

956
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,709
You are

957
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,795
very clever.

958
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,756
Please give me a moment.

959
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,346
I missed the smell of Seoul.

960
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,139
This is so nice.

961
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,100
Wait.

962
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,018
Are you calling Sa-rang?

963
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,311
I should tell her I'm here.

964
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,897
You're going to call her
after three weeks?

965
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,191
You should just show up and surprise her.

966
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,861
Every moment of a relationship
should be special.

967
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:37,115
How did you start dating her
without knowing a thing?

968
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,576
You can talk to me again
once you try dating.

969
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:44,539
Who says I've never dated?

970
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,087
Everyone at the hotel knows.

971
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,423
Really?

972
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,767
The person you have called is unavailable.

973
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,437
Please leave a message after the tone.

974
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,776
I arrived at the airport.

975
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,487
I miss you.

976
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,713
Hello, Mr. Gu.

977
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,215
How was your business trip?

978
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,717
Good. Where's Sa-rang?

979
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,053
She was reappointed.

980
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,682
-Reappointed?
-Yes.

981
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,517
I only heard it from my manager.

982
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,434
To where?

983
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,478
I'm not so sure.

984
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,048
Ha-na.

985
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,886
When I first came to this hotel,

986
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,598
I said something like this.

987
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,851
That from now on,

988
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:16,232
I'll make this hotel
a place without fake smiles.

989
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,113
Is that smile…

990
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:25,533
genuine?

991
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,956
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

992
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,544
We were ordered
not to share a word regarding Sa-rang.

993
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,682
Where is Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

994
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,020
Who reappointed her?

995
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,148
We do not know who reappointed her.

996
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,526
I just know
she went to King Tourist Hotel.

997
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,613
-King Tourist Hotel?
-Yes.

998
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,615
It's been about three weeks.

999
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,200
Three weeks?

1000
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,286
-Is something going on?
-No.

1001
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,580
Don't worry about me.

1002
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,707
Finish your job and take your time.

1003
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,420
Okay. Thank you.

1004
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:37,855
Won.

1005
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:27,864
Won.

1006
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,874
This…

1007
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,585
is a pocket watch.

1008
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,128
Don't lose it.

1009
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,462
Okay.

1010
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,131
Always keep it on you.

1011
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,174
Of course.

1012
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,725
Mom, what's wrong?

1013
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,477
Nothing.

1014
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,618
Won.

1015
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,246
It's me, Mom.

1016
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,353
KING THE LAND

1017
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,679
I'm sorry I'm late.

1018
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,682
You should be in King the Land.

1019
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,016
Let's go back now.

1020
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,269
Don't drive Won into a corner anymore.

1021
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,689
Let him live his life the way he wants to.

1022
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:25,940
What did you do?

1023
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:28,693
This is why you can't be loved.

1024
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,529
It is a design
that symbolizes unchanging love.

1025
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,739
I have something I want to say today.

1026
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,993
I gave her money and she left on her own.

1027
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,119
What cheap love.

1028
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:45,918
