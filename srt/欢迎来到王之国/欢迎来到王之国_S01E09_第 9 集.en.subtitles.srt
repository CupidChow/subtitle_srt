1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,089
Now.

3
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,384
This is the highlight of the meal.

4
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,574
Are you all right?

5
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,076
Are you hurt?

6
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,160
No.

7
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,832
What will you do with all these?

8
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,839
As long as you aren't hurt,

9
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,716
it's all right.

10
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,094
Do I have…

11
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,805
permission?

12
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,758
Here.

13
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,223
Gosh.

14
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,268
Here.

15
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,435
Thank you.

16
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,279
I don't know what this is,

17
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,697
but it's really good.

18
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,242
I wanted to cook the best meal for you.

19
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,245
You already did.

20
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,831
It was the best meal

21
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,875
and the best dining atmosphere of my life.

22
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,795
I'm glad you liked it.

23
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,880
I'll cook for you again.

24
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,716
I'll cook next time.

25
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,717
When?

26
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,135
Tomorrow?

27
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,803
No.

28
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,929
Then when?

29
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,393
When you look the most adorable.

30
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,147
Cheers.

31
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,494
Let's eat.

32
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,833
You must really be good at everything.

33
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,084
Of course.

34
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,879
Though I don't know what this is.

35
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,299
EPISODE 9

36
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,847
We only need 500 more dollars.

37
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,978
We're doomed.

38
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,813
We're closing soon,

39
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,899
and there's not a person in sight.

40
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,526
Ha-neul, should I just buy a bag?

41
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,072
You don't want to face legal issues.

42
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,698
Just go on a trip with those 500 dollars.

43
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,706
But it's only fun if we all go together.

44
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,875
I'll pay for a team trip
if I win the lottery.

45
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,335
You don't even buy tickets.

46
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,878
I will from now on.

47
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,631
You all went through a lot
working overtime.

48
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,008
Let's eat grilled beef intestines.
It's on me.

49
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,844
Let's wrap up now.

50
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,929
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

51
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,680
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,644
Welcome to Alanga!

53
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,230
-Welcome to Alanga!
-Welcome to Alanga!

54
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,439
Please come in!

55
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,566
-This way, please.
-What do you think of this?

56
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,776
It's the latest design.

57
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,611
Thank you.

58
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,575
Thank you. Enjoy your trip.

59
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,203
-Thank you. Enjoy your trip.
-Thank you. Enjoy your trip.

60
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:06,008
A toast to celebrate
Purser Oh Pyeong-hwa's promotion.

61
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,177
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

62
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,888
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

63
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,057
Stop it. That's enough.

64
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,142
Why?

65
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,812
Ms. Yoo said the most important criteria
for promotion was in-flight sales.

66
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,231
You had the most sales
and our team came in first.

67
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,400
-There's no doubt about it.
-Of course.

68
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,193
You've been through a lot.

69
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,780
Purser Oh, once you're promoted,

70
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,615
don't forget about us and help us out.

71
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,075
I'll swear my allegiance.

72
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,660
That's enough.

73
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,995
I told you to stop.

74
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,331
Ma'am, over here!

75
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,542
Hello.

76
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,545
What took you so long?

77
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,922
We were so bored without you.

78
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,757
Seems like you were having fun.

79
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,217
You're better off without this old-timer.

80
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,261
Goodness. Why would you say that?

81
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,931
-Sit over here, ma'am.
-Thank you.

82
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,309
-One draft beer, please.
-Coming right up.

83
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,480
You all worked so hard.

84
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,400
Especially the major contributor,
Ms. Oh Pyeong-hwa, who carried our team

85
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,027
from last to first.

86
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,280
Why don't we give her a round of applause?

87
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,452
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

88
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,121
It's thanks to you all

89
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,998
that our team was able to rank first.

90
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,502
This is a token of my appreciation.

91
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,923
I feel bad receiving this
when everyone worked so hard.

92
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,633
You have every right to receive it.

93
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,176
Treat yourself.

94
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,095
Thank you. I'll use it well.

95
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,556
Now for the highlight of the evening.

96
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,642
I have an important announcement to make.

97
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,521
Someone among us
will be promoted to purser.

98
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,149
Drumroll, please.

99
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,734
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION,
OH PYEONG-HWA

100
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,403
Congratulations on your promotion.

101
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,614
You've worked so hard, Mi-na.

102
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:56,953
Me?

103
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,371
Here's your purser scarf.

104
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,584
Thank you.

105
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,921
I'll do my best. Thank you.

106
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,423
Purser Hwang, congratulations.

107
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,801
Thank you.

108
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,346
This is amazing.

109
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,308
As expected, it looks good on you.

110
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,313
-Don't bash me
-Don't bash me

111
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,025
-Saying I'm a cruel woman
-Saying I'm a cruel woman

112
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,112
-It was for you
-It was for you

113
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,740
That I chose to break up…

114
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,536
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,621
How can I dare surpass you

116
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,251
when you're my senior by many years?

117
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,212
It's okay.

118
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,797
You don't have to worry about me.

119
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,550
You did a great job. Congratulations.

120
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,471
Cut the nonsense about being okay.

121
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,472
You must be jealous.

122
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,102
If you're jealous,
just say you're jealous.

123
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,146
The nonchalance
makes you look more pathetic.

124
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,439
Stop drinking.

125
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,940
You're drunk.

126
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,693
That's why you should've tried harder.

127
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,696
It's such a happy day for me

128
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,617
but I'm walking on eggshells around you.

129
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,037
You're making me feel sorry for no reason.

130
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,372
What is this?

131
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,124
How uncomfortable.

132
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,522
What are you doing out here in the cold?

133
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,485
You'll catch a cold.

134
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,196
Thanks.

135
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,751
Are you okay?

136
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,004
No.

137
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,215
I'm not.

138
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,884
I feel so embarrassed…

139
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,429
for getting my hopes up.

140
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,848
Pyeong-hwa.

141
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,893
Do you remember what you said before?

142
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,522
"I just like flying."

143
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,861
I did.

144
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,739
And I still do.

145
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,575
I heard that people confuse

146
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,412
what they want to do
with what they want to become.

147
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,875
Wasn't it your dream
to be a part of beautiful flights?

148
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,254
If I become a purser,

149
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,215
wouldn't my flights become more beautiful?

150
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,175
You're already amazing.

151
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,180
I want to become
a good flight attendant like you.

152
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,683
Like me?

153
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,811
Think about everything that's happened.

154
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,062
Look at me right now.

155
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,730
I am looking.

156
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,858
I always have.

157
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,570
You always try your best
to help passengers

158
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,572
have a safe and comfortable flight.

159
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,699
Being the best flight attendant

160
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,660
is much better

161
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,620
than becoming a purser.

162
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,588
Thanks.

163
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,173
It's not that comforting,

164
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,009
but I'll try to cheer up.

165
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,902
Let's walk.

166
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,044
Why did you want to walk today?

167
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,087
Isn't it great today?

168
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,256
The weather's so nice
and I'm in a good mood.

169
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,716
-There need to be days like this.
-How strange.

170
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,012
What is this refreshing smell?

171
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,723
-Did you spray cologne?
-Not "smell."

172
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,808
"Scent."

173
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,809
Scent.

174
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,810
Perfume.

175
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,520
Jeez.

176
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,896
Why do you care?

177
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,815
-Hello, sir.
-Yes, hello.

178
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,317
Mr. Gu.

179
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,570
He's the longest-working employee
at King Hotel.

180
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,529
Thirty years.

181
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,033
-Once you leave, make a left.
-Okay.

182
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,410
He is amazing.

183
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,083
Thirty years?

184
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,752
What's wrong?

185
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,256
It's nothing.

186
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,053
Hello.

187
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,346
It's a good morning.

188
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,514
Yes.

189
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,932
It is a good morning.

190
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,393
Today is going to be a good day.

191
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,272
"It's a good morning"?

192
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,625
Don't.

193
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,302
What's this?

194
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,553
Why do you look so happy?

195
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,014
You're mistaken.

196
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,558
No, I'm not. There's definitely something.

197
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,393
Right, Sa-rang?

198
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,937
I'm not sure.

199
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,855
Face forward.

200
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,273
Why are you not sure?

201
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,441
That's strange.

202
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,003
Something's off.

203
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,255
You're grinning from ear to ear.
You look crazy.

204
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,590
Cut the nonsense.

205
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,883
Get off.

206
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,642
-Why aren't you getting off?
-I'll accompany you.

207
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,769
I can go by myself.

208
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,521
I don't want to send you alone.

209
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,319
People can see us.

210
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,321
Then I can just cover our hands.

211
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,409
They can't see now.

212
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,756
Only up to here.

213
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,882
No further.

214
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,263
Fine.

215
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,514
I'm only allowing it this once.

216
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,890
You can't do this next time.

217
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,476
Okay.

218
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,990
I don't think you understood me.

219
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,711
Go inside.

220
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,256
Okay.

221
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,283
He's so cool.

222
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,619
I'm going to work hard today!

223
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,597
He ordered coffee.

224
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,100
What's going on?

225
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,602
Why isn't he leaving?

226
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,397
I think he's here
to observe how hard we're working.

227
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,858
You're right. That's it.

228
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,152
It's giving me chills.
I thought he was better than this.

229
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,403
He's watching again.

230
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,703
He keeps glancing our way.

231
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,830
You're right.

232
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,456
He's here to keep an eye on us.

233
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,752
Sa-rang, go check on him.

234
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,422
-What do you mean?
-Check to see if he needs anything.

235
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,133
Find out why he's acting like that.

236
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,467
Gauge his mood.

237
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,303
-Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

238
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,807
All right.

239
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,615
Mr. Gu,

240
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,994
is there anything else
I can help you with?

241
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:22,911
No, I'm fine.

242
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,206
Then why don't you consider leaving now?

243
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,124
I don't want to.

244
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,796
Everyone finds it uncomfortable
to see you sitting here.

245
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,465
Don't mind me. Just continue working.

246
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,633
Well…

247
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,308
How are we supposed to do that

248
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,351
when you're sitting here like this?

249
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,146
-I have a meeting here later.
-What time?

250
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,147
At 5 p.m.

251
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,983
It's 2 p.m. right now.

252
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,443
Hurry up and leave.

253
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,820
-I'll leave in a bit.
-Can you just leave now?

254
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,114
Come on. It's because I want to see you.

255
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,532
Mr. Gu!

256
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,711
We are at work right now.

257
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,797
-You need to leave.
-But…

258
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,510
Did you have to get so serious?

259
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,806
No one can work properly because of you,

260
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,099
including me.

261
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,564
Fine.

262
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,776
After just one more cup.

263
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,737
You already had three.

264
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,739
I think it'd be best for you to leave now.

265
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,494
Hurry.

266
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,080
Is that what you want?

267
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,249
Yes.

268
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,334
I beg you.

269
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,044
"Beg"?

270
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,846
Okay.

271
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,808
I'll disappear as you wish.

272
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,864
VEGAN RESTAURANTS

273
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,198
MUST-EAT RESTAURANTS NEAR NAMSAN

274
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,619
MUST-EAT RESTAURANTS NEAR GWANGHWAMUN

275
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,110
"Thank you"

276
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,280
must be an expression
to use at times like this.

277
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,406
Don't mention it.

278
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,076
Thank yourself
for your great service skills.

279
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,120
-You're the best.
-That's true.

280
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,749
But what was that notebook earlier?

281
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,585
It had the restaurants'
most popular dishes,

282
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,588
their locations, and notes about
the employees' foreign language skills.

283
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,340
When I worked in the lobby,
a lot of foreign guests

284
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,300
asked for restaurant recommendations.

285
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:08,095
I created the list by touring
good restaurants on my days off.

286
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,971
Mad respect.

287
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,390
You're the best talent for a reason.

288
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,184
I'm seeing you in a new light.

289
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,645
Attention to detail is important
in customer service.

290
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,689
I'll leave this here.

291
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,691
You can look at it whenever you need to.

292
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,901
Is that okay?

293
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,028
You're giving away
your efforts and know-how.

294
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,905
What's wrong with that?

295
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,240
Our team will be using it.

296
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,492
We're all one family.

297
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,552
Is the 100th-anniversary event preparation
going smoothly?

298
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,387
Yes, everything's going smoothly.

299
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,721
Can you elaborate?

300
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,349
This isn't just any event.

301
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,852
King Hotel is the root of King Group.

302
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,188
This year, we're honoring
the past 100 years of the group's history,

303
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,982
as well as presenting our new vision.

304
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,899
I know.

305
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,860
We also need to invite public officials,

306
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,611
but you haven't reached out to them yet.

307
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:11,950
They're not the type of people
to come on short notice.

308
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,578
Hwa-ran is right about that.

309
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,582
You need finesse when approaching
people who work for the government.

310
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,835
Your sister has that network
in her pocket.

311
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,044
Ask her for help.

312
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,380
You entrusted me with it.

313
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,090
I can handle it.

314
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,176
You haven't even gotten anything done.

315
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,804
King the Land is hosting this event.

316
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,390
So everything is up to me.

317
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,767
No, it's a matter of the hotel.

318
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,272
King Hotel's capabilities
are to be displayed through this event.

319
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,235
You're right.

320
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,447
The entire hotel needs to be involved.

321
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,957
Then from now on,

322
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,294
I will take charge of the hotel.

323
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,804
Your sister is in charge
of King Air and Distribution,

324
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,681
so you can manage the hotel.

325
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,016
However,

326
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,060
you have to show me
what you're capable of.

327
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,687
Once the 100th-anniversary event is over,

328
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,731
let's talk again.

329
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,876
Mr. Gu, would you like some more coffee?

330
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,254
Absolutely not.

331
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,427
I need to have a word with you.

332
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,394
I thought you didn't want to
talk to me at work.

333
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,105
By any chance,

334
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,233
are you upset?

335
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,318
As if.

336
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,361
I'm not that petty.

337
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,822
Please. You're sulking.

338
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,325
What are you saying?

339
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,328
I'm just trying
not to mix business with pleasure.

340
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:02,829
As you asked.

341
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,749
Goodness.

342
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,002
I had no choice but to do that earlier.

343
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,920
Please. You begged me to leave.

344
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,714
Come on. Don't sulk over that.

345
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,673
Stop.

346
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,556
Don't be upset.

347
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,395
I mean…

348
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,567
-That's not--
-Forget it.

349
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,902
-But--
-I'll make sure

350
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,154
not to mix business with pleasure either.

351
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,031
I understand what you mean.

352
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,866
-But--
-Let's talk again next time.

353
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,827
But…

354
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,501
Can you do that one more time?

355
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,255
This is bad.

356
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,094
This is bad.

357
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,556
Mr. Gu!

358
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,310
-You're the--
-Get out.

359
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,688
You're the best. You're the man.

360
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,233
That is who you are.

361
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,276
What are you saying?

362
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,529
I heard you finally declared war
against Ms. Gu.

363
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,989
"I will take charge of the hotel."

364
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:21,991
You're so cool.

365
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,160
You're awesome. Good job.

366
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,453
This is just the start.

367
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,331
I will be at the forefront.

368
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,337
What? Why do you look so depressed?

369
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,839
You were over the moon earlier.

370
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,383
Why are you down in the dumps now?

371
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,551
What is it?

372
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,593
What's wrong?

373
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,053
It's nothing.

374
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,930
I don't think so.

375
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,349
Are you scared after drawing your sword?

376
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,768
It's nothing like that.

377
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,981
Then is it a relationship problem?

378
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,774
Do you need my advice?

379
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,659
-This is about someone I know.
-Okay.

380
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,619
He argued with his girlfriend at work.

381
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,123
The reason being his girlfriend told him
to stay away from her at work.

382
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,750
So the man got a little upset.

383
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,334
-Yes.
-But what I don't understand

384
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,087
is that when the girlfriend
hugged him from behind

385
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,089
to cheer him up,

386
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,091
the guy shuddered.

387
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,885
He actually loved it

388
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,137
but pushed her away
because he was startled.

389
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,264
Why did he get startled? What an idiot.

390
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,016
He must know nothing about dating.

391
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,934
I do know!

392
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,522
Leave for the day.

393
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,069
At this rate, you could end up
losing everything to Mr. Gu.

394
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:44,324
Mr. Gu's greatest weapon
should not be taken lightly.

395
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,700
What weapon?

396
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,160
The fact that he's his son.

397
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,334
I received an urgent message from the US.

398
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,877
They said they couldn't reach you.

399
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,836
Later.

400
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,172
It seems it's something urgent
regarding your son, Ji-hu.

401
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,840
Did you not hear me?

402
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,676
Understood, ma'am.

403
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,141
Are you worried, Mr. Choi?

404
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,477
Yes, slightly.

405
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,771
Do you not trust me?

406
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,023
It's not that.

407
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,191
Then,

408
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,151
why are you worried?

409
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,613
King Group was mine from the start.

410
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,866
And it's going to stay that way.

411
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,869
I'm not going to let Won have any of it.

412
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,414
I'm sorry, ma'am.

413
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,253
Send invitations
to the people on our side.

414
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,672
Are you thinking of helping Mr. Gu?

415
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,382
Why would I help him?

416
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,926
Won may be in charge of the event,

417
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,930
but it's going to be
full of people on my side.

418
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,935
Won will be in charge in name only.

419
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,396
Do you understand?

420
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,399
I'm here, ma'am.

421
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,525
Goodness gracious.

422
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,194
What brings you all the way here?

423
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,362
Well…

424
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,865
Oh dear.

425
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,824
Be careful!

426
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,872
Goodness.

427
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,124
GENERAL MEDICAL CENTER

428
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,543
Jeez, it's fine.

429
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,794
Please lie down.

430
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,173
Why did you bring me to the hospital
over something like this?

431
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,591
You must have money to burn.

432
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,469
You could've been in big trouble.

433
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,013
The cartilage has degenerated
in both of your knees.

434
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,681
How have you been walking all this time?

435
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,392
With my two legs. How else?

436
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,854
It's normal for my joints
to act up at this age.

437
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,231
It'd be weirder if they were healthy.

438
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,108
Get out of my way. I'm leaving.

439
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,320
-Didn't you hear what the doctor said?
-What?

440
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,740
The doctor suggested getting
knee injections while you're here.

441
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,494
And considering your age,
they wanted to run a few more tests.

442
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,870
What about my restaurant?

443
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,955
I'll take care of it.

444
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,081
Goodness.

445
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,875
You talk big for a guy
who can't even peel onions.

446
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,960
Jeez.

447
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,381
Ma'am,

448
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,508
no matter what you say,

449
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,804
until you receive injection treatment
and run all of your tests,

450
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,472
you can't leave this hospital.

451
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,101
I'll do what I can with your restaurant.

452
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,936
All you have to do

453
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,231
is take care of your health.

454
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,818
What?

455
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,737
How dare you glare at me?

456
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,241
Look at you.

457
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,536
I thought you were a sluggard,
but you're quite agile.

458
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,162
Gosh.

459
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,832
Why did you come all the way here anyway?

460
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,500
Well…

461
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,670
I just dropped in while I was passing by.

462
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,589
You dropped in all the way from Seoul?

463
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,966
I saw some flowers

464
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,094
and I thought of you.

465
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,763
You should be thinking of
a woman you love.

466
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,641
Why did you think of me?

467
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,686
There must be something going on

468
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,147
between you and Sa-rang.

469
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,817
How did you know?

470
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,235
I can just tell.

471
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,320
It's written all over your face.

472
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,366
You have feelings for Sa-rang, don't you?

473
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,667
Yes, I like Sa-rang.

474
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,753
Then did you ask her out?

475
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,923
Do I have to put it into words

476
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,760
when we both know we like each other?

477
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,888
Come over here.

478
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,181
You can just tell me--

479
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,390
Come over here!

480
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,023
The thing is,

481
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,110
even if you feel
an emotional connection with someone,

482
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,364
if you don't express
how you sincerely feel,

483
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,075
it's likely they won't know.

484
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,536
It's the same whether things are good

485
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,455
or bad in your relationship.

486
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,209
If something made you upset,

487
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,337
just swallow your pride

488
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,133
and tell each other what made you upset.

489
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,303
You also have to listen with your heart.

490
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,056
That is how you should love one another.

491
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,307
Do you understand?

492
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,645
Yes.

493
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,647
I'll keep that in mind.

494
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,024
Okay. Here.

495
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,153
First things first.
Sign up to be a candidate.

496
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,072
A candidate for what?

497
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,908
You'll be candidate number one
for Sa-rang's husband.

498
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,412
I'll make a decision
after considering a few others.

499
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,164
But ma'am…

500
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,125
Grandma.

501
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,711
Grandma, are you okay?

502
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,797
I'm fine. This is nothing.

503
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,466
How bad is it? Where does it hurt?

504
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,426
-Are you in a lot of pain?
-Goodness.

505
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,304
I told you I'm fine. It's okay.

506
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,766
Why, you little…

507
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,852
You're so impatient.

508
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,938
I can't believe you told her already.

509
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,482
What are you going to do
with that big mouth of yours?

510
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,694
You've been admitted,
so I had to contact your guardian.

511
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,988
What? You're out.

512
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,322
I disapprove.

513
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,615
You get out of my way too.

514
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,868
-I'm getting up.
-Where are you going?

515
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,120
I need to run my restaurant.

516
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,205
Who cares about the restaurant right now?

517
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,084
I told you to stop working.
I make money now.

518
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,962
It's okay. I'm totally fine.

519
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,298
Are you going to keep worrying me?

520
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,134
Do you know how I felt on my way here?

521
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,971
Please.

522
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,473
Didn't I tell you to let me know

523
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,560
when you're sick
or going through a tough time?

524
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,023
I can't live without you.

525
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,195
How am I supposed to live without you too?

526
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,783
Okay. All right.

527
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,869
It's okay. Don't cry.

528
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,496
I'll get all the treatments
and tests done,

529
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,917
and I won't leave
until the doctor tells me I can.

530
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,835
So stop crying. There, there.

531
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,673
You promised to live longer than me.

532
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,467
Stop it. I'm not dying.

533
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,887
Where would I go without you?

534
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,805
I won't go anywhere.

535
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,975
So stop crying. Okay?

536
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,942
There, there.

537
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,926
Don't worry.

538
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,219
She'll be okay.

539
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,137
Her fall wasn't that bad.

540
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,098
Thank you.

541
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,934
You can go first.
I'll take care of the rest.

542
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,353
Let's do it together.

543
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,897
No, it's okay. I can just take a taxi.

544
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,776
I promised your grandmother
to take you home safely.

545
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,861
Let's do it together.

546
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,419
Don't we just have to
switch out the lightbulb?

547
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,338
No. We first need to
completely cut off the electricity

548
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,340
to ensure our safety.

549
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,051
Have you done this before?

550
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,511
Of course not.

551
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,389
Then I'll just do it.

552
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,432
No.

553
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,142
I'll do it.

554
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,019
Just trust me.

555
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,072
-This…
-What did you do?

556
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:49,660
All I did was place my finger there,
but all of a sudden…

557
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,203
Wait. Do you have your phone?

558
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,830
-Hold on.
-Where is it? Turn on the flashlight.

559
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,248
My phone is…

560
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,000
in my car.

561
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,544
-I put mine over there too.
-Hang on a second.

562
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,421
-Which way is the exit?
-What do I do?

563
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,672
-Okay, then let's…
-Where…

564
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,100
Wait…

565
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,520
-Should we go this way?
-I need to go that way.

566
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,939
-Okay. I'll go.
-No, it's not that way.

567
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,274
-Wait. Hold on.
-Gosh.

568
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,026
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

569
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,611
-Are you hurt?
-Freeze.

570
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,950
Just stay still right here.

571
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,620
All right?

572
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,747
All right.

573
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,916
-But--
-Don't.

574
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:40,920
Fine.

575
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,468
What?

576
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,970
Where are you?
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

577
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,181
Where are you? Where in the world are you?

578
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,557
-Right here.
-Oh my god!

579
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,725
It's okay.

580
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,605
-I'm not okay.
-What's wrong with you?

581
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,773
Come on.

582
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,942
Why are you always fainting?

583
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,069
Get up. Seriously.

584
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,076
You should go back now.

585
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,165
Is that what you really want?

586
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,384
I want to stay with you.

587
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,054
Is it just me?

588
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,895
No.

589
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,398
I feel the same way.

590
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,116
I'm sorry about yesterday.

591
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,244
I can be so clueless sometimes.

592
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,414
I guess

593
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,958
I made a fuss

594
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,295
because it felt like
you didn't miss me or like me back.

595
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,008
Sorry for making you feel uncomfortable.

596
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,930
I'm also sorry for snapping at you.

597
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,600
I could've been more gentle,

598
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,561
but I was worried about what
the others would think,

599
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,271
so I was on edge.

600
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,066
No.

601
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,194
I'm sorry.

602
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,035
I'm sorry too.

603
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,876
If I ever make a mistake again,

604
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,961
you can sulk all you want.

605
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,422
I'll handle it.

606
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,760
Even if it may take a while,
I'll make sure to cheer you up.

607
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,471
So when you're with me,

608
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,723
don't suppress your emotions.

609
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,768
Just be yourself.

610
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,818
Come to think of it,

611
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,699
I don't think
I've ever expressed how I truly feel.

612
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,680
I like you a lot.

613
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,148
Will you accept my feelings?

614
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:56,091
But do we have to stay
this far away from each other?

615
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,635
This is my grandma's room.

616
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,720
I know that.

617
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,971
But…

618
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,308
You're so far away.

619
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,559
I can barely hear you.

620
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,269
Hello?

621
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,647
Can you hear me?

622
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:15,444
Do you want to go to Seoul this instant
or do you want to sleep outside?

623
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,738
Really?

624
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:19,865
You're so adamant.

625
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,119
We have to get up early tomorrow to prep.

626
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,331
We only have three hours before then,
so go to sleep.

627
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,958
Fine.

628
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,471
-What was that?
-Let's sleep.

629
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,269
Hurry up and go to sleep.

630
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,607
It's our second time.

631
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,276
What do you mean?

632
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,612
Sleeping in the same room.

633
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,323
Last time, there were two rooms.

634
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,200
You were so snappy then.

635
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,910
You were such a jerk then.

636
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,374
Even though I kept

637
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,085
giving you the death stare,

638
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:15,879
on the inside,

639
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,923
I was thinking, "What?"

640
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:19,967
"Why do I like her?"

641
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,594
"Why does she look cute?"

642
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,388
Really.

643
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,392
Come to think of it,

644
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,270
I liked everything about you
from the start.

645
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,612
Thank you for liking everything about me.

646
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,289
I'll always be next to you.

647
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,709
I'll always be in your line of sight.

648
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,962
I'll always be

649
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,506
within arm's reach.

650
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,308
Now I can see you clearly.

651
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,230
Let's sleep.

652
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,607
This isn't…

653
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,944
-Hey, you punk!
-Don't get the wrong idea, ma'am.

654
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,445
I swear I didn't do anything.

655
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,490
What? You didn't do anything?

656
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,868
Yes, I swear. I only held her hand, ma'am.

657
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,036
Why you little…

658
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,539
-You punk.
-Why?

659
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,082
-You idiot.
-What did I do?

660
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,251
-You idiot. You call yourself a man?
-What?

661
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,669
Are you a man, you punk?

662
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,254
-Grandma.
-You just held her hand?

663
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,505
Darn you.

664
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,388
You're not going to the hospital?

665
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,892
Why would I go back there
when I finished all of my treatments?

666
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,227
Then where are you going?

667
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,979
I'll be back soon.

668
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,689
You should peel the onions

669
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,940
and get the fire ready.

670
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,316
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

671
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,568
You're taking him too?

672
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,487
What's going on?

673
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,531
-Hurry up.
-Yes, ma'am.

674
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,659
Where are you going?

675
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,375
Ms. Cha!

676
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,668
Drink one of these.

677
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,092
Who is this?

678
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,385
Your grandson-in-law?

679
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,012
Don't be absurd.

680
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,972
He's just one of the men
who chase after Sa-rang.

681
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,473
A candidate.

682
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,683
I see.

683
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,018
You're so handsome.

684
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:20,939
That's the least he can do
to be in Sa-rang's league.

685
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,566
She's on another level.

686
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,734
You're right.

687
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,320
-Drink this.
-I'm okay.

688
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,904
It's my treat. Just drink it.

689
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,157
Thank you. I appreciate it.

690
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,534
Sun-hui!

691
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,581
I heard you went to the hospital.

692
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,126
Have one of these for a swift recovery.

693
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,044
Okay.

694
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,546
Who is he?

695
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,882
-Her grandson-in-law?
-No.

696
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,885
He's just one of the many men
who chase after Sa-rang.

697
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,678
He's just a candidate.

698
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:58,810
So?

699
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,313
How long have you chased after Sa-rang?

700
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,940
-Well--
-By the way, do you have a job?

701
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,694
-Yes, I--
-He works at the same hotel as Sa-rang.

702
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,404
King Hotel.

703
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,115
The best hotel in the country.

704
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:15,702
It costs several hundred thousand won
for one night.

705
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,205
No matter how great the hotel is,

706
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,582
it's still just a huge inn.

707
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,127
My grandson-in-law
works for a major company in Seoul.

708
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,754
Goodness.

709
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,632
A hotel is almost a major company.

710
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,467
But do you own a house?

711
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,019
I don't feel the need to yet.

712
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,396
Goodness.

713
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,066
I can't believe I'm hearing someone say
they don't need a house.

714
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,568
It's not easy to buy a house in Seoul.

715
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,655
He can take his time.
Why are you worried about his house?

716
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,698
It's okay.

717
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,910
My grandson-in-law bought a house.

718
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,245
He's only paid off half the mortgage.

719
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,623
You're all chatting again?

720
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,125
Aren't you going to work?

721
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,301
-Eat it with this.
-Thank you.

722
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,636
-Enjoy.
-Hey, my daughter-in-law.

723
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,971
-Yes?
-More radish kimchi, please.

724
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,472
Okay. Radish kimchi.

725
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,394
Where did they go?

726
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,484
What do you like about Sa-rang?

727
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,779
Just everything.

728
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,614
There's nothing I dislike about her.

729
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,659
Do you know how long Sa-rang lived here?

730
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,911
She used to live here?

731
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,663
Since when?

732
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,874
I ask the questions.

733
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,083
You just answer.

734
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:46,835
Yes, ma'am.

735
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,213
What's Sa-rang's favorite food?

736
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,426
She doesn't like raw fish.

737
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,595
Did I ask you what she doesn't like?

738
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,930
I asked you what she likes.

739
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,269
I will find out one by one.

740
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,815
If you like her,

741
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,610
you should first find out
what kind of life she's lived

742
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,111
and what kind of person she is.

743
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,654
How can you just declare you like her

744
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,531
when you don't know anything about her?

745
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,702
You don't pass as Sa-rang's partner.

746
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:24,956
Get up.

747
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,210
YANGGIL BANK

748
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,669
-Hello, ma'am.
-Yes.

749
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,428
This must be the man
who's been chasing after Sa-rang, right?

750
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,930
Your potential grandson-in-law.

751
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,890
Yes, that's me.

752
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,560
Ms. Cha is a hard nut to crack.

753
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,895
You're in for a rough ride.

754
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,064
What can I help you with?

755
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,649
Another savings account?

756
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,442
A housing subscription account.

757
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,819
Really? Why?

758
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,111
You already have a house.

759
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,447
It's not for me. It's for him.

760
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,617
This is for the first month.

761
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,869
Starting next month,
you make the deposits.

762
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,374
You're already taking care of
your grandson-in-law.

763
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,459
You're so loving, ma'am.

764
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,461
Grandson-in-law, my foot.

765
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,296
He's just a candidate.

766
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,300
Is this your first time at a bank?

767
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,760
Your ID.

768
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,512
Right. Yes, ma'am.

769
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,474
Here you go.

770
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,561
Please wait here. I'll make a quick copy.

771
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,733
Thank you, ma'am.

772
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,111
I'll save a lot of money.

773
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,029
You don't need a house right now.

774
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,992
You and Sa-rang
can work hard and save money.

775
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,578
Don't let something like that
get you down.

776
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,497
Just work hard

777
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,833
and live a good life. Okay?

778
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:56,298
Then are you finally
giving me your approval?

779
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,427
Didn't you hear me?

780
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,262
You're no good.

781
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,430
You don't pass.

782
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,396
Wow, what's all this?

783
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,064
Is this a feast?

784
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,901
I just prepared the usual dishes
with not much effort.

785
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,069
Eat up.

786
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,154
Thank you.

787
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,951
Grandma's food is the best.

788
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,579
-So don't be sick.
-Okay.

789
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,081
Hey, eat this first.

790
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,335
I asked them to give me their best cut.

791
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:36,546
But I'm not sure
if it'll be tender and juicy.

792
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,465
-Thank you.
-Sure.

793
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,348
Here. You should try it too.

794
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,184
It's amazing.

795
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,227
-Is that so?
-Yes.

796
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,605
-You should have some too.
-Okay, I will.

797
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,362
It's so good.

798
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,530
Please eat.

799
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:03,698
Okay.

800
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:15,627
She told me I was the number one candidate
for grandson-in-law.

801
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,712
Is that why she cooked for you?

802
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,381
How odd.

803
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,383
By the way,

804
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,011
what's your favorite food?

805
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,182
Maybe spring rolls?

806
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,308
That's it?

807
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,436
What do you mean?
Spring rolls are amazing.

808
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,190
-What about you?
-I'll go with spring rolls too.

809
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,442
-What?
-I mean,

810
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,821
you're the person I like.

811
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,406
So I like what you like.

812
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,658
Let's go eat them sometime.

813
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,034
Okay.

814
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,875
Should we take one more lap?

815
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,046
I think we've taken over ten laps already.

816
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,756
Then…

817
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,718
we can just make it 20.

818
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:10,890
I'll allow it.

819
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,102
Let's go.

820
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,022
Sa-rang!

821
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,651
Where are you coming from?

822
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,319
What's up?

823
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,239
Goodness. Mr. No.

824
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,491
Mr. No?

825
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,995
It's really him.

826
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,003
What is all of this?

827
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,047
I'm going to drink like a fish tonight.

828
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,175
She can't survive right now
without drinking.

829
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,302
Why? Did something happen?

830
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,763
You know what an incentive trip is, right?

831
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,307
We reached our goal
after working our butts off for a month.

832
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,185
But they sent us on a day trip to Bali.

833
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,062
A day trip to Bali?

834
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,104
Yes.

835
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,439
I just got back.

836
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,662
Hey!

837
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,664
You ruined my hair.

838
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,292
Good grief.

839
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,293
I'm sorry.

840
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,795
Do you want to check these?

841
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,258
There's nothing special about Bali.

842
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,887
With a beach and a palm tree,
we're basically there.

843
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,390
YOU BETTER BALI-VE IT

844
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,726
So you're saying we can't go?

845
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,019
Yes, that's right.

846
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,854
This time, we can settle for this.

847
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,397
We'll go to Thailand next time.

848
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:45,360
You said we'd go to Southeast Asia
if we reached 30%.

849
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:49,322
We worked our butts off
without any bathroom breaks.

850
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,490
Tell me about it.

851
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:54,744
Next time, I'll do whatever it takes
to get you girls a trip to Thailand.

852
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,871
So let's increase the sales a little more.

853
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,081
Ms. Do.

854
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,083
We came somewhere nice.

855
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,002
Don't ruin the mood.
Let's talk about good things only.

856
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,506
I've been to Bali before.
It's identical to this place.

857
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,217
It's a waste of time to fly there!

858
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,593
Hey.

859
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,720
The special effects.

860
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,724
Is this good?

861
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,726
-Yes.
-Keep smiling.

862
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,645
Nice. Wonderful.

863
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,813
-You look like Lee Hyo-ri.
-Me?

864
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,231
That's the worst.

865
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,649
She's so evil.

866
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,152
She's just like my supervisor.

867
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,611
What did your supervisor do?

868
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,573
She promised to make Pyeong-hwa a purser

869
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,741
if she increased sales,
so she made her team first.

870
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,869
But instead,
she promoted Pyeong-hwa's junior,

871
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,203
her favorite.

872
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,957
She wouldn't have worked to the point of
hurting her back had she known.

873
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,294
Are in-flight sales
that important for becoming a purser?

874
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:47,797
They bring in a lot of money
thanks to their high profit margin.

875
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,175
The company keeps pushing us.

876
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,385
If your team doesn't reach
its monthly sales target,

877
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,678
you'll get a poor performance rating.

878
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,306
Are there any incentives
for selling a lot?

879
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,891
No, there aren't.

880
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,476
If I do well, it's a given.

881
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,603
If I do poorly,
I get on my superiors' bad side.

882
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,564
What do you expect from King Group?

883
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,650
Even Sa-rang was chosen
as the best talent for two years straight,

884
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,777
but all she was given was
a smiley face badge.

885
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,779
Hold on.

886
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,117
You were chosen as the best talent
for two consecutive years,

887
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,452
but all you got was a badge?

888
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,371
Since it was two years, I got two badges.

889
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,124
I wasn't expecting anything, so it's okay.

890
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,793
It's not okay.
You always say that with everything.

891
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,046
What can I do if it's not okay?

892
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,177
So the best talent only got a badge.

893
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,222
Da-eul, even after reaching your goal,

894
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,307
you weren't given the trip
you were promised.

895
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:43,603
Pyeong-hwa, you were promised a promotion
if your team came in first,

896
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,979
but someone else got it.

897
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,899
It's my fault for being so naive.

898
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,235
Why in the world…

899
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,737
The company should recognize
and reward its employees.

900
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,781
Also, a superior not keeping their word?

901
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,493
How does it make sense
for a superior to break their promise?

902
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,452
It does.

903
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,955
The higher-ups only look up.

904
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,873
They don't care about us.

905
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,126
If things go well, it's thanks to them.
If not, it's our fault.

906
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,920
Why is that your fault?

907
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,548
All three of you are not at fault.

908
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,049
The fault lies in the company

909
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,801
and your superiors for tricking you.

910
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,429
We cannot let this slide.

911
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:23,810
I'll do whatever it takes
and take responsibility to amend this.

912
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,980
-Wait.
-Won't it be difficult for you

913
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,189
to do much as a manager?

914
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,108
I know, right?

915
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,693
If he were a department manager…

916
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,027
That's hard too.

917
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,612
He needs to be a head manager at least.

918
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,031
Hey, didn't you hear what Sa-rang said?

919
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,285
She said her head manager
was a total jerk.

920
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,911
He goes to work for fun.

921
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,289
He wouldn't care about us lowlings.

922
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,416
Right, Sa-rang?

923
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,756
No.

924
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,094
No. He's not a jerk anymore.

925
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,679
He's a really nice person.

926
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,723
Hey, get your head straight.

927
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,474
As is the king, so are the subjects.

928
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,102
If he were a good person,
we wouldn't be suffering like this.

929
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,186
Right, Mr. No?

930
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,147
I think he's all right.

931
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,482
Someone like Mr. No
should be the head manager.

932
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,609
You're right.

933
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:16,195
Okay. May Mr. No become the head manager!

934
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,534
It doesn't matter who does it.

935
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,369
If you work this hard for the company,

936
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,371
the company should also treat you well.

937
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,498
I don't even expect that much.

938
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,376
I just want to be appreciated
for the work that I do.

939
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,297
Why do we have to wish for something
that should already be given?

940
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,383
We deserve what we deserve.

941
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,643
Anyway, it is an honor.

942
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,395
The best employee at King Air,
King Distribution,

943
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,105
and King Hotel.

944
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,359
I'm with the best employees
of King Group right now.

945
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,402
Like I said,

946
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,946
you should be the head manager, Mr. No.

947
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,157
If you run for the position,
I'll vote for you.

948
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,034
It's Mr. No.

949
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,661
-It's Mr. No.
-It's Mr. No.

950
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,204
-It's Mr. No.
-It's Mr. No.

951
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:10,041
Since you guys are rooting for me,
I can't sit still.

952
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,378
Order everything you want to eat tonight.

953
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,672
On behalf of the company, I…

954
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,469
As a manager,

955
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,429
I'll pay for everything!

956
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,560
Mr. No!

957
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,021
"Gang Da-eul, Oh Pyeong-hwa,

958
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,439
Cheon Sa-rang"?

959
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:34,982
The kind Ms. Sa-rang?

960
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,401
What is this?

961
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:40,613
The number one employees
of King Distribution, Air, and Hotel.

962
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,490
They are King Group's best employees.

963
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,826
Prepare an overseas trip
as their incentive.

964
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,911
The remaining employees
will be sent in turn.

965
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:50,248
Why are you so concerned
about the employees' incentive trips?

966
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,793
The company should reward them
for their performance.

967
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,211
Isn't that a given?

968
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,797
I've never seen
such an openhanded company.

969
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,553
There's one right here.

970
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,055
-Ms. Gu's approval is needed, right?
-No.

971
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,641
I'm making all the decisions
about the hotel.

972
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,602
With employees from Distribution and Air,
it's the group's issue.

973
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,730
-Will you be okay?
-You may proceed.

974
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,690
I'll take responsibility.

975
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,233
They are our group's best employees,

976
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:21,070
so it needs to be the finest
and most luxurious experience.

977
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,204
Me?

978
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,209
"A nice trip"?

979
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,211
WE'LL REWARD YOU WITH A NICE TRIP

980
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,630
What?

981
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:43,634
"Ms. Oh Pyeong-hwa, thank you
for your devotion and hard work."

982
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,220
"We'll reward you with a nice trip."

983
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,431
Congratulations.

984
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:51,225
The best staff of the group
are being given incentive trips.

985
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,019
Congratulations.

986
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:02,862
Thank you.

987
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,202
They're leaving tomorrow.
Is everything ready?

988
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,328
Of course.

989
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:13,039
They will experience
the best trip of their lives.

990
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,457
You'll be shocked.

991
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,420
Get in, sir.

992
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,297
What? You've never done this before.

993
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,090
No, this is what I usually do

994
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:26,135
as King Group's best assistant.
You know that, right?

995
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,563
-Are you sick?
-No, I'm perfectly fine.

996
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,779
I'll drive you home safely.

997
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,297
I'm so excited.

998
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,676
-I'm so happy!
-Hey!

999
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,429
Oh my. Mr. No!

1000
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,430
You're here.

1001
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,391
This is all thanks to you.

1002
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:14,559
I didn't do anything.

1003
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:17,436
We're going on this trip
because you told the higher-ups.

1004
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,105
You'll be blessed.

1005
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,731
Thank you so much.

1006
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,986
For this trip,
let's forget about everything

1007
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,863
and make this a happy, exciting,

1008
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,364
and comfortable trip.

1009
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,866
Let's go relax.

1010
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:30,867
-Okay!
-Okay!

1011
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,493
Let's go then.

1012
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,379
I'm so happy.

1013
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,131
What should we eat first?

1014
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,632
That's a good question.

1015
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:52,680
Head…

1016
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,143
Manager!

1017
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:02,815
Be quiet.

1018
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,025
-Who is he?
-Someone he knows?

1019
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:04,942
Why are you here?

1020
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,652
This is a trip
for King Group's best employees.

1021
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:07,862
I'm the best assistant.

1022
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:11,490
I get what you're saying.
I'll send you on a trip next time. So go--

1023
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,743
That's ridiculous. I need to assist you.

1024
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,369
Assist me with what?

1025
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,163
-Just leave.
-Who are you?

1026
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,794
-Hi, Sa-rang.
-Hello.

1027
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,839
-It is an honor to finally meet
-He works at the hotel.

1028
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,090
the people who were on the papers.

1029
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,800
Let me introduce myself. I'm--

1030
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:30,843
He is

1031
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,555
the man behind this incentive trip,

1032
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,265
Department Manager Yoo Sang-sik.

1033
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,228
What are you talking about?

1034
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,275
Let's introduce ourselves again.

1035
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,403
This is Mr. Yoo Sang-sik.
He's a department manager.

1036
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,031
And I'm

1037
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,616
Mr. No.

1038
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,785
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

1039
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,662
Mr. Yoo, thank you.

1040
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,205
Mr. Yoo Sang-sik,

1041
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,581
thank you.

1042
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:02,959
Mr. Yoo,

1043
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,253
I will guide them from start to finish,

1044
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:08,756
-so you may…
-Will you move, Mr. No?

1045
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:09,715
-What?
-"What?"

1046
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,925
-Pardon?
-Yes, "pardon."

1047
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,301
I'm a department manager.
You're just a manager.

1048
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,719
So can you go over there?

1049
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,681
Let me introduce myself again properly.

1050
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,350
I am the department manager
in charge of this trip,

1051
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,185
No… I mean, Yoo Sang-sik.

1052
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,395
It's nice to meet you.

1053
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,734
The concept of this trip is "We go hard."

1054
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,945
When we eat, go hard.

1055
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,655
When we have fun, go hard.

1056
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,532
-All together…
-We go hard!

1057
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,491
You're so energetic.

1058
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:40,037
But Mr. No,
why do you have your mouth shut?

1059
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,712
Just act like I'm not here, please.

1060
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,505
Unity is key for this trip.

1061
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,298
Individual activities are not allowed.

1062
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,801
We'll set off after shouting our chant.

1063
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,220
-When we eat…
-Go hard!

1064
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:58,055
-When we have fun…
-Go hard!

1065
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,932
-All together, we go hard!
-We go hard!

1066
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,976
Okay. Let's go!

1067
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,946
Why aren't you coming?

1068
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,241
I'm not letting Mr. No get away with this.

1069
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,659
I thought he was Mr. Yoo.

1070
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,287
His enthusiasm is nice. Let's go.

1071
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,499
Mr. No!

1072
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,294
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

1073
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,004
Okay. Coming.

1074
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:31,589
I'm coming.

1075
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,758
Mr. No, let's go!

1076
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:37,887
Mr. No, let's go!

1077
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,193
KING THE LAND

1078
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,142
Go hard!

1079
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,227
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

1080
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,355
Let me announce today's schedule.

1081
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,397
What about free time?

1082
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,066
There's no free time on a group tour.

1083
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,901
-Let's get out of here.
-Now?

1084
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:34,985
Now.

1085
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,863
A trip?

1086
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,866
How could something in King Group
be carried out without my knowledge?

1087
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,619
But I keep wanting more.

1088
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:47,289
I feel so happy that I begin to wonder
if I'm allowed this much happiness.

1089
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:51,585
I keep hoping that
I'll continue to be this happy.

1090
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,463
I'll make every day of yours
filled with happiness.

1091
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:02,054
