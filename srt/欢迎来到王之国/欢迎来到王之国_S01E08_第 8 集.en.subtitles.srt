1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:51,301
Wild geese live for over 100 years

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:55,972
and never abandon their partner
once they are mated.

4
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:00,351
They are a symbol of eternal love.

5
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,194
ONE HOUR AGO

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,201
What do you think? Don't I look great?

7
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,702
Sure, you do.

8
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,455
But less than the man of the hour.

9
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,918
Let's see.

10
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,088
There it is.

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,758
Looks great.

12
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,468
-I'll take this.
-This?

13
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,594
Yes, this one.

14
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,970
That obviously looks very humble.

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,222
It suits you perfectly.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,766
You have no idea.

17
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,727
The Korean people were known
as the white-clad folks.

18
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,479
So for our biggest celebrations,

19
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,732
the most honored person
would put on a white garment

20
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,692
and carry out the most important job.

21
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,986
Of course, that'll be me today.

22
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,489
I'm the most noble and honored man here!

23
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,657
Yes, I know that.

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,325
So put that on and do your thing.

25
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,410
I'll put this on and do my thing.

26
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,664
Give me those clothes.

27
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,835
I can't put you up
for something as important as this.

28
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,087
You can't handle it.

29
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,506
The clothes are mine,
and that job is mine too.

30
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,258
Hand it to me. That's an order!

31
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,932
I'm the most noble and honored.

32
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,226
Sa-rang.

33
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,943
The bride and groom
will share their wedding drinks.

34
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:45,081
Bride and groom,
hold up your cups respectfully

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,624
and have your drinks.

36
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,553
What?

37
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,805
Hey!

38
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,808
You're here.

39
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,893
Why are you there?

40
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,061
You wanted to switch. You gave the order.

41
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,813
You said this was important!

42
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,189
How dare you deceive me?

43
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,692
There's nothing more important

44
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,694
than sweeping the yards
to make the place clean

45
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,654
for our guests on this special day.

46
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,823
-You!
-What?

47
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,700
-You, come here!
-No, you come.

48
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,951
I'm coming!

49
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,202
-Okay.
-Hey!

50
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,495
Get back here. Stop!

51
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,789
What are you going to do?

52
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,875
Sa-rang, you're beautiful.

53
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,168
-You.
-Hey.

54
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,171
-Get back here.
-You can come back later.

55
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,964
How dare you deceive me?

56
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
Hey!

57
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,386
You!

58
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,352
EPISODE 8

59
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,153
Why did you agree to something
you didn't want to do?

60
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,156
I'm here on behalf of the hotel.

61
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,702
I couldn't allow any damage to it
because of my personal wants.

62
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,788
It wasn't easy to get this contract.

63
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,751
I still didn't like it.

64
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,755
-What do you mean?
-You and him doing that.

65
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,423
I didn't want to see it.

66
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,344
Wait, are you jealous?

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,638
Why would I be?

68
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,101
Only losers
with zero confidence get jealous.

69
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,186
Which means

70
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,897
that's far from something I would do.

71
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,442
-Then why?
-Just because.

72
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,570
I didn't like seeing you with another man.

73
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,367
That's called jealousy.

74
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,494
It wasn't.

75
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,663
Do you know what he's like?

76
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,165
He's probably dated well over 100 women.

77
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,834
-He's probably married too.
-Wow.

78
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,294
Two, three… no, four times.

79
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,129
Wow, really?

80
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,755
You can't be with other guys,

81
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,924
but especially not him.

82
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,884
Never. Not at all.

83
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,054
Okay.

84
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,100
Then let's say it wasn't jealousy.

85
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,853
But something like jealousy.

86
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,938
It wasn't.

87
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,523
I wasn't jealous.

88
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,275
Yes, that's what I said.

89
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,073
Anyway,

90
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,701
you acted very wisely today.

91
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,745
I was worried
everything was going to fall through.

92
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,123
I'm here on behalf of the hotel.

93
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,667
I may be a jerk who only does as I please,

94
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,044
but work is still work.

95
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,756
Since when?

96
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,718
From now on.

97
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,219
Why?

98
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,930
I want to protect something.

99
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,852
I'll protect it at all costs.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,229
And to do that,

101
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,440
I'll build up my power.

102
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,160
Are you going to work out?

103
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,039
No, I already look great.

104
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,624
-Oh my.
-Why should I?

105
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,419
Where do you find such confidence?

106
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,880
I was

107
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,299
only sharing facts.

108
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,762
I truly apologize for not realizing that.

109
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,367
Why are you staring at me like that?

110
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,870
Because I love it.

111
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,831
What?

112
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,791
Love.

113
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,301
I'm saying I love everything.

114
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,929
Well, the weather

115
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,098
and the wind.

116
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,894
The weather.

117
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,730
Yes, the weather is wonderful today.

118
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,776
What great weather.

119
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,703
Hey!

120
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,044
How dare you ruin my sacred wedding?

121
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,629
You made a fool out of my love!

122
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,547
Love?

123
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,923
Love, my foot.

124
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,551
You said you've dated
over 100 women until now.

125
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,511
And you were married twice.
Or was it thrice?

126
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,138
It's not a crime to be popular.

127
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,973
Though someone as unpopular as you

128
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,850
would never know.

129
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,186
I'm popular enough.

130
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,188
I just chose not to date people.

131
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,941
A woman-chaser like you
can't even comprehend how popular I am.

132
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,320
You're quite proud for a penniless pauper.

133
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,239
-How much do you have?
-A whole lot.

134
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,365
Excuse me.

135
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,243
If you two are going to fight,
I'm going home.

136
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,581
We aren't fighting, Sa-rang.

137
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,209
We aren't. We're just warning each other.

138
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,504
I'm warning you.

139
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,340
You're banned from being
within a 100 m radius of Ms. Cheon.

140
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,050
Got it? Go.

141
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,636
Did you forget about the contract?
I'm the one who gives orders.

142
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,012
Get rid of him!

143
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,140
What? Get rid of me?

144
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,767
-Yes, you.
-You think that's possible?

145
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,809
You… Oh.

146
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,311
-Get rid of me?
-Yes.

147
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,354
Go quickly.

148
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,730
You can't get rid of me!

149
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,607
Let go! Wait, you're really doing this.

150
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,276
Man, I'm walking on air.

151
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:49,987
Finally.

152
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,031
It's the two of us.

153
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,407
Yes.

154
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,159
Let's take a walk, Sa-rang.

155
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,036
All right.

156
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,051
Isn't it tough
to wait on guests for a living?

157
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,137
Of course it's tough.

158
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,308
It's not always easy
to serve every guest with a smile.

159
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,518
I'll give you a hotel.

160
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,103
Pardon?

161
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,312
I have lots.

162
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,147
You can choose whichever one you like.

163
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,275
Then you won't have to live
such a tough life.

164
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,902
It's all right, really.

165
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,698
It may be tough, but I still love my job.

166
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,158
It'll be even better if you own a hotel.

167
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,162
What I want to do
isn't business management.

168
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,500
I want to provide a happy day
for every guest we have.

169
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,338
It's a special thing
to present happiness to someone.

170
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,133
And it's not something just anyone can do.

171
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,604
You're such a wonderful woman.

172
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,856
I knew it.

173
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,441
I have a good eye for people.

174
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,901
I must have a party!

175
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,612
Party time!

176
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,364
Sure.

177
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,625
Go inside.

178
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,085
I had a wonderful day thanks to you.

179
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,546
Sa-rang, see you tomorrow.

180
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,381
Yes, Your Highness.

181
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,848
Don't you think that smile was too big?

182
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,436
It's finally over.

183
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,564
Great work today, Mr. Gu.

184
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,607
Great work.

185
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,701
Put these on.

186
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,245
I'm all right.

187
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,539
You dragged those around all day
without a break.

188
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,708
Don't you feel bad for your feet?

189
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,585
Show some kindness and let them rest.

190
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,519
You're acting like
you did something wrong.

191
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,187
What if someone sees me?

192
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,980
No one will, so calm down.

193
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,569
What are you doing?

194
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,280
You can sleep here tonight.

195
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,538
Sleep here?

196
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,938
Great work escorting that headache

197
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,982
and working overtime
on behalf of our hotel.

198
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:17,027
He may be our VIP guest,
but you're our VVIP employee.

199
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,947
You deserve to stay here tonight.

200
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,409
Don't turn it down.

201
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,080
I won't. Thank you.

202
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,010
You must be hungry.
Order some room service.

203
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,720
Eat whatever you want

204
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,305
and rest up.

205
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,391
This is an employee benefit.

206
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,852
Okay.

207
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,022
Good night.

208
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,625
Mr. Gu.

209
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,110
I told you to order room service,

210
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,654
but you choose instant noodles?

211
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,447
The best late-night snack
is instant noodles.

212
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,573
You don't know, do you?

213
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,617
What do you take me for?

214
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,743
Of course I do.

215
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,247
-Really?
-Yes, really.

216
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,250
In that case,

217
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,126
I choose this.

218
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,218
To think we came all the way
to the Han River for raw instant noodles.

219
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,305
You really don't know a thing.

220
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,101
If you're at the Han River,
you've got to have this one.

221
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,395
Read this. "The original cup noodles."

222
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,878
Is it that good?

223
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,087
I think

224
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,131
I simply must

225
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,217
get that machine in my room.

226
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,135
Come on.

227
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,429
Then it wouldn't taste like this.

228
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,805
It only tastes this good

229
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,474
when you throw in this soft river breeze

230
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,603
and that dazzling night view.

231
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,021
That's key.

232
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,357
At times, I come here
for instant noodles and beer after work.

233
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,692
It tastes like heaven.

234
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,028
Hey.

235
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,072
You kept this awesome attraction
all to yourself?

236
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,700
You're more selfish than I thought.

237
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,663
Do you have to criticize me that much
over some instant noodles?

238
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,081
"Some instant noodles"?

239
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,626
These are the best instant noodles
I've ever had.

240
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,128
They're so good.

241
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm glad.

242
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,840
In that case…

243
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,593
I rarely share this secret with others.

244
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,554
The time is now.

245
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,307
One dumpling.

246
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,192
-On top.
-Yes.

247
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,077
Isn't it good?

248
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,412
This place makes great dumplings.

249
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,417
I never got to enjoy such treats in life.

250
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,419
I lived in vain.

251
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,505
Anyway.

252
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,132
Is there a good timing for beer too?

253
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,135
-Of course there is.
-When is it?

254
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,566
-Now!
-Now?

255
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,652
-Now?
-Now! Hurry.

256
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,913
-Now.
-I was right, wasn't I?

257
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,165
Nice timing.

258
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,546
-You're home.
-Dad!

259
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,132
What's going on?

260
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,759
-Did you come early to play with me?
-I'm…

261
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,387
too tired to play.

262
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,556
-Go play with Mom.
-I knew it.

263
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,266
You would never play with me.

264
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,352
Cho-rong, why don't you show him
the new dance you learned today?

265
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,896
I'm the best dancer in my class.

266
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,732
Later. I'm tired.

267
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,111
Where's dinner? I'm hungry.

268
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,489
Should the three of us eat out?

269
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,366
Or should we order something?

270
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,118
I want short ribs or fried chicken.

271
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,829
-Should we?
-I'm sick of eating out.

272
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,414
Let's just eat whatever we have.

273
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,386
Honey, can you take out the trash?

274
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,346
Honey?

275
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,170
-Dad.
-Yes?

276
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,797
Where's your shame?

277
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,091
If Mom cooked for you,

278
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,885
shouldn't you at least take the trash out?

279
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,345
But I ate her food enthusiastically.

280
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,805
Do you know how hard that is?

281
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,349
It must be one tough job.

282
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,351
When I grow up,

283
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,520
I'll never marry a lazy bum like you.

284
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,437
What?

285
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,523
You used to say I was the coolest.

286
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,026
I didn't know any better
because I was too young.

287
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,111
What?

288
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,781
That was ages ago.

289
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,702
You're all grown up. All grown.

290
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,031
First floor. Going down.

291
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,742
Doors closing.

292
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,405
Did you sleep well?

293
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,365
Yes, thanks to you.

294
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,534
How do you want your breakfast?

295
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,453
What time is it?

296
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:06,830
Eight o'clock.

297
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,585
My shift begins at 3:00 p.m. today,
so may I sleep a little more?

298
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,586
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,088
I thought your shift began earlier.

300
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,215
All right. Go to sleep.

301
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,551
Okay. Thank you.

302
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,579
Yes?

303
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,289
I pushed your checkout time to 3 p.m.

304
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,584
-Thank you.
-Okay. See you later.

305
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,336
-Sleep tight.
-Okay.

306
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,592
What are you doing?

307
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,427
What are you doing?

308
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,150
Oh no.

309
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,151
What do we do?

310
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,822
-Hide.
-What?

311
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,990
Hide.

312
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,500
What do you want?

313
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,210
I heard you checked in yesterday,

314
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,380
so I came by to see
if you found anything uncomfortable.

315
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,507
This unannounced visit is uncomfortable.

316
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,466
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,011
I wanted to take extra good care of you.

318
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,721
My checkout's at 3 p.m.

319
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,266
I asked to make sure I'm undisturbed
because I wanted to get a good rest.

320
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,600
Did you miss the memo?

321
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,103
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,107
But if you need anything
or find anything uncomfortable--

323
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,775
I don't need anything. Goodbye.

324
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,449
He's so cool.

325
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,118
That curt manner is his charm.

326
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,498
Hello, you've reached Manager Kim Su-mi.

327
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,128
His Highness is looking for me?

328
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,255
Yes, okay.

329
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,049
Oh my! What's happening?

330
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,139
Where are you?

331
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,558
You can come out now.

332
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,771
Is she gone?

333
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,066
It's not like you did anything wrong.

334
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,943
I didn't want to give the wrong idea.

335
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,821
Your behavior right now
will give people the wrong idea.

336
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,698
I said this was your employee benefit.

337
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,158
You just made me look odd too.

338
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,701
I'm completely awake now.

339
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,037
-I must go.
-You don't have to.

340
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,623
I told them not to disturb me.

341
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,750
No, I'm fine, really.

342
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,960
I had a good rest thanks to your kindness.

343
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,962
-Thank you.
-Sure.

344
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,422
I forgot.

345
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,382
You're not the type that just listens.

346
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,833
Nobody will come,
so don't mind them and sleep some more.

347
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,668
Okay?

348
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,131
-Good afternoon.
-Not for me.

349
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,592
This isn't even the first time.
Are you teasing me?

350
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,387
Were you my mortal enemy
in a previous life?

351
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,641
Why do I have to run such petty errands?

352
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,976
Why?

353
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,353
What's this?

354
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:45,233
Your Highness, this is a dress that meets
the dress code for tonight's party.

355
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,570
Make sure you attend the party in this.

356
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,654
Says who?

357
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,364
The prince!

358
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,741
Your prince!

359
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,922
This is from His Highness.

360
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,341
It's the outfit for tonight's party.
You must wear it.

361
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,677
He can be annoying in so many ways.

362
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,971
But he sent you a present as a friend.

363
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,097
You must be happy.

364
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,058
He's not a friend.

365
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,517
Stop it. I know you're glad.

366
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,020
Then allow me to open it.

367
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,939
See that?

368
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,361
Good grief.

369
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,446
He didn't have to…

370
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,494
That little…

371
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,161
Sa-rang.

372
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,126
I knew I had a good eye.

373
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,669
I knew it'd look good on you.

374
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,172
It's awkward to be in something like this.

375
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,383
I wanted you to see

376
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,969
the kind of outfit that suits you best.

377
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,264
I knew you'd look great
in an elegant garment like this.

378
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,182
I see.

379
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,944
Thank you.

380
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,950
Let us begin the party.

381
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,478
What are you doing?

382
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,980
And your outfit?

383
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:30,940
I'm volunteering.

384
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,276
All my butlers are dressed like that.

385
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,611
Relax and sit, Sa-rang.

386
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,238
Well,

387
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,700
how can I relax and sit
when I feel uncomfortable?

388
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,951
It's all right, ma'am.

389
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,578
Please relax and take a seat.

390
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,586
Allow me to serve the wine.

391
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,762
Shouldn't you tell us about it?

392
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,351
I prepared this extremely overpriced wine

393
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,479
befitting of your position, Your Highness.

394
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,688
Drink up

395
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,608
and help boost our sales numbers.

396
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,611
Does this hotel serve wine with that face?

397
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,541
What? Are you telling me
to drink this and die?

398
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,876
Take it however you like.

399
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,004
You can either drink it and die,
or die and drink it.

400
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,798
Let me prepare your food.

401
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,596
What's going on? Why is he serving us?

402
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,640
I put him up to it. For us.

403
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,934
But why?

404
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,437
You deserve only the best service.

405
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,523
Someone like the hotel's head manager
seemed to qualify,

406
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,607
so I got him.

407
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,111
Thank you very much,

408
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,905
but I'm still a staff member
of this hotel.

409
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,449
Look at yourself right now.

410
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,366
What suits you

411
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,035
isn't a uniform, but a dress.

412
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,746
Not a hotel, but my royal family.

413
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,997
Marry me.

414
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,374
Sorry?

415
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,668
This is an official proposal.

416
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,253
Will you marry me?

417
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,964
Wait, what are you…

418
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,593
Sa-rang,

419
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,887
my love.

420
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,910
No!

421
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,411
-Never.
-What are you doing?

422
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,370
Flat out no.

423
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,581
I object to this proposal.

424
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,082
Who do you think you are?

425
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,168
Me? I have the right to say this.

426
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,629
Because I'm…

427
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,089
Ms. Cheon is one of my employees,

428
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,051
and I'm her employer
who has a responsibility to protect her.

429
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,636
Not only that, you're a player,

430
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,304
and I can buy this too!

431
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,388
Anyway, no.

432
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,933
I won't play along with this joke anymore.
I'm off.

433
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:10,850
Let's go.

434
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,477
Give me the ring.

435
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,942
What?

436
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,902
You're accepting this?

437
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,029
It's a present for me.

438
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:23,988
Give it to me.

439
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,644
I've never seen such a pretty ring before.

440
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,817
Thank you for regarding me favorably.

441
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,487
I'll keep your kindness in my heart
and cherish it for a long time.

442
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,158
Wait, are you turning me down?

443
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,119
I'll just accept the thought.

444
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:16,332
It was a huge honor to serve
a gentleman like you, Your Highness.

445
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:21,212
I'll remember you for a very long time
as the most fabulous guest I've ever met.

446
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,631
Please visit us again
as our best guest in history.

447
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,634
We'll always serve you
joyfully and wholeheartedly.

448
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,807
This was the first time
I wasn't hurt after a rejection.

449
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,226
I was wrong.

450
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,728
You're unlike what I thought.

451
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,772
You're much more special and fabulous.

452
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,318
Your Highness, you're the one
who's special and fabulous.

453
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,235
Okay.

454
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,154
I'll back off this time.

455
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,533
Next time, I'll come back with a ring
that's much prettier and more expensive.

456
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,744
Don't turn me down then.

457
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,169
May we eat? I'm hungry.

458
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,378
With Mr. Gu, of course.

459
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,756
No, he's here as a server.

460
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,257
I don't want to dine with him.

461
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,135
But it's your last day.

462
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,762
Let's all enjoy supper.

463
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,391
Well, if that's what you want.

464
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,103
-Take a seat.
-Forget it. I don't want to eat.

465
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,902
Mr. Gu.

466
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,782
Mr. Gu.

467
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,495
Hermès.

468
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,336
If you want it that badly,

469
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,005
then I'll join.

470
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,514
Sit down.

471
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,644
Serve before you sit.

472
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,692
Thank you.

473
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,986
-Do it for me too.
-You've got hands.

474
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,659
You're really annoying.

475
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,952
He has many girlfriends.

476
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,630
This is a present from me.

477
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,507
Why isn't it just us two?

478
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,300
I'll be back soon.

479
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,803
Don't start dating someone else
before I return,

480
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,138
Sa-rang.

481
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,597
You're always welcome here.

482
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,890
Sa-rang.

483
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,477
Hey, you should go. You're running late.

484
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,730
I had fun thanks to you.

485
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,565
This is your tip.

486
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,026
You're pretty stingy for a prince.

487
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,610
What is this?

488
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,195
Give me a blank check.

489
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,656
This is generous
considering your performance.

490
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,284
Be prepared as a guide next time.

491
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,203
Good grief.

492
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,748
Don't ever return.
I'm shutting the hotel down.

493
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,167
I'll return before then.
Don't miss me too much.

494
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,173
See you again, my friend.

495
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,759
What are you doing?

496
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,762
Come on. I don't need friends.

497
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,346
Me neither.

498
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,599
That makes you and I the same.

499
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,059
I'll be back.

500
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,477
My brother, Won.

501
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,024
Don't come back.

502
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,302
You two really are friends,

503
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,887
having fun until the last moment.

504
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,347
Friends? Hardly.

505
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,057
I hate guys like him.

506
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,520
May I ask you something?

507
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:08,940
Why did you do that?

508
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,027
You would never accept
an order to serve food.

509
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,279
And you dressed like a butler too.

510
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,241
Because I promised to show

511
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,992
a great performance

512
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,246
as a representative of this hotel
until the very last moment.

513
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,709
So? Did I do okay?

514
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,672
I hope I was worth training.

515
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,589
Yes.

516
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,801
You did a splendid job.

517
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,847
Anyway.

518
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,600
Why did you take a while

519
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,103
to answer him yesterday?

520
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,731
He proposed with sincerity,

521
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,818
so it wasn't good manners
to turn him down easily.

522
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,071
You shouldn't allow such punks leeway.

523
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,073
There's no need
to show him manners either.

524
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,160
Wait.

525
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,579
Did you consider

526
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,749
accepting his proposal even for a moment?

527
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,885
It's a secret.

528
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,846
There are no secrets between us.

529
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,723
Of course there are secrets between us.

530
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,683
You're about to make me really sad.

531
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,809
Will you be like this?

532
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,811
You really won't tell me?

533
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,146
It's a secret.

534
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,231
I mean…

535
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,524
It's a secret.

536
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,609
Please excuse me.

537
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,277
Where are you going? I'm not done.

538
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,821
It's the busiest time of the day,
so I should go.

539
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,156
Please excuse me.

540
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,491
-It's a secret.
-What?

541
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,038
Where's the Grand Ballroom?

542
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,748
Please come this way.

543
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,135
A secret?

544
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,019
We're landing soon.
It's dangerous, so I'll wrap up.

545
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,563
No, I got it.
You can get ready for landing.

546
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,531
Here you go.

547
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,658
Thank you.

548
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,289
Dear passengers,

549
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:34,293
we are now arriving
at Incheon International Airport.

550
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,420
Please remain seated

551
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,965
until the aircraft makes a full stop

552
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,800
and the seatbelt sign turns off.

553
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,804
Thank you for flying with King Air.

554
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,098
Our flight crew

555
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,977
will always serve you
in safety and comfort.

556
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,069
My gosh!

557
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,114
Pyeong-hwa, what's going on?

558
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,283
I know we've never met, but may I come in?

559
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,660
Sure, come on in.

560
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,125
One second.

561
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,423
What happened?

562
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,967
I think she sprained her back.

563
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,177
Could you put ice on her?

564
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,014
After about 15 minutes,

565
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,890
you can put a pain relief patch on her.

566
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,767
Okay.

567
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,353
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

568
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,230
Yes, thank you.

569
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,025
I'll introduce myself properly next time.

570
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,651
Okay.

571
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,486
I'll come by tomorrow.

572
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,572
Don't do anything today

573
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,907
and go right to bed, okay?

574
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,576
Okay. Thank you.

575
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,037
Good night.

576
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,414
Goodbye.

577
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,917
Bye.

578
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,254
Take care.

579
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,262
He's so attractive!

580
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,098
-Who's that? The guy from that time?
-My back!

581
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,309
My back.

582
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,563
I'll put a pain relief patch on you.

583
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,780
Goodness, you're such a fool.

584
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,865
It could've been much worse.

585
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,867
A promotion isn't worth getting hurt over.

586
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,078
It's not that I'm dying to get promoted.

587
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,622
It's my desperate struggle to survive.

588
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,209
If you struggle a few more times,
you'll go broke buying these patches.

589
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,545
Do you want to be a purser that badly?

590
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,215
It's not that I want to.

591
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,258
I really have to be one now.

592
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,346
But I don't think
it'll happen in this life.

593
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,392
What if this is your last life?
Don't just give up.

594
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,478
You even hurt your back working hard,
so keep it up until the end.

595
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,563
No matter how hard I try,

596
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,192
I can't even do half as much as others.

597
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,902
What do the others do?

598
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,279
Nobody works as hard as you.

599
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,996
A FEW HOURS AGO

600
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,252
I thought you wanted to become L1.

601
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,711
I guess you aren't desperate.

602
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,756
I'll work harder.

603
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,675
That's your problem.

604
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,677
Everyone works hard.

605
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,638
It's because you only take
standard procedures.

606
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,433
Other teams

607
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,560
carry the duty-free books around,

608
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,229
selling and even delivering
the items themselves.

609
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,066
They'll get in trouble if they're caught.

610
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,776
The company will go berserk.

611
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,570
Do you really think they don't know?

612
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,572
Pyeong-hwa.

613
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,740
There's no free lunch in this world.

614
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:55,578
Only those who are passionate enough
to put up with such danger

615
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,829
get promoted.

616
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,623
Don't be scared.

617
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,667
I'm just sharing an example.

618
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,045
To triumph in this fierce competition,

619
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:09,508
you need to show enough passion
to match what the others are doing.

620
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,763
Sa-rang.

621
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,682
Yes?

622
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,436
Are you free tomorrow evening?

623
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,231
SAMSAM SPA, HOT KILN SAUNA

624
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,284
Why do I get freckles only on my face,
not my feet?

625
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,496
They're never in the sun.

626
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,706
There's skin on the feet too.

627
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,917
But why would your soles get freckles?

628
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,627
They'd need to see the sun.

629
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,587
It's a shame we get freckles on our face.

630
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,547
Oh my.

631
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,424
You can get duty-free items

632
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,885
without going on a trip?

633
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,264
Yes, I'll personally deliver
items of your choosing.

634
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,891
Try a little harder.

635
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,896
Oh my, a door-to-door service?

636
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,689
That is quite amazing!

637
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:07,858
Oh my.

638
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,110
Is this that miraculous cream
that flattens out

639
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,321
every single wrinkle on you?

640
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,697
You're right.

641
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,491
You can give it a try.

642
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,284
Let's see.

643
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,205
My gosh.

644
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,749
My eye wrinkles are disappearing.

645
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,627
I feel ten years younger already.

646
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:33,884
Yes, your wrinkles
really disappeared in an instant.

647
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,220
Is this really only 59,900 won?

648
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,680
Is this not too cheap?

649
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,306
What's that?

650
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,100
Let me test it too.

651
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,977
Me too. Let me give it a try.

652
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,311
-Me first.
-Okay.

653
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,272
One second. Let me put it on you.

654
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,398
I was here first.

655
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:51,193
This is a limited edition
for in-flight duty-free services,

656
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,905
and a special promotion began
just this month.

657
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,116
I saw this a few times
at department stores,

658
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,827
but it was too tiny and expensive
for me to buy it.

659
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,453
This is my chance.

660
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,330
How many can I get? I'll take them all.

661
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,416
You can't take everything.

662
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,917
Don't be like that, young lady.

663
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,295
I can buy two of them.

664
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,421
No, I'll take them all.

665
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,298
How much can I get? Like 50?

666
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,384
You have made a very wonderful decision.

667
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,261
-You look so much younger.
-Really?

668
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,929
Yes, your wrinkles are gone.

669
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,472
-Already?
-Yes!

670
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,731
Mr. Gu, did you visit HR?

671
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:29,648
Why?

672
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,067
You couldn't find
an old personnel record, right?

673
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,654
He matched up every single file
with the hard copies since your visit

674
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,573
but found nothing and came to me crying.

675
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,658
He's begging you for the name.

676
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,659
Never mind.

677
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,453
Who is it? Who are you looking for?

678
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,454
It's fine.

679
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,497
Isn't it in our online database?

680
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,790
It was all digitized.

681
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,501
It wasn't on the server.
That's why I went for a hard copy.

682
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,962
Then the person
probably wasn't important here.

683
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,132
What?

684
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,010
If an employee's records
weren't kept in the files or the server,

685
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,012
it means they weren't important.

686
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:00,929
In a word,

687
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,514
a nobody.

688
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,935
What do you mean?

689
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,896
Those who are powerful

690
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,731
or important end up getting recorded.

691
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,316
I mean, some go down in history.

692
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,109
But for the rest of us,

693
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,112
it doesn't matter
if we disappear without a trace,

694
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,281
so their records get deleted.

695
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,742
I'm telling you for your sake.

696
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,619
Don't end up like your mom.

697
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,329
See?

698
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,622
Nobody remembers her.

699
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,917
Both you and me.

700
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,044
That's life for a loser.

701
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,550
No one in this world is a nobody.

702
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,813
Come on in.

703
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,857
I expected the prince to be fussy,

704
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,110
but he was rather friendly and polite.

705
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:01,115
He also promised me he'd have
all of his guests stay here from now on.

706
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,325
I knew you'd make this happen.

707
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,077
Thank you.

708
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:10,249
Invite Prince Samir
to our 100th anniversary.

709
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,166
Yes, Father.

710
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,546
I'd like to take charge
of the 100th-anniversary event.

711
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,005
What?

712
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,007
Do you know how important this is?

713
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:23,137
We only invite the very elite
among our VIP guests.

714
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,680
You can't handle that yet.

715
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,182
Know your stuff before you speak.

716
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,101
It's King Hotel's biggest event,

717
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,853
so it must be held at King the Land.

718
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,815
You must've had a tough time
managing everything alone.

719
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,984
You can leave it to me now.

720
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,865
Yes, you finally came to your senses.

721
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,992
Okay, you can take charge.

722
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:45,993
Father.

723
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,995
Won can't handle this yet.

724
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,457
Seeing how well he handled Prince Samir,
I think we can rely on him.

725
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,752
Hwa-ran, have faith in him
and let him try this.

726
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,504
You can do it, right?

727
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,339
-Yes.
-Great.

728
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,384
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

729
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,429
Let's eat.

730
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:11,310
Are you really starting something with me?

731
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,896
You said I'd have to
fight you for life here.

732
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,940
It's inevitable, so I'll try my best.

733
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,904
Do you think someone like you
has a chance against me?

734
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,322
I told you before

735
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:27,159
that someone like you
shouldn't own the company.

736
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,786
Since when did you care so much
about the company?

737
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,330
It's because you went too far.

738
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,249
If you placed an employee in danger
over some ginseng,

739
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,792
you should've at least sent help.

740
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,378
Or you could give the staff
the incentives they deserve

741
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,005
for bringing up sales.

742
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,465
What are you trying to do?

743
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:45,844
The employees are supposed to
earn their paychecks.

744
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,056
Why should we give them incentives

745
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,390
simply for doing their job?

746
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,895
-That sounds like you.
-Don't be snarky.

747
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,650
What are you betting in this fight?

748
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,736
I've put in everything.

749
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,072
I'm putting up my fight

750
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,491
with everything on the line.

751
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,501
I didn't want to fight.

752
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,462
But you keep getting me involved.

753
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:25,342
I keep seeing employees suffering
from unfair treatment.

754
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,843
I'm complicit if I stay put.

755
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,180
I'm going to try and protect the people

756
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,057
that you deem

757
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,434
as nobodies.

758
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,901
Who do you even think you are?

759
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,028
At the very least, I have a conscience.

760
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,239
So I'm better than you.

761
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,408
Let's have a good fight.

762
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,455
You know what?

763
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,792
Those who fight for others…

764
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,671
stand no chance against someone

765
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,923
who fights for themselves.

766
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,595
Good luck.

767
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,447
What's this?

768
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,537
Why are you there?

769
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,915
Let go of me. Let go.

770
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,584
Cheon Sa-rang.

771
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,627
No.

772
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,837
Let go of him.

773
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,754
Let me go!

774
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,675
No!

775
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,915
Hello, sir.

776
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,376
That's what you call being a nuisance.

777
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,254
It was a special request
from the head manager.

778
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,214
It may seem like a simple favor to you,

779
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,134
but for us,
it's an order that must be obeyed.

780
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,973
I'm sorry.

781
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,725
Did I keep you here late?

782
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:02,684
No, sir.

783
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,436
Even if it hadn't been you,

784
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,856
it's only natural for us to serve
every single guest with utmost care.

785
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,483
Please come by whenever you like.

786
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,027
I'll leave on time in the future.

787
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,570
Goodbye.

788
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,837
Tap on it and let it seep in.

789
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,923
That's nice.

790
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,050
Try it.

791
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,305
Hello?

792
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,307
May I see you?

793
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,059
Right now?

794
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,853
I'm busy right now.

795
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,939
-I'll see you next time.
-I'll go to you.

796
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,691
-You're going to come here?
-Yes.

797
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,527
I have something to say too.

798
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,823
-Is this important?
-Yes.

799
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:02,828
This isn't a place
to say something important.

800
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,829
I'll see you next time.

801
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,539
No, I have to see you now.

802
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,249
Where are you?

803
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,598
SAMSAM SPA, HOT KILN SAUNA

804
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,546
You found me all right.

805
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,965
-Hey.
-And you're in sauna attire too.

806
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,593
Why is everyone lounging around?

807
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:01,803
It's a sauna.

808
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,932
-Show me your arm.
-I know that.

809
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,185
So why is everyone lying here
instead of at their homes?

810
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,396
That's what people do here.

811
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,482
You have to wear it like this
not to lose it.

812
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,485
What did you have to say?

813
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,364
Do I have to say it here?

814
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,700
I told you.
That's why I wanted to see you later.

815
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,077
-Let's go outside.
-No.

816
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,787
My friends are here.

817
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,290
-Your friends?
-Oh my, Mr. No!

818
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,085
-What brings you here?
-Hey.

819
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,047
You should go.

820
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,632
It'll be a pain if you stay.

821
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,966
Hurry and go.

822
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,511
I wanted you as my wingman,

823
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,971
but you were an awful actor.

824
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,599
I'm doing so well.
Everything is sold out thanks to me.

825
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,935
Hey, I'm the one who did everything.

826
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,978
You need to act naturally to draw a crowd.

827
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,689
Mr. No, try one.

828
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,982
I'm fine.

829
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,948
Thank you.

830
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,127
Anyway,

831
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,587
wasn't I a good actor?

832
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,715
You were totally awful. So rigid.

833
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,009
You need to do better to draw people.

834
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,511
Try to be more natural.

835
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,305
Exactly. I said your role is important.

836
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,349
I won't help if you give me a hard time.

837
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,850
Let's go.

838
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,732
Did you skip dinner?

839
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,235
Is it your first time trying these?

840
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,489
I can't believe
you've never had these before.

841
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,658
Try this too. Here.

842
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,285
Thank you.

843
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,875
By the way, what's with these?

844
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,711
They don't seem like regular eggs.

845
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,254
-Let's go.
-Aren't they good?

846
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,047
They were roasted on a stone plate.

847
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,173
Go on. You can have these.

848
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,175
Goodness, thank you.

849
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,593
Hey, wait.

850
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,264
Are you here to eat eggs or to see me?

851
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,642
How could I leave before finishing these
when she kindly gave them to me?

852
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,938
This is quite delicious.

853
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,412
Wait.

854
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,248
How about Mr. No instead of Sa-rang?

855
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,083
Me?

856
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,669
The more the merrier, right?

857
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,796
-I say yes.
-Why won't you ask me?

858
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,215
Come on, we're all family.
Give her a hand.

859
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,800
Just be a wingman.

860
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,218
A wingman? For what?

861
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,429
He's not good at it.

862
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,430
It's not a big deal.

863
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,432
All you have to do
is memorize a few lines.

864
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:17,040
Wait, you can get duty-free items at home
without traveling abroad?

865
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,502
Yes, and you get an extra 10% off too.

866
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:23,088
Wait, an extra 10% off
of the duty-free prices?

867
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,255
Yes.

868
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,758
On top of that, just for today,

869
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,803
if you purchase red ginseng extract,
you get one for free.

870
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,597
Then I'll take four ginseng extract sets

871
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,057
and three multivitamins.

872
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,059
And one eye cream for you, babe.

873
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,728
Get your stuff while they're on sale.

874
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,855
You won't find another chance like this.

875
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,733
Wait, red ginseng is half off?
Which brand?

876
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,068
Let me see it too.

877
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,821
It's this one.

878
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,448
Right now, it's buy one, get one free.

879
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,158
I see. Duty-free items.

880
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,743
Is anything else on sale?

881
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,994
Everything.

882
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,705
Cosmetics, liquor, accessories,
health supplements, everything.

883
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,125
Take your time
and let me know whatever you need.

884
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,876
-This one's good.
-It's cheaper than duty-free?

885
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,628
Of course.

886
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,131
I bought this from her last time,

887
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,384
and it was half the price
you see at department stores.

888
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,511
You can't travel abroad every single day,

889
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,179
so I think this is a great chance.

890
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,389
This is wonderful.

891
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,891
-My gosh.
-You want three? You won't even finish it.

892
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,810
-Just get two.
-These are half off.

893
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,688
-Two, two, two, so six packs.
-So cheap.

894
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,565
-Right?
-This is great!

895
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,276
You should probably get one each.

896
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,652
This is the cheapest one.

897
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:28,987
You wanted to get this.

898
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,656
-Yes, this is it.
-Really?

899
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,200
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

900
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,249
You'll be able to reach the top
after a few more rounds.

901
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,375
Thank you.

902
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,669
I'll never forget your help.

903
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,921
Thank you, Mr. No.

904
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,090
Well, I'm good at everything.

905
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,675
You were really good.

906
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,428
You'll make a living
no matter where you go.

907
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,265
Anyway, do you have to go this far?

908
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,433
This is illegal.

909
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,727
It's not illegal.

910
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,270
It's not, right?

911
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,944
It's not illegal, right?

912
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,323
It is.

913
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,659
It is?

914
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,621
Only I didn't know?

915
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,998
I'm sorry.

916
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,500
I thought you knew.

917
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,876
This is really wrong.

918
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,127
Why are you taking it so far?

919
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,795
Don't be so harsh on her.

920
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,923
She must've been pressured into doing it.

921
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,467
And she's paying
for that extra discount too.

922
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,177
Why would you even spend your own money?

923
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,345
What if you get caught?

924
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,013
Because I have to.

925
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,935
Let's stop now.

926
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,103
Wrongdoing isn't for everyone.

927
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,982
People like us can't sleep in peace
after we do something wrong.

928
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,860
This darned conscience.

929
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,363
Why do we stay honest
when nobody gives us the credit?

930
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,614
Who cares if no one does?

931
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,782
We can give it to each other.

932
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,161
We all know that
Pyeong-hwa is a great worker.

933
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,455
Yes, our little bear is the best.

934
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,582
Stop it.

935
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,918
Who cares if it's just you two?

936
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,545
I'll give you the credit too.

937
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,005
What good is that, Mr. No?

938
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,757
But still, I'll give it to you.

939
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,010
I'll remember that the company
made you take things this far.

940
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,346
I won't forget it.

941
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,557
Thank you for saying that.

942
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:24,644
The ones who should know that
are those up high and not you, Mr. No.

943
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,529
You'll see a better day. I know it.

944
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,031
Let's make a toast for that day.

945
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,201
Sounds great. Cheers!

946
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,786
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

947
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,166
It was wonderful to see you
try so hard today.

948
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,044
You were the best one.

949
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,053
Mr. No?

950
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,055
Do you want to play?

951
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:11,774
Mr. No.

952
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,526
You like Sa-rang, right?

953
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,070
Do you even need to ask?

954
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,030
It's so obvious.

955
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,489
No.

956
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,824
What? Really?

957
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,494
Then we'll lose you
and go with the Arab prince.

958
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,080
Why are you bringing him up right now?

959
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,334
He's a total player
with the worst personality.

960
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,170
He called Sa-rang last night.

961
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:35,882
He offered to fly us out to Dubai
on a private jet this summer.

962
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,092
That prince's generosity
is out of this world.

963
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,386
We're in for a treat thanks to Sa-rang.

964
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,763
He called?

965
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,264
Wait.

966
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:47,185
I clearly remember you two saying
I pass as Sa-rang's boyfriend.

967
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,270
You both said you'd take my side.

968
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,271
Me?

969
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,189
Yes.

970
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:54,150
To be exact, it was both of you,
including Pyeong-hwa.

971
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,443
Me too?

972
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,279
Yes, I clearly remember your approval.

973
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,659
My gosh. Is betrayal your specialty?

974
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:04,786
This isn't betrayal.

975
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,871
We're just being smart.

976
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,665
Dubai is calling us!

977
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,964
Hey, we're all one big family.

978
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,299
Let's not do this.

979
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,885
But you said you didn't like her.

980
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:23,137
So I think we're done here.

981
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,138
Wait.

982
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,391
Let us

983
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,601
chat some more

984
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,312
until we use up all these coins.

985
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,692
Please sit.

986
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,575
Tell her.

987
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,494
Tell her what?

988
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,995
How you feel.

989
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,455
"I like you. Go out with me."

990
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,249
How is that so difficult?

991
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,752
Do I have to say it in words?

992
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:56,921
It's the heart that counts.

993
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,673
She won't know if you don't say it.

994
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,759
If you keep beating around the bush,
you'll end up losing her.

995
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,095
Just ask her out.

996
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:33,875
Nice!

997
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,013
Isn't a cold treat nice

998
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,140
after sitting in the hot sauna?

999
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,141
Yes.

1000
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,642
I get why people come here.

1001
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,190
Thank you for today.

1002
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,651
We're all one big family,
so we should help each other out.

1003
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,614
You've changed a lot.

1004
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,826
You used to be so scathing,
but you even make jokes now.

1005
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,674
Are you free next weekend?

1006
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,886
Why do you ask?

1007
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,516
I want to talk about us.

1008
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,685
About us?

1009
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,897
Yes, about us.

1010
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,776
Let's talk about us.

1011
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,201
Okay.

1012
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,687
WONSIKDANG

1013
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:17,747
Welcome.

1014
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,165
What's all this?

1015
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,875
Are you Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

1016
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,836
-Yes.
-May I take your coat?

1017
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,088
Thank you.

1018
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,558
This way, please.

1019
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,687
Thank you.

1020
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,529
Our restaurant only serves
the chef's special.

1021
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,739
Is that all right?

1022
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,951
Yes, please serve me your best.

1023
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,037
So who's the chef?

1024
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,205
I'm today's chef,

1025
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,581
Gu Won.

1026
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,124
I see. Do you also cook?

1027
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:05,920
It'd be faster if you asked
for the things I couldn't do.

1028
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:11,258
I remember that
you couldn't even peel an onion.

1029
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,344
Please forget that ancient history.

1030
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,764
I received special training
from the best chef,

1031
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,641
so please be rest assured.

1032
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,934
You're quite passionate.

1033
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,978
I will let go of my worries.

1034
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,314
I'm solely in charge
of cooking and serving tonight.

1035
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,524
So I ask

1036
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,652
for your generous understanding
even if you face a bit of delay.

1037
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,153
Sure, I'm okay with that.

1038
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,614
Please take your time
and bring me delicious dishes.

1039
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,706
We must have a drink on a night like this.

1040
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,876
I made this sangria myself.

1041
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,255
You made this yourself?

1042
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,172
Yes.

1043
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,133
Let me try it.

1044
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,308
This is really good.

1045
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,107
The appetizer.

1046
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,363
How could I eat something this cute?

1047
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,656
Then you can just stare at it.

1048
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,324
No, I must try it.

1049
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,743
Thank you.

1050
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,459
-This is so good.
-Of course.

1051
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,586
So you really can cook.

1052
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,671
The problem is that
I'm good at everything.

1053
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,423
Look forward to the next dish.

1054
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:33,549
Okay.

1055
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:27,144
Pasta.

1056
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,647
Let me try this.

1057
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,532
This is really good.

1058
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:41,200
You should try it too.

1059
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:43,494
Here.

1060
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,376
-Pretty good.
-It's not just good.

1061
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,503
It's really delicious.

1062
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,130
Chef Gu.

1063
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,007
This is excellent.

1064
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,260
Thank you for noticing.

1065
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:00,928
You made it all worthwhile.

1066
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,640
Anyway, what's the occasion?

1067
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,645
It's a very important day.

1068
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,022
What is it?

1069
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,900
A day to treat my VIP, Ms. Cheon.

1070
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,404
It finally hit me when Samir was here.

1071
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:22,324
I found out what it felt like
to humor and serve all kinds of jerks.

1072
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:27,079
Then I realized you must've made
a lot of effort to be the best talent,

1073
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,832
so I wanted to treat you with my best.

1074
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,376
I knew it.

1075
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,839
I felt like I was warmly welcomed
as soon as I entered.

1076
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:38,257
I'm glad you felt that way.

1077
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,050
So sincerity always works.

1078
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,803
Thank you.

1079
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:46,223
It's an honor to enjoy
such wonderful dishes.

1080
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,352
Also,

1081
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:55,316
I'd like to have
a serious conversation with you.

1082
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,235
What's it about?

1083
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,698
That's to come after dinner.

1084
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,575
I'll tell you then.

1085
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:07,578
The best part is yet to come,
so give me a minute.

1086
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:08,829
What is it?

1087
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,290
Do you want to know?

1088
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:18,130
-May I have another glass?
-One second.

1089
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,549
-I'll bring it over after this.
-I can get it.

1090
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,898
You're kind of cool today.

1091
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:37,233
I'm always cool.

1092
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:41,695
Now.

1093
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,782
This is the highlight of the meal.

1094
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,898
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

1095
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:19,984
No.

1096
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,656
What will you do with all these?

1097
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,621
As long as you aren't hurt,

1098
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,540
it's all right.

1099
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,421
Do I have…

1100
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:24,757
permission?

1101
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,516
KING THE LAND

1102
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,092
-Are you upset?
-As if.

1103
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,385
Don't be upset.

1104
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,305
-That's not--
-Forget it.

1105
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:20,474
You have feelings for Sa-rang, don't you?

1106
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,522
You don't pass as Sa-rang's partner.

1107
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,898
Be careful!

1108
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,526
Sa-rang!

1109
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,445
Mr. Gu!

1110
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,240
I heard you finally declared war
against Ms. Gu.

1111
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,492
I will take charge of the hotel.

1112
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:40,410
Are you okay?

1113
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,162
No.

1114
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:44,790
I'll leave in a bit.
It's because I want to see you.

1115
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,458
Mr. Gu!

1116
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:54,466
