1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,804
What happened?

3
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,556
There's nothing they can do
in this bad weather.

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,975
They'll resume the search when it clears…

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,226
No, it'll be too late.

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,686
They already pulled out.

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,729
You should wait.

8
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,356
Get the helicopter.

9
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,941
The helicopter?

10
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,026
What helicopter?

11
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,569
How am I going to do that?

12
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,362
And what will you do with it?

13
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,280
I should go.

14
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,324
You can't fly there in this lousy weather.

15
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,285
And you can't use it
without Ms. Gu's permission.

16
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,833
Are you saying there's a risk?

17
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,004
At first, it may look like
the revenues are going up,

18
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,506
but it's only an illusion.

19
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,050
In the long run,
the net profit is bound to drop--

20
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,177
Are you saying I'm wrong?

21
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,055
Oh, no.

22
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,766
Do I lack long-term perspective
on our business?

23
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,726
No, ma'am.

24
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,103
Which means
what I've done so far is right.

25
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,605
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,484
If I'm right and all of you are wrong,

27
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,195
why are you all sitting here?

28
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,868
Retailing is a tug-of-war
between stability and venture.

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,538
In order to prove our investment in Alanga

30
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,374
hasn't just been a venturous move…

31
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,462
What do you want?

32
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,713
I need a helicopter.

33
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm in a meeting.

34
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,007
One of our staff is missing.

35
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,926
-I received the report.
-Then what?

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,637
This meeting isn't for that matter.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,680
So?

38
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,890
I need the helicopter.

39
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,142
I hear I need your permission.

40
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,566
Mr. Gu.

41
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,361
Is there anybody here
who holds a position lower than you?

42
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,365
You've acted cheeky enough
as the chairman's son today.

43
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,952
If you need my approval,
stick to the formal procedures.

44
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,128
I apologize for my intrusion.

45
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,172
One of our staff
is stranded in the mountains.

46
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,675
She isn't answering her phone,
but her location can be tracked.

47
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,344
The search was suspended
due to the weather.

48
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,262
That's why I need

49
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,222
the company's helicopter.

50
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,640
Okay. We'll talk later.

51
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,893
-Ms.Gu.
-Get out.

52
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,061
-I have no time for that.
-Nobody here does.

53
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,189
Don't you see that
we're in a meeting right now?

54
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,284
Please.

55
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,997
No company would use its helicopter
to find a mere employee.

56
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,417
Do you know how much
a helicopter flight costs?

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,793
Come to your senses.

58
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
Hwa-ran.

59
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,091
You're the one who sent them.

60
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,346
If you were going to be so anxious,
you shouldn't have sent them.

61
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,849
Let's continue.

62
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,559
Where were we?

63
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,687
That our investment in Alanga
wasn't just a venturous move.

64
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,650
I always wanted to turn Alanga
into a world-famous luxury brand.

65
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,818
-To do that--
-It's all a dream.

66
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,697
A company that's too busy making money

67
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,575
to care about the safety of its employee

68
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,619
can't possibly turn into a luxury brand.

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,664
It's nothing but a vain dream.

70
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,707
Such big words from a guy without one.

71
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,792
Right?

72
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,086
I'll get the helicopter running.

73
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,630
I'll show you how cheeky I can get.

74
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,551
Make a fortune, everyone.

75
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,100
Get the helicopter running now.

76
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,727
I know Ms. Gu Hwa-ran hasn't approved.

77
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,397
I'm Gu Won.

78
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,190
I'll take responsibility.

79
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,360
You had to fight her someday,
so great job.

80
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,029
Ms. Gu won't boss you around
after you put your foot down.

81
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,865
You've put up a good fight
in your first power game.

82
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,367
This is about saving a life.

83
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,410
It's not about power.

84
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,787
You need power to save people.

85
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,872
You should go home.

86
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,332
I'll update you on her rescue.

87
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,042
I'm not going home.

88
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,003
There's nothing more you can do here.

89
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,337
I'll stay.

90
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,089
I'm going.

91
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,802
Are you insane? In this weather?

92
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,095
I know you're blinded by love,

93
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,596
-but this is wrong!
-Let go.

94
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,683
What will become of me
if something happens to you?

95
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,477
You're my only connection at work!

96
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,730
As I said, you picked the wrong man.

97
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
Let go of that connection and me.

98
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,608
Over my dead body!

99
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,195
If you must go,
you'll have to step over me!

100
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,322
Lie down!

101
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,283
What? I can't hear you!

102
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,576
Quickly! There's no time!

103
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,955
Then enjoy your flight!

104
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,248
This way, please!

105
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,794
You must come back alive!

106
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,140
You have to fly safely!

107
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,392
Be careful!

108
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,653
EPISODE 6

109
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,242
What was that?

110
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,286
I'm scared.

111
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,955
Am I going to die?

112
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,375
I'm scared, Grandma.

113
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,935
What are you doing?

114
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,645
-Go away!
-It's me!

115
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,397
-Get off of me!
-It's me!

116
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,444
Mr. Gu?

117
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,361
Yes.

118
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,988
It's me.

119
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,282
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

120
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,080
Are you a human? Not a ghost?

121
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,498
Yes, it's me.

122
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,260
I was so scared that I'd die here.

123
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,765
-You're fine.
-Thank you.

124
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,933
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

125
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,894
I'm here now.

126
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,024
I thought I was going to die.

127
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,861
Target rescued.

128
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,821
She looks fine.

129
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,364
I must turn due to strong winds.

130
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,619
How did you get here?

131
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,747
-On a helicopter.
-You even borrowed a helicopter?

132
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,457
I had one at home.

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,792
Why do you have a helicopter…

134
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,048
You probably do.

135
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,719
Anyway, how are we going to get back up?

136
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,224
We should get back up.

137
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,187
You didn't come alone, right?

138
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,897
They'll throw a rope down, right?

139
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,401
Wait.

140
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,071
Did you come alone without a plan?

141
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,992
It's better than being here by yourself.

142
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,663
Well, I guess so.

143
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,580
But still…

144
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,874
When I came to my senses,
I was already in the helicopter.

145
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,128
I didn't have a moment to think.

146
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,800
All I knew was I had to come and save you.

147
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,679
Why?

148
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,432
I wonder.

149
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,355
Why did I do that?

150
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,832
So what are we going to do now?

151
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,213
Don't worry.

152
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,298
I'm here.

153
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,184
Hello? It's me, Gu Won.

154
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,230
Help.

155
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,034
Why are you laughing?

156
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,162
No reason.

157
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,206
"Help."

158
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,127
They'll send a rescue team in the morning.

159
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,713
So hang in there until then.

160
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,508
What a relief.

161
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,427
I'll protect you.

162
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,815
My gosh.

163
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,569
What was that?

164
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,988
I heard something. Something must be here.

165
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,158
You said you'd protect me.

166
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,748
I wasn't hiding. I was guarding your back.

167
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,792
Okay? I always say this.

168
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,088
Enemies always come from behind.

169
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,005
So--

170
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,050
My gosh! You surprised me.

171
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,095
Jeez.

172
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,809
You're scared so easily.

173
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,061
No, I'm not.

174
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,718
Have a hearty bite.

175
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,888
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

176
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,355
I've never seen such a cowardly guy.

177
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,775
Whether it's a ghost or a boar,
you should knock it out like a man.

178
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,736
Good grief. I still remember your shriek.

179
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,779
I agree.

180
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,656
Wait, what?

181
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,909
It wasn't a shriek. It was a battle cry.

182
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,161
Like a roar.

183
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,078
Bam!

184
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,247
Something like that.

185
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,458
So you're from King Hotel?

186
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,711
Yes. I apologize for causing you trouble.

187
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,298
I heard a lady who went to look for me
hadn't returned, so I went to find you.

188
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,383
Why weren't you careful in this weather?

189
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,718
Are you brave or just reckless?

190
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,719
She's thoughtless.

191
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,888
Who cares if your company
made you do this?

192
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,348
Your company means nothing
once you're dead.

193
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,100
Don't put out your life for work.

194
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,894
There's nothing as foolish as that.

195
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,811
You're right.

196
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,064
I wanted to ignore the order,
but someone high up made me do it.

197
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,150
Someone high up? Who?

198
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,776
This man.

199
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,661
This is so tasty. Thank you.

200
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,787
Eat up.

201
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,420
You should get a checkup

202
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,339
at the nearest hospital in the morning.

203
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,675
No, I have no time for that.

204
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,803
I have to go to work right away
for a night shift.

205
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,181
Who cares about work?

206
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,016
Do as someone high up tells you.

207
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,353
And in the future,

208
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,605
don't put your life on the line
for the company.

209
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,858
I don't want to do that either,
but it keeps happening.

210
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,443
Just say no.

211
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,575
There's no choice
for a mere employee like me.

212
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,462
I promise.

213
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,383
Something like this

214
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,844
will never happen again.

215
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,414
What are you doing this early?

216
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,251
I wanted to sweep the yard
before he woke up.

217
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,921
Would he care that you did this for him?

218
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,590
I came to give him a hand,
so I should work.

219
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,139
Give it to me. I got it.

220
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,557
No, I'll do it.

221
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,268
-No, I'll have it.
-No, it's fine.

222
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,479
You don't seem like a good sweeper.

223
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,772
I got it. Give it here.

224
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,856
It's okay. Move aside.

225
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,857
-Let go.
-I got this.

226
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,025
-Move.
-You aren't so good.

227
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,109
-Please move.
-Give it.

228
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,194
Good grief!

229
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,529
Why do you keep getting in my way?

230
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,202
Mr. Gu.

231
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,162
I've never been hit before.

232
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,705
Are you all right?

233
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,707
-I'm fine.
-Goodness.

234
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,252
Give it to me.

235
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,504
-I'll do it.
-No.

236
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,255
-I got this.
-I'll do it.

237
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,256
-Let go.
-I'm sorry.

238
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,967
No, it's okay. Let go of this.

239
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,510
I'll do it.

240
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,972
That's not how you sweep. Look.

241
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,931
Like this.

242
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,475
This.

243
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,477
This.

244
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,145
And this.

245
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,606
-This is how it's done.
-Hold on.

246
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,111
Hey.

247
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,237
I…

248
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,572
Are you okay?

249
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,492
You hit exactly
where I got injured yesterday.

250
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,410
Wait, I…

251
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,787
That stone.

252
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,997
Sit down.

253
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,836
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

254
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,172
Could…

255
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,317
It hurts more than it did yesterday.

256
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,737
I'm in so much pain.

257
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,620
It hurts so bad.

258
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,539
It must hurt a lot.

259
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,792
I'll clean up, so sit right there.

260
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,710
Don't move.

261
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,295
I'll do everything.

262
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,967
It seemed like
you didn't know how to sweep.

263
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,304
I've never seen
a broom like this before, but look.

264
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,645
-Right here too.
-Okay.

265
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,487
-I'm good, aren't I?
-You're so good!

266
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,341
These are our hotel's cake and cookies.

267
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,802
I heard you like these,
so I had them made specially.

268
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,678
It's a little dirty.

269
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,180
Thanks. I'll enjoy these.

270
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,183
Please work with us in the future

271
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,684
and send us some good ginseng.

272
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,771
I only work with First Royal Hotel,

273
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,731
so save yourself the trouble and go home.

274
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,359
Let me know if you need any help.

275
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,777
I'll help you before I go.

276
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,071
We said we were fine. You don't have to.

277
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,030
There's no need.

278
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,032
Go home and look after yourself.

279
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,534
Anything is fine.

280
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,244
I can clean and do the laundry too.

281
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,079
Did the man high up make you do this?

282
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,956
I didn't, sir.

283
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,332
Yes, it was you.

284
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,543
There's no need, so go home.

285
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,087
You already swept my yard
early this morning.

286
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,130
That was me.

287
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,801
If you get sick of your work,
quit and come here.

288
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,887
You're good enough at hiking
to be a ginseng digger.

289
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,931
Right, the ginseng!

290
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,432
One second.

291
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,559
What?

292
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,484
Sir, please take a look.

293
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,654
I dug this up yesterday on the mountain.

294
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,406
By any chance,

295
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,199
is this ginseng?

296
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,370
You think anyone can dig up ginseng?

297
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,772
It's not ginseng, is it?

298
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,649
It must be bellflower root.

299
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,069
You don't have to ask.
It's obviously bellflower root.

300
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,281
It's ginseng.

301
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,741
-What?
-Really?

302
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,950
Wild ginseng at that.

303
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,037
This is such a rarity.

304
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,122
Not anyone can dig this.

305
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,250
We say it requires three generations
of good deeds to find one.

306
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,878
You dug up this rare thing
even I've only found once.

307
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,379
Miss.

308
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,964
You must have lived a good life.

309
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,800
Gosh, I kind of did.

310
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,265
Do you want to come and work with me?

311
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,768
Mount Jiri has approved of you.

312
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,729
Sir.

313
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,690
Goodness.

314
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,858
I'm sorry.

315
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,985
I will not allow that.

316
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,571
She's a valuable member of our company.

317
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,573
All of a sudden?

318
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,992
She's the best talent at our hotel,

319
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,828
and she secured that position
two years in a row.

320
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,956
-Yes.
-Two years.

321
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,957
Sure.

322
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,333
Please let go of me.

323
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,460
What was that?

324
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,505
Thank you for saving me, sir.

325
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,673
I saved you.

326
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,799
You can have this.

327
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,842
If you hadn't saved me last night,

328
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,844
I would've died in the woods.

329
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,304
No, I saved you.

330
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,973
You should repay me instead.

331
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,683
-I'll take it.
-Hey!

332
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,103
I can't take this.

333
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,604
It's too valuable.

334
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,022
No, please take it.

335
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,650
I can't take something
that the heavens gave you.

336
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,402
You should give it to your father.

337
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,154
I don't have one.

338
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,115
Then your mother.

339
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,575
I don't have a mother either.

340
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,160
What? Then…

341
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,746
Then what will you do with this?

342
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,416
I'll give it to my grandma.
She'll be thrilled.

343
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,960
Yes, give it to your grandmother.

344
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,796
Hold on. I'll pack it up for you.

345
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,223
Something this precious

346
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,600
deserves careful treatment.

347
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,478
Thank you.

348
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,148
So please consider our hotel too.

349
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,860
I received great energy today
thanks to you.

350
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,446
When I come across the best wild ginseng,

351
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,114
I'll send it to King Hotel immediately.

352
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,450
Don't worry and go home.

353
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,617
Really?

354
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,369
Are you serious?

355
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,455
It's a promise.
You can't change your mind.

356
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,497
All right.

357
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,208
If you change your mind,
join me right away.

358
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,126
You are

359
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,211
a natural-born ginseng digger!

360
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,424
You're right. I found ginseng!

361
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,177
I found ginseng!

362
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,350
I'll send you ginseng

363
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,394
as I find them in the future,

364
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,313
so stop sending your employees here.

365
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,024
You shouldn't do that to them.

366
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,818
I used to take advantage of
those hotel employees

367
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,987
whenever they came out here.

368
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,657
But I came to my senses thanks to her.

369
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,412
She could've gotten into serious trouble.

370
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,630
I wasn't the one who sent her…

371
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,256
I did.

372
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,386
Thank you for your help.

373
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,700
It's fine.

374
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,495
I'm fine, really.

375
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,623
Just say thanks.

376
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,126
Thank you, sir.

377
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,921
No, not like that.

378
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,140
I thank you
from the bottom of my heart, Mr. Gu.

379
00:23:56,184 --> 00:24:01,273
I mean, do you and I have to be
so formal just to say thanks?

380
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,193
It'd be mutiny if I skipped the formality.

381
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,071
Forget it.

382
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,781
Why do I bother?

383
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,373
You should've returned with the helicopter
and not stayed here.

384
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,208
I had to drive five hours for you.

385
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,752
-Sa-rang, are you okay?
-Yes.

386
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,005
Take this.

387
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,299
I didn't ask you to come.

388
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,217
You made a big scene at work

389
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,136
trying to help one of your employees.

390
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,596
The chairman wants to see you.

391
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,140
Are you hurt?

392
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,892
I'm fine.

393
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,520
What about work?
Did something happen there?

394
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,899
He barged into Ms. Gu's meeting
to get the helicopter--

395
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,402
Hey, that's enough. Let's go.

396
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,446
He had a go at her.

397
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,074
-Please get in.
-Hop in.

398
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,161
Let's go.

399
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,212
Hey, you can…

400
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,259
Okay.

401
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,472
Yes?

402
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,599
Back here.

403
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,853
Okay.

404
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,739
I'll close the door, sir.

405
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,666
He could've closed it himself.

406
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,001
He's so high maintenance.

407
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,254
-Try to understand.
-Okay.

408
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,714
I can hear you.

409
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,132
I'll start driving, sir.

410
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,846
Are you sure you're okay?

411
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,349
I almost died.

412
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,851
Exactly. I was so worried

413
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,937
that I drove over without sleeping.

414
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,021
Thank you.

415
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,147
My leg was in pain,

416
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,191
so I was dreading the bus ride home.

417
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,693
You're thankful, aren't you?

418
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,028
Then you can treat me to a meal.

419
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,571
Sure.

420
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,614
Really?

421
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,825
What should we eat?

422
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,159
What do you like?

423
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,413
You should decide, Mr. No. It's my treat.

424
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,497
"Mr. No"?

425
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,457
I'm shocked at the formality.

426
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,375
Call me Sang-sik.

427
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,794
You did that last time.

428
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,005
I'll really do that if you keep saying it.

429
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,840
Of course you should.

430
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,301
It was me!

431
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,096
-What was?
-I saved her!

432
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,348
Why should you two eat when I saved her?

433
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,851
This is illogical and inconsiderate.

434
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,144
What are you two doing?

435
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,314
I'll stop by the service area, sir.

436
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,026
-Rain check on the meal.
-Your meal is off!

437
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,736
Don't eat with her!

438
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,701
Sa-rang, eat up. It's my treat.

439
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,202
-Thank you.
-Sure.

440
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,289
The signature snack here is the sausage.

441
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,248
This is mine.

442
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,752
He's such an eyesore today.

443
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,795
Pick anything you like
but the sausage, sir.

444
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,839
-I don't want anything.
-Why not?

445
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,758
The key. I'll drive. Sit in the back.

446
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,551
I'd be grateful.

447
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,139
-And pull this out.
-What?

448
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,775
See?

449
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,486
This is how you succeed in life.
Learn from me.

450
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,364
He treats me like this
because I'm that essential.

451
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,865
Right?

452
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,825
You must be happy.

453
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,494
Let's go quietly.

454
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,412
You'll get treated as you do,

455
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,331
-so just follow my example.
-Okay.

456
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,043
Mr. Gu, do you want to try one?

457
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,169
Forget it.

458
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,296
Try one. It's really good.

459
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,432
No, he doesn't want any.

460
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,351
He'll get sick if he's forced to eat.

461
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,103
I'll eat it.

462
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,688
I'll put it on this stick.

463
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,191
Isn't it good?

464
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,152
Walnut cakes from rest stops
always taste great.

465
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,445
It's delicious.

466
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,490
-You can have more.
-No, you go ahead.

467
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,076
Walnut cakes are best with coffee.

468
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,289
I need to go to the restroom.

469
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,542
I think a little came out.

470
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,723
He must have a bad stomachache.

471
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,349
That's what he gets for binge eating.

472
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,475
Will he be okay?

473
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,395
No way.

474
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,147
Are you worried?

475
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,356
Of course I am.

476
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:56,943
What about me?

477
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,155
-Sorry?
-Why don't you worry about me?

478
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,031
I'm the one who saved you,

479
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,952
but the ginseng, the meal, and your worry
are always for someone else.

480
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,415
Well,

481
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,876
I can worry about you too.
Tell me what about.

482
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,003
Forget it.

483
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,678
Hey, are you okay?
Are you in a lot of pain?

484
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,097
No.

485
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,183
I must have a stomachache.

486
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,894
Take the week off as sick leave.

487
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,104
Use the corporate card
to eat, sleep, and play.

488
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,481
Really?

489
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,107
Thank you.

490
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,109
Don't thank me. I'm abandoning you here.

491
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,737
With such terms,
feel free to abandon me at any time.

492
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,905
Keep abandoning me.

493
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,657
Drive carefully.

494
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,453
Have fun on your date.

495
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,663
Hello?

496
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,209
He hung up. I was talking to myself.

497
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,086
I almost died.

498
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,483
Where is it?

499
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,528
-Pardon?
-Your grandmother's place.

500
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,488
Let's give her the ginseng.

501
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,074
But the chairman called you.

502
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,909
It's fine. Tell me.

503
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,161
I'm okay, really. I'll go alone later.

504
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,287
Tell me.

505
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,710
It's really okay.

506
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,553
JOAS

507
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:48,972
Miss?

508
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,892
How may I help you?

509
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,645
How much do you get
for selling one of these?

510
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,481
-Sorry?
-Your incentives. I'm sure you get some.

511
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,900
We do not get incentives.

512
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,027
What an awful company.

513
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,948
Our company, Joas, gives huge incentives
for the sale of even a single item.

514
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,451
I'm in the diamond tier,
and I make 40 million won a month.

515
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,786
Fate must've led me to you.

516
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,539
I'll let you join us under me.
What do you think?

517
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,456
Excuse me, miss.

518
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,459
Please excuse me.

519
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,630
How may I help you?

520
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,673
I heard everything,

521
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,716
so fill this out.

522
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,718
It's the membership application for Joas.

523
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,636
I'm sorry.

524
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,514
-We aren't allowed--
-Your company doesn't give you a dime.

525
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,766
You'll easily make
50 to 60 million a month with me.

526
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,851
I'm sorry.

527
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,978
Company policy doesn't allow me to do so.

528
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,771
You don't have to do anything.
Just fill it out.

529
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,316
Your name, phone number,
and resident ID number.

530
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,609
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,736
Everything is possible in this country.

532
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,738
-Where are your manners?
-What?

533
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,740
She was going to join under my name.

534
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,117
How dare you rain on my parade?

535
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,035
Me?

536
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,162
Whoever gives her
the application first wins.

537
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,330
Miss, fill it out.

538
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,165
How dare you pull this kind of crap?

539
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,626
You already stole
one of my members last time!

540
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,210
-You punk!
-What's with you, old lady?

541
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,420
-Please calm down.
-Old lady?

542
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,130
-Yes!
-Old lady?

543
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,673
I'm going to kill you.

544
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,841
Come here!

545
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,134
-You!
-What's with you?

546
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,636
-Sir, calm down.
-You trashy lady!

547
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,596
-Trashy? You little…
-Please calm down.

548
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,648
Have you lost your mind?

549
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,483
-You!
-Yes, I've lost my mind!

550
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,319
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're experiencing turbulence.

551
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,779
For your safety,

552
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,698
please make sure
your seatbelt is fastened.

553
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,579
That almost killed me.

554
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,708
Have some water.

555
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,335
Thanks.

556
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,091
Pyeong-hwa.

557
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,009
Where's your shoe?

558
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,849
Let's organize the cart and go out.

559
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,434
You're going back out

560
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,478
without your shoe?

561
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,689
Is this improper?

562
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,856
Yes.

563
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,901
We have time until we land,
so we have to sell more.

564
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,071
Where did it go?

565
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,280
Looking for this?

566
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,544
-Should I put it on for you?
-No.

567
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,504
I can do it.

568
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,800
Thanks.

569
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,593
I'll look after my stuff from now on.

570
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,431
Even if you lose it again,
I'll find it for you.

571
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,327
This is it.

572
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,706
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

573
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,124
"Cow's head gukbap"?

574
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,002
Is the soup made with a cow's whole head?

575
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,213
No, not the head, but head meat.

576
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,757
Do you want to try it?

577
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,758
No, I'm fine.

578
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,634
You should go inside.

579
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,096
Thank you for the ride.
Please get back safely.

580
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,557
I'll wait.

581
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,102
No, I'll be a while. You should go.

582
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,062
Goodbye.

583
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,030
Right, where is that…

584
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,991
Grandma, I'm here.

585
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,076
What?

586
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,410
How come you're here?

587
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,328
What about work?

588
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,830
Look, wild ginseng.
I brought this for you.

589
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,957
Sure. Put the apron on.

590
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,376
This is wild ginseng I dug up myself.

591
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,128
-Look.
-I get it.

592
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,379
So start serving these.

593
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,298
Don't forget those too. Hurry.

594
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,119
-A bottle of rice wine, please.
-How is it?

595
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,251
-My daughter-in-law!
-Yes?

596
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,544
Another bowl of rice.

597
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,355
-Hey!
-My goodness!

598
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,110
Who are you with?

599
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,946
-Sorry?
-Who are you

600
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,575
to peek at a woman
through a tiny little crack in the window?

601
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,786
Peeking? I was just looking.

602
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,329
Exactly.

603
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:10,001
Why were you looking at my Sa-rang
with those leering eyes?

604
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,627
Leering?

605
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,381
She wouldn't come out,
so I was wondering what she was doing.

606
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,009
"My Sa-rang"?
Are you Ms. Cheon's grandmother?

607
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,345
Are you her colleague?

608
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,265
Yes.

609
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,018
You should've said so from the get-go.

610
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,144
Okay.

611
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,397
Pick these up and follow me.

612
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:33,816
What do you mean?

613
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,958
Sit.

614
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,084
Pardon?

615
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,127
Sit down.

616
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,259
Take this.

617
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,011
Sit down.

618
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,846
Okay.

619
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,936
You've peeled onions before, right?

620
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:10,895
No.

621
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:11,938
What?

622
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,774
How dare you lie to me?

623
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,693
I really haven't.

624
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,528
So? You can't do this?

625
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,156
-No.
-Don't be a wimp and do as I say!

626
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,784
Grandma, orders are piling up.

627
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,495
-Why aren't you here?
-Tell them to go if they won't wait.

628
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,996
They can eat somewhere else.

629
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,167
Now, look.

630
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,295
Cut off this part first.

631
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,632
Then cut off the other part.

632
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,635
Once you peel off this part,

633
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,178
you'll see this.

634
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,973
This is your job.

635
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,516
Me?

636
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,017
Why?

637
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,936
Just do as I say.

638
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,437
You'll be blessed.

639
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,439
Grandma, orders are piling up!

640
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,276
-Ms. Cheon…
-Okay, I'm coming.

641
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,819
Good grief, those punks.

642
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:00,861
Peel them.

643
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,367
What's with them?

644
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,545
From this

645
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,046
to this.

646
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,256
Okay.

647
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,721
Let's see.

648
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,475
What?

649
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,601
My goodness.

650
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,811
You ruined these perfectly good onions.

651
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,772
What should I do now?

652
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,483
Did you cut these with your foot?

653
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,193
Goodness.

654
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,654
I'm the one who's at fault
for leaving you with this job.

655
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,031
Good grief!

656
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,909
I can't deal with this. Goodness.

657
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,786
I can't believe it.

658
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,246
Why am I in tears?

659
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,883
My gosh!

660
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,845
What are you doing there?

661
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,140
I mean…

662
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,434
Where did you get this apron?

663
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,769
Your grandmother gave it to me.

664
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,105
Did you meet her?

665
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,981
You shouldn't let her catch you.

666
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:01,982
She already did.

667
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,528
And I think she got the best of me…

668
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,114
-Come in.
-Yes, ma'am.

669
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,292
Good work. Drink up.

670
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,421
-What's this?
-It's good for you.

671
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,172
Bottoms up.

672
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,425
Thank you.

673
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,686
What's this?

674
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,313
It's great for men.

675
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,858
A mix of loach extract

676
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,860
and a touch of larvae.

677
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,740
Goodness.

678
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,452
A man with such a weak stomach
is good for nothing.

679
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,871
He holds a very high position at work.

680
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,747
Why did you make him peel onions?

681
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,292
High or not, they're all the same.

682
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,002
It's not like he's the chairman's son.

683
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,172
Hey, you need to go get some tofu.

684
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:08,966
Okay.

685
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,349
Do you feel better?

686
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,937
How can people eat loach and larvae?

687
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,023
I told you to go home first.

688
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,611
I'm that loyal.

689
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,947
Us? There's loyalty between us?

690
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,032
Of course there is.

691
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,533
We both almost died together.

692
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,161
Then again, I saved you.

693
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,000
In that case, do you want something sweet?

694
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,045
No, I hate sweets.

695
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,171
Just try some.

696
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,507
Try some out of loyalty.

697
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,281
You're drinking more broth?

698
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,533
This is excellent.

699
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,034
What do we owe you?

700
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,495
Six fish cake sticks
and four sweet pancakes.

701
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,664
They're 3,000 won and 2,000 won,
so 5,000 won.

702
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:25,042
I had four cups of this too.
Please add that to the total.

703
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,627
The broth is free.

704
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,466
But this is so good.

705
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,970
You'll be blessed.

706
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,932
My wallet.

707
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,308
Here.

708
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,602
I'll pay you back.

709
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,355
It's all right.
You came to my town, so it's my treat.

710
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,026
Then may I have one more?

711
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,905
-As many as you want.
-One more, please.

712
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,783
Here. This is on the house.

713
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,954
Then I'll take another one.

714
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,291
Here. Eat up.

715
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,167
KING CARP GAME

716
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,336
That's still a thing?
I did it a lot as a kid.

717
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,256
What is it?

718
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,300
KING CARP

719
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,929
And pick one.

720
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,359
-I got number 18.
-Did you lose again?

721
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,320
You lost ten times in a row.

722
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,446
That's a talent.

723
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,740
Sir, are you sure I can win this game?

724
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,241
Of course.

725
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,618
One more round.

726
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,411
May I borrow 1,000 won?

727
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,872
No, you need to stop.

728
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,833
I'll play one last round,
so let me borrow just 1,000 won.

729
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,836
You've already said that many times.

730
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,421
Look at these.

731
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,922
So this is the last time.

732
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,091
I'll play one more round.

733
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,469
Just 1,000 won.

734
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,305
This is turning into gambling.

735
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,432
How is this gambling? It's a battle.

736
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,850
I'm paying for this myself.

737
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,769
Well technically, it's your money.

738
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,396
Yes, and that's gambling.

739
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,731
Anyway, a no is no.

740
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,150
And I'm out of cash anyway.

741
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,111
Let's take this and go.

742
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,954
Just 1,000 won.

743
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,415
Please?

744
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,376
I'll play just one more round.

745
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,920
Just 1,000 won.

746
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,548
Just

747
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,342
one more round.

748
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,724
Are you seriously
trying to act cute right now?

749
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,227
Yes, so let me borrow 1,000 won.

750
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,104
You can't win this game that easily.

751
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,898
I've played this a lot,
and I've never won the big prize.

752
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,858
I'll show you.

753
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,735
So please, just 1,000 won.

754
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,446
Are you dying to play?

755
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,035
Another round?

756
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,537
Here.

757
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,206
This is the last time.

758
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,458
-You said you had no cash.
-Forget it, then.

759
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,508
One more round.

760
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,556
This time, you're playing too.

761
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,642
Say when.

762
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,903
Stop.

763
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,366
Stop.

764
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,912
Stop.

765
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,786
Please.

766
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,374
Please.

767
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,261
No way.

768
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,971
Number 39. The king carp!

769
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,725
-We drew this! The carp!
-How did you do this?

770
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,727
We won! No way!

771
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,395
We won!

772
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,439
-No way! That one!
-I can't believe it!

773
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,733
-What did you do?
-This is awesome!

774
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,902
Goodness, the king carp.

775
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,320
This is awesome.

776
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,697
-I'll take that.
-Okay.

777
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,825
Jeez.

778
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,290
-I won.
-That was crazy.

779
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,420
Goodness.

780
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,131
Are you that happy?

781
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,008
Yes.

782
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:29,346
I don't think I've ever wanted anything
this badly in my life.

783
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,181
Small things can give you joy.

784
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,394
A small thing? This is a king carp.

785
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,646
And you used 10,000 won to get it.

786
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,356
Nothing's free in this world.

787
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,025
I must make an investment
to win something precious.

788
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,198
Anyway, I've played this a lot
since when I was a kid,

789
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,578
and I've never seen anyone
who won the king carp until now.

790
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,998
So you were kind of cool.

791
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,002
See? This doesn't happen for just anybody.

792
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,504
It's me. Because it's me.

793
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,716
Only I can do something like this.

794
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,136
Yes, sure. Of course.

795
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,637
I'll pay you back though.

796
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,639
Forget it.

797
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,588
Are you okay?

798
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,465
Are you hurt?

799
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,842
What are you doing?

800
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,136
I said I'd protect you.

801
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,695
Rice puffs.

802
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,039
-He's making rice puffs.
-Rice puffs?

803
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,540
-Oh, rice puffs.
-Yes.

804
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,209
It sounded like a bomb.

805
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,669
I was so surprised.

806
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,181
My carp.

807
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,058
This is my…

808
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,820
Grandma.

809
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,822
It took so long for a block of tofu.

810
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,699
Did you make one yourself or something?

811
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,825
Right, the tofu!

812
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,284
-I'll go get one.
-Hey!

813
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,869
You're so out of it.

814
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,163
Never mind. It'll take you too long.

815
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,124
Sorry.

816
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,751
I was giving him
a tour of the marketplace.

817
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,422
It's such an everyday place.
There's nothing to see there.

818
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,591
Please take this.

819
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:13,719
What's this?

820
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,846
It was a sudden visit,
so I came empty-handed.

821
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,389
Please take this.

822
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,058
Goodness. Are you made of money?

823
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,561
You can't even eat this.

824
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,147
When will you buy a house,
wasting all this money?

825
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:29,192
Grandma, you don't have to worry.

826
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,486
Why? Is his dad rich?

827
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,113
What does he do?

828
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,452
He owns a few small businesses.

829
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,456
You're too old
to be living off your father.

830
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,750
You look perfectly fine
on the outside too.

831
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,586
Do you have
a housing subscription account?

832
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,254
Not yet.

833
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,757
If you have money to buy flowers,

834
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,467
you should open a savings account.

835
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,052
No matter how rich your family is,

836
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,180
you must make a living for yourself.

837
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,097
Absolutely.

838
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,599
Come and eat before you go.

839
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,856
Does she like them?

840
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,569
Goodness.

841
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,698
Eat up before it gets cold.

842
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,703
Thank you.

843
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,753
What's wrong? You can't eat this?

844
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,507
No, it's just that…

845
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,010
I've never had it before.

846
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,094
What?

847
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,764
All right.

848
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,099
Okay. Scoop some rice.

849
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,226
Rice?

850
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,895
Yes, dip it in the soup.

851
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,523
-The soup.
-Good.

852
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,192
It'll taste pretty nice
if you try it like that.

853
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,828
If you really can't eat it,
I'll make something else.

854
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,870
Try it.

855
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,330
Her gukbap is really good.

856
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,582
Okay.

857
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,459
Thank you.

858
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,679
How is it?

859
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,394
Good, isn't it?

860
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,272
Yes, it's really good.

861
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,983
See?

862
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,444
I've been doing this for 30 years.

863
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,571
Eat some more.

864
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,783
-May I have some kimchi?
-Put this on there and keep eating.

865
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,951
-Yes.
-Good.

866
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,543
Thank you. So I dip the rice first.

867
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,336
-You seem to love it.
-And add kimchi.

868
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,387
Hey, over here.

869
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,471
Here.

870
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,309
I packed some gukbap and kimchi.

871
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,476
You can take these.

872
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,103
Thank you for the food.

873
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,104
Sure.

874
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,149
Also,

875
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,484
this is your daily wage.

876
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,778
It's all right. Please don't do this.

877
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,948
I'm paying you minimum wage.

878
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,992
Thanks for peeling the onions.

879
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,035
Take it.

880
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,786
Take it!

881
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,080
Then I'll accept it thankfully.

882
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,042
-And this is yours.
-I'm fine.

883
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,043
It's for the ginseng.

884
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,128
My precious granddaughter

885
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,130
brought me such precious wild ginseng.

886
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,341
I'm such a lucky woman.

887
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,635
I'll get more if it's effective.

888
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,012
Don't you dare go back there.

889
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:47,390
Do you know how dangerous
the mountains are?

890
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,895
What kind of a jerk made
my precious kid wander the mountains?

891
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,396
Once I find them,

892
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,482
I'll make sure I wring their neck.

893
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,818
I won't go back. Don't worry.

894
00:53:58,902 --> 00:53:59,861
Go on.

895
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,530
And drive safely.

896
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:03,907
Yes, we'll get going.

897
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,911
I'll be back.

898
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,288
Why would you come back?

899
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,457
Right.

900
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,126
Come back and peel some more onions.

901
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:17,671
Yes.

902
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,172
-Go now.
-Goodbye.

903
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,715
-Go.
-Bye.

904
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,176
Go inside.

905
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,149
Look at him.

906
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,616
Goodness. He's very polite.

907
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,838
That punk.

908
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,465
He has good manners after all.

909
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,654
Thank you.

910
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,617
For coming to save me
and taking me to Grandma's.

911
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,119
Thank you for everything.

912
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,830
Now you're making sense.

913
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,416
If you're thankful,

914
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,251
treat me to a meal.

915
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,420
I will.

916
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,047
Let me know when you're free.

917
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:42,964
Okay.

918
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,632
I'll let you take me.

919
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,259
Take you where?

920
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:47,635
On a date.

921
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,432
A date?

922
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,725
You wanted to eat.

923
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,646
It's a date.

924
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,272
Get some rest.

925
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,368
What's that?

926
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,496
Gukbap.

927
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,833
Do you want some?

928
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,298
This is nice.

929
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,967
It's tough to find a good gukbap place.

930
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,511
She's done this for 30 years.

931
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,389
I'm craving a drink now.

932
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,641
I'd like a drink.

933
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,519
What should I bring?

934
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,104
Whiskey, cognac, or wine?

935
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,566
I just want a glass of soju.

936
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,942
I'll get some right away.

937
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,157
This is great.

938
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,588
So you went your way with the helicopter?

939
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,424
Yes.

940
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,927
You may be the chairman's son,

941
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,096
but you shouldn't ignore procedures
with your unruly behavior.

942
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,098
I'm sorry.

943
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,728
Why did you take things that far?

944
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,233
Because it was our employee.

945
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,237
You did all that to save just one person?

946
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,407
Have you…

947
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,912
ever saved…

948
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,291
even one person?

949
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,985
The toughest thing in the world

950
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,280
is saving just one person.

951
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,867
You begin to wonder if it'll be worth it.

952
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,204
The world has become a place

953
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,790
where things are valued
more than a person's life.

954
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,212
It was a tough decision to make. Good job.

955
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,382
Even though it did cost us a little.

956
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,680
And thanks for this gukbap.

957
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,933
Bring it again next time.

958
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,728
Let's enjoy it together.

959
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,481
PUMPKIN TAFFY

960
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,398
-What do you want?
-Something good.

961
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,651
-Should I get juice?
-What's the sweetest?

962
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,444
-What about you?
-I don't know.

963
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,445
I don't want anything.

964
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,614
You can order whatever you want.

965
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:44,909
What are you getting?

966
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,371
I need to report on our sales
compared to last year,

967
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,164
so please put the data together, Ms. Gang.

968
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,334
But the sales report is your duty.

969
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,503
Why should I write it
when I'm the one reporting it?

970
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,839
I have to do it tomorrow morning,

971
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,132
so send it over by tonight.

972
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,260
I'm sorry, but I have to go home
right away because of my kid.

973
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,219
Ms. Gang.

974
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:06,264
Do you not know how to keep
your work and personal life separate?

975
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,975
If you're at work, do your job.

976
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,729
If you're the store manager,
you should set an example.

977
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,732
Send me the report
before you go home today.

978
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,275
Let me have a sip.

979
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,540
This is so sweet.

980
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,209
And whipped cream makes you really fat.

981
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,587
How can you drink this with that tummy?

982
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,924
Give me a sip.

983
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,518
Why is this so cold?

984
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,896
It's iced. Of course it's cold.

985
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,148
But this is too cold.

986
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,275
I'll order you one next time.

987
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,235
You look like you could chug
a whole bowlful.

988
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,862
You know I don't drink coffee.

989
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,406
Anyway, I have to go out to work.

990
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,491
Keep it up.

991
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,956
She finished it.

992
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,210
She's always the same.

993
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,170
She eats as soon as she gets to work,

994
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,255
steals other people's coffee,

995
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,216
then works offsite.

996
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,384
She doesn't work offsite.
She just goes home.

997
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,385
Can she do that?

998
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,096
She's the management,
whereas we're outsourced contractors.

999
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,599
There's no use in complaining.

1000
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:32,725
Let's go.

1001
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,609
MONTHLY SALES REPORT

1002
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,914
-Hey honey.
-Honey.

1003
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,500
Something came up at work,
so can you pick up Cho-rong?

1004
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,459
No.

1005
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,796
You were supposed to pick her up today.

1006
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,714
I suddenly have to write up a report.

1007
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,925
I'm in a meeting with a client.
I can't go.

1008
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:06,968
Ask Mom.

1009
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,262
Okay.

1010
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,556
Sorry. I love you.

1011
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,358
You have to turn the lower body.

1012
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,699
We aren't taking any regular guests today.

1013
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,659
-Check the list carefully.
-Yes.

1014
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,662
But what's the occasion? It's so grand.

1015
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:37,456
A birthday party for the youngest girl
of First Royal Hotel.

1016
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,960
Why is she having it here
and not at her hotel?

1017
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,169
Tell me about it.

1018
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,047
-Anyway, don't make a mistake.
-Okay.

1019
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,307
Hi, everyone!

1020
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,142
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

1021
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,226
Happy birthday.

1022
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,401
Happy birthday.

1023
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:06,903
Hey!

1024
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,195
Thank you.

1025
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,947
You become prettier by the day.

1026
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,950
You're now old enough to marry me.

1027
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,912
Sorry. I have high standards.

1028
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,289
But still, I'll hang with you briefly.

1029
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,917
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1030
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,543
What's that?

1031
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,545
Varignon P2, ma'am.

1032
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,213
You'll enjoy its creamy texture.

1033
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,597
This is way too fancy that it's tacky.

1034
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,933
She's still a kid.
She probably wants to show off.

1035
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:06,504
Sa-rang, one sec. Sorry.

1036
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,047
Please hold this. I got a call.

1037
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,549
I'm sorry. You can follow him.

1038
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,093
-Sorry, I have to take this.
-Sure.

1039
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,012
-Hello?
-These are my friends.

1040
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:18,599
Won!

1041
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:24,313
Won, have you been well? Did you miss me?

1042
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,233
You've been well, right?

1043
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,069
How can I do well without you?

1044
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,739
You seem to enjoy your life,
drinking and partying every night.

1045
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,951
Paparazzi are a huge problem these days.

1046
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:38,619
Happy birthday.

1047
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,539
Just words?

1048
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,040
No, one moment.

1049
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:51,799
Where's Mr. No?

1050
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,301
He's taking a phone call.

1051
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:57,972
Is something wrong?

1052
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,184
No.

1053
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,895
-Something seems wrong.
-Won.

1054
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:06,856
What are you doing?

1055
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,613
Oh my god! This is huge!

1056
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,823
What is this?

1057
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,992
Can I open this now?

1058
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:19,952
Sure.

1059
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,163
Give me a hand. How do I open this?

1060
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,460
It's so pretty!

1061
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:31,547
How did you know? I really wanted this!

1062
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,174
You asked me for it.

1063
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,217
You're so considerate.

1064
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,179
This party is getting annoying.

1065
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,890
-Should we leave and hang out alone?
-No.

1066
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,266
Hang out with your friends.

1067
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,021
What are you looking at?
Concentrate on me.

1068
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,439
Excuse me!

1069
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:49,982
Yes.

1070
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,234
Please keep this for me.

1071
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:53,861
Yes, of course.

1072
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,988
-It's heavy. I'll pick it up later.
-No, sir.

1073
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,364
I'll do it.

1074
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,699
This is my job.

1075
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,095
-Won.
-Yes?

1076
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,014
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

1077
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,726
-Is the chairman well?
-Yes.

1078
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,853
-What about Hwa-ran?
-She's doing well.

1079
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:28,813
What about you?

1080
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,023
Are you receiving
business management training?

1081
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,525
I'm just working.

1082
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,152
You can't just work.

1083
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,821
You need to be named as the heir.

1084
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:41,951
It's impossible for me
with three brothers and two sisters.

1085
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:44,370
So you take over King Group
and give it to me.

1086
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,496
What do you mean?

1087
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:47,456
We're going to get married anyway.

1088
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,501
Our dads are done talking.

1089
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,254
Then our dads can get married.

1090
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,673
Don't be like that.

1091
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:56,757
Yu-ri.

1092
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,260
Don't date me.

1093
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:00,719
Date someone who likes you.

1094
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,305
Sure.

1095
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,849
I'll tell you when I start dating.

1096
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:08,853
So you need to tell me first
when you begin to fool around.

1097
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,938
Don't let me hear it from someone else.

1098
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:12,565
Sa-rang.

1099
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,942
-Yes?
-You should go home.

1100
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,652
You haven't eaten, and it's late.

1101
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,405
-I'm fine.
-Thank you for your help.

1102
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,198
You'll get lots of overtime pay.

1103
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,409
Thank you.

1104
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,548
Sa-rang.

1105
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:39,216
Going home?

1106
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,552
Yes.

1107
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,846
Then will it be a date night?

1108
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,933
Why would I go on a date with you?

1109
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:49,894
Me?

1110
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,813
Why are men like this?

1111
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,901
Don't talk about dates
unless you really like someone!

1112
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,533
I was asking if she was
going on a date with someone.

1113
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,537
She got mad at me.

1114
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,790
Why did she get mad?

1115
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,769
Ta-da.

1116
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,771
Sweets are best for the blues.

1117
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,856
What? I'm not feeling blue.

1118
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,191
You are.

1119
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:39,652
You look like you could cry any minute.

1120
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,538
This is so good.

1121
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,624
Premium cookies.

1122
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:56,252
Everyone said they were good,
so I got some for you two.

1123
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,465
It's so good.

1124
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,176
Get another one on your next flight.

1125
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,970
-Cho-rong would love these.
-Yes.

1126
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,304
I'm here.

1127
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,224
What? Is this your payday?

1128
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,934
Cho-rong is with my mom.

1129
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,520
Everything is on me tonight.
Order whatever you want!

1130
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,285
What's wrong?

1131
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,619
I'm just thirsty.

1132
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,371
Tell us what it is.

1133
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,835
It's the word "date."

1134
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,671
Do men say that to just anybody?

1135
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,131
A guest hit on you, right?

1136
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,009
They just want to have one fun night.

1137
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,261
I meet lots of men like that
on my flights.

1138
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:50,681
And most guys who say that
usually have a girlfriend already.

1139
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:54,601
He gave me his number
while his girlfriend went to the toilet.

1140
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:57,104
Yes, I think he has a girl.

1141
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:59,440
The ones who are dating
do that more often.

1142
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:00,941
What's more depressing

1143
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,611
is that all I can do on the job
is smile and ignore them.

1144
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:07,239
If I say something,
he'll lodge a complaint against me.

1145
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:11,118
They do as they like
because they know we can't do a thing.

1146
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:14,246
When I smile,
they fuss about my smile being fake.

1147
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,915
But if I stop,
they complain and say I look displeased.

1148
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,501
Darn it. It's so easy to pick on us.

1149
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:22,963
You're ruining my beer.
Let's stop talking about this.

1150
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,048
Okay.

1151
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,897
The silence makes me feel more down.

1152
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:45,569
Let's listen to music.

1153
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:48,530
"WA" BY LEE JUNG-HYUN

1154
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:21,522
"WA" BY LEE JUNG-HYUN

1155
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,902
I didn't want to believe it

1156
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,571
I didn't want to lose you

1157
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:33,951
What if our love takes a wrong turn

1158
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,620
And ends here?

1159
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:42,876
I was heartbroken, but I must play dumb

1160
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:49,216
-Because that will hurt less than goodbye
-Because that will hurt less than goodbye

1161
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:10,863
The door is open!

1162
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,576
Hey, pizza! Coming!

1163
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:19,997
Pizza.

1164
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,003
Hey, it's the pork trotters!

1165
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:27,463
Pork trotters!

1166
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,048
Pork trotters.

1167
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,508
-Pork trotters!
-Pork trotters!

1168
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:38,223
Yo, chicken!

1169
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,975
Look at me, look closely

1170
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,685
Don't betray my love

1171
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:43,479
Come on, come to me

1172
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,980
This is the last time

1173
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:46,565
Why would you leave?

1174
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,192
Why would you abandon me?

1175
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,694
Stop nagging and come to me, chicken

1176
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:52,321
Come

1177
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,678
KING THE LAND

1178
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:51,797
-She's not my girlfriend.
-Then why did you hug her?

1179
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,132
Why did you hug her
when she's not even your girlfriend?

1180
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,680
You need to gain power
in order to protect your employees.

1181
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:01,306
I'll do it.

1182
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,101
I'll bring the Arab prince to our hotel.

1183
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:05,936
Welcome.

1184
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,398
Why don't you ever think about me?

1185
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,610
I never said I don't think about you.

1186
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:16,738
So?

1187
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,743
Can you feel my sincerity?

1188
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:29,501
