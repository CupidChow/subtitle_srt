1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,011
The bathroom is bigger than my house.

3
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,680
This is cool.

4
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,723
What?

5
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,659
-Don't look.
-I won't.

6
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,538
You really can't.

7
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,540
I won't, even if you beg me.

8
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,958
What do you take me for?

9
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,605
EPISODE 2

10
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,071
You need to come out.

11
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,243
I'm sorry but can you please just go?

12
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,829
I need my phone.

13
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,248
I'll bring it to you.

14
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,999
Open up. I'm busy.

15
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,503
I'm coming in.

16
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,189
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,280
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,581
You know me, right?

19
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,375
We've met before, haven't we?

20
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,171
No, I've never seen you.

21
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,047
I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,632
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,134
This is my room…

24
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,431
Let's speak for a moment.

25
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,100
What's with him? Why is he following me?

26
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,435
Stop right there.

27
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,024
Can't you hear me?

28
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,905
May I help you, sir?

29
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,823
It's you, right?

30
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,533
The treadmill.

31
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,118
Sorry? The treadmill?

32
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,661
You suddenly called me a pervert.

33
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,580
Don't you remember?

34
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,706
A pervert?

35
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,837
What a pervert.

36
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,672
Hey--

37
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,507
If you ever do this again,

38
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,176
I'm going to kill you.

39
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,303
Please keep that in mind, Mr. Pervert.

40
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,182
That tiger T-shirt?

41
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,266
Yes.

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,268
-Do you finally remember?
-Yes.

43
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,853
I knew it.

44
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,314
You were staring like a pervert
without turning away.

45
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,483
Aren't you the pervert

46
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,735
for turning the window transparent
while on the toilet?

47
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,988
Nothing I do can top you.

48
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,242
Apologize.

49
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,786
For both today and that day.

50
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm truly sorry for today.

51
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,503
However, you were the one at fault
back on that day.

52
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,089
I believe you're the one
who owes me an apology.

53
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,173
Why me?

54
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,677
If you don't know
why you should apologize,

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,011
there's no need to go on.

56
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,222
Please excuse me.

57
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,974
Enjoy your stay, sir.

58
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,234
Excuse me.

59
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,111
Hey!

60
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,324
I wasn't done talking.

61
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,411
I'm sorry, but I have nothing more to say.

62
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,329
And both back then and now,

63
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,498
I don't even have
the fanciest interest in you,

64
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,708
so stop following me.

65
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,543
There's no talking to you.

66
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,378
Nothing you can do will get to me.

67
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,130
Okay.

68
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,466
I don't need to show courtesy
to someone who behaves like this.

69
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,343
This is a warning.

70
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,179
Don't ever let me see you again.

71
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,810
Yes, sir.
That is also precisely what I want.

72
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,687
And stop smiling.

73
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,191
All staff of King Hotel serve our guests
with sincere, bright smiles.

74
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,818
If my smile is displeasing to you,

75
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,987
please consider staying at another hotel.

76
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,071
Excuse me.

77
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,035
Guest first.

78
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,295
That perverted jerk.

79
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,344
And it's not "fanciest," but "faintest."

80
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,055
Sorry?

81
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,141
It's not "I don't have
the fanciest interest in you."

82
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,560
It's "I don't have
the faintest interest in you."

83
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,562
That's the correct expression.

84
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,105
In case people make fun of you.

85
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,904
That's one condescending jerk.

86
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,739
RESUME
NAME: GU WON

87
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,158
I asked for a resume
and you really brought one.

88
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,452
You must really want to work here.

89
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,787
Rules are rules.

90
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,913
And your family register?

91
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,207
Come on, we're family.

92
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,666
Rules are rules.

93
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,920
If that's too troublesome,
don't work here.

94
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,006
Why go through all this when
you don't even care about the business?

95
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,635
I'll submit it.

96
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,428
This is fun.

97
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,849
I'll need two copies
of the family register.

98
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,938
MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

99
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,232
Thirty minutes.

100
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,862
Hello.

101
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,864
We meet again.

102
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,368
I'm hosting the inaugural ceremony today.

103
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,494
Really?

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,247
I dread standing before a crowd,

105
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,500
but my higher-ups say it has to be me.

106
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,252
I understand.

107
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,088
Life can be tiring when you're in demand.

108
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,716
-Do you want to have dinner after?
-I'd love to!

109
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,886
-Is that all right?
-Absolutely. I'd love to.

110
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,806
Then I'll meet you tonight for dinner.

111
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,016
Okay, sure.

112
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,519
Good luck at the ceremony.

113
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,062
Thank you.

114
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,401
See? It worked.

115
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,528
Great job, Sang-sik. Good one.

116
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,616
-Where are you going?
-To get my family register.

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,619
Ask the staff to run your errands.
Let's go. Everyone is waiting.

118
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,204
For who? Me?

119
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,790
-Why?
-The inaugural ceremony.

120
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,543
After the ceremony,
you have a celebratory dinner

121
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,128
with the board and the VIPs.

122
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,546
No, I'm not going.

123
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,424
The chairman gave
a direct order to the PR team.

124
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,597
Why are you so nervous?

125
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,849
The rest of your life
will be like a party.

126
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,642
Let's go.

127
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,652
Hello.

128
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,989
I'm Manager Kim Su-mi,
here to host today's ceremony.

129
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,492
Let us begin the inaugural ceremony

130
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,119
to welcome the new head manager
of King Hotel.

131
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,830
Please welcome Head Manager Gu Won
with a big round of applause.

132
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,260
What's that pervert doing here?

133
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,853
INAUGURAL CEREMONY FOR HEAD MANAGER GU WON

134
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,233
Continue.

135
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,734
I've never seen…

136
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,945
I mean,

137
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,073
Head Manager Gu will share
an inaugural speech.

138
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,534
Oh, no.

139
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,894
Don't smile.

140
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,356
Stop smiling.

141
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,110
Don't smile.

142
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,406
Stop smiling.

143
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,233
Hello. My name is Gu Won.

144
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,611
I hope to make the best of our time.

145
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,904
-Let's end this.
-Sorry?

146
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,489
Yes.

147
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,243
Then let us end the inaugural ceremony.

148
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,954
King Hotel's best talent,
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang,

149
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,081
-will welcome the head manager.
-I'm done for.

150
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,416
Bring out the bouquet.

151
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:26,917
Darn it.

152
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,782
We…

153
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,867
meet again.

154
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,624
Welcome, Head Manager Gu!

155
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,627
Really?

156
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,921
Yes, we truly welcome you.

157
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,715
-Do you mean it?
-Yes, sir.

158
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,344
This is from all of us.

159
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,410
Next week, you'll film a promo video

160
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,871
with the best talent of the year,
our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

161
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,499
The PR team
will send you the script directly.

162
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,251
-That's all?
-That's all.

163
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,669
-You may leave.
-Okay.

164
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,963
I'll excuse myself as well.

165
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,342
Ms. Best Talent, come here.

166
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,862
I warned you
to never let me see you again.

167
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,364
I'll do my best to avoid you from now on.

168
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,745
-Do you know what hospitality is?
-Yes, I know it very well.

169
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,330
Is avoiding discomfort hospitable?

170
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,041
I'm only meeting your request
to avoid running into you.

171
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,796
Anyway,

172
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,214
why am I a pervert?

173
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,718
Not only did you make
awkward moaning sounds

174
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,678
in the gym, which is a public space,

175
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,264
but you also gave me
your room key as a tip

176
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,141
along with a creepy note

177
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,144
talking about "my cunning advances"
and "a steamy night together."

178
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,855
-Me?
-Back then, I was new.

179
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,607
I admit I didn't follow the manual.

180
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,524
However,

181
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,860
I do not have a reason
to condone such disrespect

182
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,112
just because I work in hospitality.

183
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,948
What are you talking about?
When did I do that?

184
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,618
I've never done anything like that,

185
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,705
and you're nowhere near my type,
not even over my dead body.

186
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,751
Are you sure I'm him? Are you positive?

187
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,836
You were wearing
a T-shirt with a tiger print.

188
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,795
Are you kidding me?

189
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,839
Is everyone who wears that a pervert?

190
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,719
I clearly heard that a man
in a tiger print T-shirt gave it to me.

191
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,517
So you're saying

192
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,894
you made an assumption about me

193
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,647
just by looking at my T-shirt?

194
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,317
So that wasn't you who did that?

195
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,861
What do you take me for?

196
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,363
Why would I?

197
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,364
To you, no less?

198
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,616
I told you, didn't I?

199
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,952
Even over my dead body,

200
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,871
you are without a doubt,
absolutely, most definitely

201
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,998
not my type.

202
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,378
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,421
You should've told me so.

204
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,798
You never gave me a chance.

205
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,220
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,597
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,602
Don't smile.

208
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,230
I loathe that fake smile.

209
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,733
I must smile on duty.
Just think of it as part of my uniform.

210
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,693
Even so, don't.

211
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,615
-Really?
-If you smile, you're fired.

212
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,330
Thank you.

213
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,876
I wasn't ready to show you
a heartfelt smile.

214
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,378
Thank you for not letting me fake a smile.

215
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,421
Also,

216
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,508
I truly apologize
for what I did on that day.

217
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,094
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

218
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,724
Take the flowers and leave.

219
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,434
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,698
A pervert?

221
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,623
There's no pervert like me.

222
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,459
Jeez.

223
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,133
This way, sir.

224
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,011
-Please hang up my coat.
-Of course.

225
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,517
Let me escort you to your seat.

226
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,521
Right over here, sir.

227
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,106
Put my suitcase up.

228
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,653
Yes, I'll put it in the overhead bin.

229
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,363
Please enjoy your flight.

230
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,761
You might get hurt.

231
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,098
Let me handle it.

232
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,102
Hello.

233
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,705
They can just leave the tray as is.

234
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,914
Why do people do this?

235
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,708
Because they're kind.

236
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,335
They think stacking these
will make our lives easier.

237
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,045
That's not kindness. It's excessive.

238
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,964
This is a useless courtesy.

239
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,757
Just accept the gesture.

240
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,719
Let's clean up
and get ready for duty-free sales.

241
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,638
Ro-un and Eun-ji, clean the restrooms
when the seatbelt sign turns on.

242
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,806
-Yes.
-Yes.

243
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,436
Who took the coat
from the passenger in 3H?

244
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,354
I did.

245
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,189
It's not in the closet.

246
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,357
Where did you leave it?

247
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,067
I threw it out.

248
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,610
What?

249
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,320
What are you talking about?

250
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,490
He asked me to.

251
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,325
This way, sir.

252
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,619
Please hang up my coat.

253
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,538
"Please dump my coat."

254
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,540
That's what he said.

255
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,084
Hey!

256
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,556
Are you all trying to get me fired?

257
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,391
I told you not to cause trouble!

258
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,684
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,436
An apology isn't going to fix this.

260
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,938
He told me to bring it right away!

261
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,774
I'll take responsibility.

262
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,026
How dare you say that
when you're a mere rookie?

263
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,695
You aren't in a position to do that.

264
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,324
What will you do now?

265
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,911
What are you all going to do about this?

266
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,332
I'll take responsibility and handle this.

267
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,295
Will you?

268
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,881
Pyeong-hwa,

269
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,717
then make sure it doesn't affect me.

270
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,637
Handle it quietly and efficiently. Okay?

271
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,018
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

272
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,270
Forget it. I'll be in the transit lounge,

273
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,272
so bring it before my next flight.

274
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,775
If you don't,
I won't let you off for this.

275
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,403
Yes, sir. I'll bring it to you
as soon as possible.

276
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,073
I'm very sorry.

277
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,827
I'm sorry. Please help me.

278
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,370
Please help me just this once.

279
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,412
I can't.

280
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,581
I'm very behind right now.

281
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,125
I'll pay you twice as much.

282
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,251
It's fine.

283
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,045
Three times, four times,
or however much you want.

284
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,089
Please help me.

285
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,884
Sir, please. I'm begging you.

286
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,604
You'll get hurt if you run like that.

287
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:49,980
Get some rest.

288
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,588
You were a great host
at the ceremony today.

289
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,548
How may I help you?

290
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,634
Do you like snow crab?

291
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,178
How about it for dinner?
I'll be crabby if not.

292
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,888
Hey.

293
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,807
Is it fun going around
pretending to be Mr. Gu?

294
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,309
Mr. Gu?

295
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,977
I never said I was him.

296
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,521
I was supposed to eat dinner
with the head manager,

297
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,066
but you're not the head manager.

298
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,401
Why should I eat dinner with you?

299
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,987
So you have no business
with the secretary.

300
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,573
Is that what you're saying?

301
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,658
Exactly.

302
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,659
I totally don't.

303
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,202
You're a total, absolute snob.

304
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,536
I'm like that.

305
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,790
So let's not exchange greetings
ever again.

306
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,085
Don't worry.

307
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,128
I don't go anywhere near snobs.

308
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:56,922
It'll rub off on me.

309
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,006
Oh, my! It's rubbing off.

310
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,716
What? Rub off on you?

311
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,718
Ms. Sa-rang, you're here. Let's go.

312
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,596
You are to attend
Mr. Gu's welcome dinner as the staff rep.

313
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,764
What? Me?

314
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,391
Wait, why should she go?

315
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,351
I should be the staff representative.

316
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,352
No.

317
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,188
A snobby manager
couldn't possibly represent the staff.

318
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,398
That's nonsense.

319
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,609
The higher-ups do have a discerning eye
when it comes to people.

320
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,111
-What?
-Let's go. We're late.

321
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,821
I'll be back.

322
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,656
Careful, there's some snobbiness here.

323
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,449
-This way, please.
-Darn it.

324
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,830
That crabby-looking man.
Snow crab, my foot.

325
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,336
It's so nice.

326
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,963
Is this your first time here?

327
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,965
But you've worked here for so long.

328
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,341
This is King the Land.

329
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,468
Since it's a lounge on the VIP floor,

330
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,721
regular staff can't come here
even after 100 years.

331
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,556
And you're finally here.

332
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,932
Enjoy the day.

333
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,726
Today, you're a VIP too.

334
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,768
Okay.

335
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,529
This is fabulous.

336
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,208
You said you'd do your best to avoid me.

337
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,520
Tuna cheek, sir.

338
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,521
-Thank you.
-Yes.

339
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,022
-Please enjoy.
-Yes.

340
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,655
Was the tuna you caught
500 million won, Chairman Han?

341
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,782
500 million?

342
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,408
It was 590 million won.

343
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,410
-Goodness.
-How much was this one?

344
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,537
We paid 700 million.

345
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,417
Hwa-ran has such excellent discernment.

346
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,546
You'll never see another tuna
as nice as this one.

347
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,589
Do you want to make a bet?

348
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,217
What if I find a better tuna than that?

349
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,343
Good grief.

350
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,637
What counts is the heart,
not the price tag.

351
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,516
Hwa-ran prepared this to celebrate
her brother's appointment.

352
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,687
I always knew you were generous.
Turns out you're kind as well.

353
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,148
Now that he's joined the hotel,

354
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,483
he might steal it from you.

355
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,238
Will you take charge of King the Land?

356
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,657
It's basically a mandatory course

357
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,034
for your business management training.

358
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,620
-Stop saying such nonsense.
-What?

359
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,582
In a competition,
whoever is better wins it all.

360
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,001
Why would I compete with Won?

361
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,627
I should help him.

362
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,296
Father, please make a toast.

363
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,380
Yes, I will.

364
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,841
All right, everyone.

365
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,260
I'd like to thank

366
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:34,514
the chairpersons, executives, and staff
who came here to celebrate

367
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,308
despite your busy schedules.

368
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,519
Please show your support
for Head Manager Gu Won

369
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,022
in his future endeavors.

370
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,816
Now, let us enjoy.

371
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,610
Cheers!

372
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,370
Who are you?

373
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,414
Well…

374
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,709
I'm Cheon Sa-rang, stationed in the lobby.

375
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,669
She's our best talent,

376
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,254
here to represent our staff.

377
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,464
Really?

378
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:11,259
That must mean you're
the most hospitable staff in our hotel.

379
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,511
Why don't you come out

380
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,804
and make a speech for us?

381
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,557
-Me?
-Do you feel uncomfortable?

382
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,518
No, sir.

383
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,623
It's a great honor to serve a head manager

384
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,833
of such great character and intellect.

385
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,293
So fake.

386
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,003
We truly welcome you.

387
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,507
Enjoy.

388
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,972
I like your outspoken personality.

389
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:57,931
Thank you.

390
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,516
Mr. Kim, can you find

391
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,518
the most precious part of the tuna

392
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,520
and give it to our best talent?

393
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,063
Yes, sir.

394
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,649
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

395
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,110
That fake work smile.

396
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,320
Won, you should share a word too.

397
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,906
I'm fine.

398
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,867
Get up. You're the man of the hour.

399
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,217
Thank you for sparing your precious time.

400
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,191
Also,

401
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,652
I'll make King Hotel

402
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,489
a place without fake smiles.

403
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,428
How amazing.

404
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,348
He holds an inaugural ceremony
and a party for his son,

405
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,767
even getting the PR team involved.

406
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,102
What's the matter?

407
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,437
Are you scared?

408
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,773
Of a boy like you?

409
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,858
Let me make this clear.

410
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,778
I don't care about management
or taking over the company.

411
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,780
So no need to be scared.

412
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,323
If you really don't care,

413
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,034
why did you bother to finish your MBA?

414
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,161
Well, I was good enough to get one.

415
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,498
There's no need to hide my competence.

416
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,667
Putting it like that
doesn't make you sound cool.

417
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,795
I don't care what others think.

418
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,422
And I won't work here for long.

419
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:55,965
So…

420
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,468
don't mess with me.

421
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,220
So don't be so cheeky

422
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,722
if you want to enjoy this luxury.

423
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,482
Here, come meet my children.

424
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,784
What's this?

425
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,494
Tuna. A present from the chairman.

426
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,663
Thank you.

427
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,957
Excuse me.

428
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,128
May I be excused?

429
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,045
Sure.

430
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,256
Should I let the chairman know?

431
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,801
Just go. Nobody cares about you.

432
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,895
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

433
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,322
Yes, my dear. Are you coming home?

434
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,365
I'm not.

435
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,826
Grandma, do you want some tuna?

436
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,453
What? Some pumas?

437
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,414
No, not pumas. Tuna.

438
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,458
I'm busy right now.

439
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,168
Call me when you come.

440
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,174
Gosh, she's always like this.

441
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,718
CONTACTS

442
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,473
Let's have a drink!

443
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,399
Hello?

444
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,944
The chairman gave me tuna today.
Do you want some?

445
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,153
I'm fine. You have it.

446
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,282
It's worth 700 million won,
and he gave me the most expensive part.

447
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,743
I'm in Busan eating tuna right now.

448
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,912
Busan? Why?

449
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,163
Didn't I tell you?

450
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,915
I came to see a game with the club.

451
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,709
I'm going to hang out here for a bit,
then be back by the weekend.

452
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,962
But we were going to Namsan tomorrow.

453
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,380
That was tomorrow?

454
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,175
Did I make this plan alone?

455
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,510
This game is important,

456
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,136
so let me off just this once.

457
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,973
But let's go next week
to do that lock thing

458
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,307
and whatever else you want.

459
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,976
Yu-nam, come here!

460
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,435
I have to go. I'll call you!

461
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,688
All right.

462
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,730
Hello?

463
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,050
I'm sorry.

464
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,806
It's the head!

465
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,475
It's tuna.

466
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,436
I'm sorry.

467
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,438
He gave me the head.

468
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,819
What do I do?

469
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,586
We made eye contact again!

470
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,754
I'm done. You do it.

471
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,005
-I can't.
-What now?

472
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,256
Look at its eye.

473
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,008
It's looking straight at me.

474
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,219
Hi, guys.

475
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,014
What's going on?

476
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,184
What's happening?

477
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,352
Da-eul.

478
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,066
Gosh, it's tuna!

479
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,580
It melts in my mouth.

480
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,500
Da-eul, is there anything you can't do?

481
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,584
Tell me about it.

482
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,253
Look, she's so good
at making side dishes too.

483
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,839
You'll see when you have children.
Mothers are amazing.

484
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,968
Why would you eat
raw instant noodles over this?

485
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,511
I hate mushy stuff.

486
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,514
Still, try one. If it's from the chairman,
it must be expensive.

487
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,350
It was 700 million won.

488
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,227
700 million?

489
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,603
Hey, spit it out.

490
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,230
-Why?
-Hey.

491
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,482
Most tunas are about five heads long,

492
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,442
so the head alone is worth 140 million.

493
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,819
That's worth more than our heads.

494
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,320
-Let's sell this.
-Yes, let's.

495
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,239
Hey.

496
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,491
Do we know anyone
who'd pay that much for tuna?

497
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,118
No.

498
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,953
You could buy a house with that money.

499
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,204
Right, so just eat.

500
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,747
When else would we be able to eat this?

501
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,458
If the head is 140 million won,

502
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,212
one piece costs 2.4 million won.

503
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,590
And now, 4.8 million.

504
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,176
People who gulp these down
must live a happy life.

505
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,220
I'm sure.

506
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,347
They must be happy.

507
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,350
-This is crazy.
-That's 12 million.

508
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,227
-Okay, let's do it.
-Is it good?

509
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,353
Totally.

510
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,358
Goodness.

511
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,905
Come sleep at home today.

512
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,450
-The hotel is more convenient.
-Come home.

513
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,744
Let's have another drink at home.

514
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,965
Are you coming home?

515
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,675
He told me to, so I should go.

516
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,677
You should live your life as you please.

517
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,222
Don't set your foot on rough terrain.

518
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,541
Are you getting in?

519
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,293
The chairman wants you at home.

520
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,087
How impudent.

521
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,464
You need to open the door for me.

522
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,429
You know,

523
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,682
people are quick
to catch onto bad behaviors.

524
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,812
Please get in, sir.

525
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,525
This is it.

526
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,859
It won't open any further.

527
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,821
Go home.

528
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,988
What? I can't go home.

529
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,865
The chairman told me to bring you home.

530
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,034
I can't. Mr. Gu!

531

HOTEL CONCIERGE CHEON SA-RANG

532
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,813
HOTEL CONCIERGE JOB FAIR

533
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,167
Sa-rang, what are you drawing?

534
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,919
When we played at the beach, Mommy.

535
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,518
-Then what's this?
-A hotel.

536
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,853
-A hotel?
-Yes.

537
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,147
-It's a pink hotel.
-Yes.

538
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,861
Mommy, when I grow up,
I'm going to work at a hotel.

539
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,447
-Really?
-Yes.

540
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,990
-Mommy.
-Yes?

541
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:41,991
I love you.

542
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:16,317
HOTEL CONCIERGE CHEON SA-RANG

543
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,619
PREPARING FOR OPENING

544
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,254
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

545
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,631
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

546
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,342
-Congratulations on your promotion
-Congratulations on your promotion

547
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,096
What's all this? Thank you.

548
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,639
Congrats on your promotion, Ms. Gang.

549
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,599
It's an honor, Ms. Gang.

550
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,393
Just call me Da-eul.

551
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,145
It's weird to hear you call me Ms. Gang.

552
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,397
Thank you.

553
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,026
It's great to have you as our manager.

554
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,696
Finally, spring is here for us.

555
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,660
Then let me share a word
as the new manager.

556
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,872
From now on, let's each get our own lunch.

557
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,789
Okay?

558
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,587
And this will be the last day
our junior member prepares snacks for us.

559
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,629
What?

560
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,716
I understand lunch,
but isn't that going too far?

561
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,885
It's our tradition.

562
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:09,430
If you abolish it now, what will become
of everyone who's upheld it thus far?

563
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,641
Do you really think this tradition
is good enough to pass on?

564
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,185
No.

565
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,269
-No.
-No.

566
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,106
We didn't get a job here to serve someone.

567
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,151
Let's not fight over a weird tradition
that was made in the past.

568
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,277
Okay?

569
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,446
-Okay.
-Okay.

570
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,614
Thank you.

571
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,700
Let's eat up and get ready to open.

572
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,497
They look great on you.

573
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,040
Take them off. They're awful.

574
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,294
Let's go. It's almost time.

575
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,921
They look fine.

576
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,840
Sir, those look great on you.

577
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,092
You're like Brad Pitt.

578
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,970
I wouldn't go that far.

579
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,973
Brad Pitt, my foot.

580
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,267
Hey, take them off. You look like a fly.

581
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,311
Goodness, a fly?

582
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,980
Your friend must be jealous
that you look so good.

583
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,942
-Me?
-And flies are wonderful, aren't they?

584
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,904
They gleam in rainbow hues
and fly around freely through the sky.

585
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,739
Isn't that cool?

586
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,493
The moment you walk out with those,
everyone will fall for you.

587
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,786
-Really?
-Hey.

588
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,164
Don't make any impulse buys today
and just go.

589
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,291
We have a lot of time before our flight.

590
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,334
Right?

591
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,630
Sir, these sunglasses are limited edition
and only sold in Korea.

592
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,633
Our stocks are low,
so you may not find them next time.

593
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,554
These look like they were
specially made for you.

594
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,514
I'm afraid you may regret it later.

595
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,350
I'll take them.

596
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,394
Let me ring you up. This way, please.

597
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,478
Thank you.

598
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,696
Thank you, sir. Please come again.

599
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,788
Hey, when did you get here?

600
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,332
"Oh, my, sir. You're like Brad Pitt."

601
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,584
Nonsense.

602
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,919
Hey, it makes total sense.

603
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,922
If he'll increase our sales,
he's better than Brad Pitt.

604
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,841
Just stopping by? Or are you shopping?

605
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,260
I'm not here to shop,

606
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,598
but is there something I can give
as a token of gratitude?

607
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,020
Are you sure it's a token of gratitude
and not a gift for a guy you're into?

608
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,689
-Forget it. I'm leaving.
-Oh, my.

609
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,774
You can come in as you like,

610
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,819
but you can't leave empty-handed.
Buy something.

611
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,404
No, maybe next time.

612
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,449
Please, take a look at our scarves.

613
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,577
These are wonderful products
recommended by the national mom.

614
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,709
You have a reservation for a deluxe room

615
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,794
-with a city view, right?
-Yes, that's right.

616
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,797
Please upgrade the room to a suite.

617
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,175
Shall I cancel the deluxe room

618
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,427
and change the reservation to a suite?

619
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,512
That's not it.

620
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,639
The national mom, Ms. Mo Seong-ae,

621
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,099
is willing to stay here tonight,

622
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,727
so just upgrade the room to a suite.

623
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,270
I'm sorry, sir.

624
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,898
Our rules do not allow
an upgrade to a suite.

625
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,316
Move aside.

626
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,861
-Do you know who I am?
-Yes, hello.

627
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,322
I'll post a review
on social media as a favor.

628
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,448
So get me a suite.

629
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,867
Thank you for your special concern.

630
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,579
However, our rules do not allow us
to assist you in that way.

631
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,249
If you enjoy wine,
may I offer you a pass for our lounge,

632
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,752
where we serve simple snacks
along with wine, cocktails, and beer?

633
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,881
Do you know how many followers I have?

634
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,425
One word from me,
and you'll have to shut down.

635
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,928
I'm so sorry.

636
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,681
You really don't get it, do you?

637
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,224
Get your manager.

638
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,101
I want the desk manager!

639
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,564
Our manager is not here at the moment.

640
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,399
What's with these interview questions?

641
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,277
-What do you mean?
-Look, they're so juvenile.

642
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,445
I didn't come up with them.

643
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,030
Tell them to redo it.

644
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,325
Just go along with it.
Why are you pretending to work?

645
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,535
It's unlike you.

646
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,203
I might as well do a good job.

647
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,248
Tell them to give me some real questions.

648
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:05,874
Yes, sir.

649
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,627
If your manager isn't here,
bring someone else in charge!

650
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,130
It's not like I'm asking for much.

651
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,881
I just want to talk to the manager.

652
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,383
Who are you to stop me?

653
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,468
-That's Mo Seong-ae.
-The manager isn't here.

654
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,304
I'm in charge of check-ins.

655
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,597
Feel free to talk to me.

656
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,056
Are you a parrot?

657
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,809
You're repeating the same words
over and over again!

658
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,936
What's going on?

659
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,189
-Nothing, sir.
-Doesn't seem like it.

660
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,566
Are you the desk manager?

661
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,110
-No.
-Then why are you butting in?

662
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,653
Why isn't there a manager here?

663
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,117
I asked you what was going on.

664
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,871
She reserved a deluxe room,

665
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,914
but she wanted an upgrade to a suite.

666
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,583
Charge her extra and do it.

667
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,418
That's not it.

668
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:54,423
This guest right here
is a famous actress, Mo Seong-ae.

669
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,551
She said she'd give us publicity
if we offered a free upgrade,

670
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,845
so I explained that
our rules did not allow that.

671
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,848
Ms. Mo Seong-ae, the national mom.

672
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,435
How long have you worked here?

673
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,353
Seven years, sir.

674
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,147
Yet you still can't handle
a rude guest like her?

675
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,649
What? A rude guest?

676
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,941
The so-called national mom

677
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,319
made a scene to stay in a nice room
without paying for it.

678
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,237
Why not tell her she's being a thief?

679
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,114
Get security and kick her out.

680
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,158
Hey! Who do you think you are?

681
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,370
Save the rest for our security officers.
They'll be here shortly.

682
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,790
Hey! You!

683
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,375
Stop right there! Hey, you!

684
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,501
Ms. Mo.

685
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,003
-Lots of people are watching.
-So what?

686
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,838
I didn't do anything wrong!

687
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,423
Let them all come and see!

688
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,219
It won't do you any good
if people upload this on the internet.

689
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,428
I'm so pissed.

690
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,015
That damn internet is everything now.

691
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,645
Fine.

692
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,607
I normally wouldn't care
if I didn't get that suite upgrade,

693
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,985
but I will make sure to get it today.

694
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,071
I'm so sorry.

695
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,781
You keep talking about these rules,

696
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,783
so what are the rules?

697
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,701
Tell me the article and clause!

698
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,078
I'm so sorry.

699
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,540
I don't need your apology.
Give me the room!

700
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,042
-Ms. Cheon, my office. Now.
-Sorry?

701
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,420
Didn't you hear me?

702
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,171
Come to my office. Now.

703
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,256
Hey!

704
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,550
I'm talking to her right now.

705
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,844
Over there. Manager.

706
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,765
Yes, hello, Mr. Gu.

707
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,809
It's your duty as the manager
to protect the staff.

708
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,227
What are you doing?

709
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,479
-Call security.
-Yes, sir.

710
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,398
Do your job.

711
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,984
What? You're the manager?

712
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,446
You were here all along,

713
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,698
but you were hiding and watching?

714
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,242
What's your name?

715
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:48,078
How may I help you?

716
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,914
Do you expect me
to repeat everything again?

717
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,291
This is so annoying.

718
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,461
It's me, Mo Seong-ae!

719
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,922
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
FOR HEAD MANAGER GU WON

720
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,723
If there's nothing else for me to do…

721
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,309
Don't we have a manual
against rude customers?

722
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,436
Why do you put up with such nonsense?

723
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,357
We must remain hospitable
no matter what the circumstances.

724
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,984
But circumstances do differ.

725
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,361
Weren't you the outspoken type
who spoke her mind with a smile?

726
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,821
Even if we aren't at fault,

727
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,948
it's in our manual
to apologize to our guests

728
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,367
and make sure
they don't leave feeling offended.

729
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,119
What kind of a manual is that?

730
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,913
Who made that?

731
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,539
The higher-ups, I'm sure.

732
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,707
People like you.

733
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,252
I'm quite outspoken outside of work.

734
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,631
But at the hotel,
I'm not Cheon Sa-rang, but a concierge.

735
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,382
My job is to stay professional

736
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,219
and resolve complaints from guests
in an amicable way.

737
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,813
If you have nothing more to say,
please excuse me.

738
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,651
Don't ask me anything.

739
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:06,490
Favorite color. Favorite weather.
Favorite food. Everything.

740
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,616
I don't like anything.

741
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,243
I never asked.

742
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,827
-You will.
-I won't.

743
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,913
-What will you ask, then?
-Why should I?

744
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,581
You aren't going to do the interview?

745
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,499
What interview?

746
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,630
Mr. No.

747
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,802
Why doesn't she know about the interview?

748
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,262
I only gave you the proposal.

749
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,888
What about Ms. Cheon?

750
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,390
Only you need to look over it.

751
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,350
Employees must do as they're told. Right?

752
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,893
I'm done checking.

753
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,603
I won't do it!

754
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,438
You must.

755
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,940
It's the chairman's order.

756
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,276
Why do I have to do that like a clown?

757
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,819
The chairman of New World

758
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,487
and the daughter of Ttukbaegi

759
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,740
share their everyday lives online,
including how they eat, cook, and shop.

760
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,201
In this day and age,
public image is a warzone.

761
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,786
This time, you'll go to war

762
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,329
on behalf of our group

763
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,290
along with our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

764
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,208
-"War"?
-Why would I go to war

765
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,459
with a kind person?

766
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,211
I need a good fighter!

767
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,422
I'm going to war?

768
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,800
She looks like a good fighter.

769
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,220
Look at that. Did you do taekwondo?

770
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,180
-These idiots.
-I've never heard that.

771
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,313
So I have to do
a live promotional show with Mr. Gu,

772
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,856
-and it'll air on CNBS?
-Yes.

773
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,774
I told you about the promo video.

774
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,111
How is a promo video
the same as a live show on CNBS?

775
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,988
In essence, they're all promo videos.

776
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,531
And you won't have to do much.

777
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,074
You'll just read off the script.

778
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,286
But still, how could you
not have told me anything?

779
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,121
Show me. I need to look over it too.

780
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,748
Sa-rang.

781
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,791
We aren't here to look over things.

782
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,293
We're here to do as we're told.

783
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,629
But…

784
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,673
what's with the casual tone?

785
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,467
Did I do that?

786
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,052
I did.

787
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,261
Is it because I'm older?

788
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,805
That must be why.
You can talk casually too.

789
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:54,848
Okay, Sang-sik.

790
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,309
Give me the proposal and the script.

791
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,645
I know I should do as I'm told,

792
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,897
but I need to know.
I'm a person, not a puppet.

793
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,732
It's not that I won't give it to you--

794
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,400
Then bring it to the lobby soon.

795
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,777
I'm busy, so I have to go.

796
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,451
Please excuse me, sir.

797
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,212
How do they pick the best talent?

798
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,380
Is that so important?

799
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,548
Did you just see that?

800
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,508
What?

801
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,220
We're on a first-name basis
in under five minutes.

802
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,806
My skills make my life so difficult.

803
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,641
It's killing me.

804
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,269
-Get out.
-Yes, sir.

805
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,293
Babe.

806
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,504
Look behind you. A killer view, right?

807
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,006
Yes, it's killing me.

808
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,010
Why did we get out of the taxi
before we reached the top?

809
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,846
I did it for you.

810
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,849
You're always standing at the hotel,
so you should work out.

811
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,642
Almost there. Keep it up!

812
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,478
This is nice!

813
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,398
Darn it.

814
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,200
This is nice.

815
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,538
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

816
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,915
We first talked about coming here
last winter.

817
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,041
Remember?

818
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,711
It's me.

819
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,297
No, it's fine. Go ahead.

820
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,548
Yes.

821
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,258
Really? Everyone's there?

822
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,011
Okay, I'll be there soon.

823
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:56,970
Bye.

824
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,807
If you're done, let's go.

825
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,934
Is this a joke? We just got here.

826
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,478
I forgot that I had a reunion.

827
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,521
They're begging me to come.
You should come too.

828
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,191
No. I feel uncomfortable around strangers.

829
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,901
It's fine. They're all my friends.

830
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,652
Let's hang the lock and go.

831
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,488
No, I…

832
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,908
SA-RANG ♡ YU-NAM

833
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,248
Let us love forever!

834
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,423
What did you just throw?

835
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,762
As long as we hang something.

836
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,682
You can't just laugh it off right now.

837
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,809
It's still nice.

838
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,685
This is the key to our love.

839
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,606
Let's go.

840
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,066
No, you can go alone.

841
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,735
I'm sorry.

842
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,445
Let's leave right after we say hi.

843
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,571
Please?

844
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,369
We're leaving right away.

845
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,912
Sure. It won't even take a minute.

846
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,121
Let's go.

847
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,102
Did you go to an all-girls high school?

848
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,311
Come here.

849
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:30,939
Say hi to her.

850
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,107
This is my girlfriend.

851
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:33,942
Hello.

852
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,861
Be nice to her.

853
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,949
Hey Yu-nam, come and have a drink.

854
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,076
-Hey, it's you.
-Come on!

855
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,202
Be right there.

856
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,496
I'll go say hi to them.
Have fun with the girls.

857
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,831
Don't say anything weird.

858
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:48,832
I'm watching you.

859
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,333
-Fine.
-Fine.

860
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,960
-He's impossible.
-Goodness.

861
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,712
-Have some.
-Okay.

862
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,593
-I'm here now!
-Hit it!

863
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,012
-You're here.
-It's been so long.

864
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,431
-Three drinks for a latecomer.
-You still do this?

865
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,016
-Chug!
-Chug!

866
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,893
-Chug!
-Chug!

867
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,395
-Hey!
-Another round!

868
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,521
Hurry up.

869
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,253
How long have you two dated?

870
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,212
Sorry?

871
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,508
Just over a year now.

872
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,676
I can't believe it.

873
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,678
-He's never lasted three months.
-I know, right?

874
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,722
Do you always talk like that?

875
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,142
-Are you acting cute to seem younger?
-Stop it.

876
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,101
What?

877
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,228
Right, Seon-mi is getting married.

878
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,563
-What? To who?
-Yes.

879
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,440
Do you remember Gwang-ho in our class?

880
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,193
-No way. She's marrying him?
-No, his dad!

881
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,986
What? No way!

882
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,201
No, you're it!

883
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,914
-Bunny, bunny
-Bunny, bunny

884
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:11,831
You lost!

885
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,421
-Chug!
-I had too much to drink!

886
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,090
-Chug!
-Chug!

887
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,341
-Chug!
-Chug!

888
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,885
-How long will you make us dance?
-How long will you make us dance?

889
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,637
-Look at my shoulder
-Look at my shoulder

890
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,180
-Hey.
-Where are you going?

891
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,932
-Hey, wait!
-Hey!

892
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,644
Sa-rang.

893
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:37,857
You're leaving?

894
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,985
You said we'd just say hi and go.

895
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,820
Sorry. Are you sulking?

896
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,821
I'm mad.

897
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,906
I'm wondering if I should keep dating you.

898
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,200
I'm sorry. It's just been so long…

899
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,786
I'm leaving. We can talk later. Have fun.

900
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,705
Wait, let me take you home.

901
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,040
I'll say goodbye and come out.

902
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,041
Wait for me.

903
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,089
Hey, I have to go.

904
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,925
-Why?
-Don't go.

905
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,802
-Come on, stay.
-I really have to go.

906
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,304
-No, wait.
-Don't be like that.

907
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,140
-Do you need me?
-We do!

908
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,434
Then just one last drink.

909
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,689
Wait, I really have to go.

910
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:18,982
-Come on!
-No!

911
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,818
-Hey, no.
-Someone grab him.

912
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,778
-Yu-nam's favorite game!
-Yu-nam's favorite game!

913
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,697
-Game start!
-Game start!

914
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,740
This is fun!

915
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,033
So much fun!

916
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,827
-The game of death!
-The game of death!

Hello.

00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,236
Mr. Gu.

928
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,696
Hello.

929
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,822
Yes, hello…

930
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,617
Look at the time. You're late!

931
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,036
I'm here on time.

932
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,830
Hey, our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

933
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,125
-You're here on time.
-Hello.

934
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,170
-Are you two close?
-We are.

935
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,505
We're on a first-name basis.

936
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,258
Don't fool around at work.

937
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,927
And enough with this first-name basis.

938
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,429
Why not?

939
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,388
It's not the office.

940
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,932
I don't care where we are. Just stop it!

941
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,852
Our kind Ms. Sa-rang, follow me with this.

942
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,359
Ouch.

943
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,696
Hey, miss.

944
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,615
Is this yours?

945
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,575
No.

946
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,243
That's his.

947
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,494
It's his suitcase.

948
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,038
Hey, young man.

949
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:25,997
Come here.

950
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,876
Come over here.

951
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,174
What are you doing?

952
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,468
You should take care of your own suitcase.

953
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,971
Aren't you supposed to assist me
as my subordinate?

954
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,181
I'm sorry,

955
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,850
but I'm here for the promo video,
not as your porter.

956
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,060
Please excuse me.

957
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,812
I hope you two have a great talk.

958
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,689
It's him.

959
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,109
I'm sorry.

960
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,486
I'm frightened.

961
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,364
-No Sang-sik…
-Are you three messing around?

962
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,533
You still haven't apologized
after you hit me.

963
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,244
Hey.

964
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,537
Get over here.

965
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,558
I apologize.

966
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,436
Is this enough?

967
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,732
Do you think money is the answer
to all problems, you young little…

968
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,360
ONE MILLION WON

969
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,863
-Do you need change?
-No.

970
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,031
No?

971
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,493
Do you need a hand with this?

972
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,203
You don't seem very well.

973
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,288
-This is heavy.
-And a no to that too.

974
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,332
-Thank you.
-Sure.

975
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,344
You two.

976
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,365
The car is ready.

977
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,162
Is this our car?

978
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:30,913
Haven't you seen one before?

979
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,248
No, it's my first time!

980
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,792
Then you're in for a surprise.

981
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,963
Gosh, it's so loud.

982
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,632
It's best to ride it

983
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:46,554
under the scorching sun of Las Vegas
against a rough sandstorm.

984
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:50,683
This isn't Vegas,
but you're in for a special treat.

985
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,851
Watch this.

986
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,193
See? Isn't this something?

987
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,028
We're in for a good ride.

988
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,362
This is so cool.

989
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,202
Mr. Gu, the door is locked.

990
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,040
You two can find
your own way to the hotel.

991
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,177
Sa-rang, let's grab a cab.

992
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,637
I'll get one.

993
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,763
Okay.

994
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,327
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

995
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,253
Sir, please drive slowly.

996
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,291
It's so pretty.

997
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,307
FATHER

998
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,101
Hello?

999
01:04:57,184 --> 01:05:00,271
This is a business channel
that broadcasts worldwide.

1000
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,856
This is not only a promotion,

1001
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,526
but also a symbolic statement
that you'll be joining our group.

1002
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,987
And your performance

1003
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,823
will have an effect
on King Group's stock price as well.

1004
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,159
Put on a good show.

1005
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,301
Move that over.

1006
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,303
Everyone, get ready.

1007
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,946
FAVORITE VACATION SPOT?

1008
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,322
FAVORITE TYPE OF WEATHER?

1009
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,284
Did you get the questions
from the PR team?

1010
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,786
Yes, I did.

1011
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,913
You should take this instead.

1012
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,373
This is the finalized list.

1013
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,875
It changed? We're about to begin.

1014
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,252
It was just sent
from the managing director's office.

1015
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:08,130
We'll edit all the shots,
so feel free to read off of it.

1016
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:09,799
Okay.

1017
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,845
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
FOR HEAD MANAGER GU WON

1018
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,306
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
FOR HEAD MANAGER GU WON (REVISED)

1019
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,565
They were delivered right before filming.

1020
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,210
Lines. Then questions.

1021
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,789
KING THE LAND

1022
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,073
Smile, king.

1023
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,827
He's begging you to smile.
Can't you smile just once?

1024
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,328
I don't want to.

1025
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,416
Oh, so you're good at everything,
but you can't smile.

1026
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,544
I said I'm choosing not to.

1027
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:34,628
Smile!

1028
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:38,757
Get on this boat?

1029
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,718
I don't want to go with just him.

1030
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,553
I don't want to go with you either.

1031
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,388
Are you on your honeymoon?

1032
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:45,890
-No.
-No!

1033
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:46,807
Goodness!

1034
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:50,686
What's with the vibe?

1035
01:09:55,107 --> 01:10:00,112
