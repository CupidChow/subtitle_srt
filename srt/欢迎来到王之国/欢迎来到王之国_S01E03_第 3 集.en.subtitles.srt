KING THE LAND

2
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,023
He looks amazing.

00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,937
EPISODE 3

4
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,731
Hello.

5
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,649
Hello.

6
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,692
Please take extra care in this shoot.

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,996
You still don't have it memorized?

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,289
No, it's all in my head.

9
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,961
You seem embarrassingly nervous.

10
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,547
I'm not nervous.

11
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,006
As if. You're completely stiff.

12
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,174
No, I'm not.

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,593
Okay. We'll perform a camera test.

14
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,470
Interviewer, please look at the camera.

15
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,013
Yes, sir!

16
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,558
You are nervous.

17
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,519
That's rich coming from someone

18
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,064
who spruced up from head to toe
for a TV appearance.

19
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,732
With the sohalteun style.

20
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,735
Soharten style?

21
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,238
-What is that?
-It's how your hair is done now.

22
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,614
-My hair?
-Yes.

23
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,824
It'sâ€¦

24
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,951
exactly the sohalteun style.

25
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,412
Soharten style?

26
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,831
What kind of hairstyle is that?

27
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,711
Soharten style.

28
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,380
Soharten style.

29
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,924
"Câ€¦"

30
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,551
HOW TO TAME COW-LICKED BANGS

IMAGES

32
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,013
What is this?

33
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,391
What? So as in cow?

34
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,559
We'll begin shooting now.

35
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,852
Act natural.

36
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,354
All right. In five, four,

37
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,857
three, two, one.

38
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,986
Hello, I'm here on King Hotel's rooftop,

39
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,030
-where we have the best view
-She's so pretty.

40
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,032
of Jeju Island's beautiful sunset.

41
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,783
Sa-rang looks so good on camera.

42
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,076
As if.

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,912
-Today, along with Head Manager Gu,
-It's all makeup.

44
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,664
I'll take you
on a virtual tour of King Hotel.

45
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,582
Head Manager Gu,

46
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,376
can you say hello to the viewers?

47
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,088
Hello, I am Gu Won.

48
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,090
-My gosh.
-He's so handsome.

49
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,177
Along with the viewers,

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,639
the employees of King Hotel
have a lot of questions for you.

51
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,766
Before we introduce the hotel,

52
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,226
may I ask you a few questions?

53
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,769
Go ahead.

54
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,853
Okay.

55
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,775
Your mother was a founding member
of the Jeju King Hotel.

56
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,985
I'm sure being here
must hit you differently.

57
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,534
I hear you bear a resemblance
to your mother.

58
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,411
In what way do you most take after her?

59
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,725
Mr. Gu.

60
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,688
-What's going on?
-Is he leaving?

61
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,439
-Oh, my.
-What is happening?

62
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,607
What's going on?

63
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,820
Mr. Gu.

64
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,750
It seems an urgent matter
has come up for Head Manager Gu.

65
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,003
I don't think he knew
this was a live broadcast.

66
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,798
Once he returns, I'll let him know.

67
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,849
Come back home
before your mom's memorial service.

68
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,393
Which mom do you mean?

69
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,813
I don't even know

70
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,524
what my mom looks like
or if she's even alive or not.

71
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,942
You take after your mom.

72
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,321
You're reckless just like her.

73
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,681
How amusing.

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,727
The first question touched on
the topic of mothers.

75
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,313
Being here brings back memories

76
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,732
of the first time
I went to a hotel by the beach

77
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,609
-She's a natural.
-with my mom.

78
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,777
She's like a news anchor.

79
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,236
-You're right.
-Totally.

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,446
-She's so good.
-She's articulate.

81
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,865
But where did Mr. Gu go?

82
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,283
-Why isn't he coming back?
-Right?

83
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,328
That day that I spent with my mom
was the happiest day of my life.

84
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,498
I even dreamed of living in a hotel
for the rest of my life.

85
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,959
That hotel was this very King Hotel.

86
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,002
MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

87
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,046
Ever since that day,

88
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,299
King Hotel has always been
my joy and my dream.

89
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,220
And I was lucky enough
to start working here!

90
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,099
Now, I want to gift
all the guests of King Hotel

91
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,393
the same happiness that I felt that day.

92
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,025
-Goodness.
-What a relief.

93
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,193
It's fun now.

94
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,402
It's worth watching now.

95
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,239
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH HEAD MANAGER GU

96
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,907
Were you able to handle your situation?

97
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,283
Yes, thanks to you.

98
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,911
Could I take a look
at the interview questions?

99
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,287
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,708
"What memory comes to mind

101
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,168
when you think of your mom?"

102
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,880
"What is your favorite vacation spot
you visited with your mom?"

103
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,175
"What is your favorite meal
cooked by your mom?"

104
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,390
Skip these childish questions

105
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,725
and ask me things
that you're actually curious about.

106
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,904
Do you like watching the sunset?

107
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,115
It's so pretty.

108
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,412
So the sun was setting.

109
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,872
This is the best spot to see it, right?

110
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,789
Let's go watch it.

111
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,728
Isn't it so beautiful?

112
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,563
The sunset is so pretty.

113
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,340
What's your deal?

114
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,716
Did I do something wrong?

115
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,842
Do you think it's okay

116
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,345
for a mere employee
to question the head manager?

117
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,514
This may not be a big deal to you,

118
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,266
but a mere employee like me
can get fired over this.

119
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,144
Why push yourself so hard?

120
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,146
There are a lot of other hotels out there.

121
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,816
You might work
at daddy's company as a hobby,

122
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,486
but some people work hard
just to make ends meet.

123
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,239
I know work is just a time killer for you,

124
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,740
but don't get in my way.

125
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,159
I don't want to get hit
by any stones you threw for fun.

126
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,382
Do you even know

127
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,677
what kind of stone

128
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,638
you threw in my direction today?

129
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,563
Mr. Gu!

130
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,774
This place has become
the hottest place to visit.

131
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,442
It's so hot. Gosh, that's hot!

132
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,486
Do you see the number of likes?

133
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,904
You did a wonderful job.

134
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,823
Let's go with this concept tomorrow too.

135
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,367
Two beautiful lovebirds in the sunset.

136
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,410
A lovely

137
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,495
couple.

138
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,499
What's with the vibe?

139
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,834
I said it's trending.

140
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,253
Tomorrow's shoot will end in an hour.
One photo per location.

141
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,462
That's nonsense.

142
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,590
-The shoot isn't a joke--
-I said what I said.

143
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,259
It's out of the question, sir.

144
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,469
He's so ill-tempered.

145
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,555
Sa-rang, keep it up.

146
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,265
We just need a few shots here and there.

147
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,642
Okay.

148
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,561
Mr. Gu.

149
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,103
From now on, I'm going to make sure
you guys are in good health.

150
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,021
I've let you write down your weights,

151
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,898
but the numbers don't match what I see.

152
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,233
Any objections?

153
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,081
See?

154
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,251
You said you were 51 kg,
but you're actually 51.9 kg.

155
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,962
I rounded down to make the number simpler.

156
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,590
Hey, .9 kg equals 1.5 geun of pork belly.

157
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,384
One penalty point for dishonesty.

158
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,432
How are you so good
at maintaining your weight?

159
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,517
I learned it all from you.

160
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,519
As expected from the best of the bunch.

161
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,562
You may sit down.

162
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,190
One moment.

163
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,361
One moment, please.

164
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,908
Will that make a difference?

165
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,202
Of course. It's a chunk of metal.

166
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,674
Look at this. You're a total fraud.

167
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,927
How could you
misreport your weight by 3 kg?

168
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,723
I was definitely 50 kg
the last time I weighed myself.

169
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,142
My bowel movements
have become less frequent lately.

170
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,603
Three kilograms of poop

171
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,481
amounts to this much.

172
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,857
I'm sorry. I'll lose weight.

173
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,734
Surely you know
how every additional kilogram

174
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,028
burns up tons of fuel for the company.

175
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,948
Weight management is essential
not only for your own self-esteem

176
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,075
but also for cutting company costs.

177
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,077
Your lack of care for the company

178
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,788
is the reason why
you haven't been promoted.

179
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,543
All right. Get off the scale.

180
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,295
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,008
Ro-un!

182
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,468
You're exempt from this.

183
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,178
I can just tell by looking at you.

184
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,263
Do you work out?

185
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,973
No, I don't do anything.

186
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,601
You were endowed with a good body.

187
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,228
Sit back down.

188
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,481
That's it for today. Good work, everyone.

189
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,066
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

190
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,859
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

191
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,444
Aren't you going to weigh in?

192
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,363
Me?

193
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,948
Yes.

194
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,407
Me?

195
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,039
I'll check your weights
before each flight.

196
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,624
So you guys should stay fit.

197
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,875
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

198
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,263
Don't think of going on a diet.

199
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,473
You're already beautiful.

200
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,227
Thank you for saying that,
even if you don't mean it.

201
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,739
Here.

202
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,618
What is this?

203
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,829
It's to thank you for last time.

204
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,955
Give it to your mother.

205
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,832
It's a scarf recommended
by the national mom.

206
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,839
I'm the one you want to thank,

207
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,883
but the gift is for my mom.

208
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,511
You should be a good son.

209
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,265
Thank you.
I'll make sure to give it to her.

210
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,940
As you already know,
today's concept is "Smile."

211
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,736
We're going to capture
your heartfelt smiles for your guests.

212
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,614
Director Gu, you'll be the smile king.

213
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,700
Ms. Cheon, you'll be the smile queen.

214
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,494
Can we see your smiles?

215
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,707
Thank you.

216
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,628
Your smile is worth
a hundred million dollars.

217
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,754
Don't flatter me.

218
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,465
A hundred million dollars, my foot.

219
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,674
So fake.

220
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,969
Mr. Gu, can you also smile broadly?

221
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,179
Smile, king.

222
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,021
Let's get started.

223
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,231
Shall we?

224
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,316
Sure.

225
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,072
I don't think he'll smile.

226
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,282
He will once we start.
It's work, after all.

227
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,576
I can hear you.

228
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,871
Let's start now.

229
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,291
We'll go with the heart pose first.

230
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,377
Ready? Make a heart!

231
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,380
Wonderful. I only see one heart.

232
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,506
There's only one heart.

233
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,466
Why is that? We need one more heart.

234
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,885
Come on, one more heart.

235
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,221
One more, please.

236
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,139
That's it. A heart.

237
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,141
A heart, not a circle!

238
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,018
We need a heart.

239
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,396
Okay. A big heart now!

240
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,398
The sizes of your hearts are different.

241
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,525
-This.
-A big heart.

242
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,026
You have to move your arm up.

243
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,070
That's right. A little bit higher.

244
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,363
Show me your heart.

245
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,408
Yes, I see it's coming up.

246
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,452
Please make a heart.
Let's fill the whole world with hearts.

247
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,787
That's it.

248
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,123
Something isâ€¦

249
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,959
That's nice,

250
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,211
but try to make it smoother.

251
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,587
Okay. Now smile!

252
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,256
You're doing great, Ms. Cheon.

253
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,924
Amazing!

254
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,636
It would be lovely
if Mr. Gu could smile slightly.

255
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,555
The smile should be natural.

256
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,642
Okay.

257
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,811
You just need to smile once.

258
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,063
Please. Excuse me?

259
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,065
Thank you.

260
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,652
The punk didn't smile once.

261
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,575
I mean,

262
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,910
he's begging you to smile.

263
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,120
Can't you smile just once?

264
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,039
-I don't want to.
-I don't feel like smiling either.

265
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:20,956
Then don't.

266
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,625
We're in the middle of a shoot.

267
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,587
Didn't I tell you not to get in my way?

268
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,797
Didn't I tell you not to fake a smile?

269
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,174
I'm working right now.

270
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,385
I know you got the job through nepotism,
but can you not even do this much?

271
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,887
It's not that I can't.

272
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,888
I'm choosing not to.

273
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,139
Please. I don't think so.

274
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,435
My only flaw is that
there is nothing that I can't do.

275
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,980
Oh, so you're good at everything,
but you can't smile.

276
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,398
I said I'm choosing not to.

277
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,025
I see.

278
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,568
Let's get started.

279
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,696
Okay.

280
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,823
Remember to smile, okay?

281
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,158
All right.

282
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,619
Ready? Smile!

283
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,174
Mr. Gu?

284
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,551
Not a smirk, please.

285
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,394
That's enough.

286
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,773
The next one is the last, right?
Let's make it quick.

287
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,618
I knew that punk would do this.

288
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,079
What do we do?

289
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,664
-Can't we change the model?
-Sir.

290
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,998
I think this will work.

291
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,209
-What do you mean?
-Let's photoshop this.

292
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,754
We can move up the corner of his mouth
and make it look like he's smiling.

293
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,840
You can do that?

294
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,050
You bet.

295
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,431
You want me

296
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,143
-to get on this boat?
-Yes, sir.

297
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,021
You'll be showing people
how fresh King Hotel's ingredients are.

298
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,190
Whatever. I detest boats--

299
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,485
I know that, but you just need to
hold a tilefish for a second.

300
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,946
The photographer
will take care of the rest.

301
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,825
Then what about you?

302
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,909
Me?

303
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,995
I'm obviously going to stay here.

304
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,830
I detest boats.

305
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,582
Plus, I'm not a model.

306
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,292
Can't you go with us?

307
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,919
I don't want to go with just him.

308
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,172
I don't want to go with you either.

309
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,841
I also desperately want to go
with you guys, but I can't.

310
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,010
I have a lot on my plate.

311
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,762
Well, it looks like it's going to rain.

312
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,347
-Is the weather okay?
-Yes.

313
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,474
I checked the forecast. You'll be fine.

314
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,392
Are you sure?

315
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,603
-Are you making things up?
-No.

316
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,854
I'm positive.

317
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,480
-The weather's fine, right?
-Yes.

318
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,607
Great.

319
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,858
It's definitely okay.

320
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,776
Then be careful out there. Stay safe.

321
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,777
Right, Mr. Gu.

322
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,112
Pleaseâ€¦

323
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,656
-HermÃ¨s.
-Why youâ€¦

324
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,451
Be careful.

325
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,629
Mr. Gu,

326
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,215
pick up the biggest and freshest fish.

327
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,383
Ms. Cheon, you just have to face Mr. Gu

328
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,886
and smile broadly. Okay?

329
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,096
All right.

330
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,514
We're going to start now.

331
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,063
Can you give it a shake
to make it look like it's alive?

332
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,439
Good.

333
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,192
-More.
-Yes, more. Nice.

334
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,985
Make it look like it's flailing around.

335
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,321
A little more, please. More.

336
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,614
That's great.

337
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,032
Isn't the tilefish too small?

338
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,659
I can enlarge it with Photoshop.

339
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,535
-You can do that?
-Sure.

340
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,537
Okay. Keep going.

341
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,831
Imagine the fish being super large.

342
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,874
It's so heavy.

343
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,335
Good job, Ms. Cheon.

344
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,712
Make him carry it with both hands.

345
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,632
Okay. Can you please hold it
with both hands?

346
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,093
It's so heavy.

347
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,637
It's so big and heavy.
Remember those two things.

348
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,305
That's right. It's so heavy.

349
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,640
Even more. Great.

350
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,183
Gosh, it's so heavy.

351
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,060
Just a little bit more. That's great--

352
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,234
He just set it free.

353
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,363
How heavy.

354
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,121
-Let's go home. End the shoot.
-Yes, sir.

355
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,415
We're done shooting.

356
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,375
Good work.

357
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,752
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

358
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,568
The boat is acting strange,

359
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,903
and the weather doesn't look too good.

360
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,655
Should I steer toward Gapado?

361
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,781
No, just keep going.

362
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm telling you,
something's wrong with the boat.

363
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,036
We don't want to get hit by a typhoon.

364
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,538
I hate boats, the sea, and typhoons.

365
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,456
So let's hurry.

366
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,374
Then you can swim back for all I care.

367
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,709
What nonsense isâ€¦

368
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,423
Tell him to start the boat.

369
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,593
-Me?
-Your boss just gave you an order.

370
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,845
Go ahead.

371
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:27,763
Yes, sir.

372
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,894
-Excuse me, sir.
-Don't.

373
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,939
He said no.

374
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,274
Tell him it's a no for me too.

375
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,778
I can't.

376
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,363
He said no

377
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,616
and that you can swim back
if you really want to go.

378
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,971
Ms. Gang, good morning.

379
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,598
You're so full of energy already.

380
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,392
It's a must if I want to win
the incentive again this month.

381
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,936
Yes, let's keep our spirits up.

382
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,854
What is all of this?

383
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,483
-Snacks?
-Yes.

384
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,610
I specifically told you not to buy any.

385
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,948
I was told you didn't actually mean that.

386
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,866
What?

387
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,494
What are you bringing tomorrow?

388
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,247
Ms. Gang told me not to bring anything.

389
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,582
You're so dense.

390
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,084
Did you really believe that?

391
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,335
But Ms. Gang--

392
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,713
What she meant was
to cut down on the amount.

393
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,299
You have to take her words
with a grain of salt.

394
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,689
No one is allowed
to take weekends off anymore.

395
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,648
Only I'll do that.

396
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,777
Didn't you say we could take weekends off?

397
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,488
-What happened?
-It's always been like that.

398
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,365
Has anyone besides the manager
gotten weekends off?

399
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,741
No.

400
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,410
I heard you made Yu-bin buy snacks again.

401
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,828
Do as you want.

402
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,997
I'll also do as the old managers did.

403
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,998
That's our tradition.

404
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,000
-It's not what you thinkâ€¦
-What's wrong?

405
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,960
You have the right
to be treated like seniors,

406
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,670
but the junior member
doesn't deserve the same?

407
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,881
I was shortsighted.

408
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,799
Let's go back to our old ways.

409
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,885
Yu-bin will take care of
our food and snacks.

410
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,595
And only I get to rest on weekends.

411
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,512
Understood?

412
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,348
I'm sorry, ma'am. I had poor judgment.

413
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,726
This is your last chance.

414
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,227
I won't let it slide next time.

415
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,688
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

416
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,523
I hope no one is treated unfairly,

417
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,525
at least for the duration of my tenure.

418
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,695
Once I quit,
you guys can do whatever you want.

419
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,783
Let's have coffee before we start.
I'll go get it.

420
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,789
Then, I would like an iced Americano.

421
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,833
Iced tea for me, please.

422
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,586
-All right.
-What about you, Ha-neul?

423
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,548
I want a condensed milk latte
with whipped cream.

424
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,217
Not a mocha?

425
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,010
-Get ready.
-Yes, ma'am.

426
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,764
GAPADO

427
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,187
If you keep going straight,
you'll see a cottage.

428
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,813
You should stay there for tonight.

429
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,691
It's the best hotel in Gapado.

430
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,817
Make sure you go there.

431
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,653
Okay. Thank you.

432
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,872
Aren't you coming?

433
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,046
I'm going alone then.

434
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,347
There's no service.

435
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,534
Wait.

436
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,552
Hold on.

437
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,056
It can't be

438
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,100
that house over there, right?

439
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,394
Why? Are you scared?

440
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,271
No.

441
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,983
That word isn't in my vocabulary.

442
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,901
If I were scared,

443
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,862
I would've taken the lead like you,

444
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,114
not guarded the rear like this.

445
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,995
It's just a chicken.

446
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,334
I'm usually not afraid of anything.

447
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,669
But I hate birds. That rascal.

448
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,421
-Then do you want to go first?
-No.

449
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,673
Just admit that you're scared.

450
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,508
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

451
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,219
I already told you.
It's not because I'm scared.

452
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,929
I'm just trying to cover our backs.

453
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,516
Okay.

454
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,935
Follow me. I'll go first.

455
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,562
Did I

456
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,314
ever tell you

457
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:31,941
that I box

458
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,069
as a hobby?

459
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,509
What was that for?

460
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,610
Jeez.

461
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,858
Cheon Sa-rang.

462
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,112
Cheon Sa-rang!

463
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,920
Cheon Sa-rang.

464
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,266
Why did you come out from there?

465
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,684
What?

466
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,478
Oh, my. You're awake?

467
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,855
Look at you.

468
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,315
You're a strapping young lad,

469
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,900
yet look at you shaking in your boots.

470
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,151
Goodness.

471
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,238
Your wife will have her hands full
because of you.

472
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,448
My wife?

473
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,159
You better carry your wife around a lot.

474
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,994
You fainted in the middle of the road,

475
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,122
and she carried you
all the way here on her own.

476
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,208
Do you even realize
how hard it must've been?

477
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,334
Tell me about it.

478
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,670
I've never seen anyone faint
upon seeing someone's face.

479
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,510
Where are we?

480
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,844
What do you mean?

481
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,264
You're at the most luxurious hotel

482
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,351
as well as the best restaurant in Gapado.

483
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,353
Are you on your honeymoon?

484
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,271
-No.
-No!

485
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,232
Then are you two a fling?

486
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,693
There's nothing between us.
He's just my superior.

487
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,653
Goodness.

488
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,614
A superior can become a lover,
and a lover can become a father.

489
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,074
There's not much to it.

490
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,035
I don't just go around
dating anyone, ma'am.

491
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,578
What do you mean by "anyone"?

492
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,913
How am I "anyone"?

493
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,499
I'm the one who should be saying that.

494
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,167
Yes, sure.

495
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,045
I'm telling you, I'm not just anyone!

496
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,004
Right.

497
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,966
I knew it.

498
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,884
The face is what completes the look.

499
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,762
My clothes have found
their rightful owner.

500
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,390
You can continue
your lover's quarrel later.

501
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,474
Let's have a drink.

502
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,393
- It's not like that!
- It's not like that!

503
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:04,612
Have you ever heard of
the famous Chinese bushclover wine?

504
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,240
Even if we have important guests,

505
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,868
we don't usually bring this out.

506
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,705
After my old man drank this,

507
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:17,166
I delivered eight babies,
one after the other.

508
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,882
Do you like drinking?

509
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,051
He's so frail.
He's probably a lightweight.

510
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,678
But I'll take a drink.

511
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,014
What did you say? "Frail"?

512
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,059
I'm going to drink out of this.
Please fill it to the brim.

513
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,227
This is pretty strong.

514
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,353
Will you be okay?

515
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,022
If that's the case,

516
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,565
I will

517
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,233
use this.

518
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,403
Me too.

519
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,238
-All right.
-Okay.

520
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,951
Gosh, the liquor is weak.

521
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,827
I can chug it down so easily.

522
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,537
This tastes like water.

523
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,580
Give me more, please.

524
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,707
-Fill it to the brim, please.
-Sure.

525
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,334
You know your alcohol.

526
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,089
Being young is great, isn't it?

527
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,676
Here you go.

528
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,886
You gave me a lot.

529
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,900
This is nice.

530
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,990
I told you not to smile.

531
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,660
I wasn't smiling at you.

532
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,745
Don't look at me then.

533
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,415
Why are you so irritable?

534
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,084
You're always complaining.
You grumpy pants.

535
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,213
It's because nothing works out
whenever I'm with you.

536
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,298
From now on,

537
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,258
you better

538
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,136
stay out of my sight.

539
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,265
You can't order me around!

540
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,850
We're not at work right now.

541
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,273
-Hey!
-What?

542
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,985
Did you just

543
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,362
smack me?

544
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,448
How dare you?

545
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,700
"How dare you," my ass.

546
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,909
"My ass"?

547
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,662
Don't regret this later.

548
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,998
I won't.

549
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,584
Regretting doesn't change anything.

550
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,044
Okay, just you wait.

551
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,172
I'm going to really
make you regret what you just did.

552
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:14,510
I'm not someone
who you can just hit and mistreat.

553
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,345
All people are the same.

554
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,015
That means
everyone should be treated equally.

555
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:23,436
No one should be mistreated!

556
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,148
Do you think you're all that
because you're rich?

557
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,358
Don't be such a snob.

558
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,488
"Snob"?

559
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,405
Yes.

560
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,867
People who take power trips
because they're well-off.

561
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:42,038
It's hard enough having to bow and scrape

562
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,248
to rude guests every day.

563
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,752
And now I have to deal with your crap too.

564
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,922
On top of that,

565
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,091
you're the king of all snobs.

566
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,717
King.

567
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,677
King Hotel. King.

568
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,262
Snobâ€¦ Gu.

569
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,680
Snobby Gu.

570
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,603
If I'm a snob, let me seeâ€¦

571
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,355
You are

572
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,941
-that.
-What?

573
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,859
Faced. That's it, faced.

574
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,278
Faced. Two-faced.

575
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,530
You're so fake.

576
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,447
Phony Cheon.

577
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,407
Look.

578
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,452
Do you think it's easy to fake a smile?

579
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,955
-Not anyone can do it.
-Look at you.

580
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,833
It's a high-level technique.

581
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,336
I've developed it
by putting up with all sorts of asses.

582
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,421
A certain imperviousness.

583
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,883
Sure. What a nice technique.

584
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,552
Don't be absurd.

585
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,556
Hey, Snobby Gu.

586
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,893
Why don't you just pour me a drink?

587
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,397
"Hey"?

588
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:50,940
Hey.

589
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,692
Pour me a drink.

590
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,152
You must be joking.

591
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,866
Give me some.

592
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,621
It's only up to today

593
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,166
that I'm letting you off the hook.

594
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,333
Why would you?

595
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,752
Do whatever you want.
You have that freedom.

596
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,090
You can do whatever you want
without caring how others see you.

597
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,633
I'm so jealous.

598
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,053
You don't know what it's like to be me.
Watch what you say.

599
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,181
Of course I don't.

600
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,309
But you don't have to fake a smile.

601
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,020
That in itself is a huge privilege.

602
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,982
I'm always smiling.

603
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,653
I smile even when I'm hurt or sad.

604
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,450
But it's better that I suffer the pain.

605
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,786
If someone else suffered because of me,

606
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,248
that would make me feel even worse.

607
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,714
But why do you dislike smiling so much?

608
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,894
Because everyone wears it as a mask.

609
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,021
It's all fake.

610
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,901
I'm sure there was
a sincere person among them.

611
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,946
That's pretty sad.

612
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,081
How pretty.

613
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,704
Didn't I tell you not to smile?

614
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,916
That wasn't a fake smile.

615
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,543
It was genuine.

616
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,587
I don't care.

617
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,798
Just don't smile.

618
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,468
I'm not even working right now.

619
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,345
Why can't I smile when I feel like it?

620
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,097
From now on,

621
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,267
even outside of working hours,

622
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,519
smilingâ€¦

623
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,564
in front of meâ€¦

624
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,819
is not permitted.

625
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,031
Why not?

626
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,533
No.

627
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,369
I'm not listening to you.

628
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,414
No. I'm going to keep smiling.

629
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,250
Whatever.

630
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,088
Just pour me another drink.

631
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,132
Okay?

632
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,579
SUITES

633
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,259
Snobby Gu.

634
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,011
Snobby Gu.

635
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,976
It's cold.

636
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,024
Don't smile in front of me.

637
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,306
My head.

638
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,743
My gosh. I must be crazy.

639
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,828
I didn't even take
my socks off last night.

640
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,499
Goodness!

641
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,269
Phony Cheon.

642
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,440
Why don't you get off of me?

643
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,697
Why are you sleeping here?

644
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,075
Since this is my room.

645
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,493
But this is my room.

646
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,995
I clearly heard "two rooms" yesterday,
and there were two doors.

647
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,001
ONE ROOM IF USED BY A COUPLE,
TWO ROOMS IF USED BY STRANGERS

648
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,004
I thought this was
the best hotel in Gapado.

649
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,950
What are you doing?

650
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,388
You have some time
until the boat gets here.

651
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,681
Why don't you take a lap?

652
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,266
I don't like walking.

653
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,477
You can't take in everything on foot.

654
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,354
-You need to be on wheels.
-I see.

655
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,898
I can see everything from here.

656
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,651
The scenery of Gapado
should not just be seen with the eyes.

657
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,903
It must be engraved in the heart.

658
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,821
Just go and bike around with your wife.

659
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,166
Where did you get that from?

660
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,543
It's from the old man.

661
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,212
Do you want to hop on?

662
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,675
No. We're not close enough
to ride a bike together.

663
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,802
Yes, you're so right about that.

664
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:46,016
But I hear it's impossible to see
even a quarter of the island on foot,

665
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,227
so I'm just trying to do you a favor.

666
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,563
The view from over there

667
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,691
is apparently very nice.

668
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,863
Is there only one bike?

669
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,199
Forget it. I'll go by myself.

670
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,044
Can I hop on?

671
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,477
Are you tired?

672
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,478
What?

673
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,147
You're not tired, are you?

674
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,023
This is a cakewalk.

675
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,996
It's the sea.

676
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,218
It's so pretty here.

677
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,054
Isn't it beautiful?

678
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,765
Not really.

679
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,492
Here.

680
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,704
Send me the receipt.

681
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,917
All you have to do is say thank you.

682
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,211
Thanks.

683
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,629
Send me the receipt.

684
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,564
Sorry? How much?

685
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,567
675,000 won.

686
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,485
How?

687
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,571
It costs 200,000 won per suite.

688
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,989
So it's 400,000 won for 2.

689
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,618
The moonlight dinner was 120,000 won

690
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,496
and the wine wasn't included,
so another 100,000 won.

691
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,206
So that's 620,000 won.

692
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,083
And the bike rental costs 55,000 won.

693
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,586
So the total comes out to 675,000 won.

694
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,382
But we used one room.

695
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,385
Did you two sleep together last night?

696
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,636
-No.
-No.

697
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,805
So then you used two separate rooms.

698
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,223
We accept credit cards too.

699
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,559
That's ridiculous. You're ripping us off.

700
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,935
It's fine. It's just money.

701
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,020
I didn't bring my wallet.

702
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,690
Can I pay with this?

703
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,568
This isn't a pawnshop.

704
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,361
I won't accept that.

705
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,613
I thought you said
you accept credit cards.

706
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,781
The card's in here.

707
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,324
So I'll pay with this.

708
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,159
There's a card in there?

709
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,786
Do you expect me to believe that?

710
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,372
Did you think you could fool me,

711
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,915
thinking I'm some old hillbilly?

712
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,458
What's gotten you all worked up?

713
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,294
-These peopleâ€¦
-Good thing you're here.

714
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,461
Something seems fishy.

715
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,464
You had a grand old time
eating and drinking here last night.

716
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,967
Who are you calling fishy
when you're refusing to pay?

717
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:07,884
What?

718
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,136
They didn't pay you, Mom?

719
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,554
No.

720
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,097
-Mom?
-Mom?

721
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,932
I thought you were a chaebol.

722
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,434
Why the fuss over chump change?

723
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,893
That's not it.

724
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,353
Take a look at this.

725
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,606
I was going to pay

726
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,109
-with this.
-What is that?

727
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,486
This isn't a pawnshop.
What the heck is this?

728
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,656
Anyway, if you don't pay,
I'm not starting the boat.

729
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,827
Then give me your account number.

730
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,121
I'll tell my assistant
to wire you the money.

731
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,497
Hold on.

732
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,669
Ma'am, even if the room
we slept in last night

733
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,838
is the best suite in Gapado,

734
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,507
compared to King Hotel,
100,000 won will do for one night.

735
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,676
I'll accept 150,000 won,
but no more than that.

736
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,055
This may be a tourist spot, but dinner
should cost no more than 50,000 won.

737
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,598
Bike rentals are usually
10,000 won per person.

738
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,350
I'll leave the wine price at 100,000 won.

739
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,893
Then the total is 320,000 won,

740
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,603
but including the borrowed clothes,

741
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,022
we'll pay you 350,000 won.

742
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,444
Why do you need to cut the price in half
when you're a chaebol?

743
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,071
Can you rip people off if they're rich?

744
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,864
I could report you for price gouging.

745
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:14,201
Gosh, you youngsters are so petty.

746
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,079
Just pay the price and leave in peace.

747
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,540
By the looks of it, you guys are related.

748
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,502
Was the boat even malfunctioning?

749
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,503
What?

750
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,171
Malfunctioning?

751
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,798
Yes. Very much so.

752
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,176
You're not using Jeju dialect today.

753
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,470
Is that so?

754
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,890
350,000 won.

755
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,600
We can wire it right away.

756
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,185
Okay. It's a deal.

757
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,896
Deal.

758
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,500
Why did you waste your energy
when I could've easily paid for it?

759
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,878
You've never had to check
the price of anything, have you?

760
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,881
Why would I?

761
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,967
Most people do

762
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,177
to make sure that the price is reasonable

763
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,971
and that they can afford it.

764
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,640
My grandma taught me
that money doesn't grow on trees.

765
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,934
They were obviously trying to swindle us.

766
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,811
It's wrong to deceive others.

767
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,356
Money should be earned honestly.

768
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,650
But why?

769
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:30,986
What do you mean?

770
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,904
To preserve one's integrity.

771
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,208
Alsoâ€¦

772
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,171
I'm sorry about the other day.

773
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,590
About what?

774
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,050
The stone that I supposedly threw at you.

775
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,344
I don't know what it was,

776
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,682
but the look in your eyes
told me you were hurt by it.

777
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,395
Right. That stone.

778
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,607
I forgot about that.

779
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,964
This is delicious.

780
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,174
It's amazing with beer.

781
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,301
Right? I got it at the airport
because I was short on time,

782
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,594
but it's pretty good.

783
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,680
So did the live broadcast go well?

784
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,016
Yes. Fortunately, people enjoyed it.

785
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,227
What is your head manager like?

786
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:48,897
How should I put it?

787
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,482
He's

788
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,067
a stuck-up jerk.

789
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,902
-What about his looks?
-He looks like one too.

790
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,278
He's the heir of King Group.

791
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,280
It'd be weirder for him not to be.

792
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,116
Right. Did you give him the scarf?

793
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,160
What? Are you seeing someone?

794
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,621
No, he's just a junior.

795
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,625
-Isn't it time for Cho-rong to come home?
-Yes.

796
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,544
-Let's go. We'll see you off.
-Okay.

797
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,053
How is it that all three of us
still don't own a car?

798
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,055
I know, right?

799
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,975
If one of us had a car,
we could go for a drive.

800
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,227
Hey, why don't you buy a car?

801
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,770
I don't have the money.

802
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:29,980
Then what about you?

803
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,481
I don't have a license.

804
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:34,234
How could you not have a license
at your age?

805
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,111
It should be you. You have both.

806
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,112
She's right.

807
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,947
Let's get one to celebrate your promotion.

808
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,865
-Yes.
-Hey.

809
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,117
I only get paid
an extra 20,000 won per month.

810
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,118
20,000 won?

811
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,370
Yes. 20,000 won, not 20,000 dollars.

812
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,165
I'm so consistent, aren't I?

813
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,585
The bus is here. I'm leaving.

814
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,129
Hey, Gang Darong.

815
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,799
You're doing great.
You're the best out of us three.

816
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,427
Bye!

817
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,572
Was that the best you could do?

818
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,034
How could you storm off
because of that one question?

819
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,619
As a businessman,

820
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,705
a lot of things can and will happen.

821
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,833
What sort of head manager
behaves worse than a mere employee?

822
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,087
We attracted a lot of views
and it was great publicity.

823
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,505
It's the outcome that matters.

824
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,217
The methods aren't important.
That's what I learned from you.

825
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,677
Did you raise those views?

826
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,470
Did we gain publicity because of you?

827
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,222
You made a mess,

828
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,599
and a mere employee cleaned it up for you!

829
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,558
Aren't you ashamed?

830
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,018
But it all turned out well.

831
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,356
How long will you fuss over this?

832
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,235
You're too old to be looking for your mom!

833
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,488
I'm not looking for her.

834
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,158
I just want to know the truth.

835
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,119
The only truth you need to know

836
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,746
is the company's profit and stock prices.

837
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,000
The only thing
that can be trusted is money.

838
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,585
Love? Laughter?

839
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,462
Kindness? Respect?

840
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,464
It's all a lie!

841
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,135
What about Mom?

842
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,888
Was that a lie too?

843
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,395
There's no such thing as love

844
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,856
for people in our station.

845
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,200
Then what is there?

846
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,077
Duty.

847
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:35,331
It is my duty to protect
what my father passed down to me,

848
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,501
and it is your duty
to protect what I've accomplished.

849
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,003
Love?

850
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,630
Don't be foolish.
Just be good at your job!

851
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,091
If you're going to
talk about your mom again, leave.

852
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,134
No.

853
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,179
I still need to know the truth.

854
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,167
Why don't you rest up
since you're finally home?

855
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,337
Though it seems like
you'll get kicked out soon.

856
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,507
There's no need to be scared of me.

857
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,467
What?

858
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,470
I said I had no interest in the company.

859
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,932
I warned you not to mess with me,
yet look what you did.

860
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,476
In a childish way at that.

861
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,186
Me, scared of you?

862
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,687
Don't provoke me.

863
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,566
You're just a nobody.
How dare you get smart with me?

864
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,070
You better quit acting up.

865
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,805
Sa-rang, I enjoyed the live broadcast.

866
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:14,889
You did great.

867
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,226
You're the star of our hotel now.

868
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,769
You were so cool.

869
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,438
It was nothing, but thank you.

870
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,648
Goodness.

871
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,859
Look at you guys celebrating over nothing.

872
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,156
Do you think you're famous now
after one TV appearance?

873
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,740
Anyone could've done as much.

874
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,868
Had it been me,
it would've hit 10 million views.

875
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,119
You know that, right?

876
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,498
Right this way, sir.

877
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,834
Hello.

878
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,420
Thank you all for your hard work.

879
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,135
You must be her. Cheon Sa-rang.

880
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,845
Our best talent.

881
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,972
Yes, sir. I'm Cheon Sa-rang.

882
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,682
Who hired her?

883
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,808
I did.

884
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,978
The broadcast told me everything.

885
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,606
I get why the guests chose you
as the best employee.

886
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,318
You're good at thinking on your feet
and handling crises.

887
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,277
And you're kind-hearted.

888
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,154
Thank you, sir.

889
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:15,450
Being chosen as the best talent
for two years in a row

890
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,410
is any concierge's crowning glory.

891
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,705
It's an honor for me to have
such an excellent employee at my hotel.

892
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,415
Not at all.

893
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,376
I am honored
to be able to work at King Hotel.

894
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,254
Starting tomorrow,

895
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,340
work at King the Land.

896
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,383
Pardon?

897
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,385
Didn't you say King Hotel
has been your joy and dream

898
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,803
ever since you were young?

899
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,765
As the employee
who loves our hotel the most,

900
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,768
you should be given the opportunity
to rise to its highest point.

901
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:09,170
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

902
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,250
What are you doing?

903
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,503
What's making you smile like that?
Let me see.

904
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,593
This isn't the time for you
to indulge in narcissism.

905
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,844
Did you even knock?

906
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:58,928
Over ten times.

907
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,806
You couldn't hear me
because you were so entranced.

908
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,934
Also, the PR team
already selected the photos,

909
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,269
so you don't have to look at them.

910
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,187
Here. Why don't you review this first?

911
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,065
I put this report together myself.

912
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,234
I hear you'll be attending
the board meetings from now on.

913
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,361
I compiled profit and loss statements
from the past three years,

914
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,822
a comparative analysis of
major competitors' marketing strategies,

915
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,533
this year's business plan,
next year's business goalsâ€¦

916
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,619
You're not listening to me.

917
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,247
So the PR team already chose the photos?

918
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,624
Yes, sir.

919
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,294
Why don't I take a look?

920
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,675
Is this a tilefish or a whale?

921
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,052
The fish hardly matters.

922
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,762
You should look at your face.

923
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,472
The photographer is so kind.

924
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,307
He even photoshopped your face.

925
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,104
-What is this?
-This one was the most natural

926
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,564
out of the ones that were photoshopped.

927
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,858
That's why you should've smiled
when they asked.

928
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,485
Bring him to me immediately.

929
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,278
The photographer?

930
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,281
-Bring him to me.
-Yes, sir.

931
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,109
What am I even doing?

932
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,410
UNBELIEVABLY ACCURATE PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST

933
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,080
HOW DO YOU TRULY FEEL ABOUT THEM?

934
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:04,137
"I am always waiting
for that person's text."

935
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,096
"Yes."

936
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,098
"Maybe. No."

937
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,143
Maybe?

938
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,060
MAYBE

939
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,396
"I have set up an appointment

940
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,273
to meet this person in private before."

941
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:16,816
No.

942
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,862
"This person's number is saved
in my phone with a nickname."

943
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:23,906
Phony Cheon.

944
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,032
Yes.

945
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:26,868
Nextâ€¦

946
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,498
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THEM
EVEN WHEN I TRY NOT TO

947
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,838
"I can't help but think about them

948
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,758
even when I try not to."

949
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:47,680
YES

950
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,812
NO

951
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:04,822
YES, NO

952
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,616
YES

953
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,119
"I can't help but smile

954
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,916
when I see this person smile."

955
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,598
YES

956
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,644
YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON THEM

957
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,024
Oh, my.

958
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,693
You are dealing with
the pain of unrequited love.

959
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,695
Don't keep your feelings bottled up.

960
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,282
Go to that person
and ask them how they feel about you.

961
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,869
You have already fallen for
that person's irresistible charms.

962
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,622
If you want to develop
your relationship with them,

963
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:57,208
you need to muster up the courage.

964
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,187
Thanks for your hard work.

965
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,273
Thank you for everything.

966
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:26,737
Good luck.

967
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,691
-Heyâ€¦
-Sa-rang.

968
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,559
KING THE LAND

969
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,511
You have no idea
what King the Land is like.

970
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,972
We call this place
the hotel's first class.

971
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,223
I'll do my best.

972
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,768
Let's go. Your uniform is ready.

973
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:46,812
She must be pretty.

974
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,817
That rotten jerk. Forget about money.

975
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,862
You should be with a man
who's good to you.

976
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,572
I asked to see you yesterday.

977
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:57,990
What? When?

978
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,951
I simply can't stand
owing someone a favor.

979
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,036
But I'm okay with it.

980
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,371
I just feel bad for you.

981
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,749
Would you like

982
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,626
to have dinner with me?

983
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:16,008
