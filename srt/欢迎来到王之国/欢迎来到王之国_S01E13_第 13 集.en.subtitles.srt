1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,132
-Goodness.
-Dad.

3
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,554
Oh.

4
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,847
Let us serve the meal.

5
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,973
Yes, sure.

6
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,386
It's Ms. Best Talent.

7
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,971
It's been a while.

8
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,477
Hello, have you been well, sir?

9
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,772
If she's titled the Best Talent,

10
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,941
she must be very talented.

11
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,569
Not at all.

12
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,738
He's just being generous.

13
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,908
Then let us serve the soup first.

14
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,828
It's already been decided,
so there's no need to drag this out.

15
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,205
Won, now that your position is settled,

16
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,415
marry Yu-ri within the year
before it's too late.

17
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,415
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

18
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,294
Are you hurt?

19
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,253
Are you okay?

20
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,588
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,298
I'm asking if you're okay.

22
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,384
What?

23
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,227
Yes, I'm fine.

24
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,522
It's dangerous, so step away.
I'll clean it.

25
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,065
No, I'll do it, sir.

26
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,526
I'll do it.

27
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,614
My apologies, sir.

28
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,865
Allow me to do it.

29
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,909
-Sa-rang, you may leave.
-No, ma'am.

30
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,201
-I'll--
-Sa-rang?

31
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,007
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,023
-Mr. Gu.
-Yes.

33
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,651
Goodness.

34
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,031
-It's delicious.
-Is that so?

35
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,412
EPISODE 13

36
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:52,500
Seeing Won manage
the 100th-anniversary event made me think,

37
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,586
"This kid sure can put up an act."

38
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,922
But it wasn't an act
by the looks of things today.

39
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,550
He actually cares about his employees.

40
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,553
That's why I like him.

41
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,180
He even takes care of people like her.

42
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,058
He's different from
all the pretentious men out there.

43
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,063
You're amazing for liking that about him.

44
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,819
Chairman Han and I
will arrange all the wedding preparations.

45
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,987
Understood?

46
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,447
Yes, Father.

47
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,283
Won.

48
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,409
What about you?

49
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,540
I…

50
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,053
I…

51
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,181
am in love with someone else.

52
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,521
What were you thinking?

53
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,149
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,486
How did you join King the Land
with those skills?

55
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,653
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,698
I'll be the main server
and have Sa-rang assist me.

57
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,201
How can I let her go back in
when she dropped a plate?

58
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,704
I'll do the serving.
Stay on the second floor.

59
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,665
Wouldn't the second floor
be too difficult for a new member?

60
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,375
That's why you take charge there.

61
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,252
-Ha-na.
-Yes, ma'am.

62
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,630
Since when did King the Land
become so lax?

63
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,174
It wasn't like that when I was there.

64
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,593
It's the room at the very end.

65
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,136
Let's not make any more mistakes.

66
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,639
Yes, ma'am.

67
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,227
Gosh, I thought Won was just a kid.
He's all grown up now.

68
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,479
He even has someone he loves.

69
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,273
-Do you love her a lot?
-Yes.

70
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,191
Of course.

71
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,360
A man should know how to love a woman.

72
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,155
We're not here today
to find out who you're in love with.

73
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,615
We're talking about marriage.

74
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,701
We only need to talk about you and Yu-ri.

75
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,620
I told you from the very beginning.

76
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,205
I'm sorry,

77
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,334
but I've never had feelings for Yu-ri.

78
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,045
-And my feelings won't change.
-Won.

79
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,214
It's okay.

80
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,883
Everyone falls in and out of love.

81
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,511
It's completely normal.
Don't be too concerned.

82
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,139
Won.

83
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:15,101
Love her all you want,
then break up with her.

84
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,019
We have to get married anyway.

85
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,400
She's my daughter,
but she has such a big heart.

86
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,194
That is exactly why I had my eye on her.

87
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,320
She has a big heart.

88
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,158
I said…

89
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,745
I'm in love with someone else,
but no one is interested.

90
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,416
I was upset for a second.

91
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,752
But I don't think I need to be.

92
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,337
Because

93
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,174
I also have no interest
in any of this marriage talk.

94
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,843
I'll be leaving first.

95
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,803
I hope you have a good time, sir.

96
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,846
You too, Yu-ri.

97
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,474
Let's meet by ourselves next time.

98
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:59,228
I thought that punk was a softie.

99
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,605
But he has a firm character.

100
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,106
Right, Dad?

101
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,608
He grows on you, doesn't he?

102
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,443
Yes, I like him.

103
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,613
I'll apologize on his behalf.

104
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,698
It's okay.

105
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,950
He's mine anyway.

106
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,953
I'm not going to let anyone else have him,

107
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,330
so don't worry.

108
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,358
The person you have called is unavailable…

109
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,042
We need to talk.

110
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,211
Why didn't you answer my call?

111
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,588
My phone is in my locker.
I'm working right now.

112
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,052
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

113
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,014
Let's talk later.

114
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,724
Are you mad?

115
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,936
No.

116
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,856
I was just a little shocked.

117
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,532
It's not going to happen.

118
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,200
Okay?

119
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,787
Okay.

120
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,249
Let's talk later.
I need to serve this quickly.

121
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,175
But why are you working here?

122
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,635
This isn't the hotel.

123
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,264
I wonder that myself.

124
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,891
I'm pretty sure I'm someone
who works at a hotel.

125
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,816
Can you please step aside, sir?

126
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,363
Fine.

127
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,949
Call me as soon as you get off work.

128
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,784
I'll be waiting.

129
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,291
Go ahead.

130
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,698
Your food is ready.

131
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,706
Your food is ready.

132
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,465
I will go ahead and serve your food.

133
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,363
Your food will be served.

134
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,313
Oh my god!

135
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,945
Are you an idiot?

136
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,739
You're so funny.

137
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,616
Look at your face. It's hilarious.

138
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,077
Who are you?

139
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,581
How dare you talk to me like that?
Call me "sir."

140
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,667
Sir, my foot. Apologize.

141
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,586
If you apologize now, I'll forgive you.

142
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,296
That's what people like you do.

143
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,922
I'm not someone who apologizes.

144
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,508
What's wrong with you?

145
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,803
This is your last chance.
Apologize while I count to three.

146
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,263
What? Why should I?

147
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,639
One,

148
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,932
-two…
-Three.

149
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,184
What are you going to do?

150
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,030
Apologize.

151
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,157
Why should I? Do you know who I am?

152
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,742
I don't need to know who you are.

153
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,994
Spoiled kids like you
need to be taught a lesson.

154
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,954
I told you to apologize!

155
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,873
Stop!

156
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,791
If you don't stop, I won't forgive you!

157
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,336
I get to forgive you.
You just have to apologize.

158
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,671
I'm sorry. Happy now?

159
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,839
In Korean!

160
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,509
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry.

161
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,719
My gosh.

162
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,805
Just watch. I'll make you pay.

163
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,182
You're going to regret this.

164
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,975
Well, too bad.

165
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,685
I don't regret anything.

166
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,937
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

167
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,814
Yes, this is Cheon Sa-rang.

168
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,317
Escort Mr. Ji-hu downstairs.
The chairman is asking for him.

169
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,862
-Sorry? Who?
-Mr. Ji-hu.

170
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,239
Ms. Gu's son.

171
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,915
So you're Ji-hu?

172
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,757
The chairman is asking for you.

173
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,676
Shall we go down together, sir?

174
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,183
How delicious.

175
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,644
Our Ji-hu is here.

176
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,689
It has been a while.

177
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,065
How have you been, sir?

178
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,818
I see. You must be Ji-hu.

179
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,611
He's so mature now.

180
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,948
I know, right?
You're starting to look like your uncle.

181
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,283
You're flattering me.

182
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,744
He has not once ever acted like a baby.

183
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,746
I have a wonderful grandson.

184
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,499
It is an honor
to have been born as your grandson.

185
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,501
Did you hear him?

186
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,503
How could I not adore him?

187
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,177
Good work today.

188
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,179
Accept this with gratitude.

189
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,056
Thank you, ma'am.

190
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,267
Thank you, ma'am.

191
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,393
Thank you, ma'am.

192
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,478
Thank you, ma'am.

193
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,731
Thank you, ma'am.

194
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,233
Thank you, ma'am.

195
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,740
You're aware that you don't deserve
to receive this, right?

196
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,243
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,579
Please be lenient.
It didn't end up being a big problem.

198
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,205
She also went through a lot
working upstairs.

199
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,918
If you're ever chosen
to be a part of the Dream Team again,

200
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,753
relearn the basics before coming back.

201
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,173
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,175
Thank you.

203
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,715
My pay for the day
is as much as my monthly paycheck.

204
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,866
So you're in love?

205
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
Yes.

206
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,872
I'll keep this short.

207
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,457
End it.

208
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,251
I don't intend to.

209
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,877
I'm

210
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,213
the father

211
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,465
of both you and King Group.

212
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,678
You too are the son
of both me and King Group.

213
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,014
To us,

214
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,975
marriage carries greater value than love.

215
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,977
No matter who you love,

216
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,022
you won't be able to protect her.

217
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,734
And she will end up leaving you too.

218
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,860
No.

219
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,863
That will never happen.

220
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,656
Also,

221
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,950
I'm going to protect her

222
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,952
at all costs.

223
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,332
Because I love her
from the bottom of my heart.

224
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,336
That's what everyone says at first.

225
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,922
You may not understand
what I mean just yet,

226
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,676
but you'll find out soon enough.

227
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,180
That's all I have to say.

228
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,404
The person you have called…

229
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,052
The person you have called…

230
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,553
I've called so many times.

231
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,226
Should I just hop over?

232
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,311
The lights are on.

233
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,109
Sir. Excuse me.

234
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,195
Do you live here?

235
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,034
-No.
-You don't live here, right?

236
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,162
We received a report
about a suspicious person loitering.

237
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,206
A suspicious person?

238
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,584
No, I'm the only one here.

239
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,378
Yes, that's why we're here.

240
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,171
Can I see your ID, please?

241
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,594
Someone must've gotten the wrong idea.

242
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,388
I'm not a suspicious person.

243
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,597
Then why are you here?

244
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,642
My girlfriend lives here.

245
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,436
I called her numerous times,
but she wouldn't pick up.

246
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,896
So I was worried.

247
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,606
Yeah, he's definitely a stalker.

248
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,567
Let's take him to the station
before sending him home.

249
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,611
We shouldn't conclude that he's a stalker

250
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,321
-without checking.
-Checking what?

251
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,824
-Right.
-His girlfriend won't even pick up.

252
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,911
She's deliberately avoiding him,
but he followed her to her house.

253
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,455
He's definitely a stalker.

254
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,999
What do you mean I'm a stalker?

255
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,836
What about me suggests that I'm a stalker?

256
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,754
Everything about you. Without a doubt.

257
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,381
This is your problem.

258
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,718
How do you know if it's romance
or stalking without hearing him out?

259
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,387
Isn't that right, sir?

260
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,479
Yes, I'm not a stalker.

261
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,815
Your eyes speak the truth.

262
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,622
I knew it. It's romance.

263
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,959
He came all the way here
to check on his girlfriend.

264
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,671
He was too sorry
to even ring the doorbell.

265
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,798
Right?

266
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,885
Yes.

267
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,221
Please. Cut the crap, will you?

268
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,640
You have the experience to know better.

269
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,101
Look. The lights are on,
very brightly at that.

270
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,561
So why won't she pick up?

271
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,773
She just hates your guts.

272
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,275
Yet you keep calling her nonstop.

273
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,236
And you even came to her house.

274
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,238
Gosh. Who would like that?

275
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,241
The thing is, stalkers don't
even realize that they're stalking.

276
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:46,119
Then is that why
you never called me when I got upset?

277
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,166
Why are you bringing that up again?

278
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,168
Did you ever come to my house

279
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,254
when I cried after our fight?

280
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,257
I said that I was going to,
but you specifically told me not to.

281
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,218
If I tell you not to,
do you take that at face value?

282
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,095
This is why you're a lost cause!

283
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,471
You keep bringing up the past.

284
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,224
Come to think of it,
you sure can hold a grudge.

285
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,976
Who made me like this?

286
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,936
Me. It's all my fault.

287
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,855
It's me. Everything is my fault.

288
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,941
-At least you know.
-It's all because of me.

289
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,777
So after listening to you two talk,

290
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,321
-How ridiculous.
-I think the two of you

291
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,700
should hold hands

292
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,327
and make peace.

293
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,456
I hope you have a deep conversation

294
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,167
and reach an amicable agreement.

295
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,920
Well, then. I'll be leaving.

296
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,589
Have a dazzling conversation.

297
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,799
Goodbye.

298
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,262
Give him his ID.

299
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,394
I'll take care of the rest.
You can take a break.

300
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,229
You didn't even eat yet, right?

301
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,940
It's okay. I can eat after this.

302
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,775
I'm not okay with that.

303
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,736
Get some rest.

304
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,829
We're selling duty-free items.

305
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,914
Please let me know if you need anything.

306
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,667
We're selling duty-free items.

307
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,210
Do you need anything, ma'am?

308
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,837
I would like to buy this.

309
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,551
What? Why are you back already?

310
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,720
We have to dim the lights soon.

311
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,973
How will you increase sales
with that mindset?

312
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,642
Continue until I say you can stop.

313
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,775
I don't think we should disturb
the passengers' time of rest

314
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,984
to increase sales.

315
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,074
This is exactly why
you'll never be promoted.

316
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,535
Pyeong-hwa,
shouldn't you insist on continuing

317
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,162
even if I tell you to stop?

318
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,458
Go out and sell at least one more item.

319
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,336
I'm sorry,

320
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,630
but I can't do that.

321
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,714
Pyeong-hwa.

322
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,343
Who is in charge here?

323
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,638
-You, ma'am.
-And?

324
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,723
You're going against my orders?

325
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,143
For the passengers' rest
and the safety of the employees,

326
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,978
I'm asking you to follow the rules.

327
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:23,068
I didn't know you cared so much
about the passengers and employees.

328
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,582
Did you come alone, sir?

329
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,462
-Yes.
-I'll escort you to your table.

330
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,993
Your coffee is ready.

331
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,787
I called you.

332
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,042
I fell asleep early last night,
so I couldn't answer.

333
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,296
When I woke up,
it was too late to call you back.

334
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,011
Can we talk after work?

335
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,471
Won!

336
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,560
You were here.

337
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,562
Why didn't you answer my calls?

338
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,397
I don't want you to visit me at work.

339
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,815
I'm here as a guest.

340
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,068
-I want coffee.
-Do you want it to be warm?

341
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,404
-Yes.
-All right. I'll get that ready for you.

342
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,662
What do you want?

343
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,539
I'll just cut to the chase.

344
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,876
There are a lot of men
who want to marry me.

345
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,960
I know.

346
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,087
That's why I won't apologize.

347
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,673
You're so offhand. That's why I like you.

348
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,759
Yu-ri.

349
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,968
Yes?

350
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,679
I want you

351
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,474
to experience what love is like.

352
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,602
I've been in a ton of relationships.

353
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,811
True love.

354
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,691
Then you'll be able to understand
what it means

355
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,944
when I say

356
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,529
I'm in love with someone.

357
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,493
That's why I'm going to give it a try

358
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,410
with you.

359
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,870
Find someone else.

360
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,623
Someone who can truly cherish you

361
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,291
and love you.

362
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,502
Meet someone like that.

363
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,339
Think carefully.

364
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,634
If you turn away now,
you won't get another chance.

365
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,930
If I help you,

366
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,933
you know you can have
King Group for yourself.

367
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,607
I'll pay for your coffee.

368
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,442
Enjoy your time here.

369
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,157
-One for each of you?
-Yes.

370
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,367
All right. Thank you.

371
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,952
I'll get that ready for you.

372
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,427
I didn't order this.

373
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,679
It's on the house. Enjoy.

374
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,806
Why?

375
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,101
You obviously had a fight
with your girlfriend. Just drink it.

376
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,358
We didn't fight.

377
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,526
You may take this back.

378
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,778
Then were you dumped?

379
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,240
No, we didn't fight, nor did she dump me.

380
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,616
I already told you.

381
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,577
Why is everyone doing this to me?

382
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,371
I'm being serious. We didn't have a fight.

383
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,874
I didn't get dumped either, so take this.

384
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,628
Just accept it.

385
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,380
It's from my heart.

386
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,341
You got this.

387
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,467
Thank you!

388
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,834
Are you okay?

389
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,632
My head says one thing,

390
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,843
and my heart says another.

391
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,471
That means you're not okay.

392
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,808
You don't have to pretend you're okay.

393
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,435
I'm going to give it some thought.

394
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,106
All right.

395
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,192
You probably need some time
to think it through.

396
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,863
But you don't have to be too worried.

397
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,909
How am I supposed to do that?

398
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,702
I know you must be worried,

399
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,539
but I hope you can trust me.

400
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,167
I'll take care of it.

401
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,585
It's my problem.

402
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,131
It's up to me to decide my future.

403
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,435
Still, I hope you're not thinking
of breaking up with me.

404
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,399
Why would I think of breaking up with you?

405
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,609
Were you thinking of that?

406
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,278
No, why would I?

407
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,155
I would never think that.

408
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,614
I could never let you go.

409
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,242
Then why did you say that?
It's making me upset.

410
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,368
I mean…

411
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,789
You said you were feeling down

412
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,208
and needed time to think,

413
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,879
so I thought it was
because of the other day.

414
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,008
The marriage talks?

415
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,302
It did take me by surprise.

416
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,554
But it's not like I expected your father

417
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,056
to welcome me with open arms.

418
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,727
You didn't get
my grandma's approval yet either.

419
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,813
What are you talking about?

420
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,691
I'm always number one inside her heart.

421
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,485
You mean candidate number one.

422
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,402
Anyway,

423
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,237
the irreplaceable number one in her heart

424
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,739
is yours truly.

425
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,744
Why are you so proud?
It's not even something that great.

426
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,871
What do you mean it's not something great?

427
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,707
It's the best among the titles I hold.

428
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,966
You're finally smiling.

429
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,680
I really wanted to see
that smile on your face.

430
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,768
You used to hate my smile.

431
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,395
So don't worry.

432
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,356
You know how I feel.

433
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,275
That's why I was more worried.

434
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,154
Anyway, don't take
what my father said to heart.

435
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,825
I made it clear
that I'm in love with someone.

436
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,453
I mean,

437
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,205
I was a bit startled, but it's okay.

438
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,250
I knew you wouldn't change over that.

439
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,044
So I tried not to think
negatively about it.

440
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,004
Then

441
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,800
what did you mean when you said
you needed time to think?

442
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,722
Have you heard of the Dream Team?

443
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,395
The Dream Team? What's that?

444
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,897
Apparently, it's every concierge's dream.

445
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,859
I didn't know it at first,

446
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,194
but after experiencing it,
a thought came to mind.

447
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,283
If I work really hard and reach the top,

448
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,580
I just become a maid for a wealthy family.

449
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,377
This isn't the hotel work
that I dreamed of.

450
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,424
I didn't know our employees
got drafted for personal events.

451
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:28,094
I didn't even know
why you were there that day.

452
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,183
I'll try to make a change,

453
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,936
so just wait a little.

454
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,690
Even if it takes some time,
I'll make sure it happens.

455
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,526
I'll also get rid of the Dream Team.

456
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,070
I'm not sure what's right.

457
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,866
Everyone else seemed to love it
because of the money.

458
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,327
It's just my personal opinion.

459
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,622
My personal disapproval

460
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,499
shouldn't prevent others
from earning more money.

461
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,548
Okay. You've been waiting for a long time.

462
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,927
Man, you look more energetic now.

463
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,970
Earlier, he was on the verge of tears.

464
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,555
What are you talking about?

465
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,475
What a shame.
I would've loved to see you cry.

466
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,937
-No, he's making things up.
-Then were you on the verge of death?

467
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,355
Jeez.

468
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,273
Just cook for us, please.

469
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,651
All right. Just for you two,

470
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,819
I'll start off with the last course.

471
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,640
-It's my heart.
-I was going to say that.

472
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,100
Put it all in your bag.

473
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,772
Dad, what are we eating today?

474
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,692
I'm busy today.

475
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,152
Just order some chicken
to eat with your mom.

476
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,113
What? We were supposed to eat out today.

477
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,698
I can't. I have a meeting.

478
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,909
Today's your wedding anniversary.

479
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,078
Don't tell me you forgot again.

480
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,288
You forgot, didn't you?

481
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,331
No, I didn't.

482
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,878
My boss just had to
make all of us gather today.

483
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,130
Today of all days?

484
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,715
Did you tell him what today is?

485
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,091
Of course I did.

486
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,094
But it's not like the company cares
about personal circumstances.

487
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,972
How are you always the same?

488
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,891
People were right
when they said people don't change.

489
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,394
The old sayings are always true.

490
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,397
Well, we can celebrate over the weekend.

491
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,693
By the way,
you should go grocery shopping later.

492
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,695
My dad complained about the side dishes.

493
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,613
Why don't you cook for him?

494
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,615
You're his son, you know?

495
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,184
Oh no!

496
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,364
Nice!

497
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,909
Good shot!

498
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,830
-Help me.
-Look.

499
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,458
You're too tense right now.
It will ruin your swing.

500
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,795
Here. Open up wide to the right,
then swing gently.

501
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,761
Good. Nice shot!

502
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,346
-Was it okay?
-It was great.

503
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,439
Hey!

504
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,323
What? "Nice shot"?

505
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,741
"It was great"?

506
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,284
Let me explain. Honey, wait.

507
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,953
How great, you jerk!

508
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,663
-Honey.
-You're dead.

509
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,957
When will you get a grip?

510
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,958
Honey!

511
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,641
Ow, my legs. My back hurts.

512
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,018
Who said you could get up?

513
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,688
A part of the scallion flew here.

514
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,315
But how did you know I was here?

515
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,196
Hang on.

516
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,656
I'll do it.

517
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,575
Here. Give it to me.

518
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,078
What are you doing?
You should help with this stuff.

519
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,623
You said you had a meeting.

520
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,750
Should I call your manager?

521
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,586
Well, there was a meeting…

522
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,880
Fine. I'll call him.

523
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,509
I quit my job.

524
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,806
I mean,

525
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,851
they gave me the works
because I messed up a contract.

526
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,146
Seriously. Everyone makes mistakes!

527
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,607
Have you lost your mind?
When did you quit?

528
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,193
Not too long ago.

529
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,652
Exactly when?

530
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,987
In the spring?

531
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,322
Last year.

532
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,990
Almost a year ago?

533
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,950
My goodness.

534
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,494
Then you've been
pretending to go to work every day?

535
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,541
Where did you get the money to golf?

536
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,336
Come on. My severance pay.

537
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,005
They give you quite a lot.

538
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,549
I don't know
what I would've done without it.

539
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,095
Seo Chung-jae, you scumbag.

540
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,181
I'm going to kill you tonight.

541
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,062
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

542
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,383
Ta-da.

543
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,221
You're here.

544
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,684
This is how I've been working
with my employees.

545
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,018
-Here.
-There's more?

546
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:59,527
Strength, weakness, opportunity, threat.

547
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,153
What do consumers
perceive to be our strength?

548
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,405
Our strength?

549
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,836
I'm calling in regard to Dubai Hotel.

550
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:18,713
Yes.

551
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,403
Mr. Gu.

552
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,616
I heard Ms. Gu had all of the executives

553
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,951
stay up all night for a week
writing the proposal.

554
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,079
Will we be able to beat them?

555
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,456
It's going to be a head-to-head battle.

556
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,793
We're not here to fight.

557
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,586
We're here to work.

558
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,297
I know that,
but they keep picking a fight.

559
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,094
You trust me, right?

560
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,303
Of course I do.

561
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,055
You got this!

562
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,771
Okay. Go ahead.

563
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,648
Present it to him.

564
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,233
Yes, ma'am.

565
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,071
Goodness.

566
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,073
SURVIVAL MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

567
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,741
You've come quite prepared.

568
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,992
The key point is simple.

569
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,871
It's about the overall reduction
of our fixed and variable expenses.

570
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,499
The first expense to consider is payroll.

571
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,087
We should hire fewer full-time employees
and create more contract positions.

572
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,632
Will we have enough employees
for peak seasons and banquets?

573
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,885
We can employ trainees
or part-time employees.

574
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,889
Wouldn't that affect our service quality?

575
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,143
No. They will be trained before banquets,

576
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,937
and they'll only have to serve meals.
It won't be a problem.

577
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:45,609
Additionally, if we implement
a smart check-in and check-out system,

578
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,112
we will be able
to gradually reduce manpower.

579
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,739
"Discontinuing the shuttle bus,

580
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,741
slimming down the employee cafeteria menu,

581
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,120
and eliminating water and snacks
in the staff lounge."

582
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,291
You really tackled everything.

583
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,460
It's survival management.

584
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,045
What's the expected effect?

585
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,505
It's expected to save

586
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,300
about a billion won a month
and over ten billion won a year.

587
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,843
Ten billion won?

588
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,846
Head Manager Gu,

589
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,057
do you know how many standard rooms
need to be sold to make ten billion won?

590
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,561
In terms of standard rooms, about 34,000.

591
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,354
How precise.

592
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,983
Do you still think
cutting costs is ineffective?

593
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,109
Yes.

594
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,947
Our Mr. Gu here sounds so confident.

595
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,283
Whatever you say from this point on

596
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,535
needs to be worth
more than ten billion won.

597
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,122
A hotel

598
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,125
should not just focus on selling rooms.

599
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,878
It should provide a memorable experience.

600
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,464
In order for the employees
to serve from the heart,

601
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,467
-the company must support--
-Enough with the theories.

602
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,220
Talk about the money, okay? The money.

603
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,890
Then,

604
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,726
should I start with

605
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,063
a hundred billion won?

606
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,314
What?

607
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,997
I offered management consulting
to 170 local hotels around the world,

608
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,457
and 30 hotels

609
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,626
signed management agreements with us.

610
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,337
As you may know, a management agreement

611
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,839
grants us a portion of the hotels' profits

612
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,093
in return for our name and services.

613
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,636
The expected annual return

614
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,723
is more than 35 billion won.

615
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,103
When did you get all of this done?

616
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,855
A six-star hotel
under construction in Dubai has offered

617
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,566
to make King Hotel a hotel chain.

618
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,359
We've already signed a chain contract

619
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,194
with Comfortabele Resort of Belgium,

620
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,821
a newcomer to the industry.

621
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,491
King Hotel will no longer remain
a domestic brand.

622
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:02,538
You will be able to see
King Hotel all over the world.

623
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,958
This was only possible

624
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,545
because King Hotel
won the World of Best Talent Award.

625
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,214
I didn't accomplish anything on my own.

626
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,675
It's thanks to the people
who built this hotel over 100 years,

627
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,012
which includes everyone here.

628
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,848
The company makes the employees.

629
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,601
And the employees make the company.

630
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,811
You mentioned casual employment.

631
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,565
That would make it easy to
hire people briefly and get rid of them.

632
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:33,152
But it would also make it easy for them
to abandon the company.

633
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:37,489
So those ready to abandon each other
will be working together.

634
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,700
Let's not do that anymore.

635
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,995
In my opinion, this project

636
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,205
will bring in
more than a hundred billion won.

637
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,999
What do you think, Ms. Gu?

638
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,419
Cost reduction

639
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,130
is something that any company
must achieve,

640
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,300
no matter how great
the increase in sales is.

641
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,510
Yes, I agree with you on that.

642
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,387
But the thing is…

643
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,143
whenever I traveled overseas,
I always thought the same thing.

644
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,812
"Why does this country
not have a King Hotel?"

645
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,066
"Why can't we become
a worldwide hotel chain?"

646
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,027
It's not like we don't have
enough resources.

647
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,028
Right?

648
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,321
Mr. Gu,

649
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,823
what is the reason?

650
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:25,245
I think it's because King Hotel
doesn't have an established brand image.

651
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,875
It's just one of the numerous
luxurious hotels out there.

652
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,503
However, an image is not made easily.

653
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:36,465
It needs to be built up over time.

654
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,175
Fortunately,

655
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,636
our hotel has a 100-year history.

656
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,097
With the 100th-anniversary event,

657
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,892
it can be said that King Hotel

658
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,144
has gained its own image.

659
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,359
Mr. Gu.

660
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,486
Starting next month,

661
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,655
you're the president of the hotel.

662
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,119
Be at the forefront and make
King Hotel the best hotel in the world.

663
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,205
-Father…
-You should do whatever you can to help.

664
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,499
You can do that, right?

665
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,544
Yes, I will.

666
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,303
You accomplished

667
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,390
what I desperately wanted to do.

668
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,621
Why don't you give up on the hotel, ma'am?

669
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,916
I think it'd be best for you
to focus on Air and Distribution.

670
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,128
That might be more effective.

671
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,715
The hotel is smaller in scale
compared to Air and Distribution.

672
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,049
But the thing is,

673
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,094
I don't want to give him anything.

674
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,640
Is there a reason
why you can't give up on the hotel?

675
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,434
Because Won likes the hotel.

676
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,770
All the more reason not to give it up.

677
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,691
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

678
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,942
Are those divorce papers?

679
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,363
Since when did you ask me such questions?

680
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,616
Even if you get a divorce,
it can't be now.

681
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,825
It's not the right time.

682
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,285
You should wait it out.

683
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,497
Mr. Choi.

684
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,582
You've known me for a while, right?

685
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,126
I've worked for you since you were young.

686
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,421
Have you ever seen me give up on anything?

687
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,216
No.

688
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,760
So why would you say that
when you know that very well?

689
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,179
"Give up on the hotel"?

690
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,226
There's only one way
for Won to possess the hotel.

691
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,354
It's when I abandon it.

692
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,398
Only then will it be possible.

693
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:02,903
I understand.

694
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,655
You may leave.

695
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,759
Thank you.

696
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,096
This is unbelievable.

697
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,473
Did you hear the news
that's hot off the press?

698
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,641
What is it?

699
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,936
Mr. Gu outrivaled Ms. Gu
and is finally going to be the president.

700
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,563
Really?

701
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,941
If I knew this would happen,
I would've gotten on his good side.

702
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,905
Sa-rang, can we have a word?

703
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:47,906
Yes, ma'am.

704
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,040
You will be on special duty.

705
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,668
You won't be working
in King the Land for the time being.

706
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,004
-Just me?
-Yes.

707
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,172
Special orders from the chairman.

708
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,508
The chairman?

709
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,468
I'm sorry.

710
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,471
Ji-hu said it had to be you.

711
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,057
Please look after him while he's in Korea.

712
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,727
That kid's a shrewd judge of character.

713
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,314
He knew you were our hotel's
best employee right away.

714
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,028
I'm sorry,

715
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:30,949
but may I ask if I'm doing this
as a King Hotel employee?

716
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,371
Let's call it a personal request.

717
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:40,083
It's the first time
that he's ever asked me for anything.

718
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,755
I just wanted to grant my grandson's wish.

719
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,173
Did I go too far?

720
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,760
No, sir. I understand.

721
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,056
-But…
-What is it?

722
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,768
Can I treat him
like he's my younger brother?

723
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,062
I couldn't ask for more.

724
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,983
Ji-hu is an only child,
so he grew up lonely.

725
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,070
Yes, sir.

726
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,085
Mr. Ji-hu?

727
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,004
Mr. Ji-hu?

728
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,591
Where could he be?

729
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,885
Ji-hu!

730
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,554
Where in the world are you?

731
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,390
Are you over here?

732
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,883
What? You scared me!

733
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,343
How does that make you feel?

734
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,012
How dare you?
Do you think you'll get away with this?

735
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,639
Watch out.

736
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,182
You'll get a taste of hell.

737
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,475
What?

738
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,061
Then did you call me
to get revenge and torment me?

739
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,479
Why? Are you scared?

740
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,606
No, not at all.

741
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,359
If you're a man, you should play fair.

742
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,861
But you were hiding in a mask.

743
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,323
Maybe it's because you're a kid.
Your behavior is ungentlemanly.

744
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,366
Don't call me a kid.

745
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,784
I'm not a kid.

746
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,661
Is that so?

747
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,747
You're right.

748
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,166
Seeing how childish you are,
you're not a kid.

749
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,127
A baby. You're a baby.

750
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,795
You're a baby, right?

751
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,547
Don't call me a baby!

752
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,507
-Bring it on.
-"Bring it on."

753
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,782
It's my turn.

754
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,624
I won, so now you have to speak politely.

755
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,875
Let's play one more time.

756
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,127
It's ten to zero.

757
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,629
You said it was the last round.

758
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,339
Just one more round.

759
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,549
-Do you want to play that much?
-Yes.

760
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,262
Then how should you ask me?

761
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,307
Sa-rang,

762
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,519
can we play one more round,

763
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,479
please?

764
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,730
Good.

765
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,898
All right.

766
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,442
-This is really the last time.
-Awesome!

767
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,787
Not up…

768
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,459
Try again. Ready?

769
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,418
One,

770
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,586
two,

771
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,963
three.

772
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,384
Good job.

773
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,018
It's tasty, isn't it?

774
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,270
Yeah.

775
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,814
By the way, I have a question.

776
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,525
Why do you do that?

777
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,735
Why do you act nice
in front of the adults,

778
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,529
then bully the weak?

779
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,905
Is that fun?

780
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,699
I do what I want.

781
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,620
You don't have any friends, do you?

782
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,373
Only nobodies make friends.

783
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,292
I don't need them.

784
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,211
I knew it.

785
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,630
Who would want to hang out
with a grump like you?

786
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,716
That's not true.

787
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,051
I'm just not making any
because I don't need them.

788
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,928
That's what you want to think.

789
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,221
No, it's not.

790
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,937
You need to be nice
if you want to make friends.

791
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,107
If you pick on people and bully them,
you won't make any friends.

792
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,818
So don't be like that from now on. Got it?

793
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,405
Let's go inside now.

794
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,704
Can we play a little more?

795
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,292
Are you asking me a favor?

796
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,802
All right. Just because it's a favor.

797
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,970
Yes!

798
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,139
Okay. Let's play.

799
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,850
Grandpa!

800
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:49,893
Why hello.

801
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,938
You must've had a lot of fun.

802
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,440
Yes. We're going to play again
tomorrow too.

803
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,151
Go upstairs and wash your hands.

804
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,361
I'll bring some snacks.

805
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,403
Okay, Sa-rang.

806
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:05,200
I've never seen him look so happy.

807
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,077
It's like you're his actual sister.

808
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,037
Thank you.

809
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,456
Don't mention it. I had a lot of fun too.

810
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,428
You were home.

811
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,554
Why are you here?

812
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,684
I'll be working here for the time being.

813
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,144
The chairman asked me to look after Ji-hu.

814
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,356
He asked you to look after Ji-hu?

815
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,652
You don't have to. I'll talk to him.

816
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,405
He asked me respectfully.

817
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,532
He didn't order me to do it
as the chairman.

818
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,326
He asked me out of love for his grandson,

819
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,536
so I said yes.

820
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,455
But still,
how could he ask you to do that?

821
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,790
I already agreed to it.

822
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,793
I'm having fun in my own way,
so don't worry.

823
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,338
All right, fine.

824
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,967
But you have to tell me
if anyone gives you a hard time.

825
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,886
Okay. I will.

826
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,186
So this is Head Manager Gu Won's room.

827
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,731
-Can I look around?
-Of course.

828
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,817
But how long are you going to
call me by my title?

829
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,985
We're not even at work.

830
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,323
Fine, Mr. Won.

831
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,992
What's "Mr. Won"?

832
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:30,618
I don't know.

833
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,498
It's the king carp.

834
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:39,961
This…

835
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,298
It was so hard

836
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,842
trying to put these pieces back together.

837
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,012
Why did you go
to the trouble of doing that?

838
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,014
It's a memory

839
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,724
from our first date.

840
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,646
What's this?

841
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,610
Wait.

842
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,737
Is this when you started liking me?

843
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,155
Well, not exactly.

844
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,532
-Give it back. I'm embarrassed.
-Gosh.

845
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,700
-No.
-Come on.

846
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,411
-Come on. I'm embarrassed.
-No.

847
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,621
-Give it to me.
-No.

848
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,914
-I'm embarrassed.
-No.

849
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,582
-Give it back already.
-No.

850
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,426
What are you doing in my house?

851
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,098
So this is

852
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,935
the bed that you sleep in, Mr. Won.

853
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,946
Sa-rang.

854
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,157
Are you in here?

855
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,455
Sa-rang, are you in here?

856
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:02,961
Ta-da!

857
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,754
What are you doing here?

858
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,340
Hide-and-seek!

859
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,634
You have to hide this time, okay?

860
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,760
-Ten,
-Hold on.

861
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,220
-nine,
-Count slowly.

862
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,180
eight, seven,

863
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,807
six,

864
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,600
five,

865
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,520
four, three…

866
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,024
two, one!

867
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:26,776
Here I come!

868
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,448
Ji-hu, that punk. He didn't even knock.

869
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,869
It was exhausting, right?

870
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,746
I heard parenting
is the world's hardest job.

871
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,914
I think that's true.

872
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,085
By any chance,

873
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,671
have you ever spent time with Ji-hu?

874
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,758
When Ji-hu was younger,
I was studying abroad.

875
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,304
And when I was in Korea, he was abroad,
so our paths rarely crossed.

876
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,014
Why do you ask?

877
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,766
Just because he's young,
but he already looks so lonely.

878
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,310
-Ji-hu does?
-Yes.

879
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,481
It feels like he has no one around him.

880
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:10,111
He's so well-behaved and mature,
so I had no idea.

881
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,406
Kids being mature is not a good sign.

882
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,450
Adults should be the mature ones.

883
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,410
Even being mature as an adult is hard.

884
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:47,690
Ji-hu,

885
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,359
you should sleep in your bed.

886
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:51,861
Ji-hu.

887
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,033
You're home, Uncle Won.

888
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,577
Yes. Let's go sleep upstairs.

889
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,580
Mom isn't home yet.

890
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,876
I think your mom will be late.

891
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,504
Why don't you go to bed early
and see her tomorrow?

892
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,673
I missed her yesterday
and the day before that.

893
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,342
I really want to see her today.

894
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,010
Can I just wait for her?

895
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,561
Sure, go ahead.

896
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,980
Okay. Thank you.

897
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,151
Mom!

898
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,196
Why are you still here?

899
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,574
Did you not go to the US?

900
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,660
Can't I stay here for a little longer?

901
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,620
I told you that now's not a good time.

902
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,289
Why won't you listen?

903
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,958
I'm sorry.

904
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,377
Go to your room.

905
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,461
Okay.

906
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:08,396
You sure prepared a lot behind the scenes.

907
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,274
I told you.

908
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,360
You don't deserve
to be the owner of the group.

909
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,030
You talk like you've already won.

910
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,867
Do you really think it's over?

911
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,784
You're so naive.

912
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,328
Is the company all that matters?

913
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,623
Does Ji-hu not exist to you?

914
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,750
Do you know how long he waited for you?

915
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,876
What?

916
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,337
Does he remind you of yourself?

917
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,715
You always cried, looking for your mom.

918
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,344
But you know what?

919
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,599
Ji-hu isn't you.

920
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,435
And I'm not like your mom.

921
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,105
Don't give me advice
from your lowly perspective.

922
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,524
How arrogant of you.

923
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,079
It's my first time in your room.

924
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,637
It's your first time back in a while.

925
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,639
Is there anything you want to do?

926
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,975
I'm okay.

927
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,486
Well,

928
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,197
if you happen to think of something,

929
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,284
please let me know.

930
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,328
We can do it together.

931
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,476
-Ta-da!
-It's gimbap!

932
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,144
You made all of this yourself?

933
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,812
Of course I did.

934
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,031
Here.

935
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,497
-Ji-hu. One, two, three.
-Hold this.

936
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,124
-Here.
-You're good at this.

937
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,334
I'm pretty good.

938
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,794
We did it.

939
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,766
I'm going to grow up to be like you.

940
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,351
Why?

941
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:34,811
You're cool.

942
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,021
You're the coolest person in the world.

943
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,400
Thanks for saying that.

944
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,404
However,

945
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,908
there's one thing I did
that you shouldn't do.

946
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,868
What is it?

947
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,708
You have to cry when you want to

948
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,670
and laugh when you want to.

949
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:05,091
If you're mad, get mad and make a fuss.

950
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,385
But most importantly,

951
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:10,137
if you miss someone,
tell them that you miss them.

952
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,515
Whether it's your mom or your dad.

953
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,562
Can I do that?

954
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,021
Of course.

955
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,983
Being honest isn't a bad thing.

956
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,359
It means you're brave.

957
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,285
I…

958
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,289
want you to become a brave person.

959
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:41,168
A brave person is the coolest person.

960
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,379
Even cooler than me.

961
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,841
Then…

962
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,678
can I stay in Korea for a little longer?

963
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,972
-Is that what you want to do?
-Yes.

964
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,224
I never got to play with my mom yet.

965
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,979
Okay.

966
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,107
I'll help you do that.

967
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,233
Really?

968
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,027
Thank you.

969
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,280
-Ji-hu.
-Sa-rang!

970
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,411
What is that?

971
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,079
Tornado potatoes.
Have you tried it before?

972
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,789
-No.
-You haven't?

973
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:19,874
-Give it.
-You want it?

974
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:20,875
You can't have it.

975
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,377
Here you go.

976
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,159
You're not here
to talk about work, are you?

977
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,370
No, I'm not.

978
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,872
Then

979
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:44,583
may I speak casually?

980
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,712
Yes, you may.

981
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,173
I've been waiting.

982
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,176
Waiting for you to come find me.

983
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:58,681
You're…

984
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,769
the one who sent me
my mother's personnel record, right?

985
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,901
There's something I'd like to ask.

986
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,569
Do you think
you can understand your mom now?

987
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,030
No.

988
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,283
There's no need for that anymore.

989
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,370
It happened so long ago.

990
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,416
Do you want to know where she is?

991
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,584
It's okay.

992
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,254
I just wanted to know the truth.

993
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,215
I never wanted to see her.

994
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,593
Thank you for being honest with me.

995
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:09,687
I'm hungry.

996
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,232
Let's eat.

997
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,912
-Soybean paste stew?
-Doesn't it smell good?

998
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,206
Yes, it looks so good. Can I have a bite?

999
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,332
A bite?

1000
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:36,589
Nice.

1001
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,133
I'll cut this too.

1002
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,643
This is mind-blowing.

1003
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,478
Just one bite.

1004
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,068
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

1005
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,783
Soybean paste stew.

1006
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,826
Rice.

1007
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,078
And rolled omelet.

1008
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,502
This is nice.

1009
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,139
Are you not going to meet your mom?

1010
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,148
I wanted to know why she left me.

1011
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,444
Now I know. That's enough.

1012
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,782
It could've been
because she loved you so much.

1013
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:49,036
If she loved me,

1014
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:52,623
she should've stayed by my side
no matter what.

1015
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,169
Whatever the reason may be, she left me.

1016
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,840
That means I didn't mean much in her life.

1017
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:10,015
There could be another reason
that you're not aware of.

1018
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,811
That's why I wanted you to meet her.

1019
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:18,732
That way,
you'd be able to know how she felt.

1020
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:29,493
I don't want to
think about my mom anymore.

1021
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,621
It finally feels

1022
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,499
as if I'm free from her.

1023
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,099
As long as you feel at ease now.

1024
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:58,856
Yes.

1025
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,066
Thank you

1026
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,153
for bringing me all the way here.

1027
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,024
KING THE LAND

1028
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,392
"Third-generation chaebol's
secret love affair."

1029
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:18,602
How did you pick him up?

1030
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,437
Share your secrets.

1031
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,775
You have caused greater damage
just for your personal gain!

1032
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:29,822
We, the board of directors,
oppose Mr. Gu's promotion to president.

1033
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,866
I understand why Won likes you.

1034
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,160
And it's scarier because of that.

1035
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,747
Only the worst transgressors end up here.

1036
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,291
Where is Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

1037
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:48,340
