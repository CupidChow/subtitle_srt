1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,419
Are you still mad?

3
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,214
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

4
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,548
Do you know what you did wrong?

5
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,425
Of course I do. I'm really sorry.

6
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,676
What are you sorry for?

7
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,719
Everything.

8
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,846
I'm sorry for all of it,
no matter what it is.

9
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:39,974
Forget it.

10
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,644
You're bound to repeat the same mistakes.

11
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,604
I have zero hope in you.

12
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,147
No, I'll never do that again.

13
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,148
I'll be good to you.

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,775
Once my schedule slows down,

15
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,319
we can go on a trip in two or three weeks.

16
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,029
You wanted to go to Gangneung.

17
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,781
No, Sokcho.

18
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,324
Yes, Sokcho.

19
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,368
You wanted the spicy noodle soup there.

20
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,663
Potato dumpling soup.

21
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,580
Right.

22
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,624
Come with me, okay?

23
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,058
Let's go somewhere quiet.
I have something to tell you.

24
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,435
-What is it?
-We'll talk when we get there.

25
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,938
Can't you just tell me now?

26
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,773
Why?

27
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,233
I'm meeting my club members.

28
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,818
It's an important occasion.

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,285
So you're here

30
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,953
not to actually apologize to me

31
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,456
but to clear your conscience
before meeting with your friends.

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,041
Don't say it like that.

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,085
I had to push the time back
to wait for you.

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,089
I tried to be understanding
since no one is perfect.

35
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,800
I wanted to try my best
with the person I chose to be with.

36
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,801
But…

37
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,806
it's pointless to be considerate
to someone who doesn't value me.

38
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,185
You don't deserve it.

39
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,063
Okay.

40
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,733
I'll tell them I'll be late,
so let's go eat something.

41
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,318
Something simple like gimbap?

42
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,035
Let's go.

43
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,084
What's wrong? Don't you want gimbap?

44
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,258
It's over.

45
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,137
I feel too sorry for myself
to keep seeing you.

46
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,598
All of a sudden?

47
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,516
When one person always humors another,

48
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,560
that person gets ruined.

49
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,397
I think I ruined you.

50
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,691
I came all the way here for you.

51
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,236
I can't believe you're this selfish.

52
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,366
One second.

53
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,787
Hey, is everyone there?

54
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,330
Go ahead and get started.

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,209
No, I'm almost done. I'll leave soon.

56
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,712
Something came up.

57
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,301
I'll hang up soon. Hold on.

58
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,137
Order whatever.
We're splitting the bill anyway.

59
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,597
I'll call you back.

60
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,516
Sa-rang!

61
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,560
Sa-rang!

62
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,688
Wait!

63
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,333
There's no way

64
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,504
I'm feeling jealous

65
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,756
or something like that.

66
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:01,884
Me?

67
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,264
Me?

68
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,435
I can't believe this.

69
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,463
You just littered.

70
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,714
Driver's license, please.

71
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,472
Here.

72
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,474
Sir, you have to pick that up.

73
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,158
Please throw this out.

74
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,077
We don't do that.

75
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,748
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,920
Was that for your girlfriend?

77
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,089
No.

78
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,091
You got it as a gift for her,
but you threw it out.

79
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,050
Something happened.

80
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:24,967
I said no.

81
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,095
Your girlfriend must've had another man.

82
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,264
We can tell right away
when we see a situation.

83
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,808
This isn't the first time.

84
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,811
She must be pretty.

85
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,897
Well,

86
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,357
sure.

87
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,943
I'd say she is

88
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,694
quite pretty.

89
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,612
And smiles often.

90
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,909
That's a part of her job.

91
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,661
She's pretty and she smiles a lot?

92
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,081
A woman like that will
have you in her grasp before you know it.

93
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,333
So don't get played and snap out of it.

94
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,584
Pull yourself together.

95
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,877
She's not like that!

96
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,087
She already has you.

97
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,214
No, forget it.

98
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,257
It's fine.

99
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,800
Here. You can just go.

100
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,176
What do you mean?

101
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,553
Just give me that ticket.

102
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,847
I just feel bad for you.

103
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,558
You saved money today,
so buy yourself a drink and wake up.

104
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,726
-Okay?
-It's not like that!

105
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,312
Why are you such a softie?

106
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,189
I know this because I've been there.

107
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,608
Forget it.

108
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,570
Nothing I say will get through to you.

109
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,113
Just go.

110
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,365
Go let her toy with you.

111
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,159
You'll regret it once you're hurt.

112
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,827
Then you'll remember what I said.

113
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,620
Go.

114
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,164
Man.

115
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,082
Just go.

116
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,961
Go!

117
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,340
Listen to what I'm about to say, my man.

118
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,384
How many relationships have you had?

119
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:50,761
With friends?

120
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,306
With women.

121
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,933
I'm a busy man.

122
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,477
Okay.

123
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,728
Not much dating experience,

124
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,438
but you seem to have some money.

125
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,649
That makes you the perfect prey, right?

126
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,485
And what drives you more insane

127
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,945
is that you don't even know
how you really feel.

128
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,990
"Do I really like her?
Am I just curious about her?"

129
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,116
"Am I in love?"

130
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,576
It gets so confusing!

131
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,661
Right?

132
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,705
And how do I know?

133
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,128
My woman was very pretty too.

134
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,673
Her face was the vision of love itself.

135
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,384
-Love?
-By any chance,

136
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,386
do you know that song?

137
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,724
Your eyes, nose, lips

138
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,727
The way you caressed me

139
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,064
Even all those tiniest touches

140
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,525
I can never forget her.

141
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,403
I thought I could die
a hundred times over for her.

142
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,197
I should've held onto her.

143
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,327
I should've screamed,
"I'm your man, not him!"

144
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,079
After that one moment of hesitation,

145
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,498
after turning away like that…

146
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,293
I've been tormented ever since.

147
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,891
Buck up.

148
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,104
Jeez.

149
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,273
What am I doing in front of a stranger?

150
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,281
Bye!

151
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,456
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected…

152
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,374
PAENG

153
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,585

GRANDMA

155
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,310
GRANDMA

156
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,611
Grandma.

157
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,906
Of course I had dinner. It's late.

158
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,742
What about you?

159
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,997
Can I come over tomorrow?

160
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,335
Yes, it's my day off.

161
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,379
I want to eat your food.

162
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,053
Of course. Your food is the best.

163
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,430
Yes.

164
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,058
Your food is my favorite.

165
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,895
Is there anything you want to eat?

166
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,480
I'll bring some tomorrow.

167

EPISODE 4

168
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,734
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

169
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,693
My daughter-in-law.

170
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,528
Two bottles of soju, please.

171
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,200
Okay, coming. Two bottles of soju.

172
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,993
Goodness.

173
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,621
They'll be even sweeter
coming from my daughter-in-law.

174
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,789
This is the last round.

175
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,248
You should go home and sleep.

176
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,793
I'll sleep as long as I want
once I'm dead.

177
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,835
That again!

178
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,504
Don't have too much.

179
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,882
My daughter-in-law,
some more radish kimchi.

180
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,217
Okay, radish kimchi!

181
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,053
Grandma's got it.

182
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,016
All of you.

183
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,559
Why do you call my granddaughter

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,645
"my daughter-in-law"?

185
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,814
I called over my kind daughter-in-law.

186
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,066
What's this mean granny doing here?

187
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,025
Cut your crap!

188
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,735
You two don't even have sons.

189
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,946
Don't let me catch you

190
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,199
calling my granddaughter
your daughter-in-law again.

191
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,784
Got it?

192
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,494
My daughter-in-law.

193
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,287
-A bottle of rice wine, please.
-Why you…

194
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,248
Okay, your daughter-in-law is coming!

195
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,834
Goodness.

196
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,588
Here.

197
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,890
Is something

198
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,393
going on with you?

199
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,894
What do you mean?

200
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,604
I just came to see you.

201
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,817
Your food is the best.

202
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,279
If you're concerned about me,
you should get married soon.

203
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,489
Da-eul already has a big kid.

204
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,907
You always say that.

205
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,784
Is that all you have to say to me?

206
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,245
She got married early.
Pyeong-hwa is single too.

207
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,622
Don't get me started on Pyeong-hwa.

208
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,416
She's impossible.

209
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,710
The thought of marriage
isn't entering your head

210
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,253
because you two stick together.

211
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,421
Kick her out soon.

212
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,591
I should leave before you nag me more.

213
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,592
Wait.

214
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,511
I'll pack some side dishes for you.

215
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,973
Go give some to that guy
Yu-nam or whatever.

216
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,309
Don't.

217
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,226
Why not?

218
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,855
We broke up.

219
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,820
We just did.

220
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,200
Good.

221
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,327
I'm glad.

222
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,453
That rotten jerk.

223
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,497
It's his loss.

224
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,041
You don't even know the reason.

225
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,667
I know you.

226
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,212
I'm sure he's the one at fault.

227
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,964
Forget about money.

228
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,759
You should be with a man
who's good to you.

229
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,345
I'm glad things ended.

230
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,763
Yeah.

231
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,182
Me too.

232
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,394
Also,

233
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,023
when you feel upset in the future,

234
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,817
don't hold it in and just tell people.

235
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,236
Okay?

236
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,654
Throw a fit if you want to.

237
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,532
If you want to be a crybaby, be one too.

238
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,951
And you can tell me everything.

239
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,953
Okay. I'll do that.

240
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,540
This is so nice.

241
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,209
Grandma, you're the best.

242
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,129
Goodness, my dear little girl.

243
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,590
Great job.

244
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,344
I'm glad you did that.

245
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:14,103
First Royal Hotel's LVIP Lounge
just became the top of the industry

246
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,690
surpassing King the Land of King Hotel!

247
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,443
Chairman Han, your wish finally came true.

248
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,196
It's been a lifelong dream of yours
to surpass King Hotel.

249
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,283
It's just the lounge.
Don't make such a big fuss.

250
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,451
Do you want to make a bet?

251
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,370
It was just the lounge this time,

252
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,873
but will it end with just that?

253
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,584
You should make a bet
with your hotels at stake.

254
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,752
Our hotels aren't on the same level.

255
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,548
I hear you spent a fortune
to become number one.

256
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,632
Can you handle it?

257
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,010
It's called an investment.

258
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,637
My victory over King Hotel
after years of losses

259
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,515
already gives me
a different outlook on business.

260
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,645
All right.
You can try your best to catch up.

261
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,771
Okay!

262
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,244
What does revenue from the lounge mean
in hotel management?

263
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,663
Since the clientele is mostly VIPs,

264
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,498
the higher the revenue,

265
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,209
the more sophisticated
and classy the hotel is.

266
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,421
That's why competing hotels
compare the lounge revenue,

267
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,881
not the overall sales.

268
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,299
If you knew that,

269
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,551
why did First Royal Hotel
take first place?

270
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,804
I trusted you two
and left you to work together.

271
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,847
What have you done?

272
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,891
They only increased
their short-term revenue

273
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,351
with excessive promotions…

274
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,896
Such complacent thoughts
are the shortcut to rock bottom.

275
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,564
It may be the lounge this time,

276
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,483
but that doesn't mean it'll end there.

277
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,903
Work together and do whatever it takes

278
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,696
to reclaim first place in lounge revenue.

279
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,614
Yes, Dad.

280
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,116
The same goes for Distribution and Air.

281
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,913
Climb up so high that First Royal Hotel
won't even dream of competing with us.

282
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,581
I'll see what you two can do

283
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,625
and decide if I'll bequeath
the whole group

284
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,043
or split it between you two.

285
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,296
Understood?

286
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,215
Yes.

287
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,224
What's your plan?

288
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,727
He told us to join forces,

289
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,771
but you have no power.

290
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,481
Not yet.

291
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,857
And in the future too.

292
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,568
So don't try to meddle with anything

293
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,028
and sit this one out.

294
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,488
I'll handle this.

295
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,699
So this must be how it feels.

296
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,616
What?

297
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,784
Getting looked down on.

298
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,830
It's not even news.

299
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,251
Did you think you were a big shot?

300
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,130
Someone said…

301
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,297
All people are the same.

302
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,634
That means
everyone should be treated equally.

303
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,720
…that everyone

304
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,931
should be treated with equal respect.

305
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,307
You're an exception.

306
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,687
You're an upstart nobody.

307
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,774
I know.

308
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,694
So don't be scared of me.

309
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,121
Thank you for everything.

310
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,956
I'll head upstairs then.

311
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,170
As you already know…

312
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,505
No.

313
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,216
You have no idea
what King the Land is like.

314
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,345
I'm sure the chairman put you there
because he doesn't know any better.

315
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,348
You'll get kicked out soon,
so don't try too hard.

316
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,642
Okay.

317
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,936
It's been a while, Su-mi.

318
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,938
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

319
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,981
Hey.

320
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,608
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

321
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,318
Yes.

322
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,362
I'm the manager of King the Land.

323
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,697
I'm here to take you there.

324
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,576
Hello, my name is Cheon Sa-rang.

325
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,702
It's nice to meet you.

326
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,287
Nice to meet you.

327
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,747
Let's get along.

328
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,458
Ms. Jeon.

329
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,959
She went to a two-year college.

330
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,171
Okay.

331
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,964
Let's go upstairs.

332
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,007
I'll give you a tour.

333
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,897
Most of our guests here are chairpersons

334
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,650
who are ranked within the top 30
in the business world.

335
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,946
One VVVIP guest often spends

336
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,157
more than the hotel's daily revenue.

337
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,536
That's why we call this place
the hotel's first class.

338
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,706
It's a dream for all concierges
to work up here,

339
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,251
but in reality,
not everyone gets to do that.

340
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,297
I never imagined
that I'd get to work on this floor.

341
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,007
It honestly doesn't feel real.

342
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,429
I'll do my best not to become
a nuisance to King the Land.

343
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,351
Any takes on this piece?

344
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,728
I don't know much about art,

345
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,355
but it looks great.

346
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,356
Right?

347
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,693
The chairman got this himself in New York.

348
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,570
He has an eye for art, doesn't he?

349
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,072
Yes, I think so.

350
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,117
He also recruited you here himself.

351
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,661
I'm sure he has a reason.

352
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,330
I trust his judgment.

353
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,003
So don't mind those
who talk behind your back.

354
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,382
You must respect yourself first
before others do.

355
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,679
Okay.

356
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,848
Let's go. Your uniform is ready.

357
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,707
Hello, my name is Cheon Sa-rang.

358
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,933
Have you thought about it?

359
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,976
Yes.

360
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,479
All night.

361
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,897
And even now.

362
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,483
What will you do?

363
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,902
I should've held onto her.

364
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,988
I should've screamed,
"I'm your man, not him!"

365
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,742
I'm thinking.

366
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,202
Again?

367
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,454
You're still thinking?

368
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,499
How will that help reclaim
the first in revenue for King the Land?

369
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,001
What?

370
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,670
Revenue?

371
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,214
Do you know
how First Royal Hotel took first place?

372
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,092
For months, they followed
some ginseng diggers around

373
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,593
and got a hold of wild ginseng.

374
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,012
They sold that with wine
for 100 million won.

375
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,057
I'm 100% sure that's what Ms. Gu will do.

376
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,016
That's why

377
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,435
-we should do it first.
-And copy them?

378
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,479
No, we're only following the trend.

379
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,981
But money should be earned honestly.

380
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,150
Says who?

381
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,236
Who said that to you?

382
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,071
I doubt they were rich.

383
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,531
That's a classic line from the poor.

384
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,866
Why are you so passionate today?

385
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,493
You be the head manager!

386
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:30,163
I'll end up as a nobody
if I just trust you and sit around.

387
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,456
You got a full-time job here.

388
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,625
That's all. There's nothing after that.

389
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,710
I must have sided with

390
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,712
the wrong guy.

391
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,714
Go. It's not too late.

392
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,631
Get out of here.

393
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,134
"I'll take King Group for myself!"

394
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,137
Do you not have such manly ambitions?

395
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,264
Why would I?

396
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,893
You don't want anything
and can't be bothered.

397
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,021
Right. You know me.

398
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,732
That's because you have too much,

399
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,483
for insufficiency brings desire.

400
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,570
You can throw out your fortune
and position to me.

401
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,697
I'll gladly become your trash can.

402
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,740
Whatever.

403
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,867
I'll be one for you. Here, throw them out.

404
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,410
Feel free.

405
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,746
Dump them here.

406
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,622
Among the things I have,

407
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,876
the thing I want to dump the most…

408
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,087
is you.

409
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,006
Get out of here.

410
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,132
I don't want to go.

411
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,759
-Not until you dump something.
-Get out.

412
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,385
No way. Give me something.

413
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,553
Get out of…

414
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,636
The new staff of King the Land

415
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,096
is here to greet you.

416
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,223
Hello.

417
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,017
I'm Cheon Sa-rang,
and it's my first day at King the Land.

418
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,852
Our kind Ms. Sa-rang,

419
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,437
you finally got here. Congrats.

420
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,863
I hear King the Land
is staffed with our best employees.

421
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,824
Yes, we all work there with pride.

422
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,326
But she's now a part of your staff?

423
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,370
I know her a little.

424
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,622
You'll need to give
extra attention and training

425
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,582
to enlighten her on the sophistication

426
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,168
and basic manners
befitting King the Land, Ms. Jeon.

427
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,920
Yes, sir.

428
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,797
As per your words,

429
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,133
I'll do my best to be more sophisticated

430
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,677
as I learn basic manners
befitting King the Land.

431
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,594
Yes, you will.

432
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,388
-You may go.
-Yes, Mr. Gu.

433
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,639
Excuse us.

434
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,017
Yearly business plan.

435
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,770
Our annual revenue last year was…

436
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,076
Why were you like that to her?

437
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,994
What?

438
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,745
As if you like our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

439
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,206
What is it? What's going on?

440
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,249
Like a pathetic little kid.

441
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,792
What?

442
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,460
-"Pathetic"?
-Yes.

443
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,753
-"Little kid"?
-Yes.

444
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,131
You like her,

445
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,299
but you can't tell her.

446
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,301
You want to get her attention,

447
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,136
but you have no idea what to do.

448
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,805
That's why you pick on her and act rudely.

449
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,056
That's what kids do.

450
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,349
I don't like her!

451
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,852
She's such a phony.

452
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,396
She's totally not my type.

453
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,274
Why did you get so angry over a joke,

454
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,109
as if I saw right through you?

455
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,486
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

456
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,531
You have no sense of humor,
no consideration, and no popularity.

457
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,491
That's why you're not seeing anyone.

458
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,753
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

459
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,801
Everyone say hello.

460
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,054
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang
will join us starting today.

461
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,348
Nice to meet you.

462
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,974
We're all like family here,

463
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,184
so you'll fit in soon.

464
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,103
Learn a lot from your experienced seniors,

465
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,105
and tell me if there's trouble.

466
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,066
Yes, I'll do my best.

467
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,734
I'll teach her well.

468
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,569
Let her sign the NDA first.

469
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,946
I need to go to the office.

470
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,988
Goodbye.

471
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,791
Ms. Jeon is nice, isn't she?

472
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,293
Yes, she seems wonderful.

473
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,211
You're right.

474
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,838
She's kind to everyone
without any prejudice,

475
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,215
and she's warmhearted too.

476
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,092
But I'm not like her.

477
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,470
I believe distinctions must exist.

478
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,056
We all graduated
from well-known universities in Seoul.

479
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,850
The fact that a two-year college graduate
like you made it here

480
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,728
belittles the time and effort we put in

481
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,813
to get to this place.

482
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,524
If you wish to be accepted,

483
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,651
you must prove you have what it takes

484
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,736
to be here against our tradition.

485
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,822
You can try hard, but it'll be tough.

486
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,615
Brace yourself.

487
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,033
Yes.

488
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,660
I'll do my best.

489
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,869
Follow me.

490
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,543
Du-ri.

491
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,878
Is this place for anybody now?

492
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,256
Hey, the chairman put her here.

493
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,799
I knew it.

494
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,635
I know girls like her very well.

495
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,388
She's the type we don't want on our turf.

496
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,644
The guests we receive here
are in the top 0.0001% of the nation.

497
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,148
This says you must not disclose
who you saw here

498
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,567
and the conversations they had.

499
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,777
If you disclose anything about this place,

500
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,239
you'll be held liable
and must compensate for any damages.

501
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,282
Sign it.

502
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,199
Okay.

503
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,413
Are you on social media?

504
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,623
-Yes.
-Delete your accounts.

505
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,252
It's a breach of contract
to upload any photos of this place.

506
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,546
Can I just not take photos while up here?

507
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,840
Then you can go back to your old post.

508
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,426
I'll delete them.

509

SIGNED BY CHEON SA-RANG

510
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,817
KING MALL

511
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,256
Is this store the top in sales?

512
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,674
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,927
Who's in charge?

514
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,345
Hello.

515
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,305
I'm the supervisor, Do Ra-hee.

516
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,807
Which stores do you work with?

517
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,394
The airports in Incheon, Gimpo, Jeju,
as well as shops downtown.

518
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,686
Work here from tomorrow.

519
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,481
Keep this shop as our main focus

520
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,941
and double the sales.

521
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,359
Can you do that?

522
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,112
Yes, I can.

523
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,415
Ms. Do is going to start working here?

524
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,251
She's the most infamous witch
among the old witches.

525
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,128
What will happen to us now?

526
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,838
She's that bad?

527
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,714
Her name already rhymes with crazy…

528
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,218
Manager Do Ra-hee.

529
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,720
It's okay.
We'll do the actual work anyway.

530
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,764
Let's go.

531
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,058
Let's go.

532
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,309
-Yes.
-Exactly.

533
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,019
You couldn't meet their eyes.

534
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,569
-Hello.
-Hello.

535
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,780
Is this the team with the lowest number
for in-flight duty-free sales?

536
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,241
There are three teams in the lowest rank,

537
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,826
and this is one of them.

538
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,745
Purser?

539
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,581
Yes, ma'am.

540
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,291
What's your plan?

541
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,042
We'll do our best.

542
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,502
Which you haven't done so far?

543
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,879
No, ma'am.

544
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,714
We'll do our best to bring up the sales.

545
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,798
Any specific plans?

546
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,385
We'll push the sales more

547
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,971
so that none of our guests

548
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,681
leave the flight empty-handed.

549
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,185
That means you can easily
double the sales compared to now.

550
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,896
We'll do our best.

551
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,147
Don't let me down.

552
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,358
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye!

553
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,700
Who is she?

554
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,618
I've never seen--

555
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,412
You must've been shocked.

556
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,248
-The managing director.
-That almost killed me.

557
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,757
You do realize the Chinese restaurant
has the highest sales in every hotel?

558
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,050
Yes, I'm aware of that.

559
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,635
So what's going on here?

560
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,095
I'm going to try the dishes myself,

561
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,139
so change your old recipes

562
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,766
and make new dishes by this week.

563
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,559
By this week, ma'am?

564
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,519
You can't?

565
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,938
No, I can do that.

566
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,365
-Get rid of him.
-Yes, ma'am.

567
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,256
Get rid of him.

568
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,632
Yes, ma'am.

569
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,764
I prepared a meeting with the staff
regarding our revenue.

570
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,850
Why should I go to something you prepared?

571
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,142
Look at Ms. Gu.

572
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,229
She visited every single department
and gave them a new sales goal.

573
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,188
Great.

574
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,023
I won't have to do a thing.

575
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,150
She already fired two people today.

576
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,819
"Get rid of him. And him."

577
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,238
She was so scary too.

578
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,408
One of them was too fat,
the other was too messy.

579
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,784
The staff?

580
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,703
Of course. Why would she fire the board?

581
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,998
What if all of the employees
of King the Land get fired?

582
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,207
And most importantly,

583
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,418
what if I get kicked out?

584
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,670
I did nothing wrong.

585
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,715
This may not be a big deal to you,

586
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,134
but a mere employee like me
can get fired over this.

587
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,094
You might work
at daddy's company as a hobby,

588
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,471
but some people work hard
just to make ends meet.

589
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,599
Does this meeting

590
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,560
include the staff
of King the Land as well?

591
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,812
Of course. Especially if you're attending.

592
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:40,648
Let's go.

593
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,652
Mr. Gu is holding a meeting with the staff

594
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,487
regarding the hotel's revenue.

595
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,290
A special promotional event for our VIPs

596
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:02,128
would be the most effective way
to increase short-term revenue.

597
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,466
Go ahead and do that.

598
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,719
If you don't like that,

599
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:14,807
we can increase the per-transaction sales
by having premium wine

600
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,143
or limited-edition whiskey
as our main liquor.

601
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,144
Okay.

602
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,023
If you don't like any of those methods,

603
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,984
please let me know
the direction you are looking for.

604
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,449
It's not that I don't like them.

605
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,160
As someone on the ground,
you must know better than me,

606
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,537
so I want to follow your suggestions.

607
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,748
What's the most effective method?

608
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,965
To be frank, pushing incentives.

609
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,841
Then let's do that.

610
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,637
However, providing just 30,000 won
in incentives like last time

611
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,139
for selling a liquor set
worth 40 million won

612
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,058
won't have a huge impact.

613
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,518
What?

614
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,771
You got only 30,000 won in incentives

615
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,857
for selling a product
worth 40 million won?

616
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,442
It's my first time hearing this.

617
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,527
Yes.

618
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,822
Make it big enough to have an impact.

619
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,949
Let me know your sales goal.

620
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,076
I'll look over it
and implement it right away.

621
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,663
Thank you.

622
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,289
We'll do our best.

623
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,007
That's all for the meeting.

624
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,896

CALL

626
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,957
MESSAGE

627
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,003
I need to talk to you after work.

628
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,255
Okay.

629
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,158
Is she still at work?

630
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,201
Did she not see it?

631
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,660
How could she not see it?

632
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,080
Is she still working?

633
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,965
Is she working overtime?

634
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,222
Do I not have signal?

635
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,432
Seven. Eight.

636
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,434
Nine.

637
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,478
Ten.

638
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,609
One, two, three…

639
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,286
Just until this hourglass runs out.

640
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,512
It hasn't run out yet.

641
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,822
PHONY CHEON

642
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,878
MISSED CALL

643
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,590
Ms. Gu came by today and it was like war.

644
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,842
She came by Da-eul's store as well.

645
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,845
I heard she did that at the hotel too.

646
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,762
No idea.

647
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,347
-You don't know?
-No.

648
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,224
A few of the employees were exiled.

649
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,102
Why were they exiled? To where?

650
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,437
How would I know?

651
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,690
I hear your hotel
has a special place for the exiles.

652
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,067
I don't know.

653
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,250
Who is it?

654
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,211
I don't know.

655
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,464
Well,

656
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,507
I don't need to know their place of exile

657
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,384
when I'm about to get axed.

658
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,220
Why? Did you do something wrong?

659
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,721
She wants us to double the sales.

660
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,015
If we make low in-flight sales,

661
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,350
we'll become traitors.

662
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,435
How can you double them?

663
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,897
If they keep pestering the staff,
we'll somehow bring in sales,

664
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,900
so they'll pester us
until the point of death.

665
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,069
Didn't they discuss sales with you?

666
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,904
We get incentives for pushing sales.

667
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,656
Really?

668
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,200
Your team is the best off.

669
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,369
How much?

670
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,162
No idea.

671
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,706
It's not like the incentives
or the lack thereof

672
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,541
will make me work more or less.

673
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,835
I'm just going to do my job.

674
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,756
But I'm not getting anywhere
although I'm doing more than my job.

675
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,758
I'm suffocated in the middle,

676
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,677
pushed around by my seniors and juniors.

677
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,639
If you need help, ask Da-eul for a lesson.

678
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,474
Her shop had the top sales.

679
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,892
I really should.

680
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,063
Good for Da-eul.

681
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,357
She's the manager,
the best salesperson, married,

682
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,984
and has an adorable daughter.

683
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,026
She has it all.

684
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,028
I'm jealous!

685
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,655
I'm jealous!

686
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,077
I'm home.

687
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,704
-Mom's here.
-Hey, Cho-rong.

688
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,664
What did you draw?

689
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,207
You're home.

690
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,167
Make dinner. I'm hungry.

691
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,877
Okay.

692
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,297
Look at that.

693
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,676
What's with them?

694
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,819
Mother, I need to go grocery shopping.

695
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,945
There's no food.

696
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,989
Why didn't you go beforehand?

697
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,325
It'll take forever for us to eat.

698
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,954
I made braised short ribs
and pollack soup this morning,

699
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,956
but a thief must've come and eaten it all.

700
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:58,169
That's why you should make
more than enough when you cook.

701
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,546
Don't be so stingy with food.

702
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,964
Grandma.

703
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,632
Don't be mean to Mom.

704
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,678
Aunt, Uncle, and that darned family
came and finished everything.

705
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,223
Who taught you such a phrase?

706
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,391
Don't use such words.

707
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,893
While you're at it,

708
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,270
get some oxtail and make a hearty broth.

709
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,898
I must be low on energy.

710
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,649
-I haven't had an appetite.
-Jeez.

711
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,277
You cleared three bowls of rice
without an appetite?

712
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,614
I only had three bowls
because I had no appetite.

713
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,159
What are you waiting for?

714
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,494
Go get the groceries.

715
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,246
Okay, I'll be back soon.

716
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,915
Cho-rong, come with Mom.

717
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,628
Look at that.

718
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,258
Mom, our home isn't a restaurant.

719
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,929
Why does Aunt always come
and eat at our place?

720
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,765
I guess my food is much better.

721
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,601
She always comes and eats for free,

722
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,936
never even does the dishes,

723
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,688
and steals everything good
from our fridge.

724
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,650
Should we report her to the police?

725
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,778
Let's say it's because I'm a good cook
and give her a break.

726
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,784
Cho-rong, do you want a doll?

727
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,337
Hello? Where are you?

728
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,714
Can you come to the grocery store?

729
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,924
I have too much stuff.

730
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,010
Sorry, I'm out having dinner
with a client.

731
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,221
Still? Can't you sneak out?

732
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,556
How can I do that?

733
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,557
It's a part of work.

734
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,852
Okay. Make sure you eat well.

735
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,812
-Don't strain yourself.
-Okay.

736
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,813
You too.

737
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,815
Don't strain yourself and get a good rest.

738
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,943
I'll be late tonight,
so you should go to sleep first.

739
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,779
Bye.

740
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,017
I need to talk to you.

741
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,361
Would you like to order?

742
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,491
I asked to see you yesterday.

743
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,159
What? When?

744
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,243
Didn't you see the text?

745
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,078
I called you too.

746
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,080
-Do you know my number?
-Of course.

747
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,582
It's in your personnel record.

748
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,501
Don't you know mine, Phony Cheon?

749
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,586
I have no access to your personnel record.

750
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,093
Here.

751
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,012
That's my number. Save it.

752
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,183
So what did you want to say to me?

753
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,728
I must

754
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,647
ask you something.

755
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,315
Ask away.

756
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,401
Let's talk over dinner after work.

757
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,736
Wait.

758
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,571
Can't you just tell me now?

759
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,575
You treated me to juice
on Gapado last time.

760
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,411
I'd like to return the favor,
so I'll see you then.

761
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,579
No, it's okay.

762
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,414
I'm not okay.

763
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,334
I simply can't stand
owing someone a favor.

764
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,961
But I'm okay with it.

765
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,510
Is it too much

766
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,554
for you

767
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,348
to just say yes this once?

768
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,309
Well,

769
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,978
isn't it proper manners to check

770
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,564
if I have a prior engagement
before asking me to dinner?

771
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,574
Ms. Phony Cheon.

772
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,242
Do you have

773
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,661
plans for dinner

774
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,706
tonight?

775
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,499
No, I don't.

776
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,334
In that case,

777
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,629
would you like

778
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,465
to have dinner

779
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,009
with me?

780
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,844
I don't want to.

781
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,637
Why not? Why do you say no to me?

782
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,056
I didn't say no to you.

783
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,266
I said no to dinner.

784
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,729
Then Ms. Phony Cheon,
what do you like other than dinner?

785
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,189
It's just that it'd be so awkward
to eat alone with you.

786
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,860
So you won't order?

787
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,987
I won't.

788
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,906
I'm not eating!

789
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,257
What's with him?

790
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,220
Next.

791
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:07,728
And next.

792
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,193
Next.

793
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,821
You must choose a photo today.

794
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,865
They all look the same to me.

795
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,742
So much so that it's almost scary.

796
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,869
Please make your call.

797
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,329
I've decided.

798
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,539
Thank you. Which one?

799
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,417
I simply must have
dinner with her tonight.

800
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,545
Make dinner plans
with Ms. Cheon Sa-rang after work.

801
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:35,964
Make sure she comes.

802
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,175
Why? Is something going on?

803
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,428
-Tell her it's a welcome dinner.
-A welcome dinner?

804
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,889
Where at?

805
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,355
The hotel's

806
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,315
Japanese restaurant.

807
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,566
After the welcome dinner,

808
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,860
you must choose a photo, okay?

809
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,029
You have to. Please?

810
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,998
Hello, it's been a while.

811
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,959
A strong cup of coffee, please.

812
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,752
I'll bring it to the cockpit.

813
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,255
No, I'd like to have it here with you

814
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,006
in this cozy galley.

815
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,550
I'll bring it to you.

816
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,636
You're still as feisty as ever.

817
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,890
Eat dinner with me after the flight.
It's been a while.

818
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,016
No.

819
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,310
Here's your cozy cup of coffee.

820
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,896
Please excuse me.

821
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,484
Don't be so cheeky.

822
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,405
Who do you think will suffer
if I start acting nasty?

823
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,451
Do you still think I'm a joke?

824
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,161
No.

825
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,329
I still want you.

826
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,007
Hello.

827
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,675
Would you like something?

828
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,010
What? No.

829
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,303
I already got it.

830
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,346
Keep it up.

831
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,943
Did something happen?

832
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,737
It's not a big deal.

833
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,699
Do you have plans tonight?

834
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,493
I'm just going to rest.

835
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,329
How about having a beer with me?

836
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,372
No, I'm tired. I'm not in the mood.

837
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,168
My mom told me to treat you
and thank you for her scarf.

838
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,253
It's okay. I wanted to thank you first.

839
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,963
Well, I'm using her as an excuse.

840
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,591
I want to have dinner with you.

841
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,682
Let's get dinner together.

842
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,527
This is nice.

843
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,654
I think so too.

844
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,406
Don't you love it here?

845
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,951
The waves and the wind.

846
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:14,540
I love seeing you so happy.

847
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,011
Thank you for your help last time.

848
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,683
How could I not act

849
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,561
after seeing my senior
run for her life like that?

850
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,564
I was just doing you a favor
to make my life easier at work.

851
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,940
You don't have to thank me.

852
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,945
If that's the reason, I'm sorry.

853
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,238
Why?

854
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,823
You picked the wrong senior.

855
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,159
I'm the only one among my peers
who didn't make assistant purser.

856
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,787
If I don't get promoted next year,

857
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,831
people will know that I've been left out.

858
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,958
That'll be the end of me.

859
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,295
What about it?

860
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,755
What do you mean?

861
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,341
You won't benefit in any way
if you befriend me.

862
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:07,968
So stay away.

863
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,556
So what if I can't get promoted?

864
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,268
It hurts too much to fall from high-up.

865
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,021
I prefer the low and long haul.

866
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,772
Sounds great.

867
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,650
I'll have to be
one of your close associates.

868
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,779
You'll regret it later.

869
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,782
I never will.

870
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,629
What do you think about Mi-na?

871
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,547
She's a great girl.

872
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,592
She's very curious about you.

873
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,385
What about you?

874
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,804
What?

875
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,681
I'm very curious about you.

876
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,698
This way, please.

877
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,307
-Hello, Mr. Gu.
-Hello, Mr. Gu.

878
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,727
-Why?
-What is this?

879
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,645
A welcome dinner.

880
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,689
-Why?
-To welcome Ms. Cheon.

881
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,691
You told me to put a dinner together.

882
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,567
Is this really…

883
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,610
You're…

884
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,781
-They can eat and go.
-Don't be so shy.

885
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,116
Please go inside.

886
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,079
-Hello, Mr. Gu.
-Hello, Mr. Gu.

887
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,551
Let's take a group photo before we eat.

888
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,970
Okay, Hermès.

889
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,304
One, two, three.

890
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,266
Thank you.

891
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,518
Look at that. You look great.

892
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,274
Cheers. Congrats.

893
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:28,942
Thank you.

894
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,485
Mr. Gu.

895
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,530
Thank you for sparing your time
for our rookie, sir.

896
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,615
Please eat.

897
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,743
-Maybe a toast?
-Let's just eat.

898
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,203
Thank you.

899
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

900
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,606
Ms. Cheon.

901
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,774
Is it not to your liking?

902
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,902
No, it's good.

903
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,737
How would you know without having any?

904
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,697
Do you not eat raw fish?

905
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,574
I'm fine.

906
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,327
Mr. No, prepare a steak for her.

907
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,579
It's a Japanese restaurant.

908
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,039
I know. I meant next door.

909
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,082
No, I'm fine, really.

910
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,960
Let me know
if any of you can't eat raw fish.

911
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,254
I'm fine. I'm not picky.

912
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,548
Me too. I like raw fish.

913
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,302
-Should I go?
-I'll be right back.

914
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,017
I thought that was the door.

915
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,903
I'm Edward Jung, the head chef
of King Hotel's Western restaurant.

916
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,905
This is an Angus sirloin steak,

917
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,657
a prime T-bone steak,

918
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,826
and an Australian lamb chop steak.

919
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:01,868
Have a lovely dinner.

920
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,162
Thank you.

921
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,589
Eat before it gets cold.

922
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:16,967
Will do.

923
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,221
Where are my manners?

924
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,639
Mr. No, cut it for her.

925
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:23,974
-Yes, sir.
-No, I can do it!

926
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,480
Can you feed yourself?

927
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,316
-Do you need help?
-No.

928
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,734
I'm fine.

929
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,125
Please eat.

930
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,527
Why did you call me out here?

931
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,863
Are you trying to put me in a tough spot?

932
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,489
Why would I?

933
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,575
I didn't ask for a welcome dinner.

934
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,452
And what was that huge steak?

935
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,703
Did you want to kill me?

936
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:27,787
I didn't…

937
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,624
This wasn't what I had in mind.

938
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,752
I saw that you couldn't eat raw fish,
so I got you steak.

939
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,253
Why are you angry over that?

940
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,963
You've never had to mind anyone.

941
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,465
Of course not.

942
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,717
You probably lived like a king
among servants.

943
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,054
I feel like I'm on pins and needles

944
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,598
because of your unnecessary kindness.

945
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,934
I already feel self-conscious enough.

946
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,268
Why do you feel self-conscious?

947
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,396
I was showing consideration
for this dinner I arranged.

948
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,066
That wasn't consideration.
It was more like a bomb.

949
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,277
From now on,
just pretend like you don't know me.

950
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,820
I don't need your consideration.

951
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,447
Please.

952
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,164
What went wrong?

953
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,840
GONG YU-NAM

954
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,321
Sa-rang!

955
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,949
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday.

956
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,494
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

957
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,080
-Happy birthday, dear Sa-rang
-Happy birthday, dear Sa-rang

958
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,707
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

959
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,377
Am I allowed to be this happy?

960
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,713
No, you should be even happier.
This isn't enough.

961
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,465
Yes, so wish for bigger happiness
as you blow these out.

962
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,304
CHEON SA-RANG'S BIRTHDAY

963
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,974
Happy birthday!

964
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,729
You made all this?

965
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,897
Sure, I'm a seasoned homemaker.

966
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,107
Thank you.

967
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,317
I'm a seasoned eater.

968
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,778
Okay.

969
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,281
Here, open your present.
We picked it out together.

970
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,158
Gosh, thank you.

971
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,369
Let's see.

972
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,292
-What is this?
-Your birthday is tomorrow.

973
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,294
You can hang out with us today,

974
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,838
then have a wild night
with your boyfriend tomorrow.

975
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,717
He won't forget your birthday, right?

976
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,801
He did last year.

977
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,055
Didn't I tell you?

978
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,099
We broke up a while ago.

979
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,852
What? Why haven't you told us until now?

980
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,397
Sorry, I forgot.
I've been too busy lately.

981
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,857
How can you forget that?

982
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,400
Are you all right?

983
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,652
Yes, I'm fine.

984
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,404
I actually feel relieved,

985
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,657
almost to the point
where I wonder if I even had a boyfriend.

986
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,576
I guess that was it.

987
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,203
Will you get back with him?

988
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,039
Never.

989
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,672
I'll get the beer. Turn on the music.

990
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:29,094
This is great. It's a party.

991
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,237
Sa-rang, get up.

992
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,239
Get up and show us.

993
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,615
Get up.

994
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,829
Let's go!

995
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,389
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

996
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,062
Do I seem like a guy

997
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,565
who hasn't had to consider others

998
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,359
because I was born into the right family?

999
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:27,944
A bit.

1000
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,155
But who dared to tell you such a fact?

1001
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,364
How brave of them.

1002
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,536
Don't mind it though.

1003
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,954
You were born this way.

1004
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,539
I'm only jealous.

1005
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,915
Please go inside, Mr. Gu.

1006
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,834
I'll stop by King the Land first.

1007
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,502
Why?

1008
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,255
It's our kind Ms. Sa-rang's birthday,

1009
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,966
so I got her our buffet voucher.

1010
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,885
One of the employee benefits.

1011
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,037
Look at you, showing your teeth.

1012
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:20,997
Just leave me alone.

1013
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,416
-You might bite me soon.
-I'm not doing anything

1014
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,586
not because I can't fight,
but because I don't want to.

1015
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,339
You say you don't want to fight,

1016
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,133
yet you went behind my back
and had a strategy meeting.

1017
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,635
I'm in charge of King the Land.

1018
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,303
And you're under my charge at work.

1019
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,722
Didn't you know you needed

1020
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,433
my permission and approval
no matter what you do?

1021
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,853
I didn't know.
I didn't look at the organizational chart.

1022
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,772
I don't know why you came to work here,

1023
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,732
but you'll have to fight me for life.

1024
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,401
If you need money,
I'll give you what you want,

1025
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,778
so leave.

1026
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,404
I have plenty of money.

1027
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,448
I'm telling you for your sake.

1028
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,617
Don't end up like your mom.

1029
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,621
See?

1030
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,456
Nobody remembers her.

1031
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,376
Both you and me.

1032
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,921
That's life for a loser.

1033
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,548
Okay?

1034
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,301
And throw out that pocket watch.

1035
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,971
How childish of you.

1036
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,614
Are you looking for this?

1037
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,200
-Give it back.
-I don't want to.

1038
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,788
Give it back. It's mine.

1039
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,456
She left because she didn't want you.

1040
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,960
So forget about her.

1041
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,714
No!

1042
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,846
No…

1043
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,043
I'll be the main server.

1044
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,669
You can stand quietly in the back.

1045
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,048
Don't meddle
and try to sell something expensive.

1046
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,133
Yes, I understand.

1047
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,850
I'd like some wine recommendations.

1048
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,978
We recently got nice vintages
of Charrier Margaux and Zeña.

1049
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,022
Which would go better with today's meal?

1050
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:54,567
Let me get the sommelier
to provide a more detailed suggestion.

1051
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,235
We can't wait that long.

1052
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,737
Give us a suggestion.

1053
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,532
Any bottle will go nicely
with the meal we have today.

1054
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,037
You're that best talent, right?

1055
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,748
Hello, sir.

1056
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,459
She still has a great smile.

1057
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,461
In that case,

1058
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,172
let's get a suggestion
from the best talent of King Hotel.

1059
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:23,096
In that case, may I suggest the Zeña?

1060
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,390
It's a premium wine from Chile.

1061
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,184
The smell of blackcurrant
and blackberries mixes nicely

1062
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:32,021
with the smell of vanilla
from the oak barrel,

1063
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,942
and you'll feel the fine-grained tannins
with the elegance of full-bodied wine.

1064
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,779
I believe it'll go nicely
with your lamb chop steak.

1065
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,615
You're well-versed in wine,

1066
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,283
almost like an expert.

1067
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,494
I'm a certified sommelier.

1068
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,456
I knew I had a discerning eye for people.

1069
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,334
I really want to recruit her.

1070
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,253
I'll pay you twice as much.

1071
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,462
Come work at my hotel.

1072
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,048
I'm flattered, sir.

1073
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,384
My goodness.

1074
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,970
Should we get the meal ready?

1075
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,888
Sa-rang, what are you doing?

1076
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,057
There's a single-malt package
worth 40 million.

1077
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,517
Why did you recommend wine?

1078
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,103
You should've made him order whiskey.

1079
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:15,523
This is why we say
you don't have the basics.

1080
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,068
But the chairman asked
for a wine recommendation.

1081
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,571
And you suggested wine too.

1082
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,197
Whatever.

1083
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,074
Make sure to sell more expensive items.

1084
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,325
Try upselling.

1085
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,162
Remember that.

1086
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,496
Got it?

1087
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,541
Yes, I'll remember that.

1088
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,900
PERSONNEL RECORD

1089
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:00,735
Mr. Gu.

1090
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,279
If you tell me who you're looking for,
I'll look it up.

1091
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,449
Can a record be left out of the server?

1092
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,451
No, we typed in everyone since year one

1093
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,328
as we digitized our system.

1094
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,205
So why can't I find it?

1095
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,749
It has to be there.

1096
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,251
Our payroll and severance pay
are on our accounting system,

1097
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,920
so nobody can delete the records.

1098
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,634
Is that everything from 1989?

1099
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,593
Yes.

1100
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,055
Who are you looking for if I may ask?

1101
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:30,973
Never mind.

1102
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,526
Surprise! Happy birthday.

1103
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,821
What are you doing?

1104
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,489
Let's go.
I made reservations at a nice spot.

1105
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,496
Are you still sulking?

1106
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,789
We broke up.

1107
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,166
I said I never wanted to see you again.

1108
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,960
You weren't sulking over the gimbap?

1109
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,339
That's why I made a reservation
at a high-end fine dining restaurant.

1110
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:04,924
Don't sulk over some food.

1111
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,008
Hey.

1112
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,178
Do you think
I broke up with you over that?

1113
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,098
If I had, I would've dumped you
hundreds of times already.

1114
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,059
What do you take me for
to take what I said that way?

1115
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:16,561
I'm sorry.

1116
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,521
I'll be really good from now on.
I'm so sorry.

1117
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,356
Stop saying you're sorry!

1118
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,069
If you were really sorry,

1119
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,947
you wouldn't have acted this way
to begin with.

1120
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,910
I'm sick and tired of you.

1121
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,038
Let's end this.

1122
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:38,791
You're really harsh.

1123
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,128
And you're selfish.
You can't make the call alone.

1124
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,170
I can.

1125
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,883
My love is over,
so do whatever you want with yours.

1126
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,011
I never want to see you again.

1127
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,638
Have you always been this harsh?

1128
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,181
Are you the Sa-rang I know?

1129
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,143
Let go of me.

1130
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,937
We're now strangers.

1131
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,876
This is my spot.

1132
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,963
Excuse me?

1133
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:52,717
This is

1134
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,594
my spot.

1135
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,023
KING THE LAND

1136
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:24,892
Your outfit…

1137
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,937
You two look so good together.

1138
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,105
I knew it.

1139
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,231
Who are you to…

1140
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,275
She doesn't want to see you anymore.

1141
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,320
-Why are you here?
-Why didn't you reply?

1142
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,447
-Reply to what?
-My text.

1143
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,407
-I did.
-And I replied to your reply.

1144
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,325
I'm working right now.

1145
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,996
I was just acting startled.

1146
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,498
Look, it's a heart.

1147
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:48,833
It's good.

1148
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:52,211
Your favorite food, your favorite weather,
your favorite color.

1149
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,838
Tell me everything you like.

1150
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,048
Why do you want to know that?

1151
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:04,056
