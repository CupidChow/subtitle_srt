RESUME

3
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,514
Is this you?

4
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,351
I put on a little weight.

5
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,520
I don't need a high salary.

6
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,106
I hope I don't have to stand all day.
I have flat feet.

7
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,524
-Excuse--
-Where do we eat?

8
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,903
Communication is key
for a hotel concierge.

9
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,404
Will you be able to communicate…

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,989
I'm super fluent in Korean.

11
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,825
I majored in political science
and international relations.

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,243
I will lead the conversations

13
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,454
from the guests' perspectives…

14
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,415
I'm shy. Please don't look at me.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,376
Excuse me…

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,628
2015 KING HOTEL TRAINEESHIP INTERVIEW

17
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,516
Number 511, please come in.

18
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,373
What's with Number 511?

19
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,250
Don't we require a bachelor's degree?

20
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,209
I apologize.

21
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,837
There must've been a mistake
during the resume screening process.

22
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,973
Hello, I am interviewee number 511,

23
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,224
Cheon Sa-rang.

24
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,812
2015 KING HOTEL TRAINEESHIP INTERVIEW

25
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,831
Your hobby is playing the piano.

26
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,624
Can you play for us?

27
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,543
-Right now?
-Yes, right now.

28
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,881
But there's no piano here.

29
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,257
I know, right?

30
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,986
INTERVIEWER

31
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,617
INTERVIEWER

32
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,212
Your hobby is playing the piano,

33
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,381
yet you played "Chopsticks."

34
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,926
It's my hobby, not my specialty.

35
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,969
I'm not that good, but I enjoy playing.

36
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,973
Can you smile for us?

37
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,200
Hey.

38
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,913
You really did that?

39
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,998
Yes. What else was I supposed to do?

40
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,167
But still, it was King Hotel.

41
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,461
You should've at least
played something by Beethoven.

42
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,175
Wonderful.

43
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,426
You pass.

44
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,346
Thank you, ma'am. I'll work hard.

45
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,183
Hey, Beethoven or Mozart.
None of that matters.

46
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,436
They require bachelor's degrees
from mere one-month trainees.

47
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,772
Then why did you go for the interview?

48
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,815
Just because.

49
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,234
I wondered how Korea's best hotel
conducted their interviews.

50
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,237
If you've satisfied your curiosity,
join me at the duty-free shop.

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,739
Don't listen to her.
Be a flight attendant with me.

52
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,993
No, I'm going to work in a hotel.

53
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,577
Come on. Why?

54
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,912
I just like hotels.

55
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,915
More than you like me?

56
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,043
Hey, you like nightclubs
more than you like me.

57
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,297
How upsetting.

58
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,923
How could you say that?

59
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,049
It can't be helped.

60
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,051
Let's go clubbing.

61
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,803
Right now?

62
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,096
Let's go where?

63
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,432
-Let's go!
-What are you talking about?

64
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,142
Excuse me.

65
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,519
I've been watching you for a while.

66
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,187
Would you care for a drink?

67
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:25,950
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,870
We were in the middle
of something important.

69
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,831
You can just give me your number.

70
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,292
Hey.

71
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,590
There we go.

72
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,426
I'll get in touch with you.

73
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,307
Hey, why would you
give your number to a stranger?

74
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,768
What do you mean by "stranger"?
We're acquainted now.

75
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,479
Didn't I tell you to start a relationship
after you developed feelings

76
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,855
instead of regretting it later?

77
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,191
Hey, love doesn't happen in stages.

78
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,776
I'm dying to know

79
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,028
who you'll get married to
with that mindset.

80
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,654
Are you crazy?

81
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,365
Why would I settle with one person
for the rest of my life?

82
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,243
Even the thought is frightening. Let's go.

83
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,203
Let's go.

84
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,456
I'll pass. I'm so tired.

85
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,458
-That's why you go clubbing.
-I mean…

86
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,003
You just got off your flight.
You should get some rest.

87
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,089
No sleep at all is better
than just a few hours.

88
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,006
Grab her.

89
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,760
-I'm not in the mood today.
-Goodness.

90
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,178
I'm feeling pumped already.

91
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,328
Who is it?

92
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,125
Hello?

93
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,213
Yes, I'm Number 511, Cheon Sa-rang.

94
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,176
Sorry?

95
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,969
Really?

96
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,972
I did?

97
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,098
But why?

98
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,727
No, that's not what I meant.

99
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,605
Okay, thank you.

100
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,619
Why? What's wrong?

101
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,661
What's the matter?

102
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,829
I passed.

103
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,001
I got an offer from King Hotel!

104
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,631
Congratulations, Sa-rang!

105
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,497
-Hello?
-You landed in the wrong place.

106
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,834
-Sorry?
-It's the building next to you.

107
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,591
Over here!

108
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,469
Over here!

109
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,221
Over here!

110
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,182
Over here!

111
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,436
EPISODE 1

112
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,568
The most important quality of an intern

113
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,154
is not how good they are at their job.

114
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,656
It's having common sense.

115
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,451
No matter how nimble you are
or how hard you work,

116
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,745
it's over for you
if people find you thoughtless.

117
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,663
The end.

118
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,666
Consider arriving late
on your first day of work

119
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,502
and saying, "I thought it was
the building next door."

120
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,295
What ridiculous excuse is that?

121
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,505
What are you…

122
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,174
Where did you buy your shoes?

123
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,969
I bought them in Milan.

124
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,012
Milan?

125
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,641
A three-piece suit and shoes from Milan.

126
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,476
You could be mistaken for a nobleman.

127
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,311
-You should laugh along.
-Yes, sir.

128
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,272
You need to laugh now
if you want to be seen as mindful.

129
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,776
All right. Starting now,
I'll teach you what it means to have…

130
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,153
This is fake, isn't it?

131
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,238
No.

132
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,572
It's authentic?

133
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,367
Look at you. Goodness. Hold on.

134
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,208
How much does your outfit cost?

135
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,334
Are you a chaebol?

136
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,253
Well…

137
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,548
-No.
-See? I knew it.

138
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,507
Look at you.

139
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,092
He's acting like one.

140
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,678
You're on the path of self-destruction.

141
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,847
This is what you call being thoughtless.

142
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,140
While you're in my charge,

143
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,434
don't think of doing anything
and just follow my orders.

144
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,352
-Yes, sir.
-Louder. Got it?

145
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,854
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

146
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,021
SALES SUPPORT TEAM
INTERN GU WON

147
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,406
This is your first internship, right?

148
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,615
Don't be late tomorrow.

149
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,033
I wasn't late.

150
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,245
If you come to work on the dot,
it means you're late.

151
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,622
Come to work
at least 30 minutes early. Got it?

152
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,501
But why are you speaking so casually?

153
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,253
Because we're coworkers.

154
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,381
We have to get through
this unfriendly world together.

155
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,092
Don't just sit there.
Uncross your legs and do something.

156
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,595
Do what? There's nothing to do.

157
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,347
You still have to act
like you're doing something.

158
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,559
Here. I'll give you a calculator,
so press some buttons.

159
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,852
I said uncross your legs.

160
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,187
And you heard him earlier, right?

161
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,314
You shouldn't wear
expensive suits or watches.

162
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,274
Wear something old like mine if you must.

163
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,401
Do I have to? Why?

164
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,030
Wearing something more expensive
than your superiors is considered mutiny.

165
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,823
You can flaunt your money outside of work.

166
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,200
I never flaunted it.

167
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,368
My goodness. You're absolutely clueless.

168
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,955
One would think
you were parachuted into the job.

169
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,249
You're right.

170
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,959
I parachuted here.

171
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,586
What?

172
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,880
I had to rush in from Jeju Island.

173
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,965
Is there something wrong?

174
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,884
You're driving me crazy.

175
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,846
Listen carefully.

176
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,265
This is my fifth internship.

177
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,683
If you keep acting like this,

178
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,562
you won't even be able to land a job
as a contract worker. Get it together.

179
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,773
-Interns!
-Yes, sir. No Sang-sik reporting.

180
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,858
-Interns.
-Yes, No Sang-sik here.

181
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,026
Why did you come alone?

182
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,611
-Did we only hire one intern?
-No, sir.

183
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,321
I thought you were just calling me.

184
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,031
Where are you going? Just call him.

185
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,866
-Right.
-What are you doing?

186
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,375
What? What is he doing?

187
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,252
He needs to sit when he works, you see.

188
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,420
Goodness. He got up.

189
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,838
Look at how relaxed he is.

190
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,216
How cool. I thought you were the chairman.

191
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,010
It's because this is his first internship.

192
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,345
I'll help him out.

193
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,222
-Yes, please help me out too.
-Yes, sir.

194
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,348
-To general affairs.
-Yes, sir.

195
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,517
And make three copies of each.

196
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,062
Take your hand out of your pocket.

197
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,731
Make copies. Yes, sir. Here.

198
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,525
Go.

199
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,528
HOW TO USE A COPIER

200
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,243
You're still not done?

201
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,246
I didn't know how to use this,
so I was looking it up.

202
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,789
How could you not know that?

203
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,166
Since I've never used it before.

204
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,793
Are you a young master or what?

205
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,170
Have your servants
been doing these chores for you?

206
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,757
Also, this is the scanner. Don't use this.

207
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,801
Look. Just press this button.

208
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,678
We have to replace the toner cartridge.

209
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,806
-Interns, what are you doing here?
-Yes, sir?

210
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,392
It says we need to
replace the toner cartridge.

211
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,186
Gosh, we asked for a new machine ages ago.

212
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,272
The machine has a sensor issue.
Just give it a shake.

213
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,690
-Shake it?
-Yes, shake it.

214
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,191
Yes, sir.

215
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,569
How cute. Are you going to be that gentle?

216
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,196
-Shake vigorously.
-What if it explodes?

217
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,240
-I said, shake it vigorously.
-Yes, sir.

218
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,783
-That's it. Good job.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,784
-More.
-Yes, sir.

220
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,454
-More.
-More.

221
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,624
-More.
-More.

222
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,019
Darn it. Who messed with the copier?

223
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,231
My goodness. I can't believe you guys.

224
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,067
You're driving me insane.

225
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,401
-Who was it?
-Darn it.

226
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,238
I'm sorry.

227
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,531
I was told to shake it so…

228
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,617
That's not even that expensive.

229
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,911
You could've just gotten a new one.

230
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,330
Are we living in the '80s?
Why would you shake that?

231
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,165
Well, the thing is…

232
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,377
You have a lot to say
after causing trouble. Just be quiet.

233
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,295
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,839
Why did they hire a blockhead like you?

235
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,217
-Clean the mess!
-Yes, sir.

236
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,678
Why are you sorry?
You didn't do anything wrong.

237
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,055
Of course I'm at fault.

238
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,140
-It's all my fault. Why…
-How so?

239
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,768
Hey.

240
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,937
What did you just say?

241
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,856
I said it wasn't
Intern No Sang-sik's fault.

242
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,816
Why not?

243
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,986
He just followed orders
because he was told to.

244
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,862
If it resulted in a negative outcome,

245
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,907
isn't the person
who gave the order at fault?

246
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,993
Stop it.

247
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,203
-What?
-I believe it's not right

248
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,622
to blame your juniors
without determining the cause.

249
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,791
Also, this only happened

250
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,502
because the copier was not replaced
when it should've been.

251
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,547
So the company is most at fault.

252
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,882
How dare an intern criticize the company?

253
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,719
Even a mere intern
can tell right from wrong.

254
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,679
-Darn you.
-I'm sorry.

255
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,890
This punk has no sense in him.

256
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,102
Clean up this mess at once and get lost.

257
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,187
And don't come to work starting tomorrow.

258
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,273
No, I have to come to work.

259
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,399
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

260
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,735
-I'll do that.
-What?

261
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,777
You'll what?

262
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,945
Don't move! Where are you going?

263
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,490
-You said to clean up the mess.
-Yes, right here.

264
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,077
Hello, it's me.

265
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,330
Can you send some cleaners
to the sales support team?

266
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,666
Yes.

267
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,752
The copier also needs to be replaced.

268
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,836
All right.

269
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,506
-He said he'll send them.
-Who?

270
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,050
The cleaners.

271
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,051
Who said that?

272
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,011
-Director Choi.
-Director Choi?

273
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,220
By Director Choi…

274
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,807
The only Director Choi here

275
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,770
is the one who works
in the chairman's secretary's office.

276
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,521
That's right.

277
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,650
If you don't mind me asking, who are you?

278
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,405
I'm an intern,

279
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,824
and my name is Gu Won.

280
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,953
Gu Won?

281
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,581
Then are you Chairman Gu Il-hun's…

282
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,875
That's right.

283
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,544
Goodness.

284
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,672
Goodness, you look amazing in this suit.

285
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,174
Then I guess

286
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,885
I won't come to work
starting tomorrow as you ordered.

287
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,012
No, ignore what I said. I'm sorry.

288
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,972
Don't apologize. I'm a mere intern.

289
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,933
I just need to do as I'm told.

290
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,061
Excuse me, Mr. Choi.

291
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,687
Choi Tae-man at your service.

292
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,147
Thanks to you,

293
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,275
I now have a good grasp of
what thoughtlessness is.

294
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,527
I'll be born again.

295
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,445
Hello, Mr. Choi.

296
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,863
What's wrong with the copier?

297
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,324
Are you hurt anywhere?

298
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,452
I'm fine. Please just handle the mess.

299
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,495
Hold on.

300
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,331
I was told to
manage your attendance strictly.

301
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,501
If you leave now,
the chairman will be furious.

302
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,836
I just…

303
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,171
got fired.

304
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,340
-No, it was a joke.
-I'm leaving.

305
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,218
Won.

306
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,095
You come over here.

307
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,263
-It's all your fault!
-I'm sorry.

308
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,431
-Why did you have to shake that?
-I'm sorry.

309
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,100
I can't get fired though.

310
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,643
-I need to stay here.
-I can't believe this.

311
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,729
I didn't know
that shaking the cartridge would…

312
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,606
You're back, sir.

313
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,733
Do you want to go with me?

314
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,821
-Me?
-As coworkers,

315
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,906
we need to get through
this unfriendly world together.

316
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,951
You said staying here won't even
guarantee you a contract position.

317
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,829
Come with me
and you'll get a full-time position.

318
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,796
I will serve you
with my utmost sincerity, sir.

319
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,551
-Do I need to clean this?
-I'll take care of it.

320
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,552
-Okay, then.
-Sure.

321
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,304
-Here you go.
-You may give it to me.

322
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,222
-I hope you'll be born again.
-Thank you.

323
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,349
Let's go, sir.

324
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,227
Coming through. Please make way.

325
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,646
-Gosh, why did you…
-Are you in your right mind?!

326
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,274
I told you to learn from the bottom up.

327
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,734
And you left on the first day?

328
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,862
I didn't choose to leave.
I got kicked out.

329
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,364
Either way, I already told you
that I'm not cut out for this.

330
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,325
I'll go back to the UK.

331
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,784
-What will you do there?
-Dad.

332
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,161
That's enough.

333
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,664
He can start slowly after studying more.

334
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,167
And I know it's good
to start from the bottom,

335
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,919
but an intern was too much.

336
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,129
Why can't you be
half as good as your sister?

337
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,298
Who does he take after?

338
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,009
Don't be too harsh on him.
I'll try talking to him.

339
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,304
Can we talk?

340
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,226
Go to the hotel.

341
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,727
It's a hassle.

342
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,646
I'll stay here tonight.

343
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,357
Who are you to stay here?

344
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,654
Don't be mistaken.

345
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,155
This isn't your house.

346
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,327
You're right.

347
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,162
I forgot for a second.

348
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,831
Stay at the hotel
and fly out as soon as possible.

349
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,917
Whatever you choose to do,

350
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,543
I'll support you financially.

351
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,172
So don't even think about
lurking around the house or the company.

352
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,596
You know,

353
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,598
I'm loaded too.

354
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,728
But thanks for looking after me.

355
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,148
You almost moved me for a second.

356
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,248
Where's Won?

357
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,500
He said he'd stay at the hotel
for the time being.

358
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,128
I insisted that he should at least eat.

359
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,673
That imbecile.

360
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,926
That wasn't even an earful,
but he ran away without eating.

361
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,553
He still has a long way to go.

362
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,347
If you keep tugging,
he'll only run farther away.

363
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,309
Letting him be
might be a good option for now.

364
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,061
All right.

365
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,815
Make sure you don't
give him a hard time either.

366
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,726
The guest is what?

367
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,353
-The guest is king.
-The guest is king.

368
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,689
That's right. The guest is king.

369
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,690
Why?

370
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,276
Because guests pay
service charges at hotels.

371
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,612
Because of that, it is our duty
to treat our guests like the king,

372
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,740
and it gives them the right
to be treated like one as well.

373
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,909
We aim to provide the guests
with satisfactory service

374
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,287
as well as to move their hearts.

375
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,832
We have to forget about our emotions
for the sake of our guests.

376
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,835
If you feel you're not up to it,
you may leave now.

377
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,006
No one?

378
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,966
Are you all ready to serve the king?

379
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:28,925
-Yes.
-Yes.

380
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,261
Quality customer service
starts with a smile.

381
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,431
This is the high-end smile
that only King Hotel offers.

382
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,224
Hermès!

383
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,684
-Hermès!
-Hermès!

384
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,146
A smile is the greatest sword and shield.

385
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,607
Beautifully, Hermès!

386
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,609
-Hermès!
-Hermès!

387
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,742
Hello, Manager Kim.

388
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,285
What's wrong with the floor?

389
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,536
We just cleaned it.

390
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,955
Clean it again and again
until it's sparkling clean.

391
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,874
She's a trainee.

392
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,126
Hello, I'm Cheon Sa-rang.

393
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,336
I'll take a look around.

394
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,755
-Teach her from A to Z.
-Yes, ma'am.

395
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,305
You're uselessly pretty
for a one-month trainee.

396
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,683
-Pardon?
-You'll be gone in a month.

397
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,060
Go and wipe the butt sweat.

398
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,853
"Butt sweat"?

399
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,688
If you go over there,

400
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,650
you'll see the beautiful butt sweat
left by our guests.

401
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,610
You'll be in charge of that for a month,

402
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,279
so don't miss a single drop
and wipe until it's sparkling clean.

403
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,739
Yes, ma'am.

404
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,000
Hey you.

405
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,585
Hermès!

406
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,420
Hermès!

407
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,016
Hermès.

408
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,768
Hermès.

409
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,440
Cotton swabs and cotton pads
should be filled to 90%.

410
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,317
It's difficult to take one out at 100%.

411
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,778
Anything under 90%
makes it look like we don't care.

412
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,822
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,866
Why are you so smiley?

414
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,786
I was taught to maintain
my Hermès smile while working.

415
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,329
That applies to concierges.

416
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,998
We still work in the hotel.

417
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,500
The true hotel working experience
starts in the lobby.

418
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,003
We wear sportswear
while they wear uniforms.

419
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,881
Plus, you're only here for a month.
You don't need to get used to Hermès.

420
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,926
I should still try my best while I'm here.

421
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,052
Try all you want.

422
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,097
No matter what happens,
you won't be able to go near the lobby.

423
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,267
Even I've been stuck here for five years.

424
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,185
At least you're a full-time worker.

425
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,814
Well…

426
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,358
I'm better than you in every aspect.

427
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,988
If you're done here, go out and wipe
until everything's sparkling clean.

428
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,782
Okay. I'll wipe
until everything's sparkling clean.

429
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,872
Let's get up early tomorrow
so we can eat something before our flight.

430
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,083
Pyeong-hwa, look up some famous places
nearby and make a reservation.

431
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,918
We have the hotel breakfast reserved.

432
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,128
I asked for a famous restaurant.

433
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,921
Find a rare restaurant with food

434
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,340
that is unique to this place.

435
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,843
Yes, ma'am.
I will look for a rare restaurant.

436
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,303
We're checked in.

437
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,182
Who wants to share a room with me?

438
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,520
Then should I choose?

439
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:33,485
Who will share a room with me?

440
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:38,740
I wonder who it will be

441
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,242
Eeny, meeny, miny…

442
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,080
moe!

443
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,748
You win!

444
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,507
Be done in ten minutes.

445
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,258
Don't use the restroom while I'm sleeping.

446
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,760
-Yes, ma'am.
-Unplug all the TV

447
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,886
and fridge cables.

448
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,930
I can't sleep if it's noisy. Understood?

449
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,723
Yes, ma'am. I…

450
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,396
RARE RESTAURANTS IN JEJU ISLAND

451
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,608
Didn't I tell you that I'm sensitive?

452
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,610
I could sense the electromagnetic waves.

453
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,404
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,697
-Turn off your phone.
-I put it on silent.

455
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,366
I can sense that too.

456
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,814
Thank you. Please come again next time.

457
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,234
-Da-eul.
-Yes?

458
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,695
The manager said
she doesn't like the cafeteria menu.

459
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,697
She wants some gimbap to eat in the back.

460
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,782
All right. I'll be right back.

461
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,705
Sorry. Coming through.

462
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,833
One tuna, two beef,

463
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,960
and one kimchi rice ball to go.

464
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,754
Okay, I got your order.

465
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,758
I'm really sorry, but in the tuna gimbap,
could you please reduce the rice,

466
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,509
add a lot of tuna and mayonnaise,

467
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,344
and take out the spinach?

468
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,597
Sure.

469
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,101
I'm really sorry again,
but for one of the beef gimbap,

470
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,937
can you leave out
the sesame oil and carrots?

471
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,939
Why don't you make it yourself?

472
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,776
I'm sorry. My seniors are picky eaters.

473
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,028
Just for today. I can't cater to
your needs when I'm busy.

474
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,404
Thank you so much.

475
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,656
I'm really sorry again…

476
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,617
-What now?
-Along with the other requests,

477
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,702
for the other beef gimbap,
can you take out the eggs

478
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,997
and apply the right amount of sesame oil
to make it give off a slight scent?

479
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,374
-Get out. I'm done with you.
-I'm sorry.

480
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,709
Please help me out.

481
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,753
-I need to buy the gimbap.
-Get out!

482
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,962
I'll make them.

483
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,590
At least allow me to make them. Please.

484
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,384
Excuse me. Sorry.

485
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,308
I'm back. I'll get everything ready.

486
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,477
The manager went to the cafeteria.

487
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,686
Sorry?

488
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,396
What about these?

489
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,359
Didn't you hear me? She wants
the pork cutlet from the cafeteria.

490
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,445
Let's go.

491
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,044
Where's the water?

492
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,507
-Hello.
-Hello.

493
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,092
-This is Alanga.
-This is King Hotel.

494
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,885
-Over there.
-Yes, ma'am.

495
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,810
Apologizing doesn't solve the problem!

496
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,896
Welcome. May I check your boarding pass?

497
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,358
Coming!

498
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,236
I can't believe my eyes.

499
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,364
Sir, I'm here.

500
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,285
Next.

501
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,166
Are you purchasing your clothes here?

502
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,710
Why would I bother shopping in person?

503
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,172
The comfort of the rich is beautiful.

504
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,593
What do you think of this?
There are only three in the nation.

505
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,012
Give me all three.

506
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,890
I'm sorry, but one has already been sold.

507
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,600
Then give me the remaining two.

508
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,310
I'm okay.

509
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,646
Matching shirts seems a bit too much.

510
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,356
I appreciate your gesture though.

511
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,315
Matching shirts?

512
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,316
Why would I?

513
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,234
Weren't you going to give one to me?

514
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,402
Both of them are mine.

515
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,615
Also, I hate it when someone else wears
the same thing as me.

516
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,784
Just go and get ready for the UK.

517
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,577
We're leaving in a week.

518
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,162
Be prepared not to come back.

519
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,872
The UK all of a sudden?

520
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,958
I don't have a passport.

521
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,710
Is that even possible?

522
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,003
Have you never been abroad?

523
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,047
I never had the opportunity to do so.

524
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,757
I was busy interning.

525
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,425
Apply for a passport this instant.

526
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,681
By the way, sir,
will I really become a full-time employee?

527
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,934
What if I follow you
and end up hanging in the wind?

528
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,144
Hello?

529
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,021
It's me.

530
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,024
Can you promote No Sang-sik
to a full-time position?

531
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,234
Yes, thank you.

532
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,777
Happy now?

533
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,945
Of course, sir.

534
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,133
Hello.

535
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,510
I'm the front desk manager, Kim Su-mi.

536
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,594
Yes. And?

537
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,180
I heard that you're returning to the UK.

538
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,391
Already? Even I just found out.

539
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,226
Well, you're very famous.

540
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,227
I see.

541
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,065
I am pretty popular,
which could be a bother at times.

542
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,236
Please feel free to give me a call
if you need anything before you leave.

543
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,698
I'll help you right away if you call me
directly, and not the front desk.

544
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,994
Is there something in your eye?

545
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,246
-No.
-All right, then.

546
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,800
As expected from the chairman's son.

547
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,886
He's nonchalant.

548
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,888
He's so charming.

549
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,534
Good work.

550
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,827
-Good work.
-Excuse me, sir.

551
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,704
Can you please keep it down?

552
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,790
-What?
-Other guests keep complaining.

553
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,041
Please cooperate with me.

554
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,626
This is my routine.

555
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,961
I apologize, sir.

556
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,338
Ms. Park Bo-yeon?

557
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,800
You have a refreshing way of approach.

558
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,260
-You like me, don't you?
-Pardon?

559
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,553
I'm afraid I have bad news.

560
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,971
You're not my type.

561
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,140
She's my type.

562
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,562
Hey.

563
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,479
Here.

564
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,565
Do I have to deliver your tips to you?

565
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,691
Sorry?

566
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,942
It's from the tiger back.

567
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,320
You're really something.
You're already being tipped.

568
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,157
Tiger?

569
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,012
I noticed you following me around.

570
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,514
I'll accept your cunning advances.

571
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,934
This is for our steamy night together.

572
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,610
What a pervert.

573
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,862
How disgusting.

574
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,247
That darn butt sweat!

575
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,809
Excuse me, sir.

576
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,856
Sir?

577
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,532
Why is this…

578
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,743
Hey--

579
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,128
Sir, do you think I'm a joke
because I wipe people's butt sweat?

580
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,006
That doesn't give people like you,
who have poop for brains,

581
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,259
the right to walk over me.

582
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,511
If you ever do this again,

583
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,221
I'm going to kill you.

584
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,974
Please keep that in mind, Mr. Pervert.

585
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,853
What in the world…

586
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,523
Excuse me. Stop right there.

587
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,359
Did you not hear me?

588
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,278
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

589
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,700
This space is for members
and hotel guests.

590
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,952
Who are you
to raise your voice in my hotel?

591
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,121
It's not your hotel yet.

592
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,581
-What?
-I'm also a guest.

593
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,875
A guest who rooms in a suite at that.

594
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,379
If I file a complaint,
it'll only get uncomfortable for us both.

595
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,590
Why don't you be more polite
to your guest,

596
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,384
Director of King Hotel?

597
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,056
I'll leave as soon as I'm ready.

598
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,520
So please try to treat me
like a guest while I'm here.

599
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,885
Hello, Ms. Gu.

600
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,928
What brings you here without notice?

601
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,055
Am I not allowed here?

602
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,515
Of course not. This entire hotel is yours.

603
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,268
Hello.

604
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,479
How's the work treating you?

605
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,361
It's a bit tough since it's my first time,
but I find pleasure in learning.

606
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,279
Thank you for hiring me.

607
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,405
I will do my best.

608
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,367
-Did you go through all the training?
-Yes.

609
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,202
I received basic training.

610
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,661
What are the deposit precautions?

611
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
I'm sorry.

612
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,832
She's a trainee,
so she hasn't been taught that yet.

613
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,960
The deposit precautions are to check
if the name on the reservation

614
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,670
matches the name on the card

615
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,715
and to check if there's a signature
on the back of the card.

616
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,302
-What is happy hour?
-It is a period during slow hours

617
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,971
in which the price of snacks and drinks

618
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,515
are reduced or served free

619
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,226
in venues such as the lounge
or cocktail bar.

620
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,560
Inform me in English.

621
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,654
Promote her to the lobby.

622
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,739
Pardon?

623
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,584
Excuse me, Ms. Gu.

624
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,878
She graduated from a two-year college.

625
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,713
Why would you leave
a competent girl to rot?

626
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,257
She needs to be seen.

627
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,384
She's a one-month trainee. Are you sure?

628
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,512
-Then let her stay for a year.
-Sorry?

629
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,889
The lobby is the face of the hotel.

630
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,725
She has a nice smile.

631
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,659
Everyone here can speak English
as well as you.

632
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,412
You should be able to speak
at least two foreign languages.

633
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,997
You can't speak Chinese, can you?

634
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,791
From 3 to 5 p.m.,
the hotel lounge will offer

635
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,795
complimentary snacks, coffee, and tea.
Please feel free to enjoy them.

636
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,424
At this rate,
you might even speak Japanese.

637
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,218
From 3 to 5 p.m.,
the hotel lounge will offer

638
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,346
complimentary snacks, coffee, and tea.

639
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,307
Please feel free to enjoy them.

640
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,939
It's always been my dream to become
a concierge, so I studied hard.

641
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,691
Foreign languages aren't everything.

642
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,612
The lobby isn't a place
for someone like you.

643
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,114
"Someone like me," ma'am?

644
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,450
You're uneducated, incompetent…

645
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,786
and unattractive.

646
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,580
Must I spell it out for you?

647
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,624
So don't show off and just do as I say.

648
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:42,583
Do you understand?

649
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,045
Yes, I'll do anything you ask
to the best of my ability.

650
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,755
Thank you.

651
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:12,488
FATHER

652
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,203
You just barged into a guest's room.

653
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,538
It's past your checkout time.

654
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,623
-Get out.
-I will.

655
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,043
You don't have to call Father.
I'll let him know.

656
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,922
The services at this hotel are great.

657
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,507
I'm the owner, after all.

658
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,135
Why don't you just settle down there?

659
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,179
Coming back will only
make things harder for you.

660
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,308
That's for me to decide.

661
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,477
But

662
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,187
I definitely won't be coming back,

663
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,814
so don't worry.

664
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,232
I hope you'll keep your word.

665
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,112
Bye.

666
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,623
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

667
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,708
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

668
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,835
-You now work in the lobby
-You now work in the lobby

669
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,587
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

670
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,968
-Thank you.
-Congrats.

671
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,221
You went from wiping butt sweat
to working in the lobby.

672
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,556
Goodness, I'm so proud of you.

673
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,183
So triumphs the human spirit.

674
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,770
You're the first two-year college graduate
to become King Hotel's full-time employee.

675
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,980
My term has just been extended by a year.

676
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,440
Hence,

677
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,983
the "almost full-time employee."

678
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,903
One year will become two,
and two years will become three.

679
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,073
In a few years,
we'll become cool seniors, right?

680
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,157
Probably.

681
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,828
But where in the world
are those cool seniors?

682
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,914
I'm only surrounded by a bunch
of mothers-in-law on power trips.

683
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,999
We can become cool seniors.

684
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,919
I swear I'm not going to end up
like my seniors.

685
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:14,837
You're right.

686
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,965
Let's not turn into old witches.

687
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,758
I don't want to become like them.

688
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,055
Why are you so quiet?

689
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,141
I don't have any wishes.

690
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,393
I'd be thankful
if no one gets on my nerves.

691
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,020
This won't do.

692
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,023
You need to go to a world
filled with hopes and dreams.

693
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,526
Where might that be?

694
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,653
Club Gold.

695
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,197
I'm a VIP.

696
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,117
Everything is on me tonight!

697
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,411
Come on!

698
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,788
Come on! I need you to be louder!

699
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,373
Let me hear you scream!

700
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,208
Thank you.

701
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,669
Thank you.

702
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,172
KING HOTEL BEST TALENT AWARD
RECIPIENT CHEON SA-RANG

703
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,366
I can't believe you left me

704
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,661
I can't believe you abandoned me

705
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,540
It's hard to forget about
Our deeply-engraved memories…

706
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,926
ACTUAL FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE

707
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,929
Congratulations!

708
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,098
You're finally
an actual full-time employee.

709
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,224
All right.

710
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,892
To your full-time employment.

711
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,020
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

712
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,114
THE PRESENT

713
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,408
GU WON

714
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,602
PERSONNEL RECORD
HAN MI-SO

715
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,116
It's me.

716
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,868
Book a flight to Korea at once.

717
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,911
Korea?

718
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,079
Out of the blue?

719
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,626
Something came up.

720
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,838
But my parents are visiting this week.

721
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,465
Can we go next week?

722
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,341
I'll go first then. You can come later.

723
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,427
No, we need to go together.

724
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,596
We promised
to stick together for eternity.

725
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,055
How long will you stay in Korea?

726
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,390
I don't know.

727
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,225
But I need to know that to pack my things.

728
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,519
You can just buy
your clothes and shoes in Korea,

729
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,104
but I need to take my things.

730
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,107
Okay then. Get packed in ten minutes
and meet me at the airport.

731
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,359
Then will you buy me new clothes
and shoes in Korea?

732
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,069
He hung up.

733
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,154
Sorry.

734
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,635
KING HOTEL CONCIERGE TRAINEESHIP PROGRAM

735
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,055
Congratulations on taking your first step
as a concierge.

736
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,140
I'm Cheon Sa-rang,
who will be in charge of the training.

737
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,772
The fundamental

738
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,067
of a King Hotel employee is
to love and show kindness to our guests.

739
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,028
Welcoming the guests
wholeheartedly comes first,

740
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,405
and expressing it
is the service we offer here.

741
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,159
In other words,
insincere kindness is not true kindness.

742
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,954
We need to be ready

743
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,873
to put on a genuine smile at all times.

744
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,084
Hey!

745
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,256
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

746
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,466
What happened?
What exactly did you do wrong?

747
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,011
-Me?
-What did you do

748
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,056
for a suite guest to come down
to the lobby and look for you?

749
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,599
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

750
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:26,643
No.

751
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,729
I even made a wake-up call this morning.

752
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,689
Hurry over.

753
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,899
Make sure the complaint
doesn't come to my end.

754
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,359
Is that clear?

755
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,318
Yes, ma'am.

756
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,909
You guys can practice smiling.

757
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,619
Hermès!

758
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,871
-Hermès!
-Hermès!

759
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,404
How does it feel to come back
to Korea after a while?

760
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,197
It's the same.

761
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,866
Don't think of leaving again.

762
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,118
Start working.

763
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:51,246
Hotel, Air, or Distribution?
Which do you prefer?

764
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,707
He's just visiting.
You're getting ahead of yourself.

765
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,834
He's not done with his studies either.

766
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,128
It won't be late
even if he takes his time.

767
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,421
Seven years was more than enough.

768
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,257
Since we're on the topic,
move back to Korea.

769
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,261
I'll start working.

770
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,388
What?

771
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,890
But I want to work at the hotel.

772
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,185
What's your reason?

773
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,979
I like hotels.

774
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:18,982
All right.

775
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,025
Go ahead.

776
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,944
Okay. Let's have a drink.

777
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,614
I'm delighted to see
our family gathered like this.

778
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,160
You probably can't even imagine

779
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,620
how long I've waited for this day to come.

780
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,832
Won, you'll need to climb up the ladder
by competing with your sister.

781
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,125
What do you mean?

782
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,628
Won is just now starting out.
I should help him.

783
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,840
Both providing and receiving help
reflect competence.

784
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,384
I'm only going to consider
your competence from now on.

785
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,429
Either one of you
could become my successor,

786
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,889
or it could be neither of you.

787
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,516
I know. That's your management philosophy.

788
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,186
Also,

789
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,521
live here with us
instead of staying at the hotel.

790
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,732
It's more comfortable there.

791
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,068
Won is all grown up now.

792
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,986
Let him do as he pleases.

793
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,323
I'm not going to repeat myself.

794
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,283
Come back home
before your mom's memorial service.

795
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,119
Which mom do you mean?

796
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,250
I don't even know

797
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:23,004
what my mom looks like
or if she's even alive or not.

798
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,391
Stop with the nonsense.

799
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,894
Just move in if I tell you to.

800
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,657
You take after your mom.

801
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,785
You're reckless just like her.

802
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,803
I'll be fine on my own. Go home.

803
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,021
Let me join you. The rain feels nice.

804
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,274
-Don't follow me.
-Whatever.

805
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,359
I know you don't have a friend
to drink with.

806
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,862
I like how you're smart-mouthed.

807
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,989
-True.
-And how you don't force a laugh.

808
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,365
I do though.

809
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,582
What will the starting rank be by the way?

810
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,626
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

811
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,503
What do you mean?

812
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,880
I'm asking for myself.

813
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,756
You got the wrong idea.

814
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,675
I need some authority to protect you.

815
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,470
Who's going to deal
with your toxic personality? I will.

816
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,679
Let me be bold.

817
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,265
Department manager, please.

818
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,684
I went too far, didn't I?

819
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,602
Senior manager?

820
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,112
Take the car and go home.

821
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,199
I'll find my way to the hotel.
Don't follow me.

822
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,242
No, I'm going with you.

823
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,161
I should.

824
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,788
Gosh, the weather

825
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,750
is perfect for me to become a manager.

826
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,251
What kind of weather is that?

827
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,337
Please make me a manager.

828
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,005
-Let go.
-Please.

829
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,965
My goodness!

830
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,675
-Please.
-Why is it raining so hard?

831
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,885
-I know, right?
-Darn it.

832
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,471
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

833
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,187
That's refreshing.

834
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,939
This place has good beer.

835
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,149
Hey, this place
is very popular these days.

836
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,859
There's a line on the weekends.

837
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,820
What's wrong? Are you okay?

838
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,489
My stomach hurts for some reason.

839
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:55,573
Are you stressed?

840
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,575
This usually happens when you're stressed.

841
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,953
It's obviously because of Gong Yu-nam.

842
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,496
Who's that?

843
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,457
Your boyfriend?

844
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,335
Right. You have a boyfriend.

845
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,087
I totally forgot.

846
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,005
That's enough.

847
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,674
Isn't it about time you broke up with him?

848
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,217
I guess he didn't cross the line yet.

849
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,678
She's so lenient
when it comes to her boyfriend.

850
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,180
I'm more lenient with you guys.
Couldn't you tell?

851
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,850
Hey, holding a hot cup of tea

852
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,729
and saying, "It's hot,"
will only burn your hands.

853
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,357
Don't bottle everything up.
Get it off your chest.

854
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,653
Mom! Aunties!

855
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,118
If you drink here,
you'll destroy my reputation.

856
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,536
I worked so hard to build it.

857
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,121
All right, we'll stop drinking.

858
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,331
Go and play, my daughter.

859
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,714
Your daughter is scarier than you.

860
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,883
I know, right? I'm too scared to drink.

861
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,305
I want to dance
under the lights all night long

862
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,849
holding a bottle of beer.

863
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,477
That sounds great, and it really was.

864
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,690
But I forgot how to dance, so I doubt
I'll have as much fun as I used to.

865
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,610
I don't even remember
what a nightclub looks like.

866
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,608
Gosh, my blood pressure.

867
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,761
Do you need to wear a vest?

868
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,096
It seems like a hassle.

869
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:27,183
This is how you should wear a suit.

870
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,184
As expected,

871
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,435
you have a classic style.

872
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,106
When are you going to fix this?

873
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:34,982
Should I get it fixed?

874
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,070
It's okay.

875
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,076
You look amazing today.

876
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,667
It's finally our first day.

877
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,002
Let's start the day with a smile,
Head Manager Gu.

878
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,587
That's what I hate the most.

879
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,005
Faking, putting up a front…

880
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:58,923
Faking a smile.

881
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,510
I was just saying
that you shouldn't feel too stressed

882
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,846
since all of this will be yours one day.

883
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,515
Maybe it's time for you to lose your job
seeing how you're bossing me around.

884
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,518
No one else would stick around you.

885
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,645
You should be grateful to me.

886
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,689
You're consistently impudent.

887
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,857
True.

888
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:19,152
If it wasn't for my impudence,
I would've run away ages ago.

889
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,028
Who else would stay by your side?

890
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,284
-My phone.
-You may head inside.

891
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,202
I'll tell them to bring it.

892
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,709
Congratulations on your first day of work.

893
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:44,427
The papers.

894
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,095
Mr. No.

895
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,765
Mr. No?

896
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,190
Yes.

897
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,109
All right. We'll bring it
to you right away.

898
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,779
Excuse me, Ms. Kim.
I need to use the restroom.

899
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,239
Head straight to the suite, find a phone,

900
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,741
and take it to Ms. Gu's office.

901
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,659
Wait, I'm sorry,

902
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,787
but I have a really bad stomachache.

903
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,371
To the point of crapping on the way?

904
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,082
-Yes.
-In that case,

905
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,418
finish the errand quickly and then go.

906
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,879
But this is urgent.

907
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,006
Exactly. Hurry up and hop to it.

908
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,051
Yes, ma'am.

909
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,307
My phone…

910
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,310
I almost died.

911
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,397
What is this?

912
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,071
The bathroom is bigger than my house.

913
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,407
He only took my phone.

914
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,118
This is so cool.

915
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,708
KING THE LAND

916
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,702
Please welcome Head Manager Gu Won
with a big round of applause.

917
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:41,747
We…

918
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,624
meet again.

919
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,960
Welcome, Head Manager Gu!

920
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,213
We made eye contact again!

921
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,466
I warned you
to never let me see you again.

922
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,677
I'll do my best to avoid you from now on.

923
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,972
You said you'd do your best to avoid me.

924
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,975
Even over my dead body,

925
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,936
you are most definitely not my type.

926
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:15,948
