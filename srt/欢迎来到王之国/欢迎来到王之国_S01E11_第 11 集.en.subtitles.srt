1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,351
I love you, Sa-rang.

3
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,022
I love you too.

4
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,697
I don't want to go back to Korea.

5
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,075
I just want to stay here
for the rest of my life.

6
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,910
-I love Bangkok.
-Is it good?

7
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,411
What about Cho-rong?

8
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,372
She's probably eagerly waiting for you.

9
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,125
You're right, I had a daughter.
I almost forgot.

10
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,628
Cho-rong's mom, what's wrong with you?

11
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,255
Come to your senses.

12
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,506
Okay.

13
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,553
It is pretty sad to leave.

14
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,929
It all feels like a dream.

15
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,390
We can always do this again.

16
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,892
Somewhere even better next time.

17
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,937
Don't forget what you just said.

18
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,691
Okay, I definitely won't, ma'am.

19
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,280
What's the point of traveling together
when everyone just splits up?

20
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,365
Why did I even bother planning this trip,

21
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,491
Mr. No?

22
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,409
He's right.

23
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,661
You crossed the line and upset Mr. Yoo.

24
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,912
You're the best.

25
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,959
So…

26
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,752
that is why

27
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,797
I prepared a final present.

28
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,632
What is it?

29
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,842
It's a secret.

30
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,388
That means there's nothing.

31
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,389
You're right.

32
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,057
Okay. Let's go.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,397
We go hard!

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,610
-We go hard!
-We go hard!

35
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,446
We are…

36
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,323
-One!
-One!

37
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,706
These are our seats?

38
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,084
We all have business-class seats.
This is unreal.

39
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,419
Well of course.

40
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,046
King Group's VIP employees

41
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,255
should sit in VIP seats.

42
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,549
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

43
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,967
Totally. I love it.

44
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,511
Watch your head.

45
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,226
I've always just served
the passengers who sit here.

46
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,645
I never imagined
that I'd get to sit here myself.

47
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,647
I know, right? What is all of this?

48
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,649
I have so much space.

49
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,235
Mr. Yoo, thank you so much.

50
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,153
We'll make sure to increase sales.

51
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,739
Enjoy it to the fullest.
You all deserve it.

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,283
You're the best!

53
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,953
This trip was perfect
from start to finish.

54
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,704
Thank you.

55
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,665
I should be thanking you.

56
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,667
I had fun thanks to you.

57
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,712
Am I allowed to be this happy?

58
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,298
I'll make you even happier in the future.

59
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,736
EPISODE 11

60
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:47,287
The 100th-anniversary event is important
as it can only be held once a century.

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,080
No mistakes are allowed.

62
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,959
The banquet will consist of ten courses.

63
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,919
We'll mainly be in charge of

64
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,672
greeting the important guests
and serving the VVIP tables.

65
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,550
Since we'll be serving VVIPs,

66
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,386
let's provide the best service
under King the Land's name.

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,471
-Okay. We'll do our best.
-Okay. We'll do our best.

68
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,433
Once we receive the guest list,
can you check their information

69
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,435
and make sure we don't miss anything

70
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,020
that needs to be prepared, Ha-na?

71
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,813
Yes, I'll make sure to do that.

72
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,315
I'll tell you if there are any changes.

73
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,941
That's it for today's meeting.

74
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,319
Also, Ms. Best Employee,

75
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,112
did you have a fun trip?

76
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,531
Yes, I enjoyed my time thanks to you.

77
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,616
They chose one employee per subsidiary.

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,162
I'm glad the hotel's best employee
was someone from King the Land.

79
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,079
I'm proud.

80
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,166
Let's work hard
so that the next best employee

81
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,667
gets chosen from King the Land.

82
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,918
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

83
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,004
Ms. Jeon,

84
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,465
this isn't much, but…

85
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,508
-What is this?
-It's a bath bomb.

86
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,011
I heard you take a bubble bath
every night after work.

87
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,721
I picked one with a nice scent.

88
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,932
It's so touching to hear
that you thought of me while traveling.

89
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,018
Thank you. I'll use it well.

90
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,186
All right.

91
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,481
Look at her currying favor.

92
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,441
She only brought something for Ms. Jeon.

93
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,069
This is for you, Du-ri.

94
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,445
This is yours, Se-ho.

95
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,448
This is for you, Da-seok,

96
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,200
and Ne-mo.

97
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,534
This is yours, Ha-na.

98
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,330
You didn't have to buy stuff for us too.

99
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,539
It's really nothing much.

100
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,750
I just thought of you all while shopping.

101
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,461
Also, we're a team.

102
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,798
Thank you. I'll use it well.

103
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,800
-Thank you.
-Thanks so much for this.

104
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,932
This is the hotel's plaque
prepared as a gift for the VIP guests

105
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,101
who will be attending the event.

106
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,311
WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT

107
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,063
It looks better than I expected.

108
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,106
Good work.

109
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,317
I'm glad to hear that you like it.

110
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,820
I planned and prepared it myself.

111
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,322
All right. But is this real gold?

112
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,951
Yes. Following the limits
of the anti-graft law,

113
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,620
I prepared 3 don of pure gold,
which is 11.25 g.

114
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,664
Let's prepare gifts for the employees too.

115
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,874
-For every single one?
-Of course.

116
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,210
Will the hotel be able to afford it?

117
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,796
If it's that burdensome,
we can take out your gift.

118
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,132
It's not burdensome at all.

119
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,716
I love your idea.

120
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,343
If it's for everyone,

121
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,304
I'd recommend
a hotel voucher or a buffet ticket.

122
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,933
Let's put our convenience aside.

123
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,853
Survey what the employees actually want,

124
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,230
and prepare it that way.

125
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,440
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,899
I'll listen to their opinions

127
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,277
and prepare a gift
that will satisfy their wishes.

128
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,654
Good. Thank you.

129
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,210
Mr. Gu?

130
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,508
Mr. Gu?

131
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,727
-Mr. Gu!
-Yes?

132
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,772
Hey.

133
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,650
I called you multiple times,
but you wouldn't respond, sir.

134
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,652
Sorry. I was a little busy with this.

135
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,822
Then what do you think

136
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,908
of working in your office?

137
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,117
No, it's okay.

138
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,244
You're probably busy.
You can go back to work.

139
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,667
I'm asking you because
I can't work properly with you here.

140
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,586
This is not an office.

141
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,796
You shouldn't be acting like this here.

142
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,256
Can't I work here a little?

143
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,300
Of course not.

144
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,218
What?

145
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,803
Who's the boss here?

146
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,305
Get me the boss.

147
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,643
I just want to see your face.

148
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,146
It's hard to make time
in the midst of all my work.

149
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,858
It's nice to be in the same space as you,
even for a short while.

150
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:48,903
Is it just me?

151
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,989
No.

152
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,783
I feel the same way.

153
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,538
Would you like something to drink, sir?

154
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,958
I'll take anything, please.

155
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,880
Since you usually drink tea
rather than coffee in the afternoon,

156
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,258
what do you think of Earl Grey tea?

157
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,929
But how do you know so much about me?

158
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,889
Are you interested in me?

159
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,350
It's my job as a King the Land employee

160
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,102
to remember our guests' preferences.

161
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:25,523
If that's the only reason,
then it's slightly upsetting.

162
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,358
Look who's talking.

163
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,069
You didn't even respond when I called you.

164
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,863
You sure can hold a grudge.

165
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,324
I'm pretty sure I already said sorry.

166
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,286
You said you were upset,
so I just mentioned something as well.

167
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,955
If you're that upset,
why don't we leave together later?

168
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,502
How do we do that
with all these people watching?

169
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,338
There are one, two, three,
four, five, six… Not that many.

170
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,381
That's not a lot.

171
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,924
Did we commit a crime?

172
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,092
Is love a crime?

173
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,598
I just don't want to be
the center of their gossip.

174
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,184
We can leave separately,

175
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,769
then meet up later.

176
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,692
Mr. Gu.

177
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,068
I looked everywhere for you.

178
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,156
Ms. Gu is looking for you.

179
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,657
Rather urgently, if I may add.

180
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,954
The guest list for the
100th-anniversary event isn't finalized.

181
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,373
Yes, it is.
I just need to make a final decision.

182
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,958
What's the difference?

183
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,960
You don't have time to take it easy.

184
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,504
Even the chairman's secretary's office
is asking for the guest list.

185
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,466
I'm not taking it easy.
I'm just trying to be careful.

186
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,259
Then carefully make a quick decision.

187
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,552
And take a look at this.

188
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,347
This is the list of the VIPs
invited to major King Group events

189
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,598
over the past five years.

190
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,559
For your information,
Ms. Gu has mainly invited politicians

191
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,062
such as members of
the National Assembly and the LITC.

192
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:46,979
So?

193
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,106
We should do the same?

194
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,024
No.

195
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,110
As the people
who will be leading King Group,

196
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,238
we should go with a young,
future-oriented, and global image.

197
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,948
That's why I was thinking…

198
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,534
Let's invite popular K-pop idols.

199
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,621
I'll obviously be in charge
of inviting them.

200
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,082
I told you to prepare for the event,

201
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,750
not satisfy your own interests.

202
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,251
I'll take care of the rest.

203
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,253
You can just focus on the rehearsal.

204
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,922
Got it?

205
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,634
I'm counting on you.

206
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,265
"I'm counting on you."

207
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,392
You're cool.

208
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,685
Gosh. "I'm counting on you."

209
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,480
Invite the people on that list.

210
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,192
I asked Assemblyman Park
to give a congratulatory address,

211
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,486
so arrange a section
after the chairman's speech.

212
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,155
I'm in charge of the event.

213
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,032
Just accept my help while it lasts.

214
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,493
It's my responsibility,
so I'll do whatever I want.

215
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,871
When you're in charge,
you can do whatever you want.

216
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,457
You should know when to quit acting up.

217
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,668
The 100th-anniversary event is not a joke.

218
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,421
We'll be presenting
who we'll be working with

219
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,839
for the next 100 years.

220
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,383
We need dignified people to be there.

221
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,890
Politicians, high-ranking officials
from the Ministry of Finance…

222
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,561
I guess you want to
create a future with these people.

223
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,439
They are valuable people
for all of King Group's subsidiaries.

224
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,066
I don't want to create anything
with these people.

225
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,527
Success attained by mooching off
of those with power

226
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,737
will crumble in front of power
no matter what.

227
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,448
You know that.

228
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,491
Then what kind of future
will you make with whom?

229
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,254
There's a saying that the moment
you forget about the people

230
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,840
who helped you along the way
is the moment of your fall.

231
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,969
That means the next 100 years

232
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:46,348
should be created with the people
who helped build up this hotel.

233
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,226
It must be fun playing the hero.

234
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,271
You even gave the employees
business-class seats kept for executives

235
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,523
and tried so hard to win their favor.

236
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,442
Do you think you'll become something

237
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,736
if you have them on your side?

238
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,446
I wasn't trying to win their favor.

239
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,114
I just did the obvious.

240
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,450
Whether an executive or an employee,

241
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,494
anyone who works hard for the company

242
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,038
will receive the same treatment.

243
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,457
-Who are you to do that?
-Me?

244
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,750
Someone with a conscience.

245
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,127
At the very least,

246
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,671
the company shouldn't be stabbing
its employees in the back.

247
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,131
Don't you think?

248
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,722
Do you really think
all people are the same?

249
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,685
Even though all balloons look the same,

250
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,439
some float up and some fall down.

251
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,026
What differentiates them

252
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,862
is their blood.

253
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,241
They may look the same, but they're not.

254
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,452
Because they have different genes.

255
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,664
Just like you and me.

256
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,589
How am I different?

257
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,974
Just live without knowing.

258
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,478
That's your fate.

259
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,780
ALANGA SALES TARGET

260
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,827
This is our new target.

261
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,246
Calculate the sales on a daily basis

262
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,915
and give me a report
when you clock out every day.

263
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,960
The target amount is too high.

264
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,712
So you can't do it?

265
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,256
No, we can't.

266
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,427
Our original goal of a 10% increase
compared to last month is already so high.

267
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,887
All right.

268
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,889
Then I'll report to headquarters

269
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,932
about a personnel reduction here.

270
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,852
Sorry? A personnel reduction?

271
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,228
Sales may be increasing,

272
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,439
but so are the rent
and incidental expenses.

273
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,399
Alanga is in the red.

274
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,235
With the current sales,

275
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,237
we can't keep everyone.

276
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,615
So after this month…

277
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,325
MIN YU-BIN

278
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,326
…fire the junior member.

279
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,412
All of a sudden?

280
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,957
That's why I gave you a solution.

281
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,877
But you rejected it.

282
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,295
Well, then.

283
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,714
Wait. I'll do it.

284
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,841
We can do it.

285
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,593
You should've said that earlier.

286
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,845
How peaceful and nice is it now?

287
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,472
I'm an advocate of peace.

288
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,271
By the way,

289
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,776
you should treat the rest of us
to an expensive meal.

290
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,152
Why?

291
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,987
It was thanks to me
that you went to Bangkok.

292
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,197
Did you forget?

293
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,616
It wasn't thanks to you, Ms. Do.

294
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,451
It was a result of my own efforts.

295
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,079
Who gave you the motivation?

296
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,498
Thanks to me,
who encouraged you to work harder,

297
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,126
you achieved record-high sales
and got chosen as the best employee.

298
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,840
I heard omakase dining
is the trend these days.

299
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,802
Make a reservation for next week.

300
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,886
Then,

301
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,596
I'll be leaving to work offsite.

302
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,101
It is a Mediterranean appetizer dish
made with natural oysters

303
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,310
from the west coast.

304
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,397
I used fennel to give it a fresh flavor.

305
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,316
It's fresh. It'd make a good appetizer.

306
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,569
For the main course,

307
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,364
we prepared prime beef tenderloin
with a marbling score of nine

308
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,575
from free-range, organic cows

309
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,452
from an animal welfare farm.

310
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,039
Great.

311
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,790
Overall, everything looks excellent.

312
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,751
Thank you for your hard work.

313
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,252
Thank you, sir.

314
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,422
Starting three months ago,
head chefs from each restaurant

315
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,799
have worked together
using the best ingredients.

316
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,177
There will be some elderly guests.

317
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,888
I'd like to add some dishes
that are easy to digest.

318
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,975
Also, what do you think of preparing
a separate full-course meal

319
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,019
for people who prefer Korean food,

320
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,063
so that they can choose?

321
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,273
Understood.

322
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,108
I'll discuss it with the others
and have it prepared.

323
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,402
All right. Thank you.

324
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,699
I'll take the steak. Thank you.

325
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,415
So you failed to get promoted again.

326
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,667
Mind your own business.

327
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,505
What's the point of working your ass off?

328
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,215
Learn from Mi-na.

329
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,593
She buys presents for her boss
and even helps her family make kimchi.

330
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,470
Who wouldn't adore her?

331
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,889
Let's go for a consolation drink.

332
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,225
-No thanks.
-All right then.

333
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,643
Suit yourself.

334
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,394
Ms. Yoo.

335
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,395
Yes?

336
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,357
Why don't we go somewhere nice

337
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,776
and have some drinks
to celebrate Mi-na's promotion?

338
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,153
That sounds great.

339
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,823
Then will it be on you?

340
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,158
I will pay for your drink, Ms. Yoo.

341
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,995
Okay, let's go. You all heard him, right?

342
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,914
Yes, I'd love to go.

343
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,166
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I can join you all.

344
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,251
What?

345
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,799
Ro-un, we have to listen to
whatever the captain says.

346
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,175
I have plans.

347
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,345
All of us had plans as well.

348
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,889
No, it's okay.

349
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,891
We can't make things mandatory these days.

350
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,560
It's okay, right?

351
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,353
Well of course.

352
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,147
Go ahead. Get out of here.

353
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,440
I'm a flexible person, you know.

354
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,693
You're the best, Mr. No.

355
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,070
All right. Then please excuse me.

356
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,450
Let's go, Pyeong-hwa.

357
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:21,910
What?

358
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,788
What are you doing, Ro-un?

359
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,707
I had plans with Pyeong-hwa.

360
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,293
Then we'll be leaving first.

361
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,128
Let's go.

362
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,555
I'll get going then.

363
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,265
I hope you have a fun time.

364
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,522
Then I'll also leave if that's okay.

365
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,276
I was pretty tired.
Thank you for your consideration.

366
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,535
I can't believe this.

367
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,125
Did we have plans tonight?

368
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,002
Yes.

369
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,881
I was planning on coming here with you.

370
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,050
Our time in Bangkok was too short.

371
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,427
Isn't it nice here?

372
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,144
If the captain says so,
we all have to attend no matter what.

373
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,521
Aren't you even worried about tomorrow?

374
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,524
Tomorrow will take care of itself.

375
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,736
Today, I just like being here with you.

376
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,956
By any chance…

377
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,501
do you like me?

378
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,887
Yes.

379
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,806
I like you.

380
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,650
I'm sorry,

381
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,362
but I don't think
I can accept your feelings.

382
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,325
It's okay.

383
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,787
I just answered your question
because you asked.

384
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,543
You can do whatever you want.

385
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,963
I'll do what my heart tells me to do.

386
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,354
You can go around this way
to go to the main building.

387
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,856
-Goodbye.
-All right. Thank you.

388
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,194
-Sir.
-Mr. Gu.

389
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,989
Do you have a few minutes?

390
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,532
I'm sorry,

391
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,784
but an important guest
will be arriving soon,

392
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,453
so I can't leave.

393
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,580
It won't take long.

394
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,123
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

395
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,418
I have to greet this guest myself.

396
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,297
Then I'll be waiting at King the Land.

397
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,841
-Yes, sir. I'll be with you shortly.
-Okay.

398
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,973
Welcome. I was waiting for you.

399
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,016
How have you been?

400
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,685
I've been doing well thanks to you.

401
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,395
Right this way.

402
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,616
I'm sorry for making you wait.

403
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,451
No, I'm the one
who made the sudden request.

404
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,702
-Please sit.
-Okay.

405
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,997
What would you like to drink?

406
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,625
May I have a hot cup of tea?

407
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,667
Yes, sir.

408
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,377
I'll take the same thing.

409
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,504
All right.

410
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,632
You've been working here
for over seven years, right?

411
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,510
Both then and now,
you have a pretty smile.

412
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,762
How do you know how long I've worked here?

413
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,389
Because I'm the doorkeeper of this hotel.

414
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,558
You're right.

415
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,978
It's a pleasure to see you here, sir.

416
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,564
I'll get the tea prepared right away.

417
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,237
Who was the lady from earlier?

418
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,949
She visits the hotel once a month
around this hour

419
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,410
to eat a bowl of beef bone soup.

420
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,789
She used to come with her husband.

421
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,126
After he passed, she still comes alone.

422
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,921
I thought she would feel less lonely

423
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,923
if I waited for her in his stead.

424
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:50,679
The more I get to know the hotel staff,
the more I come to respect you all.

425
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,806
I think you're truly amazing.

426
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,932
No, I'm not.

427
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,226
I do this because I enjoy it.

428
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,690
I hear you have worked here
the longest among all the staff.

429
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,484
You've stayed with us for a long time,

430
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,571
so I wanted to meet you
and have a conversation with you.

431
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,699
I don't know if I'll be of any help.

432
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:18,498
Is there a guest
that you remember the most?

433
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,462
There is a large tree
by the main entrance of the hotel.

434
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,758
It was donated by someone
who was a charter member.

435
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,220
He also helped the hotel a lot
when it was in crisis.

436
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,681
After he passed away,

437
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,975
his son made frequent visits to the hotel,

438
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,561
but I haven't seen him recently.

439
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,815
If I get the chance,
I'd like to greet him as a guest again.

440
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,942
So there was someone like that.

441
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,153
I had no idea.

442
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,240
Was it always your dream
to work at a hotel?

443
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,283
No.

444
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,078
I just chased happiness

445
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,372
and ended up here.

446
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:01,958
So…

447
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,086
did you find happiness?

448
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,725
Thank you for your time.

449
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,479
Take care.

450
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,986
Why did you bow so politely?

451
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,738
-I was shocked.
-The rehearsal.

452
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,782
-Is everything ready?
-Yes, sir.

453
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,866
Shall we?

454
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,602
Keep the plates straight.

455
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,437
Don't let them tilt.

456
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,189
Check your entrance and exit routes

457
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,275
so that the food can be served smoothly.

458
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,652
We must not exceed our allotted time.

459
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,237
They're so cool.

460
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,980
Are the rehearsals
usually performed to this extent?

461
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,773
All the banquets held at King Hotel

462
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,026
are rehearsed the day before the event.

463
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,988
Since this particular event
involves serving VVIP guests,

464
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,740
we are rehearsing in greater detail.

465
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,492
Everyone is doing a lot more
than I expected.

466
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,661
Please keep it up until the end.

467
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,620
Yes, sir.

468
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,290
We will serve each guest
with our utmost sincerity.

469
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,374
Thank you.

470
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,482
Wait! Hold on.

471
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,651
-It's me.
-You scared me.

472
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,028
Are you okay?

473
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,364
-Do I look okay?
-My goodness.

474
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,241
How are you so strong?

475
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,077
My stomach.

476
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,329
Why did you suddenly hug me from behind?

477
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,622
You startled me.

478
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,290
I was trying to surprise you.

479
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,043
Though I didn't know
you'd be so excited to see me.

480
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,962
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

481
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,757
I won't have to worry about you
walking alone at night.

482
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,094
Did you take boxing lessons as a kid?

483
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,891
This sound isn't coming from my mouth.

484
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,602
It's coming from my punches.

485
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,271
Are you having fun?

486
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,275
I never lost to anyone
ever since I was little.

487
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,152
I bet.

488
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,157
Is it that painful?

489
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,785
Oh no.

490
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,078
Are you okay?

491
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,249
Goodness.

492
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,376
Oh no.

493
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,962
It hurts.

494
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,964
Do you need to go to the hospital?

495
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,048
Should we go?

496
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,426
It hurts.

497
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,219
This feels nice.

498
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,811
You can't do this here.

499
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,355
I need to recharge.

500
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,524
Today was so exhausting.

501
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,859
I'm running out of energy.

502
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,741
Can you plug in a charger here?

503
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,078
I need to recharge.

504
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,127
There.

505
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,380
I'm afraid someone might see us.

506
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,174
I'm at 1% now.

507
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,468
Just 1%?

508
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,178
Yes, please charge me.

509
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,142
Please.

510
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,560
I'm at 5%. Now 10%.

511
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,562
That's far from enough.

512
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,232
Charge, please.

513
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,695
I'm at 15, 25, 30%.

514
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,911
100%. I'm fully charged.

515
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,704
Gosh, you're so silly.

516
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,503
Oh my god.

517
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,213
-Oh my goodness.
-What?

518
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,049
-Hide.
-Why?

519
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,592
What's wrong with you?

520
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,676
Oh no.

521
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,929
They're King Hotel employees.

522
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:06,930
-Get up.
-But where?

523
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,890
-Hold on. Where?
-The bus.

524
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,183
-The bus.
-Hurry.

525
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,978
-That gave me a fright.
-You're employees, yes?

526
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,355
"Employees"?

527
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,191
Hello, Mr. Gu!

528
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,778
-Hello, Mr. Gu!
-Hello, Mr. Gu!

529
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,739
-Hello, Mr. Gu!
-Hello, Mr. Gu!

530
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,449
-Hello, Mr. Gu!
-Hello, Mr. Gu!

531
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,828
Hello, Mr. Gu.

532
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,788
KING HOTEL SHUTTLE BUS

533
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,713
Mr. Gu,

534
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:45,385
this is the shuttle bus that helps
King Hotel employees commute

535
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,803
to and from work.

536
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,473
The hotel has three shifts,

537
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:54,143
so the bus operates
six different times throughout the day.

538
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,146
We enjoy a lot of employee perks,

539
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,315
but I believe this shuttle bus

540
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,943
is what the employees need most.

541
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,737
Thank you very much.

542
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,906
Thank you!

543
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,492
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

544
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,037
-Thank you!
-Say goodbye now.

545
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,498
Smile and wave goodbye.

546
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm very thankful as well.

547
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,711
-Please keep up the good work.
-We love you!

548
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,837
Okay.

549
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,880
Get home safely.

550
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,715
Mr. Gu will now get off.

551
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,341
Get home safely.

552
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,718
Goodbye.

553
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,094
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

554
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,762
Mr. Gu, you're the best!

555
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,139
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

556
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,223
You're the best!

557
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,365
-That was so funny.
-Jeez.

558
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,118
We went out of the frying pan
into the fryer.

559
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,704
How did you come up with that on the spot?

560
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,873
My mind went completely blank.

561
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:57,916
I don't know either.

562
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,751
I had to ride it out somehow.

563
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,462
No secrets are forever.

564
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,006
We should still be careful.

565
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,676
Why?

566
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,346
Because I'm the chairman's son?

567
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,847
If I were worried about that,

568
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,599
I wouldn't have dated you
in the first place.

569
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,645
But how did you find this place?

570
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,730
Well,

571
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,525
you seemed to like the moon in Bangkok,
so I ran a search.

572
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,821
Apparently, this river has the most moons.

573
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,909
It's beautiful.

574
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,078
Is it?

575
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,538
Should we go down and walk?

576
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,712
By the way,

577
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,216
why did you meet the doorman earlier?

578
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,969
It was for the event.

579
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,346
I heard he was with the hotel the longest,

580
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,764
so I wanted to talk to him.

581
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,433
I heard he worked here for over 30 years.

582
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,852
He's living proof of King Hotel's history.

583
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,813
Yes, that's what I heard too.

584
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,651
By any chance…

585
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,614
did you ask him?

586
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,574
About what?

587
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,953
About your mom.

588
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,372
I'm sure he'd know.

589
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,458
Why bother?

590
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:24,961
"Why bother?"

591
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,713
There's no point in asking him.

592
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,632
The answer is obvious.

593
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,300
Where's my mom?

594
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,137
She wasn't here yesterday,
and she's not here today.

595
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,930
Please get up.

596
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,807
The chairman is waiting.

597
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,018
Whenever I asked something,

598
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,855
everyone kept their mouth shut
and hid the truth from me even more.

599
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,899
It felt as if the traces
that I'd just barely found

600
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,192
were all being erased.

601
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,697
But still,

602
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,907
he could be the one to tell you.

603
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,326
It's okay.

604
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,372
It was a matter
that I had to solve on my own anyway.

605
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,415
Also,

606
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,126
I decided

607
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,462
to put an end to my quest.

608
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,531
You're home.

609
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,866
Hurry up and sit.

610
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,409
What's all this?

611
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,999
All right.

612
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,672
It's good.

613
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,720
The sauce tastes just right.

614
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,764
Hey Sa-rang,

615
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,848
did Mr. No

616
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,308
do it yet?

617
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,437
-Do what?
-What do you think?

618
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,396
Ask you out.

619
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,193
No, we don't like each other.

620
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,695
Why not? What's wrong with Mr. No?

621
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,281
I'd say he's a pretty decent man.

622
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,242
It's nothing like that.

623
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,285
If not, why did you two
run away in Thailand

624
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,453
and make Mr. Yoo upset?

625
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,665
I think I need to wash up first.

626
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,958
You guys go ahead.

627
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,961
Gosh, it's so hot.
I can't eat because it's so hot.

628
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,547
Why does she feel hot all of a sudden?

629
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,889
So I'm suggesting that we co-host

630
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,725
the 100th-anniversary event
as staff representatives.

631
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,562
I thought you didn't like me.

632
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,481
That's correct.
But I have to put personal feelings aside.

633
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,401
You did a great job
during the inaugural ceremony.

634
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,320
It's only natural for me

635
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,365
to host the big event
as a staff representative,

636
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,075
but not with you.

637
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,493
I'm out of your league.

638
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,580
What a shame.

639
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,915
It would be nice if you were kind-hearted.

640
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,002
Why do you care
whether I'm kind-hearted or not?

641
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,462
I just think it's a pity.

642
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,922
You're exceptionally beautiful

643
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,216
and competent enough
to have become the youngest manager.

644
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,846
I just don't understand why you would
keep making a mockery of yourself.

645
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,016
-Is that an insult or a compliment?
-An insult.

646
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,313
Well, I'm not too keen on your offer,

647
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,107
but since you're begging me,
I'll lend you a helping hand

648
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,067
as King Hotel's most competent employee.

649
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,988
Yes, please help me.

650
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,706
I hope we get along.

651
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,185
I must be insane.

652
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,937
Why would I fall for a guy like him?

653
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,175
Why are you…

654
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,348
Does it hurt a lot?

655
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,308
Well of course it does.

656
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,768
You hit me with steel.

657
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,852
Goodness.

658
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:56,482
You shouldn't have snuck in
like a thief without telling me.

659
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,734
I just…

660
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,529
I came to give you these gifts.

661
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,532
And last time,
I noticed the water pressure was low,

662
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,160
so I was trying to fix the sink
while I was waiting.

663
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,996
Then you should've told me.

664
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,582
You didn't give me a chance to.

665
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,710
Hold on.

666
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,752
Come to think of it,

667
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,715
you and your granddaughter are so similar.

668
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,967
Your fist moves before your mouth.

669
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,635
Of course. She's my baby.

670
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,596
Do you know why she's so pretty?

671
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,017
It's because she takes after me.

672
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,020
But what is all of that?

673
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,021
These?

674
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,774
You know how Sa-rang went to Thailand
after being chosen as the best employee?

675
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,904
Thailand is known for its silk.

676
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,906
And this was made from its finest.

677
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,077
I don't have anywhere to wear this.

678
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,331
Why did you spend your money
on something like this?

679
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,373
Do you have money to burn?

680
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,835
From now on, you can travel a lot.

681
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,130
I'll take you to many places.

682
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,842
Let's see.

683
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,099
If you'll excuse me.

684
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,814
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

685
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,193
-Oh, I don't know…
-Here.

686
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,696
Yes, it is pretty.

687
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:30,159
Well, I guess I do look good
no matter what I wear.

688
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,913
It's thanks to my good fashion sense.

689
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,873
Hold on a second.

690
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,549
This is a magical cream
that smooths out all the wrinkles

691
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,009
on your face.

692
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,260
And…

693
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,222
this is called Tiger Balm.

694
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,517
It's good for any aches or pains.

695
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,477
It also soothes headaches.

696
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,770
What?

697
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,022
Then is it a cure-all?

698
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,108
Yes, it's the best remedy for the elderly.

699
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,109
I see.

700
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,654
How much did you buy?

701
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,781
You could run a store with all of that.

702
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,366
Goodness.

703
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,743
You can share these
with your market friends.

704
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,911
I…

705
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,580
just bought a little.

706
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,834
I can't believe
you thought of my friends too.

707
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,460
How sweet of you.

708
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:27,091
Last time, your friends gave me
vegetable juice and yogurt drinks.

709
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:31,887
Hey,

710
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,099
just be a good son to your father.

711
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,977
Did you buy a gift for your father?

712
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,191
No.

713
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,192
Good grief.

714
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,195
What's the point of having kids?

715
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,155
Jeez.

716
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,614
Give this to your father.

717
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,998
All right.

718
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,542
Did you eat?

719
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,254
Not yet.

720
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,256
-Ms. Cha.
-Yes?

721
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,340
Here's the ginseng chicken soup.

722
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,800
Goodness. Just in time.

723
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,264
Sa-rang told me

724
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:21,395
that you raised her all by yourself
ever since she was little.

725
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,356
I didn't do much.

726
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,066
She grew well on her own.

727
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,948
She never once threw a tantrum
even though she lived apart from her mom.

728
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,159
She kept everything bottled up,

729
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,620
and when she acted
like a baby for the first time,

730
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,373
saying she wanted to live with her,
her mom got into an accident.

731
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,086
I think that's why

732
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,798
she's never asked me
to do anything for her.

733
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,261
From now on,

734
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,348
I'll stay by her side
and let her throw tantrums

735
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,184
and act like a baby.

736
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:06,023
You can always rely on me
to protect both you and Sa-rang.

737
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,733
I'm okay.

738
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,362
Just treat Sa-rang well, okay?

739
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,989
I'll treat you both well.

740
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,408
Thank you

741
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,995
for raising Sa-rang
to be such a beautiful person.

742
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,252
Here. I cooked it for a while
to make it tender.

743
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,003
-Try it.
-Thank you.

744
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,880
Let's see how it tastes.

745
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,507
-Here.
-Yes.

746
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,675
-Take it.
-Thank you.

747
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,176
Sure. Eat up.

748
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,386
Thank you.

749
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,206
Sir.

750
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,083
Hello.

751
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,586
I know this is sudden,

752
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,380
but may I ask you something?

753
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,340
Yes, go ahead.

754
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,510
I was wondering

755
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,722
if you knew someone
who used to work here long ago.

756
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,184
Do you know a person
by the name of Han Mi-so?

757
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:26,937
I do.

758
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:32,776
Then do you know her contact information
or where she may be right now?

759
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,530
I know who she is,

760
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,032
but that's about it.

761
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,994
I see.

762
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,330
Thank you for your time.

763
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,500
But I have a friend

764
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,504
who might remember more than I do.

765
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,522
Hello.

766
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:15,486
May I ask if you're Ms. Kim Ok-ja,
the room inspector?

767
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:16,904
What are you doing?

768
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,822
How dare you step into the room

769
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,240
with your shoes on?

770
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,409
Get out.

771
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,454
I'm sorry.

772
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:28,374
Hotel rooms are products
prepared for the guests.

773
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,335
How dare a concierge
step on a guest's product?

774
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,836
You don't know the basics.

775
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,797
I'm sorry.

776
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,924
I wanted to ask you something.

777
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,344
Whatever it is, I don't want to talk
to someone who lacks common sense.

778
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,387
Goodbye.

779
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,352
I apologize for the discourtesy.

780
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,188
I'll visit you again at another time.

781
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,850
Are you going to leave Won be?

782
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,228
He finally set his mind to something.

783
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,938
I should let him.

784
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,273
It's an important event.

785
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,193
When you first launched Alanga,

786
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,154
all the executives were against it.

787
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,365
But do you know why I let you?

788
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,617
I was giving you a chance.

789
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,455
Won should also be given
a chance for it to be fair.

790
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,832
Alanga's success was guaranteed.

791
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,544
What Won is doing
will obviously lead to failure.

792
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,670
If he fails,

793
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,214
I'll hold him responsible then.

794
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,592
Now is not the time to intervene.

795
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,851
Won acts

796
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,062
so much like his mom.

797
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,856
Don't you agree?

798
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,821
I'm worried about how much you'll suffer
if you have to abandon him

799
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,616
just like you abandoned his mom.

800
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,332
You're all grown up.

801
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,043
You're even worrying about me now.

802
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,300
You're home.

803
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,094
Yes.

804
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,971
Get some rest.

805
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:46,905
What is it?

806
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,448
Do you have something to say?

807
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,409
No.

808
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,204
Are my opinions not important

809
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,540
in planning for the big event?

810
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,677
There was something I wanted to ask.

811
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,556
And what is that?

812
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,975
Is the King Hotel of today

813
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,730
the hotel that you wanted it to be?

814
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,445
It was my dream

815
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,781
for everyone who came to King Hotel

816
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,534
to be happy.

817
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:37,331
Everyone including the guests
and the employees.

818
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,002
However,

819
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,130
a dream is just a dream.

820
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,427
Did you ever try to make it come true?

821
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,350
My employees' lives
and the lives of their families

822
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,186
depend on my decisions.

823
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,981
I believe the hotel has lasted 100 years

824
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,526
because I never made
any reckless attempts.

825
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,614
I have no regrets.

826
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,951
I was able to protect King Hotel
in exchange for my dream,

827
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,038
and I also built King Air
and King Distribution.

828
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,167
That's good to hear.

829
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:23,919
I…

830
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,923
was worried that you never had a dream.

831
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,892
I know what it is that you want to do.

832
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,228
I know what you desire too.

833
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,063
But

834
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,856
don't do it.

835
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,235
I'm being serious. This is a warning.

836
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:49,945
Do you understand?

837
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,571
-Father--
-If it's hard,

838
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,323
ask your sister for help.

839
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,618
Asking for help is a skill.

840
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,375
It's Tiger Balm.

841
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,585
Apply it to alleviate any type of pain.

842
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,769
Today is finally here.

843
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,688
It's going to be the best party ever,

844
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:07,689
so don't be nervous.

845
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,815
There's no need to be.

846
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,984
We've done well so far,

847
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,903
and everything will continue to go well.

848
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:13,987
No need to be nervous.

849
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,615
We've rehearsed enough.

850
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,242
It's going to be the best party
without a hitch.

851
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,160
So don't worry.

852
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,496
You can just count on me.

853
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,416
Why are you trembling?

854
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,501
Me?

855
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,920
What are you talking about?

856
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,546
I'm not the type to get nervous.

857
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,798
You know that.

858
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,716
I wasn't trembling.

859
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,552
I don't think so.

860
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,262
You're so nervous.

861
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,264
No, I'm not.

862
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,349
Why are you sweating?

863
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,100
I'm sweating?

864
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,104
Don't be nervous.

865
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,607
-It's a party.
-Yes.

866
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,570
-Have fun.
-Okay.

867
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,322
Drink some water.

868
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,032
-And breathe.
-Yes, sir.

869
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,328
You're super nervous.

870
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,454
Good luck!

871
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,492
2023 KING HOTEL
100TH-ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION

872

873

WORDS OF WELCOME AND ENCOURAGEMENT
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

874
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,002
Goodness.

875
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:53,962
Thank you.

876
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,051
I thought we were doing
something important.

877
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,470
-This is it?
-What do you mean?

878
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,348
We're greeting the guests
of our hotel's 100th birthday party.

879
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,850
This is the most important role.

880
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,483
Something like this
may be important to you,

881
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,943
but it isn't for me.

882
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,155
The host is the first person
to greet the guests.

883
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,032
At least for today,

884
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,618
we are the hosts of this party.

885
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,206
Just wipe your sweat.

886
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,417
You acted so cool,
but you're a nervous wreck.

887
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,377
I don't get nervous. Where's the sweat?

888
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,754
Oh, there it is.

889
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,012
Do you like me?

890
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,062

KING HOTEL
MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

893
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,288
Happy 100th anniversary to King Hotel.

894
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,092
Hello,

895
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,219
I am King Hotel's head manager, Gu Won.

896
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:10,348
I would like to sincerely thank
all of the honored guests

897
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,268
for attending King Hotel's
100th-anniversary event.

898
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,853
In addition,

899
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,690
I'd like to express
my bottomless gratitude

900
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:21,484
to all the employees
who are working diligently

901
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,988
behind the scenes even now

902
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,491
in order to make this event shine.

903
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,578
Then,

904
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,205
we will start the ceremony

905
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,207
with Chairman Gu Il-hun's
congratulatory address.

906
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,307
Hello,

907
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,476
I am Gu Il-hun.

908
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,936
In preparation
for my congratulatory address,

909
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,064
I contacted a speech expert.

910
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,609
I told the expert that I wanted to deliver

911
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,779
a historic speech
for the hotel's 100th-anniversary event,

912
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,615
and I sought an expert's advice.

913
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,868
I was given an unequivocal answer.

914
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,413
"Just make it short."

915
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,091
What? Did someone arrive?

916
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,967
I wonder what's so funny.

917
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,804
We never get to watch the event.

918
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,722
We're always just running around.

919
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,850
But this time,
I feel like we're the stars of the event.

920
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:39,354
It feels like I'm serving guests
for a party at my house.

921
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,355
You're right.

922
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,649
This only happens once every 100 years.

923
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,610
Let's finish strong
on behalf of King the Land.

924
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,903
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

925
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,988
Sa-rang, you're up next, right?

926
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,533
Yes. I'll be right back.

927
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,867
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

928
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,133
I hope the past 100 years

929
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,554
will be able to shape
the next 100 years of the hotel.

930
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,389
Also,

931
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,726
for the 200th-anniversary event,

932
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,522
I will try to prepare
an even shorter message.

933
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,606
Thank you.

934
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,786
-I liked your speech.
-Thanks.

935
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,288
Thank you.

936
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,713
Next up, we have a special guest

937
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,923
who will deliver a congratulatory address.

938
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,175
It's your turn, Mr. Park.

939
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,385
-You'll do great.
-Of course.

940
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,929
It was not easy to invite this person.

941
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,809
I would like to thank you
on behalf of the hotel's executives.

942
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:04,189
Mr. Choi Yeong-su,
could you please come forward?

943
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,540
What is this?

944
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,923
Thank you for coming.

945
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,300
I hope I'm not disrupting the event.

946
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,927
You're the guest of honor.

947
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,011
Please.

948
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,648
Hello,

949
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,025
my name is Choi Yeong-su.

950
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:53,613
I own a small pizza shop in Daejeon.

951
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,949
To be honest,

952
00:58:56,032 --> 00:59:00,119
I'm not exactly sure
why I was invited to this event.

953
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,163
I think it may be

954
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,541
because of my father.

955
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:09,420
My father was a charter member
of King Hotel's membership club.

956
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,465
I believe my father was the one

957
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,884
who planted the tree
in front of the hotel.

958
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,846
When I was little,
I came here a lot with my father.

959
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:22,850
To me, King Hotel was the best playground.

960
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:28,064
I remember the CEO of the hotel
being very loving.

961
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,985
But once my father's business
started to decline,

962
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,279
I never got to come back here.

963
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,574
Since I've been busy making ends meet,

964
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,410
I noticed that I've started to lose hope

965
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,704
and that I give up more easily.

966
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,539
However,

967
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:49,002
coming back here makes me dream.

968
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,296
Next Christmas,

969
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,215
I plan on visiting King Hotel
with my family.

970
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,595
Until then, I'm going to work really hard.

971
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,141
Also, I would like to sincerely thank

972
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,643
Head Manager Gu Won
for coming all the way to Daejeon

973
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,855
to invite a nobody like me to this event.

974
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,231
And…

975
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,443
How should I end this?

976
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,402
Well…

977
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,322
May King Hotel prosper!

978
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,705
Thank you.

979
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,250
-You may go this way.
-Hey, so you're Yeong-su.

980
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,212
Right? Mr. Choi Jang-su's eldest son.

981
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,672
Do you remember me?

982
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,674
How could I forget you?

983
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,927
I received so much help from your father.
I owe him a lot.

984
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,931
I'm sorry that I was unaware.

985
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,475
You're always welcome.

986
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:49,103
The rooms and restaurants
will always be reserved for you.

987
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,689
Make sure you come with your family. Okay?

988
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,484
Have a seat.

989
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,529
He's Choi Jang-su's son.

990
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,739
Can you believe it?

991
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,450
It is said

992
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:06,245
that flowers don't forget
about the person who watered them.

993
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,248
While planning for this event,

994
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,334
I continued to keep that saying in mind.

995
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:16,297
The people who helped create
the first 100 years of King Hotel

996
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:20,426
and the people who will be creating
the next 100 years are all here together.

997
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:26,015
I would now like to introduce you all
to the VIP of VIPs.

998
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,226
I'm sorry for the confusion.

999
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:29,811
I look forward to your speech.

1000
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,940
The deep-rooted tree of King Hotel.

1001
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,276
I now introduce you to Mr. Kim Bong-sik.

1002
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,095
Hello.

1003
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,388
I am

1004
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,016
King Hotel's doorman, Kim Bong-sik.

1005
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,108
You were a salesman
for a pharmaceutical company?

1006
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:18,860
That's right.

1007
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,822
I usually treated my clients
at King Hotel's bar.

1008
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,241
At times, I would have to drink
three times a day

1009
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,369
during lunch, dinner,
and even late at night.

1010
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,372
But one day,

1011
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,416
I got so drunk

1012
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:37,503
that I fell asleep
on a sofa in the hotel lobby,

1013
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,255
and when I woke up in the morning,

1014
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,381
I witnessed

1015
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,925
a completely different world.

1016
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:48,055
All of the employees were working
with smiles on their faces.

1017
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:55,021
It made me wonder
why everyone looked so happy.

1018
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,607
That's when I started to dream.

1019
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,735
I thought I would be able to live

1020
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,362
with a smile on my face if I worked here.

1021
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:07,366
So I started working here.

1022
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:15,124
Do you think you could repeat
what you just said during our event?

1023
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,709
What event, sir?

1024
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,544
The 100th-anniversary event.

1025
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,630
That's absurd.

1026
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,632
That's not a place for me.

1027
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:24,926
Please, sir.

1028
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,928
Why are you doing this?

1029
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,971
You're the doorkeeper of our hotel.

1030
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,726
You looked after King Hotel for 30 years.

1031
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,230
Please grace the occasion
with your presence.

1032
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:39,857
Are you being serious?

1033
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,609
Please share your dream

1034
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,363
with me as well.

1035
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,282
Coming to King Hotel,

1036
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,910
I achieved my dream.

1037
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:55,832
Most of my time at work
is spent outside of the hotel,

1038
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:02,046
but I am the proud doorkeeper
of King Hotel,

1039
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,299
Kim Bong-sik.

1040
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:15,059
HOTEL LOWER LEVEL 1

1041
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:20,439
Hello.

1042
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:32,159
Are those the lights that were used
in our hotel 20 years ago?

1043
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,954
Yes, that's right.

1044
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,081
They're the first lights that I replaced

1045
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,916
after I started working here.

1046
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,004
But what brings you here, Mr. Gu?

1047
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,966
I came here to ask you for a favor.

1048
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,305
I've only been cutting meat for ten years.

1049
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,264
A VIP?

1050
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,058
Please. How am I a VIP?

1051
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,145
People don't even know

1052
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,480
there's a butcher like me
who works in the hotel.

1053
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,484
That's why I want to show them.

1054
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,487
That there are people
who work for the hotel

1055
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,699
even though they've never worn a uniform.

1056
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,826
I appreciate your intentions,
but I'm worried.

1057
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,163
I have a low rank,
but I've worked at the hotel for longer,

1058
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,497
so I'll be upfront.

1059
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,626
Do you know what
the best kind of hotel is?

1060
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,296
What?

1061
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:36,098
A hotel where people like me
don't run into the guests.

1062
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:41,646
That is why we always try our best
to avoid the guests.

1063
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:47,068
But you're asking me
to stand on the podium?

1064
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:51,948
If you put a spotlight on people like us,

1065
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,491
you'll be criticized, Mr. Gu.

1066
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,370
Do you know what I consider
to be the best hotel?

1067
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,706
One that's profitable?

1068
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,541
That's right.

1069
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,168
The best hotel

1070
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,545
is a highly profitable one
with high sales figures.

1071
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:10,549
That is why people like you
are the most valuable.

1072
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:15,388
It is you who are on the front lines
who make the best hotel.

1073
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,599
If I had been planning on
using you for the event,

1074
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,559
I would've just ordered HR to do this.

1075
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:24,522
But you all are the most important guests,
so I came here myself.

1076
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,942
It's King Hotel's 100th-anniversary event.

1077
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:31,404
I don't want it to be held
without the guests of honor.

1078
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:45,543
I have been working
in the room inspection team for 27 years,

1079
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:48,379
and my name is Kim Ok-ja.

1080
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,233
Although I don't meet the guests…

1081
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,151
Mr. Park.

1082
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,237
Ms. Gu.

1083
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,905
You made a big mistake today.

1084
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,616
You'll pay for this.

1085
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,827
…so that the guests may feel welcomed.

1086
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:24,832
That is how I've been shaping
King Hotel from my position.

1087
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,176
Your speech was incredible.

1088
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:38,262
It is an honor
to be able to serve my seniors.

1089
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:39,638
Thank you.

1090
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,642
I'm sorry about the other day.

1091
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:44,810
I learned a lot.

1092
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:46,729
Don't be.

1093
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,983
I didn't consider the fact
that you don't work in the rooms.

1094
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,320
I wanted to apologize
for getting so worked up.

1095
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,237
Not at all.

1096
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,781
Come again next time.

1097
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,824
I promise I'll be more calm.

1098
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,744
Okay. Thank you.

1099
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,120
I'll make sure to stop by.

1100
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,915
That's my son.

1101
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,609
PROPOSAL FOR KING HOTEL'S
MISSION AND BUSINESS GOALS

1102
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:36,529
STRATEGIC PLANNING TEAM, HAN MI-SO

1103
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,364
"A hotel where everyone is happy"?

1104
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,908
Do you really think that's possible?

1105
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:43,202
You're more than capable
of making such a hotel.

1106
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,621
I'll help you by your side.

1107
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,143
Father.

1108
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:12,648
What are you doing?

1109
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,985
Are you reminiscing
when the event's been ruined?

1110
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,154
Let's talk later.

1111
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,906
Won and his sentimentality

1112
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,951
cost us the most essential figure
for our group, Assemblyman Park.

1113
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:27,037
The duty-free license expires next year,
so it needs to be renewed.

1114
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,165
We also need to expand air routes.

1115
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,167
-Aren't you aware?
-That's right.

1116
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:33,752
There were so many things to do

1117
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,338
that I lost sight of what was valuable.

1118
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,800
Don't make me distrust you too.

1119
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:41,969
King Group

1120
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,847
is not yours alone.

1121
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,242
-Enjoy your time.
-Sure.

1122
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,410
Thank you.

1123
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:14,793
Congratulations.

1124
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,420
You were amazing today.

1125
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,089
I'm always amazing.

1126
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,636
Do you want to

1127
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:25,763
come to my house this Sunday?

1128
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,017
Pyeong-hwa won't be home
because of a flight.

1129
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,483
Yes, I do.

1130
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,152
I'll be there no matter what.

1131
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,886
Make it delicious.

1132
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,255
Thank you for inviting me.

1133
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,840
Welcome.

1134
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,093
They're so beautiful.

1135
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,431
You made all of this yourself?

1136
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,310
It's not a lot,
but I prepared it with care and love.

1137
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,937
"It's not a lot"? This is a feast.

1138
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:57,938
I just

1139
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,982
wanted to make you a home-cooked meal.

1140
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,360
Thank you.

1141
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,030
MR. NO

1142
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,119
Aren't you going to pick up?

1143
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:13,829
No, I don't want to be interrupted.

1144
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,874
I wonder what will taste the best.

1145
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,792
-I know everything will taste good.
-Yes.

1146
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,377
But I'll have the rolled omelet.

1147
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,135
How does it taste? Is it okay?

1148
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,764
It's not just okay.

1149
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:33,223
It's remarkable.

1150
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,225
You could be the sous-chef of our hotel.

1151
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,895
Well if you hire me, I'd be happy to.

1152
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,191
-Try this too.
-Okay.

1153
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,200
This is so touching, babe.

1154
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,661
"Babe"?

1155
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,706
You should try it too, babe.

1156
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:01,710
Here.

1157
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,464
How is it?

1158
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,926
It's so good, babe.

1159
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:10,844
-You think it's good too, babe?
-Yes.

1160
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:16,016
Thank you.

1161
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,521
I don't know if I deserve to receive

1162
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,856
such a marvelous dinner.

1163
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,691
I'll cook for you again next time.

1164
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:26,985
I'd love that.

1165
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,200
This is nice.

1166
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,702
It is.

1167
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:38,622
The music is so nice too.

1168
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,556
-I drank it all.
-Me too.

1169
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,266
-I'll bring more.
-No, I'll do it.

1170
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,517
This is my place. Let me.

1171
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,310
-You made me food. Let me.
-No.

1172
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,020
I'll do it.

1173
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,313
-Me.
-Just stay still.

1174
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,690
-I want to do it.
-Let me.

1175
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:05,774
-No, I will.
-I will.

1176
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,151
I will.

1177
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,819
-I'll go.
-Then let's go together.

1178
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,237
Wait.

1179
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,906
Okay. Shall we go together?

1180
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,783
Sure.

1181
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,337
Are you going to drink more beer?

1182
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,549
What if I say no?

1183
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:33,362
KING THE LAND

1184
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:06,812
I want to go somewhere.

1185
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:07,813
Let's go.

1186
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,231
You won't ask where it is?

1187
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:12,192
Bring me reports on what you'll do
for the future of King Group.

1188
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,110
Both of you.

1189
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,028
The war has finally begun.

1190
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,405
You only have me.

1191
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:20,367
Make sure you report
everything related to Mr. Gu to me.

1192
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:25,122
In that case,
how high can I go by helping you?

1193
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:27,624
How come your employees aren't trained?

1194
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,128
I can't leave you alone
if you're this endearing.

1195
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,296
It's your fault.

1196
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:41,513
