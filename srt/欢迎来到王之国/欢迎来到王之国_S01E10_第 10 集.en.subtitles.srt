1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,325
I finally got some freedom.

3
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,911
We'll party like each day is a year,
so don't stop me.

4
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,829
Don't even sleep, okay?

5
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,372
You're so thrilled.

6
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,500
Are you that happy?
Don't you miss Cho-rong?

7
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,044
Hey, she needs some time of her own too.

8
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,671
-What's with you?
-"What's with you?"

9
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,089
-"What's with you?"
-Excuse me.

10
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,549
-Yes, sir?
-Yes, sir?

11
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,970
You're never off the clock, are you?

12
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,597
It's not you two. Sit down.

13
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,851
"Yes, sir?" was funny.

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,274
I finally got it.

15
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,109
I've solved the mystery.

16
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,986
What mystery?

17
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,033
I get why Mr. Gu said he was a manager
and not the head manager

18
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,327
because that could make
everyone uncomfortable.

19
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,454
But why did he call me
a department manager,

20
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,331
not a senior manager or a manager?

21
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,000
I wonder.

22
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,170
That's because I'm already
a department manager

23
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,547
in Mr. Gu's heart.

24
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,841
So he wants me
to use this chance to get trained

25
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,425
as the department manager.

26
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,514
I don't think it was that profound.

27
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,723
No, it was. Definitely.

28
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,225
-Do you really think so?
-Yes!

29
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,643
I don't think so.

30
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,729
-Mr. Yoo?
-Yes?

31
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,816
I think our tickets were switched.

32
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,234
You're in business class.

33
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,323
Really? Me?

34
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,034
Of course you should sit
in business class, Mr. Yoo.

35
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,662
Mr. No, you've been well-trained.

36
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,207
I'm glad I brought you up
to be considerate of your superior.

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,333
Give him a hand.

38
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,380
You should probably go quickly
before I change my mind.

39
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,550
Thank you, sir.

40
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,720
Don't you ever change.

41
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,973
Wow, business class? Take your seat.

42
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm off to business class.

43
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,893
Business, man.

44
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,107
I'm here.

45
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,735
What's going on?

46
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,071
What do you think?
I came back to reclaim my seat.

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,949
My seat is always next to you, right?

48
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,453
You're in the right spot.

49
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,581
Are you not uncomfortable?

50
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,665
Not at all.

51
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,962
I'm completely at ease.

52
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,089
What?

53
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,259
Why won't this work? Is it out of order?

54
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,386
No, that's as far as it goes.

55
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,555
-It went down.
-It won't go lower.

56
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,973
Excuse me, Mr. No.

57
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,058
Yes?

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,768
Are you trying to start something?

59
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,852
Start what?

60
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,521
This.

61
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,649
If you keep pushing back,
I'll kick your seat.

62
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,319
I'll be careful.

63
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,455
So why did you choose to switch seats
and be uncomfortable?

64
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,584
I am choosing to be with you.

65
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,003
It's nice, isn't it?

66
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,381
Is it just me?

67
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,217
No.

68
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,303
Me too.

69
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,865
This is nice.

70
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,450
This is nice.

71
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,546
Hello!

72
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,176
WE GO HARD!

73
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,701
(YOU'RE PRETTY)

74
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,675
We're here.

75
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,516
Please follow me.

76
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,268
Hello.

77
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,021
Of course, this is nice.

78
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,856
I can't believe this.

79
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,399
-My gosh.
-Careful.

80
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,442
Watch the stairs.

81
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,658
What is this?

82
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,368
-My gosh.
-What's this?

83
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,746
No way.

84
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,673
This isn't the end.

85
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,841
Follow me.

86
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,468
-Really?
-There's more.

87
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,116
Let's take pictures.

88
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,577
-One, two, three.
-Ta-da!

89
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,620
-You come too.
-You two look awesome.

90
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,873
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

91
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,085
The pool is a bit small.

92
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,213
How is this small? It's wonderful.

93
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,716
Yes, why can't you be content?

94
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,302
Mr. Yoo, this place is awesome!

95
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,261
Mr. Yoo,

96
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,554
thank you.

97
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,389
Don't mention it. It's not a big deal.

98
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,726
Let's go upstairs. It'll be even better.

99
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,561
-My gosh. Upstairs?
-Another floor?

100
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,562
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

101
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,147
-Second floor!
-Let's go!

102
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,857
What's on the second floor?

103
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,025
Come quickly!

104
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,276
Second floor!

105
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,949
-No Sang-sik.
-What's on the second floor?

106
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,950
Goodness.

107
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,829
These are the rooms.
Your rooms are to the right.

108
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,955
The right?

109
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,499
-Yes.
-This is it?

110
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,501
-This?
-This is our room.

111
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,127
-What's it like?
-This?

112
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,798
Three, two, one.

113
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,259
There it is. There's the scream.

114
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,262
It's so high!

115
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,056
Where's my room?

116
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,143
Let's go inside, Mr. No.

117
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,064
You little…

118
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,901
What's all this?

119
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,572
Why did you book only two rooms
for all these people?

120
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,865
Two is more than enough.

121
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,867
One room for men, one for women.

122
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,080
-Where are you going to sleep?
-Me?

123
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,998
Of course,

124
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,125
I'll sleep here.

125
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,349
Are you saying

126
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,477
this ridiculously absurd bed

127
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,231
is supposed to be shared by you and me?

128
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,275
Everything about this place is so nice.

129
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,026
Gosh, so comfy.

130
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,236
Lie down next to me.

131
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,946
You idiot.

132
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,406
We're staying somewhere else.

133
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,992
We can't. We already paid in full.

134
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,743
Five people, five rooms.

135
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,869
That's a given.

136
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,122
And let me make myself clear.

137
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,249
I will not share a bed with you,

138
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,169
so either book a new hotel
or pack up and go back to Korea.

139
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,588
Got it?

140
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,175
Mr. Yoo!

141
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,023
Remember.

142
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,861
I'm the head manager.

143
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,447
Okay?

144
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,407
Yes, sir.

145
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,334
WE GO HARD!

146
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,587
-Help!
-Don't do it.

147
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,504
Stop it.

148
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,635
Mr. Yoo!

149
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,179
-This place is wonderful.
-Thank you.

150
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,057
How did you find such a great place?

151
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,476
You have such great taste.

152
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,686
We love it. It's the best!

153
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,564
I think so too.

154
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,817
However, there has been a problem.

155
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,194
What problem?

156
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,737
The problem is that…

157
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,030
Well, the…

158
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,699
Everyone loves it here.

159
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,827
What do you mean there's a problem?

160
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,122
-May we really stay?
-Yes.

161
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,165
-Really?
-Yes.

162
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,794
The problem is resolved.

163
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,796
Luckily the rooster has stopped crowing.

164
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,173
Then get in here, you two!

165
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,800
It's so cool in here!

166
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,801
Shall we? Okay.

167
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,302
-Shoes off.
-I'm fine.

168
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,262
Come on in. Let's all play together.

169
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,223
Please enjoy. I'll join next time.

170
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,307
Next time, my foot.

171
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,690
You look great.

172
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,759
EPISODE 10

173
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,428
Did you have fun in the pool?

174
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,429
-Yes!
-Yes!

175
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,930
I'm glad.

176
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,685
Let me tell you about today's schedule.

177
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,104
Let's find a chance to slip out later.

178
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:14,400
We'll go to the hottest night market
here in Bangkok.

179
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,861
But we're here as a group.
Can we really do that?

180
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,279
Of course we can.

181
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,156
Vacations are all about freedom.

182
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,951
Where are we going?

183
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,620
You'll see when we get there.

184
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,331
Mr. No?

185
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,918
Mr. Yoo is talking. Phone down.

186
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,841
Continue, Mr. Yoo.

187
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,094
Things may become dangerous,
so I prepared something.

188
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,513
What did I prepare?

189
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,557
Group tour T-shirts!

190
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,767
Amazing.

191
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,979
But we all have our own tastes.

192
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,023
We don't need a group--

193
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,399
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

194
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,734
We'll wear them well.

195
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,277
Here.

196
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,238
Let's get changed,
and we'll meet back here in 30 minutes.

197
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,323
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

198
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,367
Mr. No.

199
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,744
Let's go.

200
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,290
Where are we going?

201
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,291
I'll tell you later.

202
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,335
Go get changed.

203
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,928
This is wonderful.

204
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,889
Ms. Gang, what's the theme
of our trip again?

205
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,017
We go hard!

206
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,352
Precisely! We go hard!

207
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,979
Go hard for our teamwork!

208
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,357
Go hard for our company!

209
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,483
We go hard.

210
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,612
As you already know,

211
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,655
it's not "Hard go."

212
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,782
People may see it
and think we're not soft.

213
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,160
That was so funny.

214
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,453
Get it? Not soft?

215
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,708
So we'll stay as "Go hard."

216
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,960
-Okay?
-Yes!

217
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,463
Then Ms. Gang will start our chant,
and we'll all shout it out together.

218
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,757
-Go.
-Hard.

219
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,093
-Go.
-Hard.

220
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,604
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

221
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,942
Go hard!

222
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,735
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

223
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,654
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

224
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,503
Why do we have to eat Vietnamese noodles

225
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,505
after coming all the way to Thailand?

226
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,841
We don't complain
when we eat Chinese in Korea.

227
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,970
But still, there must be
many good Thai noodle restaurants.

228
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,140
I have a go-to place
whenever I come here on a flight.

229
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,266
Why don't we go there?

230
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,310
Yes, Pyeong-hwa knows Bangkok really well.

231
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,853
Let's go to her joint.

232
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,855
No, this is a great restaurant.

233
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,898
Take a look.

234
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,693
Trust me and try it.

235
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,486
I'm a Thailand expert.

236
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,487
Please come inside.

237
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:10,951
We are…

238
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,661
-One.
-One.

239
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,996
That was too weak.

240
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,914
We are…

241
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,832
-One!
-One!

242
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,798
I really don't like him.

243
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,594
These are all noodles.

244
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,638
Of course. This is a noodle restaurant.

245
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,307
Da-eul doesn't like noodles.

246
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,310
What are you talking about?
I love noodles.

247
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,437
You do? Since when?

248
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,106
I've been craving noodles
since I set foot in Bangkok.

249
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,568
Ms. Gang and I are kind of hitting it off.

250
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,281
If you visit Bangkok,
you must eat sticky noodles.

251
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,449
What's that?

252
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,159
The noodles are…

253
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,329
really sticky.

254
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,167
Oh, because they're sticky.

255
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,212
Everything is great here,

256
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,756
but number one is the best.

257
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,841
-I'll take number one.
-Okay.

258
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,259
-Me too.
-Okay.

259
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,469
Me too.

260
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,638
What about you, Mr. No?

261
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,474
It's a hot day.
Do we have to eat hot noodles?

262
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,643
I'll just have a glass of beer.

263
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,186
Okay. Excuse me!

264
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,482
We'll order five number ones.

265
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,819
I said I wasn't eating.

266
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,779
I'm having two portions.

267
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,489
Do you speak Thai too?

268
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,241
Yes.

269
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,618
Go hard!

270
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,286
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

271
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,543
That just hit the spot.

272
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,253
This is it.

273
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,473
This is so good.

274
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,643
This is much better than my joint.

275
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,311
What a bummer.

276
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,355
This would be perfect with soju.

277
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,316
No, this would be perfect
for curing a hangover the next day.

278
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,985
Try the soup. It's insane.

279
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,945
I told you so.

280
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,321
Just trust me and follow me.

281
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,157
Mr. Yoo, you're the best.

282
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,826
It may be good, but it's just noodles.

283
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,870
Mr. Gu…

284
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,289
Mr. No, try a bite.

285
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,249
-I'm fine.
-Just try a bite.

286
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,625
-I'm fine.
-Just once.

287
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,918
Just one bite.

288
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,962
-I'm fine.
-One bite. Please?

289
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,883
Good grief.

290
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,852
What just happened?

291
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,687
-Why is this so good?
-What?

292
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,189
You just fed Mr. No.

293
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,900
I did? When?

294
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:48,942
You did.

295
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,737
I did that?

296
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,489
You did what? I didn't see it.

297
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
-Right?
-Right.

298
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,076
-This is good.
-I was just sharing.

299
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,619
This place is good.

300
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,912
-Give that to me.
-What?

301
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,455
-It's good.
-That's mine.

302
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,041
Excuse me! One more, please.

303
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,460
This is great.

304
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,296
What's that?

305
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,923
What?

306
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,425
-Nothing's out there.
-Never mind.

307
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,551
Eat up.

308
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,763
-This is so good.
-It is.

309
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,352
It's perfect with beer.

310
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,145
-It's good.
-The dumplings are good.

311
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,859
We're running out of time.

312
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,153
Our next stop is
the hottest spot in Bangkok,

313
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,572
filled with every product
and every kind of food.

314
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,742
-A food heaven.
-We're going to eat more?

315
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,035
I came to Thailand to eat.

316
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,995
I'm so full. I can't eat anymore.

317
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,206
If I eat more, I'm not even human.

318
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,583
My diet completely fell through.

319
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,418
I'm done eating as of right now.

320
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,878
Don't offer me anything.

321
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,214
We're running out of time.
Let's get moving.

322
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,008
Go hard! We are one!

323
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,093
Hurry up. Get moving.

324
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,177
Mr. No.

325
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,054
Pay the tab and come along.

326
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,645
-Shall we?
-Okay.

327
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,006
What's that? That looks good!

328
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,854
Mr. Exclamation Mark.

329
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,022
Go back.

330
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,863
I didn't do this.

331
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,535
What's that?

332
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,621
-That looks good, right?
-What's that?

333
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,955
It's pad thai.

334
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,582
Should we have some?

335
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,626
Mr. Yoo! Buy some for us.

336
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,752
-This?
-Yes.

337
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,378
Mr. Yoo, I want shrimp pad thai.

338
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,421
That looks so good.

339
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,714
Hey, it's ice cream!

340
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,348
TAIWANESE-STYLE PEANUT ICE CREAM

341
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,935
Do you have to eat
Taiwanese ice cream in Bangkok?

342
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,812
I feel so lucky that
I get to eat peanut ice cream

343
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,564
while I'm here in Bangkok.

344
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,233
Thailand is a street food heaven.

345
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,740
Is it that good?

346
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,200
Totally. Do you want a bite?

347
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,243
I'm fine.

348
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,911
-Come on.
-No.

349
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,581
Anyway, I clearly remember you saying
that you were too full.

350
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,376
People visit Thailand for its food.

351
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,086
I haven't even started.

352
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,671
You said you were full.

353
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,839
-That you'll blow up.
-This is dessert.

354
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,258
-Is it a separate stomach?
-Mr. No!

355
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,260
-He's back?
-Mr. No!

356
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,180
Let's find a seat.

357
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,807
Me?

358
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,642
Yes, you.

359
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,064
What's all this?

360
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,025
We're in Thailand,
so we must try all its food.

361
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,568
We just ate.

362
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,320
How are we going to eat all this,

363
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,238
sir?

364
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,489
We have a crowd.

365
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,116
A bite each won't be much.

366
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,575
What should I begin with?

367
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,036
You should start eating
instead of thinking.

368
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,996
Right?

369
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,789
Let's get started.

370
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,708
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

371
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,418
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

372
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,378
Right, before we eat, let's make a toast.

373
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,671
Shall we? Sounds great.

374
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,047
Okay. Go hard!

375
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,174
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

376
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,932
Ms. Gang, you've done well.

377
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,434
Come on.

378
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,020
-Thank you, sir.
-Good work.

379
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,771
You too, Mr. Yoo.

380
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,773
-Mr. Yoo.
-You can't reach this.

381
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,110
Thank you.

382
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,281
And Mr. No, you've done well too.

383
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,786
Mr. Yoo.

384
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,277
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

385
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,283
Do you want some?

386
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,509
-Encore!
-Encore!

387
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,516
Is everything going okay?

388
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,478
Everything is going smoothly
thanks to you, Ms. Gu.

389
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,108
Well…

390
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,528
You recently picked out
the best staff of each subsidiary

391
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,697
and sent them on a trip, right?

392
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,782
A trip? I haven't heard anything about it.

393
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,871
Mr. Gu Won took the best staff
of King Hotel, King Air, and King Fashion

394
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,831
and took them on an incentive trip.

395
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,960
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

396
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,172
How could something in King Group
be carried out without my knowledge?

397
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,132
And of all things, incentives?

398
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,509
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll look into it.

399
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,504
Are you asleep?

400
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,052
No, I'm not.

401
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,429
Can we see each other?

402
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,224
Now?

403
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,107
Right now.

404
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,234
Okay.

405
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,545
Why are you so heavy?

406
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,722
Sa-rang.

407
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,726
Do we have beer at home?

408
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,187
At home?

409
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,273
Yeah.

410
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,261
You weren't asleep?

411
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,014
I was waiting.

412
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,518
Me too.

413
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,857
I'm going to kill Mr. No when we get back.

414
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,775
Why?

415
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,610
He prepared a lot for this trip.

416
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,446
That's the problem. It's way too much.

417
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,490
"Go hard"? It's so tacky.

418
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,325
Da-eul is awful too.

419
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,202
"Mr. Exclamation Mark, go back."

420
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,330
Don't get me started.
I'll see them in my sleep.

421
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,670
I haven't been on a trip
with my friends since college.

422
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,799
I've never gone abroad with my friends

423
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,260
or gone anywhere with my grandma.

424
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,887
What have I been doing with my life?

425
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,270
You're here now.

426
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,523
And we'll travel much more.

427
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,775
It'll happen.

428
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,531
It's nice to be here with you.

429
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,493
It finally feels like a vacation.

430
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,579
I thought we were in a boot camp.

431
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,375
Tomorrow will be even better.

432
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,131
I'll make every day of yours
filled with happiness.

433
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,678
I'm more than happy right now.

434
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,571
You coming in?

435
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,492
Come on.

436
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,392
I missed you.

437
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,188
We were together all day long.

438
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,234
Not the back of your head.

439
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,360
Your face.

440
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,406
I missed this lovely face so much.

441
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,785
Why is this so heavy?

442
00:31:56,372 --> 00:32:02,462
PYEONG-HWA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS EVENING?

443
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,421
Ro-un.

444
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,507
What are you doing after work?

445
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,967
Do you want to get dinner?

446
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,054
I have plans.

447
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,639
Really?

448
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,599
You have plans tonight?

449
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,642
Yes.

450
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,560
Tonight.

451
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:35,995
What's that sound?

452
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,847
Good morning.

453
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,433
Yes, Mr. Yoo. Good morning.

454
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,727
Let me announce today's schedule.

455
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,563
We'll begin our day
with a tour of the Wat Arun.

456
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,232
We'll eat at choice restaurants

457
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:08,069
and visit the icon of Bangkok,
ICONSIAM, for some shopping.

458
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,905
Then we'll end the day
with a party on a ferry boat.

459
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,281
Do you understand?

460
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,409
What about free time,

461
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,827
sir?

462
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,954
There's no free time on a group tour.

463
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:18,955
No.

464
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,082
What sort of a tour
doesn't have some free time?

465
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,000
He's right.

466
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,960
This is tyranny. How awful.

467
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,629
No, you came on this trip
with your free will.

468
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,131
You can't want that here.

469
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:31,843
Right?

470
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,512
Get ready.
See you downstairs in 30 minutes.

471
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,097
Yes, sir.

472
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,477
See you.

473
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,283
Go hard!

474
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,660
-That's so cool.
-It is.

475
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,495
It's amazing.

476
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,047
It's even more breathtaking in person.

477
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,132
This is the Wat Arun Temple.

478
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,425
Let's go inside.

479
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,723
Isn't it beautiful?

480
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,144
If you see any monks as we walk around…

481
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,660
Mr. No.

482
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,246
Go to the back.

483
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,166
Why? I'm fine here.

484
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,709
The order is off.

485
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,170
When we play, we go hard!

486
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,755
When we eat, we go hard!

487
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,381
Enough with "Go hard."

488
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,425
We're not wearing those T-shirts today.

489
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,512
We may not have the T-shirts on,
but we'll go hard forever.

490
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,264
You're forever an exclamation mark.
Return to your spot.

491
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,314
Mr. Exclamation Mark.

492
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,024
Why aren't you in your spot?

493
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,946
Let's go.

494
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,322
Do we really have to…

495
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,826
stay in this formation as we walk?

496
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,994
Mr. No, how long have you been working?

497
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,418
Six years?

498
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,212
Six months.

499
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,550
Let me share a word as your senior.

500
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,344
Don't get on Mr. Yoo's nerves.
It'll make our lives harder.

501
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,263
Da-eul, I thought you were on our side.

502
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,224
It's because we're a team.
I couldn't care less about strangers.

503
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,433
Exclamation Mark, to the back.

504
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,352
Wait for me!

505
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,311
Come on.

506
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,438
-The three of us.
-Take a picture, please.

507
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,399
I'll take it now. Over here.

508
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,317
One, two, three.

509
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,610
Go hard.

510
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,488
Mr. No, do you want one?

511
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,365
Sure.

512
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,410
I'll take it for you.

513
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,619
Will you really?

514
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,746
-Come here. Take it with us.
-Really?

515
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,747
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

516
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,957
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

517
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,584
One more time. Go hard.

518
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,127
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

519
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,309
Go hard!

520
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,405
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

521
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,324
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

522
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,954
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

523
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,873
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

524
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,042
Go hard!

525
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,337
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

526
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,130
Not this way. This way.

527
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,507
-No, this way.
-Come on, Mr. Yoo.

528
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,134
-Just a little more.
-Here.

529
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,844
Let's do it here. This is perfect.

530
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,180
Go hard!

531
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,640
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

532
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,697
Now the highlight of the day.

533
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,492
I welcome you
to a dinner party on a ferry boat!

534
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,452
This is amazing.

535
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,955
I always wanted to try this
whenever I was in Bangkok.

536
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,706
Mr. Yoo, you're awesome!

537
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,459
Let's get out of here.

538
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,045
-Now?
-In a moment.

539
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,256
Is that possible?

540
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,966
Just follow my lead.

541
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,926
Now go inside.

542
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,599
Now.

543
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,177
What the heck?

544
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,931
Why are you here?

545
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,891
Why are you asking me?

546
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,185
Do you have something to say?

547
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,063
Darn it.

548
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,148
No!

549
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,608
I mean…

550
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,448
We have to line up again.

551
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,701
If you didn't like the ferry,
you could've said so.

552
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,815
Here.

553
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,984
Have a cool drink.

554
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,111
Thanks.

555
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,864
Are you still upset?

556
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,076
I was such an idiot. What am I doing?

557
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,747
Mr. No suddenly came between us.
What are the chances?

558
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,124
He's ruining everything.

559
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,463
But you were so cool.

560
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,346
Mr. No, where are you?

561
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,515
Mr. No!

562
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,683
There you are.

563
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,189
Come quickly.

564
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,279
Thailand looks so beautiful at night.

565
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,656
I feel so at peace too.

566
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,201
Everyone here looks so bright and relaxed.

567
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,454
There's this word in Thai. Sabai.

568
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,499
Instead of always rushing things
and scrambling around,

569
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,168
it tells you to slow down
and relax a little.

570
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,211
Sabai.

571
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,629
Maybe that's why.

572
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,965
Sabai.

573
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,174
That's nice.

574
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,802
But if we went sabai with our sales,
we'd get fired.

575
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,974
If we went sabai on a flight,
we wouldn't finish our service on time.

576
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,600
Hey, the same goes for the hotel.

577
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,603
What a foreign concept for us, right?

578
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,274
Then why don't we

579
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:47,528
enjoy some free time tomorrow
while we're in Bangkok?

580
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,072
Free time for everyone.

581
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,826
Sabai.

582
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,912
Sabai.

583
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:57,872
Bye-bye.

584
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,959
We're going hard
until the end of this trip.

585
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,419
If you want to relax,

586
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,796
you can go home and do it on your own.

587
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,758
By any chance, if you wish to go home now,

588
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,219
then feel free to go home and relax.

589
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,512
This is so much fun.

590
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,055
It's so much fun.

591
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,268
Ro-un, what brings you here?

592
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,645
I stopped by in passing.

593
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,772
Hello.

594
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,608
-My name is Lee Ro-un.
-Who is that?

595
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,234
-I had time after a flight here,
-Her junior.

596
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,861
so I stopped by to see Pyeong-hwa.

597
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,946
Nice to meet you.

598
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,657
He's a junior on my crew.

599
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,869
How did you come here?

600
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,373
I asked what you'd be doing later,
and you said you'd be eating here.

601
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,333
It's not that.

602
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,960
Mr. Yoo, can he join us?

603
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,837
Wait, he's too good-looking.

604
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,214
We kind of overlap.

605
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,924
Then you should meet him.

606
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,177
This is Department Manager Yoo Sang-sik
of King Group Headquarters.

607
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,720
And this is Manager No.

608
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,640
This is Cheon Sa-rang of King Hotel.

609
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,808
And I'm Gang Da-eul of Alanga.

610
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,519
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Ro-un.

611
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,021
We have a new member for Team Go Hard.

612
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,773
Welcome. Take a seat.

613
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:07,900
Excuse me.

614
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,693
One beer, please.

615
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,030
Let's make a toast for our newest member.

616
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,199
Right, Ro-un.

617
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,409
When I say "Go hard," you say it too.

618
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,119
-Okay.
-Go hard!

619
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,288
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

620
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,361
This is the icon of Bangkok, ICONSIAM.

621
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,737
A round of applause.

622
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,905
This is the fountain.

623
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,157
Let's take a photo
with the ferry in the background.

624
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,409
-Sounds great.
-Okay.

625
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,910
-Of course.
-Another picture?

626
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,870
-To remember this.
-We need to. Come in.

627
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,622
-Is everyone in?
-Yes, we are.

628
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,499
I'll take it. One, two, three.

629
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,673
I knew this would happen!

630
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,758
I knew it!

631
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,584
I had fun. Please excuse me.

632
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,378
No, you can't go.

633
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,879
You're already here with us.

634
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,256
Stay over.

635
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,590
May I really?

636
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,508
Of course.

637
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,426
He can't.

638
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,387
Flight crew only stay
in designated hotels during layovers.

639
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,638
You don't have to worry.

640
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,349
Mr. No can take care of that, right?

641
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,022
Well, I can.

642
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,608
But there's no room.

643
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,818
What do you mean?

644
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,069
One for women, one for men.

645
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,237
We have two rooms.

646
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,408
And our room has a king size bed,
so it fits three.

647
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,910
It's not a king. It's a queen.

648
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,871
I don't mind sleeping on the floor.

649
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,581
No, you'll catch a cold.

650
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,000
It's huge. It's big enough for three.

651
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,210
In that case…

652
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,339
Sure, I'll stay.

653
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,257
Thank you, sir.

654
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,635
Then let's make a toast
to celebrate the six siblings.

655
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,345
Yes, a toast.

656
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,638
Okay.

657
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,681
Go hard!

658
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,933
-Go hard!
-Go hard!

659
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,568
Come to think of it,

660
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:24,490
I haven't slept together
with a group of guys since college.

661
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,366
I've wanted to do this.

662
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,286
When you travel with friends,

663
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,915
a huge group of guys
end up sleeping in a room half this size.

664
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,000
But it never felt uncomfortable.

665
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,084
-Right?
-Right.

666
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,462
I'm uncomfortable right now.

667
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,922
Let's go to sleep.

668
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,256
Sure, I'm not stopping you.

669
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,342
Ro-un and I have lots to discuss.

670
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,219
I love it.

671
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,095
Then you two can chat outside.

672
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,805
I'm tired.

673
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,057
So go to sleep.

674
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,060
Just imagine you're alone
and that you need to sleep.

675
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,603
You'll fall asleep in no time.

676
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,771
Right?

677
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,814
-Yes.
-What kind of horseshit is this?

678
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,611
You two seem close. You're like friends.

679
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,862
Friends?

680
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,823
I absolutely detest people
who are like Mr. Yoo.

681
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,743
Mr. No tends to be
a little clingy with me.

682
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,373
He has no friends due to his personality.

683
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,083
-Really?
-No.

684
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,876
So I've been looking after him

685
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,419
with my generous heart. Right?

686
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,046
I'm turning the lights off. Night.

687
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,423
-No, don't turn them off.
-Go to sleep.

688
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,591
Turn the lights on.

689
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,302
I'm talking to you, Mr. No.

690
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,429
I'm a department manager
and you're a manager.

691
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,764
Turn them back on now.

692
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,851
I've put up with your nonsense all day.

693
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,769
Wait!

694
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:37,896
Happy now?

695
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,440
Ta-da, Cho-rong!

696
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,942
Look! Isn't this pretty?

697
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,860
It is. It's totally pretty.

698
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,029
And look.

699
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,116
What about this?

700
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,617
That's really cute too.

701
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,036
Did you only get stuff for me?
What about you?

702
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,330
What? I don't need anything.

703
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,791
You don't have to buy out of need.

704
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,876
Buy something if it's pretty.

705
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,753
Don't just buy mine tomorrow.

706
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,172
Make sure you get something
for yourself too, okay?

707
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,340
Promise me.

708
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,092
Okay, I promise.

709
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,385
Be careful of cars.

710
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,053
And don't follow bad people.

711
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,680
Make sure you stay with the aunties.

712
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,265
Okay, I'll be careful.

713
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,934
Goodnight sweetie.

714
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,020
-I love you.
-I love you too.

715
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,980
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight!

716
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,529
What would you have done without Cho-rong?

717
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,114
I'm not jealous that you're married,

718
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,033
but I am jealous
that you have a daughter like her.

719
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:31,950
Me too.

720
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,787
You should try having one too.
They're not adorable all the time.

721
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,207
But giving birth to Cho-rong is still
the best thing I've done in my life.

722
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,964
Take this.

723
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,674
What's this?

724
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,886
We picked it up on the way.

725
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,929
What?

726
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,225
What is this?

727
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,312
Girls, come on.

728
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,230
You two are giving me the feels.

729
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:06,026
Cho-rong tells you to look after yourself,
but you don't listen.

730
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,236
What can we do? We have to look after you.

731
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,032
Thank you. I mean it.

732
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,204
-What's going on?
-No.

733
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,413
-No.
-Hey.

734
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,249
-No. I'm not crying.
-You better not be crying right now.

735
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,377
We'll tease you for life if you cry now.

736
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,336
Never.

737
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,171
Come on.

738
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,965
You two are the best.

739
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,385
-Come on.
-You're the only ones for me.

740
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,928
Thank you.

741
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,809
Me too. You two are the only ones for me.

742
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,021
Not you.

743
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,856
You've got Ro-un,

744
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,150
who came all the way to Thailand
just for you.

745
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,443
That's really not it.

746
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,613
"I stopped by to see Pyeong-hwa.
Nice to meet you."

747
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,532
"I don't mind sleeping on the floor."

748
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,283
It's not like that.

749
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,244
It's not. Nothing's going on.

750
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,496
-"Then I'll stay. Thank you."
-That's enough.

751
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,956
-Cut it out.
-Why?

752
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,791
-Hey, just cut it out!
-"Pyeong-hwa--"

753
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,167
-What's wrong?
-My gosh.

754
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,711
-Are you all right?
-Why?

755
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,254
-I'm sorry.
-"Pyeong-hwa."

756
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,463
"Are you okay, Pyeong-hwa?"

757
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,632
"I'm okay, Pyeong-hwa."

758
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,467
I knew you'd say that!

759
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,511
-I knew it!
-"I'm all right, Pyeong-hwa."

760
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,846
So sweet!

761
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,764
"I'm fine, Pyeong-hwa."

762
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,601
-Stop it!
-"I came because I missed you so much."

763
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,145
"Pyeong-hwa."

764
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,688
-"Pyeong-hwa."
-I can't hear you.

765
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:29,609
"I can sleep on the cold hard floor
if it means I can be with you!"

766
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,449
Make sure you eat before you leave.

767
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,575
Thanks.

768
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,279
Mr. Yoo.

769
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,073
Mr. Yoo.

770
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,407
-Is Sa-rang gone?
-She's not there?

771
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,117
No. Mr. No's gone too.

772
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,119
-Over there.
-What?

773
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,789
Mr. No!

774
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,290
Where are you going?

775
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,000
Where are you going?

776
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,462
Where are you going?

777
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,091
We're leaving to find freedom.

778
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,884
Goodbye, everyone!

779
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,845
Hey, Cheon Sa-rang!

780
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,555
You traitor!

781
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,850
Wait for me! I want to come too!

782
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,305
-Isn't it pretty?
-Yes.

783
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,288
You're good.

784
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,305
No, let's take one. I want to.

785
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,396
-This time, you have to smile.
-I shall smile.

786
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,732
And make a heart.

787
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,359
I shall make that too.

788
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,069
And smile.

789
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:00,987
Good.

790
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,429
What is this place?

791
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,809
I told you there was a place
I wanted to go with you, right?

792
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,602
This is it.

793
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,856
It's as beautiful as a painting.

794
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,819
I'd be so happy if I could see
a view like this every day.

795
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,614
Should we live here?

796
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,284
Sounds like a dream.

797
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,995
Then we'll live like a dream.

798
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,853
Enjoy your meal.

799
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,107
Are you that happy?

800
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,694
I've had lots of Thai food,
but nothing like this.

801
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,448
It's all so pretty.
And it all looks so good!

802
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,826
Try this one first. Open up.

803
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,874
It's good.

804
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,054
This is so good. Here.

805
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,601
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

806
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,313
Take your time and try the others too.

807
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,076
Did you enjoy dinner?

808
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,411
Yes, it was so good.

809
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,583
And the night view is so pretty.

810
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,837
I'm very glad that you like it.

811
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,762
I never

812
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,640
hoped for anything since my childhood.

813
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,810
I was afraid my hopes and desires

814
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,354
would take away
the things that are dear to me.

815
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,774
But I keep wanting more.

816
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:48,905
I feel so happy that I begin to wonder
if I'm allowed this much happiness.

817
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:55,120
I keep hoping that
I'll continue to be this happy.

818
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,876
It's okay to want more.

819
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:07,006
The things you want to do,
want to have, and want to become.

820
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,676
You can want it all.

821
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,719
You deserve it.

822
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,160
My sister and I have different moms.

823
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,789
My father had me
after he remarried my mom.

824
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,461
She disappeared when I was young.

825
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,172
All of a sudden,

826
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,174
without a word.

827
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,427
I was wailing as I looked for her,

828
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,763
but everyone else
had a smile on their faces.

829
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,310
It was the first time I thought
smiles could look monstrous.

830
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,479
And that in my life…

831
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,316
no one showed their genuine emotions.

832
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,779
Then along came Cheon Sa-rang

833
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,157
with her genuine emotions.

834
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,914
Do you still have no idea where she is?

835
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,916
You haven't heard from her?

836
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,000
No.

837
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,172
I kept looking,
but there was no trace of her.

838
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,840
It's as if

839
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,886
she never existed in this world.

840
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:41,601
I don't know if she abandoned me
or if she had a reason to leave.

841
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,437
So I'm not sure
if I should miss her or despise her.

842
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,732
I'm sure she's somewhere.

843
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,984
Let's find her together.

844
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,827
You don't have to do that.

845
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,414
I was just curious.
I didn't exactly want to see her.

846
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,876
And I'm not even curious anymore.

847
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,595
The night view is nice. Let's go out.

848
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,126
Thank you for coming into my life.

849
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,007
Thank you for coming into my life.

850
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,746
I prepared something.

851
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,457
Ta-da…

852
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,170
This isn't it.

853
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,269
Well, what can we do?

854
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,646
It's for VIPs.

855
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,105
You're right.

856
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,523
Let's hop on.

857
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,142
Look at that.

858
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,811
Let's make a short stop.

859
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:30,853
There?

860
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,453
This is great.

861
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,914
You said that about 100 times.

862
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,416
But it really is great.

863
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,627
The full moon! Make a wish.

864
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:14,731
All done?

865
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,190
Yes.

866
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,042
This is wonderful.

867
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,944
What did you wish for on the moon?

868
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,701
That I would always be
as happy as I am now.

869
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,745
Is this good enough for you?

870
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,289
You should've wished for more.

871
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,751
Then what did you wish for?

872
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,421
Me? Nothing.

873
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,131
Why not?

874
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,593
There's nothing more to ask for.

875
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,305
I have you with me.

876
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,849
I don't need anything else.

877
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:38,064
Oh, but I did say a word of gratitude

878
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,732
for giving me someone so precious.

879
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,443
Thank you.

880
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,907
I love you, Sa-rang.

881
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,746
I love you too.

882
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,828
KING THE LAND

883
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,404
The guest list for the
100th-anniversary event isn't finalized.

884
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,239
Yes it is.
I just need to make a final decision.

885
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,033
Invite the people on that list.

886
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,702
It's my responsibility,
so I'll do whatever I want.

887
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,663
It must be fun playing the hero.

888
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,542
It hurts.

889
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,048
Are you going to leave Won be?

890
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,592
By any chance…

891
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,637
did you ask him about your mom?

892
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,306
I'm sure he'd know.

893
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:42,855
