00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,631
Yu-ri.

3
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,383
Don't date me.

4
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,801
Date someone who likes you.

5
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,262
Sure.

6
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,306
I'll tell you when I start dating.

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,768
So you need to tell me first
when you begin to fool around.

8
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,728
Don't let me hear it from someone else.

9
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,273
I've already met

10
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,484
someone I like.

11
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,721
Yo, chicken!

12
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,515
Look at me, look closely

13
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,141
Don't betray my love

14
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,893
Come on, come to me

15
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,561
This will be the last time

16
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,063
Why would you leave?

17
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,773
Why would you abandon me?

18
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,192
Stop nagging and come to me, chicken

19
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,693
Come

20
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,719
Can we talk for a minute?

21
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,820
Mr. Gu.

22
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,905
I thought you wanted chicken.

23
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,908
Can you eat this all by yourself?

24
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,453
Wait. Why are you here?

25
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,583
Let's talk over chicken.

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,500
Sorry?

27
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,210
Where are you going?

28
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,461
You can't go inside!

29
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,046
-Pizza
-Pizza

30
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,096
EPISODE 7

31
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,023
You should've told us
you were Sa-rang's coworker.

32
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,108
I'm sorry for showing up unexpectedly,

33
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,528
but if you think about it,
you didn't give me a chance to--

34
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,697
We're basically family. Go easy on us.

35
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,115
We work for King Group too.

36
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,576
-I work at Alanga, King Fashion.
-I work at King Air.

37
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,786
-We are all one big family.
-One big family.

38
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,496
-Hermès.
-Hermès.

39
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,877
Do you work
in the same department as Sa-rang?

40
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,795
No.

41
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,713
He's--

42
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,839
Yes, we do.

43
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,551
It must be tough.

44
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,012
I heard there was
a stuck-up jerk working there.

45
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,556
Hey.

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,350
No, there isn't.

47
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,352
What are you saying?

48
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,978
Right. It was the head manager.

49
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes, it was the head manager.

50
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,731
What was his name again?

51
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,192
His name… Gu Won.

52
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,236
The chairman's son. The nepotism guy.

53
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,612
Right?

54
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,573
-No.
-Oh, my.

55
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,451
He tortured you that much?
You're tearing up just hearing his name.

56
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,119
It's okay.

57
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,455
I heard he goes to work for fun.

58
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,792
He should have fun
without bothering others.

59
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,669
There's always one in every bunch.

60
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,711
Hey…

61
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,296
Well…

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,839
at first.

63
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,300
At first, he was like that.

64
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,552
Just slightly.
But he's not like that anymore.

65
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,595
What do you mean?

66
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,181
You said he has a rotten personality.

67
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,517
Did I?

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,018
Yes. You said he was a douchebag.

69
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,561
I see. When?

70
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,313
-Yesterday.
-And two days ago.

71
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,274
-Last week too.
-And last month.

72
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,401
So I did.

73
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,406
Come to think of it,
we never even introduced ourselves.

74
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,490
What's your name?

75
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,243
Guys,

76
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,121
-this is--
-You can call me Manager No.

77
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,040
My goodness. You're a manager?

78
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,625
I manage my team as well.

79
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,211
I'm Gang Da-eul. I work at Alanga.

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,838
Stop by if you ever go overseas.

81
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,589
-I'll give you a big discount.
-Okay.

82
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,717
My name is Oh Pyeong-hwa.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,343
She's almost a purser at King Air.

84
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,053
Give me a call whenever you fly.

85
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,179
Thank you.

86
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,224
Steer clear of them.

87
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,350
By the way, Mr. No.

88
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,564
Why did you come here?

89
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,650
Why do you think?

90
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,903
It's because he couldn't stop
thinking about her.

91
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,489
Have you two already gone that far?

92
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,117
Hey.

93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,744
Eat this and leave.

94
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,287
Why? We're having so much fun.

95
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,914
What are you going to do once we leave?

96
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,082
Hey, Gang Da-eul.

97
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,208
Do you want to get kicked out?

98
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,461
Hey, half of this house belongs to me.

99
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,212
We split the deposit and the rent.

100
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,006
Don't be rude to my guest.

101
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,008
You can stay as long as you want.

102
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,468
Thank you, Pyeong-hwa.

103
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,473
But what is that?

104
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,724
-Is it a gift?
-Oh, this.

105
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,852
Here. It's medicine.

106
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,354
I didn't know your symptoms,
so I got everything.

107
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,856
This is for me?

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,483
Why do I need medicine?

109
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,903
You didn't look so well earlier.
I thought you were sick.

110
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,325
Mr. No, you pass.

111
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,118
I give you my approval as well.

112
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,913
Don't be absurd. That's enough.

113
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,414
What did we do?

114
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,957
She must be feeling embarrassed.

115
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,168
Let's pretend
we don't know what's going on.

116
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,836
I told you it's nothing like that.

117
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,925
If I may,

118
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,347
I'd like to talk to her in private.

119
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,268
-Right? Okay.
-Go ahead.

120
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,603
You must have a lot to talk about.

121
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,355
-We'll give you some privacy.
-Of course.

122
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,981
-Take your time.
-Enjoy your time.

123
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,733
You can take as long as you need.

124
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,651
Let's go.

125
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,632
Drink this.

126
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,008
All right. Thanks.

127
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,470
I'm sorry.
It was pretty hectic, wasn't it?

128
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,638
Well,

129
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,184
I'd say it was a valuable time

130
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,229
for me to learn what you thought of me.

131
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,439
A jerk

132
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,023
and a douchebag

133
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,983
with a rotten personality.

134
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,280
Don't take those jokes too seriously.

135
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,073
They're such jokesters.

136
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,119
You must be super close.

137
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,913
We're practically family.

138
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,751
You have a great family.

139
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,009
But why did you actually come here?

140
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,472
Well, you didn't look too well earlier,

141
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,433
so I was worried that something was wrong

142
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,560
or that you might be sick.

143
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,610
Even so, you shouldn't have
left your girlfriend to come see me.

144
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,944
On her birthday, no less.

145
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,738
She's not my girlfriend.

146
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,366
-She isn't?
-No, she isn't.

147
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,826
Then why did you hug her?

148
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,037
-What?
-Why did you hug her

149
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,788
when she's not even your girlfriend?

150
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,374
Is your chest just open to anyone?

151
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,168
What are you, a public rest area?

152
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,221
Don't tell me
you're feeling jealous right now.

153
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,225
Me?

154
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,268
Why would I be jealous? No way.

155
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,561
What do you mean?

156
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,147
Your eyes are blazing with jealousy.

157
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,109
Nothing's blazing here.

158
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,945
Look.

159
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,821
No matter who you date,

160
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,991
I don't care in the slightest.

161
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,577
Fine.

162
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,663
Since you're so insistent,

163
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,206
I'll make sure

164
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,708
no one ever comes into my arms.

165
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,419
I never asked you to do that.

166
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,504
Fine.

167
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,548
From now on,

168
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,968
I'll make sure
there are no more uncertainties.

169
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,178
So don't worry.

170
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,138
I'm telling you, it's not like that.

171
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,433
Are you sure?

172
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,639
All right.

173
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,851
I'll play along.

174
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,285
What was that?

175
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,536
Are they dating now?

176
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,913
Must be nice.

177
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,168
-Have a great time.
-Take your time.

178
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,329
Shall we go on a date?

179
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,831
Right now?

180
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,917
It's too late.

181
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,879
What about tomorrow morning?

182
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,631
We have to go to work.

183
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,759
Then what time works for you?

184
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,721
The best time to eat,
the best time to drink tea,

185
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,308
or the best time to have a drink.

186
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,727
Let me know
what times are convenient for you.

187
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,064
I'll think about it.

188
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,860
Why do you need to think about it?

189
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,695
Can't it just be whenever you want?

190
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,782
I need to check my schedule.

191
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,349
You should get going.

192
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,684
Already?

193
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,687
Let's take a few more laps around.

194
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,397
I'll give up my precious time.

195
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,025
I humbly decline your precious time.

196
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,277
Hurry up and go now.

197
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,778
Don't tell me to leave.

198
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,615
I'll leave when the time is right.

199
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,870
I think now is the right time.

200
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,915
All right then.

201
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,334
After one last lap.

202
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,839
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

203
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,675
I'm just trying to protect you.

204
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,511
Don't get your hopes up
about anything else.

205
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,973
I wasn't expecting anything else.

206
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,977
Anyway, people drive
so aggressively around here.

207
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,438
It's too dangerous for you
to walk around alone.

208
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,401
I can watch out for any cars if I need to.

209
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,320
So let go of my hand and leave.

210
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,780
I think people are sleeping.

211
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,449
Let's be quiet.

212
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,076
Keep it down a bit.

213
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,011
HAWAIIAN SUN, HAWAIIAN HOST

214
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,931
DIOR PERFUME 30 ML

215
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,267
Hello.

216
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,813
Do you need something?

217
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,569
You've been coming to work
with a young dude these days.

218
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,613
Are you two dating?

219
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,117
I'm asking you.

220
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,285
Are you two dating?

221
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,205
Let go while I ask nicely.

222
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,670
Does he know about us?

223
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,422
Is it fun messing around
with a younger man?

224
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,926
What's it to you?

225
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,511
It's none of your business.

226
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,472
Do you want me to reveal

227
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,849
the skeleton in your closet?

228
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,602
What's wrong?

229
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,688
Are you scared?

230
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,816
That's why you should quit acting up.

231
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,944
You acting like this
makes me want to run my mouth.

232
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,487
Don't you dare say anything.

233
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,157
If you do,
I won't let you get away with it.

234
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,329
I love that fiery glare of yours.

235
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,373
This is why I can't get over you.

236
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,585
Does your wife know you act like this?

237
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,350
Hello, sir.

238
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,268
Hey.

239
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,312
Ro-un,

240
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,689
what do you think
of a woman with a dirty past?

241
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,984
A sly woman

242
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,652
who hides her true identity.

243
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,406
Why…

244
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,662
are you asking me that all of a sudden?

245
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,165
Then again,

246
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,125
why do I bother asking?

247
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,752
No man would like that.

248
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,464
Well then. I'll leave you guys to it.

249
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,898
If you ever run into problems
or need any help,

250
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,108
you can tell me everything.

251
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,444
All right?

252
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,511
Hello, how are you?

253
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,137
Not good. Why are you asking?

254
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,390
I'm already so pissed.

255
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,058
Are you making fun of me?

256
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,393
Just get changed.

257
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,812
What is this?

258
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,523
I was told to doll you up and escort you.

259
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,068
I heard they even sent a helicopter
just to save you.

260
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,070
You're really something.

261
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,614
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,741
Is that how you should say sorry?

263
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,995
Do you think I'm a joke
because I delivered clothes to you?

264
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,705
Do you think you're all that now?

265
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,622
No, ma'am.

266
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,957
What are you doing?

267
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,043
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

268
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,879
I was teaching her basic manners.

269
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,341
She lacks basic propriety
but lucked out and rose to the top.

270
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,385
It seems to have gone to her head.

271
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,850
Ms. Kim, did you climb up the ladder
because you lucked out?

272
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,892
Sorry?

273
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,813
I obviously climbed up the ladder
due to my competence alone.

274
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,772
Of course.

275
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,734
No one at King Hotel
can climb their way up on luck alone.

276
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,905
On top of that, King the Land is only open
to the most competent employees.

277
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,323
Am I right?

278
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,825
You are. But--

279
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,786
Sa-rang was chosen as the best talent
for two consecutive years.

280
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,913
As a result, she got to promote the hotel.

281
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,332
Her success is a result
of her own efforts.

282
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,169
It's not because she was lucky.

283
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,086
Understood?

284
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,796
Yes, ma'am.

285
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,090
If you ever mistreat my concierges again,

286
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,342
I'll have to give you a lesson in manners.

287
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,053
Why are you here?

288
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,473
Ms. Gu told me
to get her ready for a press conference.

289
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:42,186
She ordered that Ms. Cheon
look elegant from head to toe.

290
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,396
I can help her. You may leave.

291
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,481
Yes, ma'am.

292
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,346
Just read off the script.

293
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,974
All the questions will be directed at me,
so don't worry.

294
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,267
Yes, ma'am.

295
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,561
PRESS CONFERENCE ANSWER SHEET

296
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,314
This part is slightly unsettling.

297
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,024
What?

298
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,902
It says I was
in a life-and-death situation,

299
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,987
but it wasn't that serious.

300
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,697
That doesn't matter.

301
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,242
People don't care about the facts.

302
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,201
They want drama.

303
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,620
That is why we need to tell a story.

304
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,289
That would be deceiving them.

305
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,795
Do you know how much it cost
just to rescue you?

306
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,589
The company paid for it.

307
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,175
Don't you even feel sorry?

308
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,721
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,809
I arranged this event
to help you ease your guilt.

310
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,312
The PR team even created a story for you.

311
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,730
How convenient, right?

312
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,399
We're all doing you a favor.

313
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,068
So you should do your best too.

314
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,155
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,948
Read the last part.

316
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,616
Right now?

317
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,951
Yes, right now.

318
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,124
"I was stranded
in a life-and-death situation

319
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,333
due to extreme weather."

320
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,044
"I am thankful that King Hotel…"

321
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,714
…AND MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

322
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,926
What is it? Is there a problem?

323
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,973
The person who rescued me
was Head Manager Gu.

324
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,850
I authorized the helicopter.

325
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,728
He doesn't have that authority.

326
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,106
So I'm the only one you need to thank.

327
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,233
Read it again.

328
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,370
Best date spots in Seoul.

329
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,756
"Sweet and romantic.
Don't worry, we have you covered."

330
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,258
-Are you going on a date?
-Nice.

331
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,927
What are you doing?

332
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,387
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

333
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,472
Who's your date?

334
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,389
No one.

335
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,766
There's no date.

336
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,142
Yes, it is. Look.

337
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,185
Come on.

338
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,024
I was just trying to check and see

339
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,319
if our hotel was
on the list of date spots.

340
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,823
What was that snicker?

341
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,410
Do you even know what it's like
to be on a date?

342
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,330
-Of course I do.
-Of course you don't.

343
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,625
I have the ultimate skill that can steal
a woman's heart in one minute.

344
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,044
Do you want me to teach you?

345
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,422
In one minute?

346
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,465
One minute.

347
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,641
You think I would learn

348
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,268
from you?

349
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,232
A date

350
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,402
is like a war in which you must
win a woman's heart.

351
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,863
And do you know
the key thing to help you do so?

352
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:23,865
What is it?

353
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,493
Right. You said you didn't need my help.

354
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,661
Jeez.

355
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,788
I'll do you a favor and listen.

356
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,498
Okay.

357
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,125
You probably didn't know this,

358
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,669
but you have to get her to notice you.

359
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,838
Stay within her line of sight

360
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,924
and brush past her sometimes
as if it were a chance encounter.

361
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:41,842
Get it?

362
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,385
That would be stalking her.

363
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,012
You can't make it obvious.

364
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,847
You have to appear,

365
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,141
then disappear.

366
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,351
Get close but not too close.

367
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,477
You get it?

368
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,396
Then she'll think,

369
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,274
"Why do I keep running into him?"

370
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,484
"Can it mean something?"

371
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,902
Just when you're on her mind,

372
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,404
you have to disappear.

373
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,407
Then she'll start missing you
and thinking about you.

374
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,159
Then it's game over.

375
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,328
That'll work?

376
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,079
Of course. It definitely will.

377
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,297
Goodness.

378
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,548
Where are you going?

379
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,216
I have something to report.

380
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,760
Does it have to do with me?

381
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,056
Not really, but you still need to
have an idea of the company's--

382
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,434
From now on, if it's unrelated to me,

383
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,102
don't report it.

384
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,317
How entertaining.

385
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,514
Do you need anything else, sir?

386
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,351
No. I just stopped by as I was passing by.

387
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,727
Don't mind me.

388
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,686
Yes, sir.

389
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,777
Are you looking for someone?

390
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,155
Did all the employees clock in?

391
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,615
Yes, sir.

392
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,243
Why don't I see Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

393
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,453
She went to a press conference.

394
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,541
A press conference?

395
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,627
PRESS CONFERENCE ON KING HOTEL
SUPER FARMER WEEK EMERGENCY RESPONSE

396
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,640
You could've just waited
after reporting it to emergency services.

397
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:57,269
Instead, you called all the board members
for an emergency meeting at night.

398
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,186
Is it true?

399
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,105
Yes. An employee was in danger.

400
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,024
Was there a reason
for your personal involvement?

401
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,194
I received news that the search
was being delayed due to the weather.

402
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,904
She was alone in the mountains.

403
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,239
Of course I had to.

404
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,993
Dispatching a helicopter
just to save one employee

405
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,453
was probably not an easy decision
for the company.

406
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,788
No. It was easy.

407
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,206
Once again,

408
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,000
an employee was in danger.

409
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,754
I'm sure it was difficult not to consider
the expense of dispatching the helicopter.

410
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,090
Don't companies these days,
especially conglomerates,

411
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,509
usually act in their own interests?

412
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,719
That is true.

413
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,512
Profit comes first for any company.

414
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,932
But the employees
are the ones who generate that profit.

415
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,519
That's why we say
that the employees are its true owners.

416
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,814
It sounds like your employees
can really trust the company.

417
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,983
It is my responsibility
to make that possible.

418
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,569
I have a question for the employee.

419
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,362
Do you have

420
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,156
any last words for the company?

421
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,991
I was stranded

422
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,911
in a life-and-death situation
due to extreme weather.

423
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,664
I am thankful that King Hotel

424
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,583
and Managing Director Gu Hwa-ran
came to my rescue.

425
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,255
Managing Director Gu,
do you have a message for your employees?

426
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,173
Excuse me.

427
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,719
Can I say one last thing?

428
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,573
There was someone who flew
through the storm in the helicopter.

429
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,706
Thank you, Head Manager Gu Won,
from the bottom of my heart.

430
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,015
Thank you very much.

431
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,403
Ms. Gu, please look over here.

432
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,853
"Third-generation business leaders
are on the rise."

433
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,938
They talk as if
that's just gotten started.

434
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,984
"When Managing Director Gu Hwa-ran
learned of the plight of her employee,

435
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,819
she held an emergency board meeting

436
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,988
and dispatched a helicopter herself to…"

437
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,365
She stole your spotlight.

438
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,075
You're the one who dispatched it.

439
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,034
This is absurd.

440
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,244
Mr. Gu, you have to learn this from her.

441
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,871
Her self-promotion

442
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,166
has the press printing out rumors
that the successor has been chosen.

443
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,127
Are you listening to me? Are you?

444
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,546
The owner of the company is speaking.

445
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,216
I mean…

446
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,219
It says here that the employees
are the owners of the company.

447
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,887
Why didn't you tell me
about the press conference?

448
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,640
You told me not to report
anything unrelated to you.

449
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,058
How was this unrelated to me?

450
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,976
A King the Land employee
being dragged away

451
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,229
and manipulated like a puppet
deserves a report.

452
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,271
Then make it clear.

453
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,731
How much do you want to know?

454
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,857
I'll report everything.

455
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,944
Only things that have to do with me.

456
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,903
Exactly.

457
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,321
How involved do you want to get?

458
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,989
For example,

459
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,992
schemes Ms. Gu employs
to secure her spot as the successor?

460
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,912
I don't need to know that,
nor do I want to.

461
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,039
Then what about this?

462
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,252
In a few days, a prince named Samir
from the Middle East will visit Korea.

463
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,711
He's the 13th richest man in the world,

464
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,463
and his one-night stay
is worth a month's sales.

465
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,007
Every hotel in Korea is at war
to get him to stay at their hotel.

466
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,885
Even Ms. Gu tried, but she failed.

467
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,555
You can use this point
to your advantage, sir.

468
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,348
That has nothing to do with me.

469
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,475
Report about my employees only.

470
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,061
Who?

471
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,522
-Should I do a background check?
-No.

472
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,441
I want to know who's having a tough time

473
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,776
or being treated unfairly.

474
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,445
That's all I need.

475
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,406
All employees have it rough
and are treated unfairly.

476
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,366
That comes with the job description.

477
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,409
Mr. Gu,

478
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,747
if you really want to get involved,
you have to let me brief you.

479
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,583
I know you're displeased
with how Ms. Gu is acting.

480
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,543
You need to gain power

481
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,379
in order to protect your employees.

482
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,010
Don't stare me down like that.

483
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,138
Gain the power
that's suitable for your position.

484
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,663
You did exceptionally well
at today's press conference.

485
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,416
The successor of a company
isn't just decided internally.

486
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,001
Public opinion matters too.

487
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,296
It reflects who comes to mind
when they think of our group.

488
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,839
Are you trying to lecture me?

489
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,091
I'm sorry, ma'am.

490
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,678
Are we out of options with Prince Samir?

491
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,724
First Royal Hotel is already
in negotiations regarding his stay.

492
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,436
We tried everything, but he was obstinate.

493
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,689
Is this what I have to hear
after six months of groundwork?

494
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,942
I'm sorry, ma'am.

495
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,152
But there's nothing we can do.

496
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,200
Let's give up then.

497
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,035
From now on,

498
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,704
it's none of our business.

499
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,051
Was it you?

500
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,680
You had her mention your name?

501
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,809
Or was it Sa-rang's own decision?

502
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,813
I made her do it.

503
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,064
I did save her after all.

504
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,358
So you piggybacked off of my plan.

505
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,402
Don't you think it's pathetic?

506
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,112
It's better than deceiving others.

507
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,115
I enjoyed the show though.

508
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:11,202
"The employees
are the true owners of the company."

509
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,914
Is that what you really think?

510
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,999
Of course.

511
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,084
The owners of the company
are the employees.

512
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,379
And I happen to own the employees.

513
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,881
How shameless of you.

514
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,132
I pay them.

515
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,010
In any world, the person
who provides the money is the owner.

516
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,720
If you really think that way,

517
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,223
you don't deserve to become

518
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,517
the owner of the group.

519
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,104
Then do you?

520
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,566
Do you realize
how much damage you've caused?

521
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,652
I'm the one who restored what you damaged.

522
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,324
Though I'm sure the economic impact
generated by today's articles

523
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,700
will go over your head.

524
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,994
Don't calculate someone's worth
with money.

525
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,456
This is why you're not good enough.

526
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,001
The head of a company
must maximize its profits,

527
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,920
even if it means putting on an act.

528
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,047
The company can't exist without me,

529
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,424
and the employees
can't exist without the company.

530
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,475
Well done, Ms. Gu.

531
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,854
You demonstrated
how to improve the company's image.

532
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,566
Today's articles on the economy
are all about you, Ms. Gu.

533
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,653
Your story is continuing to
circulate on social media,

534
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,571
and journalists are writing about it.

535
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,781
Is that so?

536
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,368
I didn't think that far ahead,
but I'm glad we attracted publicity.

537
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,788
What about the Arab prince?

538
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,831
I think he will stay at First Royal Hotel.

539
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,667
If it isn't official yet,

540
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,127
do whatever it takes
to bring him to our hotel.

541
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,754
We should,

542
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,632
but King the Land is in charge
of inviting and managing our VIP guests.

543
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,635
So it's Head Manager Gu's responsibility.

544
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,014
Then you should do whatever it takes
to bring him to our hotel.

545
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,101
If they take him,
it won't just be a matter of sales.

546
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,229
This could determine
the industry's leading position.

547
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,564
It could change the game.

548
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,524
Do you understand?

549
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,902
Why aren't you answering?

550
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,320
Didn't you make any preparations?

551
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,242
If you're not up for it, tell me.

552
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,495
That way, your sister can take action.

553
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,877
I'll do it.

554
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,715
Are you confident?

555
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,759
I'll bring the Arab prince to our hotel,

556
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,345
even if I have to put on an act.

557
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,764
Good.

558
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,618
You know there was a banquet today, right?

559
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,037
Do you know how busy we were?

560
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,998
You're lucky you got to slack off.

561
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,250
The world is so unfair.

562
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,587
I wasn't slacking off.

563
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,214
I was following Ms. Gu's orders
for a scheduled event.

564
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,883
That's not my problem.

565
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,344
We served the guests when it was busiest,

566
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,139
so you can clean up on your own, right?

567
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:21,976
By myself?

568
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,353
No one was able to rest
because we were so busy.

569
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,897
We'll be in the staff lounge.

570
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,440
Call us when you're done.

571
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,441
Let's go, guys.

572
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,693
Good luck.

573
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,071
So you wanted to thank me?

574
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,157
Sorry?

575
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,118
I mean…

576
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,745
Since you're thankful,
let's have some coffee.

577
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,585
I'm extremely busy right now.

578
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,087
I have to rearrange everything
before break time ends.

579
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,508
Then I'll help you.

580
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,940
Wait. That's not how you do it.

581
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,446
Don't I just have to cover it?

582
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,573
There are no "justs" in the hotel.

583
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:44,994
The edges of the tablecloth need to
hang evenly at the perfect angle.

584
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:48,581
Is all of that necessary
when they'll only be used once?

585
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,752
A lot of people
devote their time and energy

586
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,962
to satisfy the guests
that'll be sitting here.

587
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,131
And I'm spreading out their devotion.

588
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,217
Isn't it fine as long as it's neat?

589
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,927
Do you have to give meaning to it?

590
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,055
If I don't,

591
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,141
the things that I do become chores
that can be done by anyone.

592
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,018
However,

593
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,647
if I give meaning to it, it becomes
something special that only I can do.

594
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:19,153
That also gives meaning
to my career as a hotel concierge.

595
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,915
I'll spread out that devotion with you.

596
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,876
Teach me.
I'll learn how to do it properly.

597
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,008
All right.

598
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,596
Then try grabbing the edge like this.

599
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,098
-The edge?
-Yes.

600
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,850
-And…
-Like this?

601
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,311
No, you can't stretch it out like that.

602
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,438
Let's see. This much?

603
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,820
-Is this good?
-No.

604
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,906
There still needs to be some tightness,

605
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,324
so around this much.

606
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,704
So…

607
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,416
if it can't be too tight…

608
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,625
Yes.

609
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,627
…or too loose,

610
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,754
I can just hold it however I want.

611
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,805
Just leave. I can do it by myself.

612
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,224
Fine. I'll put in more care and effort.

613
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,768
How do I do it? Like this?

614
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,022
Yes.

615
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,400
All right.

616
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,569
On the count of three,

617
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,029
you're going to gently let go.

618
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,531
-Gently?
-One, two, three.

619
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,952
Good.

620
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,751
Are we done now?

621
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,343
Yes, you did a good job.

622
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,554
Well, of course.

623
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,680
I'm good at everything.

624
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,557
Lucky you.

625
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,561
I just dropped in while I was passing by.

626
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:21,979
I know.

627
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,397
Just in case

628
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,693
you were thinking that I came on purpose.

629
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,904
I wasn't.

630
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,909
Why don't you ever think about me?

631
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,079
All I said was I didn't think
you came on purpose.

632
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,290
I never said I don't think about you.

633
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,715
That's true.

634
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,344
There's no way
you wouldn't think about me.

635
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,850
Follow me.
There's still so much left to do.

636
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,694
Hurry up.

637
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,579
Grab the end and lay it down gently again.

638
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,998
One, two, three.

639
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,920
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

640
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,900
What do you want for dinner?

641
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,152
-Anything but short ribs.
-No short ribs.

642
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,782
I hope you guys weren't slacking off
while I was away.

643
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,578
If you're that worried,
you can work with us.

644
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,662
Why would I do that?

645
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,747
Mark my words.

646
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,667
I'm watching all of you like a hawk.

647
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,085
Yes, ma'am.

648
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,464
I was thinking of having
a team dinner this week.

649
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,633
Let me know when you all are free.

650
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,220
For the record, I'm busy every day

651
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,763
except for Thursday.

652
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,558
Then we can do Thursday.

653
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,935
Really?

654
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,021
If that's what you want.
What should we eat?

655
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,647
Whatever the girls want to eat.

656
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,399
What do you want to eat?

657
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,402
-Sashimi. It's been a while.
-You're right.

658
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,446
I went to a sushi buffet
and had my fill yesterday.

659
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,656
I'm sick of eating raw fish.

660
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,116
What about grilled beef intestines?

661
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,784
How do you eat that stuff?

662
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,077
Then Ms. Do,

663
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,997
what do you think of a family restaurant?

664
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,999
Are you a kid?
Should we throw a birthday party?

665
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,585
What about pork trotters?
The place next door is good.

666
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,420
How dare you put trotters
on the dining table?

667
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,921
They stink.

668
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,633
We can go wherever you want.

669
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,509
Just decide among yourselves.

670
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,303
Must I decide everything for you?

671
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,931
Then we'll let you know
after discussing it.

672
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,935
The place we went to last time…

673
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,354
What was it called again?

674
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,689
Gosh.

675
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,066
They had good short ribs.

676
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,819
You know, I'm just saying.

677
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,031
-Well, then.
-Goodbye.

678
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,908
Have a good evening.

679
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,995
Why did she have to say
she wanted short ribs

680
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,372
in such a roundabout way?

681
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,041
She was just trying to sugarcoat it.

682
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,752
I'll call them to make a reservation.

683
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,711
Yes, ma'am.

684
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,422
Five servings of fresh short ribs.

685
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,132
Wait. Marinated ribs are best here.

686
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,093
-Can you make those marinated?
-Sure.

687
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,054
They like fresh ribs.

688
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,931
How much did the revenue increase by?

689
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,100
Around 15%.

690
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,478
At this rate,
we'll be able to achieve our goal of 20%.

691
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,897
Why don't we increase it by another 10%?

692
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,776
That's ridiculous.
We're already overworked as it is.

693
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,569
You'll get an incentive trip.

694
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,863
We were already promised one
if we reached 20%.

695
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,157
Instead of three days in Jeju,

696
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,576
let's go to Southeast Asia for six days.
How's that?

697
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,162
Bali, Phuket, Cebu, Kota Kinabalu…

698
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,123
Choose wherever you want to go.

699
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,916
-Really?
-Of course.

700
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,085
If we increase our sales,
we can go anywhere.

701
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,586
You can do it, right?

702
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,713
But still, 30% is a bit far-fetched.

703
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,007
If you think it's impossible, it is.

704
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,635
If you think it's possible,
you can do anything.

705
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,263
It all depends on you, Ms. Gang.

706
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,182
Da-eul, let's make it happen.

707
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,686
If we add another 10%,
we won't be able to take any breaks.

708
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,979
Are you okay with that?

709
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,856
Yes, we don't need any breaks.

710
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,024
Of course.

711
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,569
What could go wrong
when we have you, Ms. Gang?

712
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,654
Okay. To our vacation.

713
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,573
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

714
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,751
Did you hear the news?

715
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,546
The Arab prince is staying at our hotel.

716
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,967
He has refined taste
befitting a member of the royal family.

717
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,887
He knows for a fact
which hotel is the best in Korea.

718
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,723
We're named First Royal Hotel
for a reason.

719
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,101
I heard it was a provisional contract.

720
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,813
Goodness. You should know better.

721
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,940
He already reserved
a week's worth of meals,

722
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,319
and we changed
the curtain colors and toilet.

723
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,778
How is that provisional?

724
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,448
You never know
until everything's set in stone.

725
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,452
Jeez. You two fight like cats and dogs.

726
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,746
When will you grow up?

727
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,748
Just admit that you're jealous.

728
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,668
Anyway, the tables have turned.

729
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,961
First Royal is number one.

730
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,671
King Hotel is number two.

731
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,882
That means King the Land is second too.

732
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,514
Our best talent.

733
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,265
How is she your best talent?

734
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,850
She's my hotel's best talent.

735
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,772
The Arab prince
will be staying at our hotel.

736
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,150
Come and greet him
as my hotel's employee representative.

737
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,486
-Pardon?
-Goodness.

738
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,322
Stop bothering my hardworking employee
with your nonsense.

739
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,243
I might be able to give you this hotel,
but I'll never let you have her.

740
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,912
Do you want to bet?

741
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:12,829
Yes.

742
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,414
Just make a bet.

743
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,626
Man up and bet your hotels.

744
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,629
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

745
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,592
Is that so?

746
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,522
-What?
-I have bad news for you.

747
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,483
The Arab prince is coming to my hotel.

748
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,237
-What?
-My son, Won, got it done.

749
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,365
A hotel's history and reputation
are what make it number one.

750
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,200
Hold on.

751
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,577
When the Arab prince comes,

752
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,329
you can greet him
as our employee representative.

753
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,539
Okay?

754
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,709
Yes, sir. Thank you.

755
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,461
Hey, it's me.

756
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,505
What happened?

757
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,383
What happened with the Arab prince?

758
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,719
We even changed the toilet!

759
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,387
Good work.

760
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,556
As expected of my son.

761
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,765
You have tricks up your sleeve.

762
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,643
I heard he already made the down payment.

763
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,978
Is he really coming to our hotel?

764
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,771
Yes, I called him.

765
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,317
The prince changed his mind
after a single call from you?

766
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,778
How is that possible?

767
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,323
I know, right?

768
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,783
But it was possible.

769
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,025
Is he really your friend?

770
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,902
Even the legal team
has never seen such a contract.

771
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,822
He's not my friend.

772
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,407
We're just acquaintances.

773
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,660
It'd be better were he a stranger.
Look at the contract.

774
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,121
"You will always answer me with 'yes.'"

775
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,289
"You will always serve me with a smile."

776
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,374
How is that a contract?

777
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,834
He's just looking for a slave.

778
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,836
You can't sign it.

779
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,462
Why not?

780
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,588
You just can't.

781
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,466
He's going to shove you around.

782
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,427
What does he take you for?

783
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,638
You're a selfish jerk
who doesn't listen to others.

784
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,724
You've never smiled at anyone.

785
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,100
You'll definitely break the contract.

786
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,768
Who's going to deal with it? Me?

787
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,312
-I can't.
-Why not?

788
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,314
Do you think I'm a douchebag

789
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,358
with a rotten personality?

790
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,777
Did someone say that to you?

791
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,779
I don't think you're that bad.

792
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,782
I told you not to sign it.

793
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,119
You've never kowtowed to
or served anyone before.

794
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,245
I can just half-ass it.

795
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,748
No, you can't.

796
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,583
You won't be able to stand him.

797
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,751
Do you want to see?

798
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,627
-What?
-Here.

799
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,755
Imagine I'm Prince Samir.

800
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,931
Hey, Gu Won.

801
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,559
Come take my shoes off

802
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,144
and bring me some slippers.

803
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,400
You have to say "yes" sincerely
with a smile on your face.

804
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,862
Or else I won't pay a single penny
for breach of contract.

805
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,825
Yes.

806
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,743
Great.

807
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,453
Good job.

808
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,878
Come over here.

809
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,131
I should lift up my right leg.

810
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,301
I want you to get down on your knees.

811
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,603
Easy.

812
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:49,940
Good job.

813
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,566
Make sure you polish my shoes.

814
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,860
They're very expensive.

815
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,241
What did I tell you? Goodness.

816
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,160
Get

817
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,286
over here!

818
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,751
Prince Samir,
the 13th richest person in the world,

819
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,253
has arrived in Korea.

820
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,213
His trip was announced as leisure travel,

821
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:17,175
but it seems his purpose is to negotiate
the import of next-generation warplanes.

822
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,177
During his stay, he'll likely meet with

823
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,972
the head of the Defense Acquisition
Program Administration…

824
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,835
I only learned how to greet you in Arabic.

825
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,754
Welcome to King Hotel.

826
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,131
Are these flowers for me?

827
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,969
You're good at Korean.

828
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,389
Welcome.

829
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,101
How beautiful.

830
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,227
Thank you.

831
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,562
On behalf of the hotel,

832
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,399
I prepared a small gift from the heart.

833
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,234
Can I take a look at it now?

834
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,276
Yes, Your Highness.

835
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,489
You may be disappointed
because it's such a small gift.

836
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,450
It's a gift from your heart.
How could I be disappointed?

837
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,996
What is this?

838
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,373
It is a traditional Korean knot bracelet.

839
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,000
I had one prepared in green

840
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,294
as I heard green is associated
with abundance, sanctity, and paradise

841
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,754
in the Arab world.

842
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:01,923
I have a keen eye.

843
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,717
I'm incredible.

844
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,094
-Sorry?
-The moment I saw you,

845
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:09,514
I knew your heart
would be as beautiful as your face.

846
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,267
"Sa-rang."

847
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,436
Will you put it on for me?

848
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,568
Yes, Your Highness.

849
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,491
I'll put it on for you.

850
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,710
There.

851
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,046
You're all checked in,
so you can head straight to your room.

852
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,756
Follow me.

853
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,427
I received such a precious gift.

854
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,554
I must do something in return.

855
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,722
Have you eaten yet?

856
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,349
Sa-rang?

857
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:54,851
Sorry?

858
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,478
You have to hold it in, sir.

859
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,406
Why aren't you eating?

860
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,532
Do you want something else?

861
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,367
It's okay.

862
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,411
I don't even think
I can finish all of this.

863
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,996
You don't have to.

864
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,247
Just eat what's good.

865
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:17,916
Yes, Your Highness.

866
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,752
By the way,
I was surprised by your Korean skills.

867
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,839
My first love was Korean.

868
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,466
Really?

869
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,344
I studied hard to tell her how I felt,
but I got rejected.

870
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,304
What a horrible woman.

871
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,060
Maybe it was to meet you.

872
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,187
Like destiny.

873
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,913
Do you feel uncomfortable?

874
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,124
You look displeased.

875
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:00,959
Well…

876
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,837
This is where I work, actually.

877
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,925
So it's slightly uncomfortable to sit here
while everyone else is working.

878
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,136
-Should I tell them to leave?
-No, it's okay.

879
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,637
Please don't.

880
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,598
No…

881
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,559
Have you never eaten in places like this?

882
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,313
No, this is my first time.

883
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,942
It feels weird to be
sitting at the table that I set.

884
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,194
It seems people always put duty first

885
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,071
and enjoying their rights second.

886
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,532
I rented out this whole place for you.

887
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,117
You are the star of the day.

888
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,785
Enjoy it to the fullest.

889
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,830
Thank you.

890
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,213
How dare you sit down?

891
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,966
I want to enjoy my rights too.

892
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,718
I drove you,

893
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,928
opened the door for you,
and held your luggage.

894
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,847
I think I deserve to eat as well.

895
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,266
I'll give you food.
Eat over there by yourself.

896
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,684
Don't mind me.

897
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,771
You're an eyesore.

898
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,774
I'd like to say the same thing.

899
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,651
Hey,

900
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,362
don't you think
you've messed with me enough?

901
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,615
You had enough fun.

902
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,577
-You should stop now.
-I was already planning on it.

903
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,329
I don't need you anymore. Get going.

904
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,580
Okay. Good thinking.

905
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:25,376
I'll have our hotel's best employee
attend to you.

906
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,837
-Let's get up.
-No, you don't need to.

907
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,131
I already chose my attendant.

908
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,382
It's Sa-rang.

909
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,301
-Pardon?
-What, punk?

910
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,056
Not her.

911
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,308
Why not?

912
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,851
Because I said so.

913
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,353
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang is my…

914
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,480
personal assistant.

915
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,941
I am? Since when?

916
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:49,943
Starting today.

917
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,737
Remember the contract?

918
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,822
You have to say yes to everything I say.

919
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,588
Then I'll stay.

920
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,966
No, I don't need you. Get out.

921
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,425
Remember the contract?

922
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,094
I have to

923
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:20,223
stay next to you at all times.

924
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,418
The meeting is taking a while.

925
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,715
You don't have to go too far.

926
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:54,674
What do you mean?

927
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,427
I'm saying you don't have to
prepare a heartfelt gift

928
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,596
and serve him with your utmost sincerity.

929
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,015
He is an important guest of our hotel.

930
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,100
I should serve him
to the best of my ability.

931
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,229
You're being excessive.

932
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:18,573
King Hotel provides the best service
to all of our guests.

933
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,658
It is what we take pride in.

934
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,452
Just a moderate amount of kindness

935
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:25,705
is unacceptable
as an employee of King Hotel.

936
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,130
Still, don't give him such a pretty smile.

937
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,009
Do I look pretty when I smile?

938
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,471
I thought you hated my smile.

939
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,723
Well, it's not that pretty.

940
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,269
Then how do I have to smile
to not look pretty?

941
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,229
Like this?

942
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,441
Like this?

943
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,030
Stop it.

944
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,450
Just do what you've been doing.

945
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,410
You're not even going to listen to me.

946
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,079
No, I really don't know what you mean.

947
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,915
Ever since my first day here,

948
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,585
I kept smiling from ear to ear every day.

949
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,921
I even practiced smiling in my sleep.

950
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,258
I'm sure all of the King Hotel employees

951
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,761
have the best smiles in the nation.

952
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,472
Why would you practice even in your sleep?

953
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,057
Because I wanted to do well.

954
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,898
You're sincere about every little thing.

955
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,484
So,

956
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,821
you should also try your best
while you're at it.

957
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,406
Me?

958
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,408
Why?

959
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,453
Today, we're representing the hotel
as a team.

960
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,624
Let's work hard to make Prince Samir
think that he made the right call

961
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,042
by choosing King Hotel.

962
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,170
Bump.

963
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:58,673
Bump.

964
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,385
Bump.

965
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,599
Fine.

966
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,021
Teach me what to do

967
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,983
to be a good representative of the hotel.

968
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:20,611
All right.

969
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,281
First,

970
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:26,576
you have to greet the guest
with a bright smile.

971
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,952
Smile broadly.

972
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,168
Are you okay?

973
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,086
Whatever. Forget it.

974
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,840
I mean, the heart is first.
The expression is second.

975
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,802
You're not smiling
because someone asked you to.

976
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,721
It needs to be sincere.

977
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,932
The guests all know
how you're feeling inside

978
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,392
through your smile.

979
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,895
So try thinking in your mind,

980
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,023
"Welcome to our hotel!"

981
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,359
and then lightly smile.

982
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,123
Yes.

983
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,208
That's good.

984
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,878
Yes. It's a lot better than before.

985
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,090
See? You need to smile from the heart.

986
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,259
Sincerity is something you can feel.

987
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,555
So?

988
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,140
What do you think?

989
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,017
Sorry?

990
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,188
Can you feel my sincerity?

991
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,236
Can you feel my heart?

992
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,461
Sa-rang!

993
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,591
I'm done for the day. Let's go.

994
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,426
-No more meetings?
-No.

995
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,679
I agreed to buy your country's
fighter jets and ended it quickly.

996
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,722
Have you been on a jet before?

997
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,015
Why would I?

998
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,351
It's the best hobby.

999
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:18,688
They've gotten a lot cheaper,
so they only cost a hundred billion won.

1000
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,982
You should buy one for yourself.

1001
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,902
Sa-rang, I'll take you for a ride one day.

1002
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,238
Thank you.

1003
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:29,824
Sa-rang,

1004
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,325
what's that?

1005
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,248
It's the palace where
the kings of the Joseon Dynasty lived in.

1006
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,416
"Palace."

1007
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,002
I want to go there.

1008
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,589
Okay. Let's go.

1009
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:45,715
Let's go.

1010
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:46,799
I'm excited!

1011
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:48,885
You can leave.

1012
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:49,802
No.

1013
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,387
I'm going too.

1014
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,181
We're going together?

1015
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,650
Joseon kings walked along this path,

1016
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,110
and it's called eodo.

1017
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,072
Only the king was allowed
to walk down this path.

1018
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:13,868
Isn't it fascinating?

1019
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,929
How beautiful.

1020
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:37,433
You've seen everything.

1021
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:38,351
Let's go now.

1022
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,393
You go.

1023
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,561
I'll go if you go.

1024
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:41,729
Why you…

1025
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,564
Just go and buy some coffee.

1026
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,234
Coffee?

1027
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,861
I'm not someone who runs errands.

1028
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,238
Yes, you are. Remember the contract?

1029
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,325
I'll buy the coffee.

1030
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:55,534
What would you like?

1031
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,494
No.

1032
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,412
You are my special guest.

1033
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,164
Hurry up.

1034
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,009
You dare make me fetch you your coffee?

1035
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,594
How impertinent.

1036
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,103
This place seems oddly familiar.

1037
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,071
Korea is such a beautiful country.

1038
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,533
Among everything here,
you're still the most beautiful.

1039
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:38,786
Thank you.

1040
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,163
Sa-rang,

1041
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,165
do you have a boyfriend?

1042
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,464
Well, not yet.

1043
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,050
Really? What a blessing.

1044
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,553
I'd like to thank the heavens
for bringing me to you.

1045
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,179
I'm the one you should be thanking.

1046
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,223
Here.

1047
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,683
I bought this coffee myself,

1048
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,602
so you should enjoy it
with a thankful heart.

1049
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,562
Thank you.

1050
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:05,479
Hey.

1051
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,398
We were in the middle
of something important.

1052
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,441
Get lost.

1053
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,860
I can't even if I want to
because of the contract.

1054
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,571
-Isn't the coffee good?
-Yes.

1055
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,322
-Right?
-It's good.

1056
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,618
Sa-rang, what is that?

1057
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,583
It's a traditional nuptial experience.

1058
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,960
-"Nuptial"?
-A wedding.

1059
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,462
I want to try that

1060
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,255
with you.

1061
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,299
With me?

1062
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,468
Yes. Is there a problem?

1063
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,723
Well, I know it's just a fake experience,

1064
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,768
but it's usually done between couples.

1065
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:44,977
Don't take it seriously.

1066
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,395
It's just a cultural experience.

1067
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,480
Cut the crap.

1068
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,609
If you ever come with your girlfriend,

1069
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,194
I'll escort you back here.

1070
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,947
I just simply want to experience
traditional Korean culture.

1071
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,158
Traditional culture, my foot.
What a player.

1072
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,618
Am I asking for too much?

1073
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,835
It's a no-brainer.

1074
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:10,961
Don't do it.

1075
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:12,505
Remember the contract?

1076
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,006
"Obey no matter what."

1077
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,674
No, I didn't forget.

1078
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,052
I'm not saying
I won't stick to the contract.

1079
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,470
I'm going to break it.

1080
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:21,430
-What?
-I'll find you another hotel.

1081
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,598
Get out of my hotel.

1082
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:23,974
I paid good money.

1083
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,601
Can a bum like you make up for it?

1084
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,104
I gladly will.

1085
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:31,273
This contract

1086
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,067
is void.

1087
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:34,902
You can't.

1088
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,613
-I'll do it.
-Do what?

1089
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,866
That traditional wedding ceremony.

1090
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,494
You don't have to. Don't.

1091
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,871
It's just work.
It's not an actual wedding.

1092
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,165
I'll think of it as a meaningless event.

1093
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:52,086
So please don't ruin everything
over something like this.

1094
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,922
I'll go get prepared.

1095
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,883
Wait. But to me, it's--

1096
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:00,636
Your employee is better than you.

1097
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,471
Wait for me, Sa-rang!

1098
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:04,682
Sa-rang!

1099
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:06,934
A wedding.

1100
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,352
Sa-rang!

1101
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,687
It's a wedding.

1102
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,398
Sa-rang, wait for me.

1103
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:42,303
The bride's palanquin will enter.

1104
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:27,598
Now, the beautiful bride
will step forward.

1105
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:56,877
Groom, take a bow and step forward.

1106
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,843
KING THE LAND

1107
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:00,834
Hey!

1108
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,211
How dare you deceive me?

1109
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,630
You're our VVIP employee.

1110
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,215
You deserve to stay here tonight.

1111
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,426
I knew you'd look great
in an elegant garment like this.

1112
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,511
My love.

1113
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:11,512
Cheon Sa-rang.

1114
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:12,846
No. Let go of him.

1115
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,723
Wait, are you jealous?

1116
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:17,935
Since when did you care so much
about the company?

1117
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:22,815
I'm going to try and protect the people
that you deem as nobodies.

1118
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:26,443
If you keep beating around the bush,
you'll end up losing her.

1119
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,778
Just ask her out.

1120
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,114
I want to talk about us.

1121
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:37,329
