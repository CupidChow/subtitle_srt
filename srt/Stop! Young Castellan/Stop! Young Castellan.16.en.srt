00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,064
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,000
Lady Wu,

4
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,125
I have feelings for you.

5
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:36,500
What?

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,583
Is someone threatening you?

7
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,583
Or is someone following you?

8
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,708
I know you and Song are deeply in love.

9
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,583
But if I don't say it,

10
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,125
I will have regrets.

11
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,166
Meeting both you and Song

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,250
is my good fortune.

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,541
I...

14
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,583
really like both of you.

15
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,166
That's all I wanted to say.

16
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,083
Lady Wu,

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,250
sleep early.

18
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,125
Okay.

19
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,083
(Like both of us?)

20
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,750
(So does he like me)

21
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,750
(or does he like Song Lian?)

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,166
Castellan!

23
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:46,080
Xu Zicheng has sent men
to capture you.

24
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:46,916
You must escape

25
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,416
through the secret passage.

26
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:49,750
I'm not leaving.

27
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:51,290
Isn't he trying to capture me?

28
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,333
I'll go back with them.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,950
I can't let anything happen to you.

30
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:55,916
You must leave now!

31
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,791
There are so many buddies here.

32
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:03,083
To protect them,
you must not be captured.

33
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:07,875
Tell Xu Zicheng,

34
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,875
if he dares to harm anyone here,

35
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,125
I swear he won't get what he wants.

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,416
Okay. Please take Castellan and leave.

37
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,083
Come with me.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,791
Song Lian,

39
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,500
protect Castellan.

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,080
Where is the witch physician?

41
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,410
Find him for me.

42
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,000
Help me!

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,083
Or you'll all die!

44
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,583
Help!

45
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,958
Chatelain is insane!

46
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,250
Chatelain!

47
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,583
Why is this happening?

48
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:03,250
The medicine made by the physician

49
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,916
is no longer suppressing the poison?

50
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,916
I will make

51
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:16,541
the entire city bury me with them!

52
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:19,456
Okay!

53
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,708
I'll obey your command!

54
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,750
Where are you taking me?

55
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,791
Wherever you want to go, we'll go there.

56
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,232
Song Lian,

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,080
you promised you
wouldn't lie to me again.

58
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,166
Do you know another way
to cure Wuteng Poison?

59
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,916
Your blood contains

60
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:47,540
Wuying.

61
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,666
What does that mean?

62
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,583
The Wuying in your body
hasn't fully integrated.

63
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,958
This child may be affected
and die during childbirth.

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Even if it's born,

65
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,583
it may cause trouble.

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,583
Uncle,

67
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,083
I want to have this child for Yue.

68
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,790
Please help me.

69
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,583
Fine.

70
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,750
Fine All-knowing Auntie
in the Dark Market.

71
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,416
She might be able
to help you save this child.

72
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,583
Thank you, Uncle.

73
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,125
My grandfather's last wish was,

74
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,041
if all the Wuteng wasn't destroyed,

75
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,625
when the Wuteng Poison appeared,

76
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,291
I'd protect Young Castellan
of Wufengzhai.

77
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,250
So I guessed,

78
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,708
it was the child in Madam Rou's womb.

79
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:52,660
So...

80
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,916
My mother is Madam Rou?

81
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:01,875
What about Ouyang Jin?

82
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,625
It's impossible.

83
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,450
My father is Castellan of Wufengzhai.

84
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,660
Did you know that my blood
could detoxify the poison?

85
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
At first, I followed
my grandfather's wishes.

86
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,166
When Wuteng emerged,

87
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,416
I'd protect you.

88
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,208
Because one day,

89
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,208
when Wuteng Poison spreads,

90
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,250
your blood

91
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,791
can save the people of the city.

92
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:31,958
But,

93
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,750
I fell in love with you.

94
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,083
I couldn't sacrifice you.

95
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,125
So I had to stop you

96
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,250
(from uncovering the truth.)

97
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,583
Why?

98
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:49,120
But I promised you
I wouldn't lie to you anymore.

99
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,083
Song Lian,

100
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,250
if all this is true,

101
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,916
then this is my fate.

102
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,416
It's not your fault.

103
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:04,120
So who poisoned Wufengzhai

104
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:06,790
with Wuteng Poison?

105
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,541
I suspect

106
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,250
that Ouyang Jin's body

107
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,458
contains the Wuteng Poison.

108
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:18,958
He wants to use this

109
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:22,580
to lure out the descendant
of the witch physician to cure himself.

110
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,083
But why Wufengzhai?

111
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,958
Why my father?

112
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,291
Why?

113
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:33,580
We can pretend we don't know anything.

114
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:34,708
Leave this place.

115
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:36,958
Okay?

116
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,166
Song Lian,

117
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,166
can you do that?

118
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,458
You can't.

119
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,083
Neither can I.

120
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,791
I have to uncover the truth.

121
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,166
Flowers in the mirror,
moon in the water.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,583
The pursuit of truth

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,583
results

124
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:02,128
in nothing but emptiness.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,875
(He must be hiding something.)

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,791
All-knowing Auntie.

127
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,916
Little girl. You're here.

128
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,166
Auntie, I...

129
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,458
Come on.

130
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,708
It's time to tell you something.
