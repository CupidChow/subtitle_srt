=Stop! Young Castellan=

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,416
Young Master Qin and Young Master Song,

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,458
which one do you like better?

5
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:33,712
What?

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,000
Young Master Qin

7
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,958
takes care of you carefully.

8
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,500
About Young Master Song,

9
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:43,080
although he doesn't show it publicly,

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,708
he acts very properly.

11
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,750
Both of them are handsome.

12
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,875
It's really hard to choose.

13
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,208
They're both my buddies.

14
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,333
You're talking nonsense.

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,909
Hey, you're awake!

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,392
I'll help you drink your medicine.

17
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,375
I'm fine.

18
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,000
You can all leave now.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,608
Go ahead.

20
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:36,320
(Memorial Spirit Tablet)

21
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,083
Sweetheart,

22
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,458
this bandit has a kind heart.

23
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,375
Taking care of me when I was sick

24
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,375
and even picking flowers for you.

25
00:01:57,728 --> 00:02:00,912
(Liquor)

26
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,291
If I had known he was so easy to please,

27
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,750
I would have been his servant long ago.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,192
Sincerity moves mountains.
Perseverance carves stones.

29
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,916
It must be your sincerity

30
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,208
that touched him.

31
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:12,458
Well,

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,708
Young Castellan.

33
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:14,833
What goodies

34
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,291
are you hiding in that bag?

35
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:17,916
Nothing.

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,750
Just two jars
of plum liquor for my father.

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,791
Lady Wu, you're tired today.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,152
Let me carry it.

39
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,250
No need.

40
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,208
Who's there?

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,580
So they want to rob my liquor.

42
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,416
Lian, catch this!

43
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,083
Let's go!

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,910
Young Master Song, I'm scared.

45
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,672
Me too.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,291
I don't know martial arts.

47
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,500
If they can't defeat them,

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,104
we'll all be in trouble today.

49
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,333
Young Master Song,

50
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,791
I can take the liquor
and go down the mountain for help.

51
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,333
Alright.

52
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,458
You go first.

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,550
Okay.

54
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,680
Lady Wu, help me!

55
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,875
The liquor was robbed!

56
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,544
(Liquor)

57
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,083
It's my fault.

58
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,083
Let's go.

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,875
It's all my fault.

60
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,708
You're back.

61
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,672
I knew you were talented
and good-looking,

62
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:30,250
and you'd get me the "Drunk in Paradise"

63
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,784
Lady Yu, please behave.

64
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:34,958
Lady Yu,

65
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:37,360
Young Master Qin has completed his task.

66
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,528
You got the "Drunk in Paradise"?

67
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,583
It's my fault.

68
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,083
Young Castellan,

69
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,083
don't hide it.

70
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:51,958
Bring it out.

71
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,291
The aroma of "Drunk in Paradise"
cannot be hidden,

72
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,541
Young Castellan.

73
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,000
Song Lian,

74
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,579
you must have a dog's nose.

75
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,408
There's nothing
that can escape your senses.

76
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,458
So you had another trick up your sleeve.

77
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,208
I begged for this with all my might.

78
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:20,790
Let's go.

79
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,375
Go.

80
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,958
We are destined to meet.

81
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,750
So I would like to toast to you all.

82
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,125
Please.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,791
Good liquor!

84
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:40,875
This glass

85
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,500
is to the missed marriage
between Lady Wu and me.

86
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,375
Lady Wu can't handle much alcohol.

87
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,083
I'll take this one for her.

88
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,458
Don't you know

89
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,840
that drinking for someone
always doubt the amount?

90
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:58,750
Come on.

91
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,440
Two glasses left.

92
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:00,370
It's alright.

93
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,166
One more glass.

94
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,416
Another one.

95
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,416
The last one.

96
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,000
I can't drink anymore...

97
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,824
I really can't...

98
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,458
Young Master Song.

99
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,166
What did you give me to eat?

100
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:29,958
It's poison.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,166
Now I'm asking you a question.

102
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,416
You must answer truthfully.

103
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,750
Or your intestines will burst.

104
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:44,910
Translate the words on this.

105
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,958
I don't recognize it.

106
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,500
Still pretending?

107
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,916
I truly can't read
these gibberish symbols.

108
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,416
Even if you kill me,

109
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,580
I won't be able to translate it.

110
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,875
You're not from the Suo Clan.

111
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,666
I'm a genuine Han Chinese.

112
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,583
I've never heard of the Suo Clan.

113
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:06,750
How could that be?

114
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,750
Let's go.

115
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,200
Not giving her the antidote?

116
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,416
It's just a sleep-inducing medication.

117
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:19,200
Let's go.

118
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,125
I can still drink.

119
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:33,708
Slow down.

120
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:34,750
Here.

121
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,125
It's alright...

122
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:40,916
I'm fine...

123
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,750
Drink with me again...

124
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,250
You all went together.

125
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,583
Why is he drinking so much?

126
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,708
Lady Yun, leave him alone.

127
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,666
He'll clean up
when he wakes up tomorrow.

128
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,125
I'm used to handling these things.

129
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:01,875
But you two,

130
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,083
go back and wash up. Get rest early.

131
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:06,958
Yes.

132
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,000
We should wash up now.

133
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:08,620
Let's go.

134
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,699
After these days,

135
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,888
I haven't had a proper bath.

136
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,910
(Moon Pavilion)
Ah!

137
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,288
What's all the noise in the morning?

138
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,580
Lady Wu, don't misunderstand.

139
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,916
It's not what you think.

140
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,250
Let me explain.

141
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,208
I...

142
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,083
Since I was born,
I've been trampled upon.

143
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,125
Now, my innocence has been defiled.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,666
What face do I have left
to live in this world?

145
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,708
Lady Yun,

146
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,583
I won't take advantage
of others when drunk.

147
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,583
Please let me explain.

148
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,458
Lady Yun,

149
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,000
stop it right now. It's enough.
