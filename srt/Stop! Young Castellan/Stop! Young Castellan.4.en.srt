=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,984
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,120
The Red-Clad Heroic Thief

4
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,416
of unparalleled beauty.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,375
Such a renowned name,

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,416
how could I not know it?

7
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:35,000
Young Castellan,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,708
why are you

9
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,875
looking at me like that?

10
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,791
It's said he wears a mask

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,541
and no one has seen his true face.

12
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,458
Unless...

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,333
Unless you're one of his mindless fans

14
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,369
praising him blindly
without even meeting him.

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,952
The morals of our dynasty are
being corrupted by people like you.

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,541
Well,

17
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,500
Young Castellan,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,708
have you seen him?

19
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,083
Of course.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,166
He's just a petty thief.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,910
He couldn't even
withstand my three moves.

22
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:04,750
Yeah.

23
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,291
Hey,

24
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,166
wait for me.

25
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,125
Try your luck!

26
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,416
Young lady, try this one?

27
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,125
Here.

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,708
This is nothing

29
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,750
for me.

30
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:16,928
Almost got it.

31
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:19,916
There's still a chance.

32
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,208
Your turn.

33
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:25,583
What?

34
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,208
Aren't you

35
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,250
trying to blame

36
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,500
me for your failure?

37
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,750
Shut up and hurry up.

38
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,250
You're a weak physician, not a warrior.

39
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,750
If you can't aim properly,
I won't blame you.

40
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,583
Go and get it.

41
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,916
Hurry up and get new stock.

42
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,916
I'll come back next time.

43
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,291
Thanks.

44
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:52,750
Let's go.

45
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:03,208
All-knowing Auntie, we need you!

46
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,160
(All-knowing Auntie Knows Everything)

47
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,125
It's a surprise to see
an old friend return.

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,208
Auntie...

49
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,125
you know me?

50
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,000
Each person is limited
to one matter per year.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,250
Where's the item?

52
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:30,500
It's All-knowing Auntie's rule.

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,291
Exchange your most precious
possession for information.

54
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,666
It can be an object,

55
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,666
or it can be a secret.

56
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:43,708
This won't work.

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,540
My mother gave this to me.

58
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,750
I can't sleep without it.

59
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,208
You're not serious about this deal.

60
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
You can leave now.

61
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,708
Fine, we'll leave.

62
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,791
Wait...

63
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,291
Listen to me.

64
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,541
This is just an object.

65
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,875
We need to save someone's life.

66
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:00,410
All-knowing Auntie,

67
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,750
give us another chance.

68
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,250
Hurry up.

69
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,125
Here you go.

70
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,500
Tell me what this gibberish is.

71
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,250
The Suo Clan.

72
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,000
They suffered a natural disaster
years ago,

73
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,125
and most of their clan members died.

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,166
Where can we find them now?

75
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,750
One item for one question.

76
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,750
That's your second question.

77
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:40,660
All-knowing...

78
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,916
Are you a bandit?

79
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:45,040
If you don't want to do business,

80
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,000
then take your woman and leave.

81
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,410
What do you mean "his woman"?

82
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,208
- How...
- Alright.

83
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,583
Gosh.

84
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:54,870
All-knowing Auntie.

85
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,208
Take this.

86
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,458
Moon Pavilion?

87
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:08,700
All-knowing Auntie, thanks.

88
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,330
Let's go.

89
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:15,330
Have you seen this person?

90
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,416
I'm asking you,

91
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,583
have you seen this person?

92
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,416
Zhu,

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,958
you have a job.

94
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:30,416
Sui Feng,

95
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:30,958
let's leave.

96
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:38,910
Auntie,

97
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,000
sorry for disturbing you.

98
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,500
Have you seen this person?

99
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:46,120
Sir, this way, please.

100
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:47,488
Excuse me.

101
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:48,958
Hey,

102
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:50,560
what are they fighting for in there?

103
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,696
Someone is giving away silver?

104
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,160
Moon Pavilion's owner wants a husband.

105
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,458
Marrying her is like
marrying a golden mountain!

106
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:56,410
Looking for a husband?

107
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,125
Got it. If you become her husband,

108
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,916
and then we can be close by
and search for clues.

109
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not becoming her husband.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,256
(Moon Pavilion)
You go if you want.

111
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,410
I heard she's pretty.

112
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,789
My life will be without regrets
if I can marry her.

113
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,719
You just want her wealth!

114
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,310
I'll come out on top
with my martial arts.

115
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,640
(Lady Yu, Owner of Moon Pavilion)

116
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,291
What? Just look like this?

117
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,583
What an ugly birthmark.

118
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,958
I thought she was an absolute beauty.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,600
So disappointed.

120
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,580
Just a little fun to watch.

121
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,448
She's not even as pretty as my wife.

122
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:29,056
Hurry up! Gold beads!

123
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,583
Move aside! She gave them to me!

124
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,583
Don't push!

125
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,708
Who stepped on my foot?

126
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,456
I prepared this gift for you.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,791
Please be quiet.

128
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,583
White clothes...

129
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,416
Please be quiet.

130
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,541
I never expected there would be
so many gentlemen admiring me today.

131
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,872
It's really making it difficult
for me to choose.

132
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:51,750
Don't rely on your good looks
to act recklessly.

133
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,248
I've set up a fair and square arena.

134
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,708
There are two rounds.

135
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,083
- Anyone can join it.
- Are you attracted to my beauty?

136
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,500
The winner advances to the next round.

137
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,200
That's right.

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,520
- Before the contest,
- Do your best,

139
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,850
I'd like to toast to you.
and I'll marry you and make you my wife.

140
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,000
Your wife?

141
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,541
Take my candy,

142
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,583
and you'll have to be my wife.

143
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,496
(Lady Yun, Maid)

144
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,916
You wench!

145
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,600
I knew you were jealous of my beauty.

146
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,583
Lady, please spare me! I dare not.

147
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,166
Why get angry, beauty?

148
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,125
I can't wait any longer.
Let's start now.

149
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,083
In that case, let's begin now.

150
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,000
Get out of here now!

151
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,375
Yes.

152
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,583
I always admire brave men.

153
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,166
Is there anyone

154
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,416
willing to challenge him?

155
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:10,708
(Come on.)

156
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,056
(I'm on my way.)

157
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:14,700
I'll challenge him!

158
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,791
(That constable is chasing us
all the way here!)

159
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,125
Come back with me.

160
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,333
Well, who are you?

161
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,291
Young Castellan, you stole something,

162
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,333
so I'm here to arrest you.

163
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,583
Surrender now.

164
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,750
(Wanted List)
This young lady is delicate and lovely.

165
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,916
You should have mercy.

166
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,333
I give up! I lost!

167
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:01,750
Sir,

168
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,000
where are you going?

169
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,584
We should keep our distance.

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,000
Lady, please have some self-respect.

171
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:08,750
Sir!

172
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,208
This constable

173
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,125
ruined our plan to get close to Lady Yu.

174
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,250
Now it's a good chance
to get closer to her.

175
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,208
We can't use wit.

176
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:16,750
We have to rely on your brute force.

177
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:21,160
You've advanced to the next round.

178
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,250
Come with me to receive your next task.

179
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,083
Lady, sorry...

180
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,458
I wish you find a good husband soon.

181
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:34,500
(The plan was ruined
by that constable. )

182
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,583
(Then we'll just have to take Lady Yu.)

183
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
(Fortunately,
I'm also good at being a bandit.)
