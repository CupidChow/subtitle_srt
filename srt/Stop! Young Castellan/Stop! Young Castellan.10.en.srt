1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,064
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,916
(He wouldn't be out collecting herbs
in the middle of the night, would he?)

4
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,083
(That's not right.)

5
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,125
(If it's just about collecting herbs,)

6
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:40,080
(why would he need
to hide it from others?)

7
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,458
I'm full.

8
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,083
I...

9
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:48,288
I'll go to the market later

10
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,870
to inquire about Cloud Seeking Mountain.

11
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,583
Qin, thanks a lot.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,250
Young Castellan,

13
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,250
don't let Qin's business
suffer because of this.

14
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:58,833
It won't.

15
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,791
Lady Wu's matter is also important.

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,750
Qin, you're the best.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,370
Why did you hit me?

18
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,541
I didn't move at all.

19
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:19,625
Young Castellan,

20
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,291
it's a muscle cramp.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,750
You need to exercise more.

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,916
Then you should exercise more.

23
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,375
Qin,

24
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:31,910
don't you have important
matters to attend to?

25
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,500
Yes, I'll go now.

26
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:37,958
Take your time.

27
00:01:59,168 --> 00:01:59,840
Who's it?

28
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,208
Agarwood?

29
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,583
This bracelet is made of agarwood.

30
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,080
Hero, please spare my life!

31
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:22,200
I've committed a crime.

32
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:23,410
I know I'm wrong.

33
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:24,370
Please spare my life!

34
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,250
Let me go!

35
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:27,568
Young Castellan,

36
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:28,583
save me!

37
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,041
Save me!

38
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,500
It's here.

39
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,041
Dense Cloud Forest?

40
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,458
This is a homonym, not the same place
as Cloud Seeking Mountain.

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
Dense Cloud and Cloud Seeking...

42
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,166
It's like

43
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,791
"seeking the dense clouds".

44
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,583
I've asked the local people,

45
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,660
and none of them have heard
of Cloud Seeking Mountain.

46
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,625
But this

47
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,333
Dense Cloud Forest

48
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,583
is shrouded in poisonous mist.

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,791
The mist is like clouds,

50
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,750
which is why it's named so.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,540
I have a feeling that this is the place.

52
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:23,916
Young Castellan,

53
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:25,450
where did you get that feeling from?

54
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,458
You lack

55
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,125
a woman's sixth sense.

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,519
A woman's sixth sense?

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
What's that?

58
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,750
Song,

59
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,125
why are your eyes,

60
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,750
slightly red?

61
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:43,750
It might be because

62
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,910
I have some discomfort around my eyes.

63
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:46,916
It's fine.

64
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,083
If we're going there,

65
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,916
we need to make some preparations.

66
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,083
Don't worry.

67
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,416
I'll make an antidote

68
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,416
for the toxins tonight.

69
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,083
Okay.

70
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,666
Then I'll prepare some tools.

71
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,791
And I...

72
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,416
Young Castellan,

73
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,916
you should rest well.

74
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:06,291
Right.

75
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,541
Lady Wu,

76
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,333
everything is taken care of by us.

77
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,750
Us!

78
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,083
What's up?

79
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,125
Don't invite me to sit?

80
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,000
Alright, come in.

81
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,708
What do you want?

82
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:44,958
This time,

83
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,416
I came to return this

84
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:47,750
to you.

85
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,416
I forgot about it.

86
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,458
It's the first time

87
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,583
that I've seen you

88
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,291
so shy.

89
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,950
If there's nothing else,
you can go back.

90
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,208
I'm going to sleep.

91
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,750
I came here because,

92
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,416
I do have something to ask you.

93
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,333
I want to ask you

94
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,208
if we don't find

95
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,583
the Wuying this time,

96
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,083
what should we do?

97
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,416
I'll keep looking until I find it.

98
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:24,160
I have to save Wufengzhai
no matter what.

99
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,583
Okay.

100
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,166
Young Castellan,

101
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,500
get some rest early.

102
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:36,583
Song Lian.

103
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes?

104
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:38,916
What's wrong?

105
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,416
Do you have anything else
hidden from me?

106
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,375
No, nothing.

107
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,416
Okay.

108
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:52,708
Goodnight.

109
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,083
Goodnight.

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,129
Wait a second.

111
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,440
(Dense Cloud Forest)

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,916
Take this.

113
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:25,541
What's it?

114
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,950
Protect you from the miasma poison.

115
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:28,288
The effect lasts for four hours.

116
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,333
I don't think I need it.

117
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,950
It's always good to be prepared.

118
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:33,910
You should take it too.

119
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,583
By the way,

120
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:41,750
to avoid getting separated,

121
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,088
we each hold one end of this rope.

122
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,166
(Really a professional constable.)

123
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,583
Let's go.

124
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,416
Go.

125
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,250
It's hard for living beings

126
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,791
to survive in this dense miasma.

127
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,536
Wuteng is the most poisonous
in the world,

128
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,750
and this place is perfect
for their growth.

129
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:47,916
Watch out!
