=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,904
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,375
Watch out!

4
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,000
Ambush ahead!

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,712
- Let's go!
- Go!

6
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:38,250
Cut the red rope! Scatter and hide!

7
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,875
Attack together and deal with them!

8
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:40,083
Yes!

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:40,875
Meet up later.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,080
What was that noise?

11
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:55,984
It's weird.

12
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:00,750
(Where is she?)

13
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:41,708
Ah!

14
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,500
(Young Castellan!)

15
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:47,708
Young Castellan,

16
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,208
are you okay?

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,750
This snake is venomous.

18
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,291
Let me treat the wound.

19
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
The wound needs to be bandaged.

20
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,166
This red...

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,875
Yi Zhihong,

22
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,291
you're also

23
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,291
looking for Wuying?

24
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,416
You...

25
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,458
Why are you here?

26
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,910
(Where's he going
in the middle of night?)

27
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:17,450
(Where is he going?)

28
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,540
(It must have been you last night.)

29
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,458
You're Yi Zhihong.

30
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,083
Why are you looking for Wuying?

31
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:37,250
Tell me the reason.

32
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,583
Lady Wu.

33
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,333
Song.

34
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,916
Are you both injured?

35
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,125
Lady Wu.

36
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,083
Song.

37
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:46,958
Lady Wu.

38
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:48,791
You're injured.

39
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,083
I'm fine.

40
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,708
Just a snakebite.

41
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,500
Was the snake venomous?

42
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,416
Song

43
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,333
bandaged you, right?

44
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:00,750
She is fine.

45
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,875
But avoid strenuous activities.

46
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:04,916
And...

47
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,458
Emotional stress.

48
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,250
I think I've found Wuying's location.

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,916
There's another group here.

50
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,208
Stay close to me.

51
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:13,580
Let's go.

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,410
Go.

53
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:22,910
The vines are tangled.

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,125
A faint black glow flows within.

55
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,708
This must be Wuteng.

56
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,083
Wait...

57
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,458
Why only Wuteng?

58
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,750
No sign of Wuying.

59
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,708
Long time no see, everyone.

60
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:39,916
It's you, indeed.

61
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,916
How did you find this place?

62
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,708
Naturally, through you.

63
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,333
You told me yourselves.

64
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,916
I need Wuying to save lives.

65
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,666
What do you mean by that?

66
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,958
What do you think?

67
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,458
Well, are you

68
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,000
Yi Zhihong?

69
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,375
It's really you.

70
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,500
Today is a day of double blessings.

71
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,375
Perfect.

72
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,166
Kill them for me!

73
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:13,410
And take Wuying!

74
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,208
Hey!

75
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,458
You're injured, so don't go.

76
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:20,580
You're good at lightning skills.
Take Wuteng and leave.

77
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,455
Young Castellan, you...

78
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:22,500
No more talking, hurry!

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,166
Song, leave now!

80
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:23,958
I can handle this.

81
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,666
After I've gone,

82
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,125
you must

83
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,125
continue our mission.

84
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,500
I swear

85
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,200
I'll uphold the ancestral teachings.

86
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,416
(And destroy Wuteng.)

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,375
Why are you looking for Wuying?

88
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,166
There are things

89
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,916
that cannot be compromised.

90
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,000
Everyone

91
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,250
has their own destiny,

92
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,791
and the path they must walk.

93
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,916
Stop! Are you insane?

94
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,041
You're crazy!

95
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,166
What are you doing?

96
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:13,958
Fine.

97
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,958
Wait and see!

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,791
Retreat!

99
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,583
Why?

100
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,583
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,291
I don't want to hear that.

102
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,750
I just want to know why!

103
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:38,160
You didn't tell me why you
were looking for Wuying earlier.

104
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,750
Now you're just saying sorry!

105
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:40,791
Song Lian!

106
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,410
What do you think we are to you?

107
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,083
Have you been lying to us all this time?

108
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:49,416
I...

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,583
I don't know how to explain it to you.

110
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:52,333
But

111
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:53,958
I must destroy it.

112
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:02,870
Forget it.

113
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,875
You don't have to explain.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,791
Song,

115
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,500
why did you

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,958
lie to us?

117
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,416
Lady Wu,

118
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,083
can I come in?

119
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,208
Sure.

120
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,833
You're weak,

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,910
so you need to eat.

122
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,125
Try this.

123
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,958
When did you discover him?
