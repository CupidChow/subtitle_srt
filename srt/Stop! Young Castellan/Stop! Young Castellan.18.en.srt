1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,144
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:32,580
In the city, I fear
something has changed.

4
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,008
Let's go and investigate.

5
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:35,580
Okay.

6
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,000
Someone is there!

7
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:40,700
Let's go and see!

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,041
Go!

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,083
Wait a second.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,791
There are pursuers!

11
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:44,916
Let's go!

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,083
Stop there!

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,083
Stop!

14
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:51,750
They're over there!

15
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,583
Chase them!

16
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,125
That way!

17
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:04,250
Have you found them?

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,750
No.

19
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,166
Check over there. Go!

20
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,166
Qin,

21
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:10,870
what's going on in the city?

22
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:11,916
Why are the gates open

23
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:12,916
and the streets empty?

24
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,541
Ouyang Jin is poisoned by Wuteng,

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,336
so he wants to take the whole city

26
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:17,416
with him.

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,870
What about the people of Wufengzhai?

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,800
Ouyang Jin is searching for you
throughout the city.

29
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,458
Your people are

30
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:24,120
being held hostage
in the Chatelain's Mansion.

31
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:27,520
He's using them
to force you to come out.

32
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:28,458
Presumably,

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,791
he knows your blood

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,790
can cure the poison.

35
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,750
Song,

36
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,080
what do you mean by that?

37
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:35,952
I'm going to the Chatelain's Mansion.

38
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:37,410
(Chatelain's Mansion)
I want you all to die!

39
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:37,916
Chatelain!

40
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:38,958
I want to kill you all.

41
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:39,750
Calm down!

42
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:40,958
Move aside!

43
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,083
Chatelain!

44
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:43,875
I'll kill you!

45
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:44,708
Chatelain!

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,583
Chatelain!

47
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,166
I'll kill you!

48
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:52,750
Ouyang Jin!

49
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,416
You've arrived just in time.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,833
Chatelain!

51
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,291
Chatelain.

52
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:22,958
What are you doing?

53
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:23,791
Sui Feng!

54
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:24,750
Sui Feng!

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,250
My blood can save him.

56
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,666
Chatelain...

57
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,000
Chatelain, you're awake.

58
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:46,958
Ouyang Jin,

59
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,000
do you know why my blood can save you?

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,291
Chatelain,

61
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:54,750
take it slow.

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,333
Warm yourself up.

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,166
About the thing I'm about to tell,

64
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,166
others

65
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,500
should get out of here.

66
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,583
Zicheng is not just anyone.

67
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,458
Though I hate to admit it,

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,958
but you and I

69
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,290
are indeed of the same mother's blood.

70
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,449
Our mother took Wuying,

71
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,720
and gave birth to you and me.

72
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,333
Each of us inherited
Wuying's unique properties

73
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,125
and Wuteng's deadly poison.

74
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:41,958
Impossible!

75
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:42,916
How can that be?

76
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,083
You're lying.

77
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,083
You're speaking nonsense.

78
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,125
It's your fault!

79
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,708
You shouldn't have
been born in the first place.

80
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,375
Why did that woman do this to my father?

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,000
Why did she do this to me?

82
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,250
I'll choke you to death.

83
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,958
I'll choke you to death!

84
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,580
You're not even trying?

85
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,750
Use some force!

86
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,250
Let's die together then.

87
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,083
She can't die.

88
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:11,296
If she dies, there'll be
no cure for the poison.

89
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:18,916
That's right!

90
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,083
That's right!

91
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,416
Look at yourself!

92
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,916
You were born just to save me.

93
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,064
With your lowly life, you'll save me.

94
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,032
Ouyang Jin,

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,750
it was your father who stole my mother,

96
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,375
and he tortured her
to the brink of death.

97
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,541
And you...

98
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,208
Using Wuteng to poison
the innocent people of this city.

99
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,750
You're just like your father.

100
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,583
A monster in human form.

101
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,666
I'll find a way
to cure the Wuteng Poison.

102
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,333
As for you,

103
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:58,080
you deserve to die.

104
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:01,680
You...

105
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:06,666
Chatelain.

106
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,125
Chatelain.

107
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:17,959
(Tablet of the Benevolent Father)

108
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,256
(Tablet of the Benevolent Mother)

109
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,000
You have a way, don't you?

110
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,708
To refine my blood.

111
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,708
Wu Baobao,

112
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,000
can you fulfill your childhood wish

113
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,666
and let me be your husband?

114
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,500
Okay.

115
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,083
Zicheng,

116
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,708
it seems like

117
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,024
we haven't had a drink together
in a long time.

118
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:23,080
I will get the liquor.

119
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:24,928
Alright.

120
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,083
(My entire life)

121
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,916
(has been enslaved by Wuteng Poison.)

122
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,916
(My own mother
sentenced my father to death.)

123
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,708
(In search of the Wuying,)

124
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,916
(I lost my humanity)

125
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,208
(and committed heinous crimes.)

126
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,375
(I have no more attachments
in this world.)

127
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,375
(Just let me)

128
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,875
(atone for my sins with my death.)
