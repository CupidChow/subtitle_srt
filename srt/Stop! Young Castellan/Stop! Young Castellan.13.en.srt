1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,016
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,875
Lady Wu!

4
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:36,666
Young Castellan!

5
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:48,290
Young Castellan!

6
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,958
How are you now?

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Song Lian,

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,125
take her away.

9
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,083
I'll handle this.

10
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Hurry!

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,512
Go!

12
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,375
Capture him!

13
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,750
Let me see Chatelain.

14
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,083
Slow down.

15
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,541
Just hold on for a moment.

16
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:34,916
It's okay.

17
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:37,080
Let me take a look at the wound.

18
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,375
Hold on for a while.

19
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,583
I'll stop the bleeding.

20
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,583
It's okay.

21
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:48,869
It's fine.

22
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,264
Song Lian.

23
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,375
Why are you shaking?

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
I'm bandaging your wound.

25
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:54,660
Just bear with it.

26
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,330
It'll be over soon.

27
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,708
It's done.

28
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,166
Song Lian,

29
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,791
I'm giving you
one more chance to explain.

30
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,125
Why did you

31
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,375
burn the Wuteng?

32
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,750
My grandfather

33
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,083
was a renowned witch physician.

34
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,458
He died because of the Wuteng.

35
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,375
(When infected with the Wuteng Poison,)

36
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:42,250
(the victim's body is covered
in vine-like blood vessels,)

37
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,660
(experiencing unbearable pain.)

38
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:46,410
(Breathing becomes difficult,)

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,410
(and the body eventually stiffens,)

40
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,872
(leading to suffocation and death.)

41
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,083
(Prolonged physical contact
with the infected)

42
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,208
(can also transmit the poison.)

43
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:57,330
- Grandfather!
- (That's what happened to him.)

44
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:57,916
Lian'er,

45
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,583
eradicating the Wuteng

46
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,500
is the mission of our
witch physician family.

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:03,958
Grandfather,

48
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,166
don't leave me alone.

49
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:05,625
Grandfather!

50
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,166
We must not let innocent lives be lost.

51
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,375
Destroy the Wuteng.

52
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:13,008
Remember...

53
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,250
Grandfather!

54
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,416
Take it easy.

55
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,666
The Wuteng is harmful.

56
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:29,330
But what about the Wuying?

57
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:31,450
Why not use Wuying to save lives?

58
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,416
Where is the Wuying?

59
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,780
Wu Ying appears
once every hundred years.

60
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,083
The last Wuying

61
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:41,200
has already been consumed by Madam Rou.

62
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,333
In this world,

63
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,208
there is no more Wuying left.

64
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,083
It can't be.

65
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,000
All-knowing Auntie
did tell us the location!

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,083
We still have a chance.

67
00:03:59,083 --> 00:03:59,875
Don't we?

68
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,416
Please tell me.

69
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:02,750
Wu Baobao,

70
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,583
my parents

71
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:06,450
and grandfather

72
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:08,540
(all died because of the Wuteng.)

73
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,916
(All my loved ones are gone.)

74
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:15,250
(Our ancestral home
was confiscated by the soldiers.)

75
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,000
(I had nowhere to go.)

76
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:18,910
(So I became a street urchin.)

77
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,375
(At my lowest point,)

78
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,208
I met you.

79
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,000
Your smile back then

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,370
(was like a ray of light,)

81
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,000
(illuminating my path.)

82
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,333
Later,

83
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,083
while fulfilling my grandfather's
mission to destroy Wuteng,

84
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,916
I also learned to survive

85
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,958
by any means necessary.

86
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,583
Eventually,

87
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,583
I became known as a notorious thief.

88
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,416
Do you remember,

89
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,458
when you were young,
you met a little boy?

90
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Take my candy,

91
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,875
and you'll have to be my bride.

92
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,583
Take this.

93
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,333
You gave him a candy.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,083
I don't seem to recall it.

95
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,000
It's fine.

96
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,875
Such a long time ago,

97
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,583
it's normal to forget.

98
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,083
That was the first time

99
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,208
I tasted something sweet in my life.

100
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,083
Thank you,

101
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,541
Wu Baobao.

102
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,333
Actually, you could have told me.

103
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,958
Ever since I was young,
I've had to rely on myself.

104
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,416
I have no family, no friends.

105
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,541
I didn't know who
to share these things with.

106
00:05:58,448 --> 00:05:59,660
Song Lian,

107
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,291
you're foolish.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,750
You won't be alone anymore.

109
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,875
So this is your hideout.

110
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,583
For me,

111
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,208
the most dangerous place is the safest.

112
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:42,916
It's done.

113
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,375
Tonight, you can
stay here for the night.

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,552
Tomorrow morning,
you go back to the village first.

115
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,958
I need to go to the Chatelain's Mansion

116
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,750
to inquire about Qin's whereabouts.

117
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,083
I think only this bed
is suitable for sleeping.

118
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,916
You can stay in the room.

119
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:06,750
Sleep next to me.

120
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,208
(Isn't this developing too fast?)

121
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,541
On the floor.

122
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,916
I...

123
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,824
I'm not tired.

124
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,083
I'll stay outside
and keep watch tonight.

125
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,541
You look tired.

126
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:22,583
I'm okay.

127
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:23,791
Get rest early.

128
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,916
What's wrong? You pulled your wound?

129
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,083
Let me look at it.

130
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,458
I won't do anything to you.

131
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:04,080
We've been so tired these days.

132
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,208
So just sleep here.

133
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:07,910
You should sleep early too.
