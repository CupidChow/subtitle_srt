=Episode 6=

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,904
(Brewmaster's Abode)

4
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,500
Good liquor!

5
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:56,464
You could have dodged it easily.

6
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,583
Hey, sir!

7
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,333
If you don't sell,
why are you splashing us?

8
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,250
You're being persistent

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,056
and refusing to leave.

10
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:01,620
Sir,

11
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,541
we truly want this liquor.

12
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:04,660
What are your requirements?

13
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,125
I will

14
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,583
do whatever it takes.

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,166
Just don't let me see you again.

16
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,791
Wait a second!

17
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:11,950
Lady Wu!

18
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:14,500
Lady Wu,

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,500
are you okay?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,791
(I'm fine.)

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,700
(It's up to you now.)

22
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,583
Lady Wu is weak,

23
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,916
and she fainted because of you.

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,458
I'm afraid we can't leave now.

25
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:25,750
We may have to trouble you

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,666
and stay here tonight.

27
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,916
Are you trying to scam me?

28
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,416
Alright, just for tonight.

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,458
Get out of here early tomorrow.

30
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,500
Thank you.

31
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,083
And

32
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,583
don't go near the main house

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,750
and disturb my wife.

34
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:45,833
Stop pretending.

35
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:46,875
Wake up.

36
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,291
Lady Wu seems to be asleep.

37
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,500
Has she been tired lately?

38
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,083
Let me carry her inside.

39
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,666
I will carry her.

40
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,458
Bamboo Leaf Green.

41
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,083
Luofu Spring.

42
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,208
Dukang.

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,416
This one is...

44
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,333
This is called Suhexiang.

45
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:53,648
A medicinal liquor from the palace.

46
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:54,450
How do you...

47
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,291
Shh.

48
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,208
You're just a wandering physician,

49
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,200
so how do you know
this is from the palace?

50
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:10,708
Well,

51
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,916
I've tasted once.

52
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,875
Back in the day,

53
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,916
I happened to save His Majesty
who was traveling incognito.

54
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:19,958
You guys...

55
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,541
What are you doing?

56
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,369
Let me explain.

57
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,576
She tried to steal the liquor.

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,666
Lady Wu...

59
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:33,750
No way.

60
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,125
We should take it openly,

61
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:36,916
not steal it.

62
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:37,583
Well,

63
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,600
come with me and confess to the old man.

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,040
We'll ask for the liquor with sincerity.

65
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,032
Are you insane?

66
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,708
What do you want me to confess?

67
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,208
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,416
Is this your sincerity?

69
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,500
Taking without asking is stealing!

70
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,750
Are you bandits?

71
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,416
Sir, I'm sorry.

72
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,333
Me too.

73
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,083
I'm used to being a bandit.

74
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,904
Now I realize my mistake.

75
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,660
Yes.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,625
You...

77
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,708
All of you

78
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,250
get out of here!

79
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,333
I can't have you here.

80
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,500
Just leave now!

81
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,875
Sir, what's wrong?

82
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,416
Hey!

83
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,208
Sir!

84
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,291
Are you okay?

85
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,432
Sir, wake up!

86
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,580
He has Qi and blood deficiency,
and weak spleen and stomach.

87
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:31,916
Qin,

88
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:33,660
prepare

89
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,750
this medicine and boil it.

90
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,541
Okay.

91
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:37,328
I'll do it right away.

92
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:38,370
Take care of him.

93
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,083
Help him sit up.

94
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,166
During the day,

95
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,083
he said not to disturb his wife.

96
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,375
His wife...

97
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:16,352
(Memorial Spirit Tablet)

98
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,958
Young Castellan,
what are you thinking about here?

99
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,333
I've never known who my mother is.

100
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,250
I don't know what she looks like.

101
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,375
Nor do I know...

102
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,625
If she's alive or dead.

103
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,916
Isn't it amazing?

104
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,416
When I was young,

105
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,666
I thought I was born by my father.

106
00:05:57,968 --> 00:05:59,000
Father,

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,583
they say I was born by my mother.

108
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,916
They're lying.

109
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,166
I was clearly born by you alone.

110
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,750
That's right.

111
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,208
Alright, stop crying.

112
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,583
Bao,

113
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,875
do you want a mother?

114
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm content with just my father.

115
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:21,328
I'll take care of you too in the future.

116
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,166
Silly girl.

117
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,708
Not just my father,

118
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,750
no one in the village

119
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,704
has ever mentioned my mother.

120
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,750
I guess,

121
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,128
she must have done
something wrong to my father

122
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:40,960
and ran away.

123
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,666
So I never mention her too.

124
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,541
This bracelet is made of agarwood.

125
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,296
Although it can't replace the bracelet
your mother left you,

126
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,666
it can still calm the mind
and promote sleep.

127
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,541
When did you make this?

128
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,083
Lian, you're being overly
kind for no reason.

129
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,750
Aren't you into me?

130
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,291
I...

131
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:09,958
No...

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,666
How could I be?

133
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,458
You're thinking too much.

134
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,916
Your eyes are dark and puffy.

135
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,333
So I have good intentions.

136
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,250
You're just thinking of nonsense.

137
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,750
Why is there a red string tied to it?

138
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,291
I noticed

139
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,432
you seem to like red a lot.

140
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,496
Red strings ward off evil.

141
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,784
Perfect for you, Young Castellan.

142
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,450
Nice craftsmanship.

143
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,664
It fits perfectly.

144
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,992
I'm sleepy.

145
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm going to sleep.

146
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,125
Lady Wu,

147
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:22,160
Young Master Qin and Young Master Song,

148
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:23,728
which one do you like better?

149
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,176
What?
