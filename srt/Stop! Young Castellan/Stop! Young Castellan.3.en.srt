1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,984
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,410
Cut the crap!

4
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:29,056
If you want to kill, then come.

5
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:07,750
Don't move.

6
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,120
Please forgive me, Chatelain.

7
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,208
I will definitely capture that thief

8
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,750
and bring them to justice.

9
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,541
Go ahead.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,458
Don't keep me waiting too long.

11
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,791
(What kind of Ace Constable are you?)

12
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,375
(Unable to catch even a mere woman?)

13
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,875
(I am the one Chatelain truly needs.)

14
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,500
Zicheng.

15
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,833
Chatelain,

16
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,375
what exactly was stolen from the mansion

17
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,291
that requires such a massive effort?

18
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,791
It's just an ordinary bronze mirror.

19
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:19,791
Then why...

20
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,375
Young Castellan Wu seems

21
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,083
very interested in my family.

22
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:26,910
As I haven't found the descendant
of the witch physician yet,

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,083
I don't want her to complicate things.

24
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,208
She seems quite obsessed with Wuying.

25
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,000
You might use that to your advantage.

26
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,875
She's just a novice girl after all.

27
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,125
It's that wandering physician before

28
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,875
who might be useful.

29
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,208
Alright.

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,080
I'll send someone to investigate.

31
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,916
You should rest and recover
from your injuries.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,416
Here.

33
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,125
Sit down.

34
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:10,500
How are you feeling?

35
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,750
Why did you come to rescue me?

36
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,791
I told someone to lock you up.

37
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:17,750
Oh...

38
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:18,875
Well...

39
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,432
That person didn't lock the door.

40
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:23,160
Fortunately, he didn't lock the door,

41
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,000
so I could rescue you.

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:29,875
Come on.

43
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:32,620
Drink some water.

44
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,424
You're weak,

45
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:34,500
so rest for a while first.

46
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:35,856
Drink it.

47
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,791
Why am I so sleepy?

48
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,536
If you're sleepy, just sleep.

49
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:55,750
You'll feel better when you wake up.

50
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:00,000
Young Castellan?

51
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,750
(How dare you drink
a physician's water?)

52
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:08,910
(See if you dare bully me again.)

53
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,083
Where did you put it?

54
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,583
(Is this woman a hamster?)

55
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,583
(Hoarding all these useless things.)

56
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:27,450
The bronze mirror!

57
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,458
You are indeed here for the Wuying.

58
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:32,791
Speak!

59
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,200
What exactly do you want?

60
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,500
(Such a formidable constitution.)

61
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:37,040
(Not even afraid of my potions.)

62
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:37,458
Well,

63
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,083
I understand Wuying better.

64
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,791
So I'm here to help you.

65
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:41,583
After all,

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
even with Wu Ying,
you need a physician to refine it.

67
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:45,290
But you keep wanting to lock me up.

68
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:45,833
It's

69
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,750
a last resort.

70
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,072
I'll see how you're going
to help me find the treasure.

71
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:00,750
If you're useless or lying to me,

72
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,333
I can crush you with just one finger.

73
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

74
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:06,660
I'll do whatever you say,

75
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,583
Young Castellan.

76
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,958
But

77
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,250
you went through so much trouble
to find clues from Madam Rou,

78
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,750
only to find an ordinary bronze mirror.

79
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,458
It should be useless, right?

80
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,166
Impossible.

81
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:22,370
For this bronze mirror,

82
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,958
Ouyang Jin sent many people
to capture me.

83
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:25,540
There must be a mystery.

84
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:26,500
You're right.

85
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,416
I was just saying that.

86
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,416
Whatever you say

87
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:30,541
is right.

88
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,750
Song Lian, look!

89
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:45,328
What kind of nonsense symbols are these?

90
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,910
Only a ghost can understand, right?

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,083
I know someone who can decipher it.

92
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,583
But we need to go to a place.

93
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:03,708
Where?

94
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,583
Let's go.

95
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,583
Where are you taking me?

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,120
You'll know when we get there.

97
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,291
What kind of mysterious place is this?

98
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,541
We're here.

99
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,375
What?

100
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,888
What kind of creepy place is this?

101
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,125
Welcome to

102
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,750
the "Dark Market",
where everything you desire

103
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,083
can be found.

104
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,750
Why are they all staring at me?

105
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:35,790
Try your luck with the rings!

106
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,875
Treasures and curiosities!

107
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,289
Ten taels of silver for one try!

108
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,019
Read horoscopes and fortune-telling
about past and present lives.

109
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,100
Don't be fooled by that.
I'll take you to buy good things.

110
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,648
I want that pear wood birdcage.

111
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:49,709
I know everything under the sun.

112
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,120
I've found the seller for you.

113
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,950
A millennia-old Guqin is for those
with a special connection.

114
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:56,950
What are you staring at?

115
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:59,216
If you're not buying, get lost.

116
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,750
Sir, what kind of meat is this?

117
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,958
Just tell me whose meat you want.

118
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,333
I'll cut it for you right now.

119
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,291
No, thanks.

120
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,208
Let's find the person we need.

121
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
Since we're here, there's no rush.

122
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:15,958
Later,

123
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,450
I'll take you to find something fun.

124
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,375
Let's go.

125
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,464
Check it out over there.

126
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,291
You've traveled far and wide.

127
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,750
Have you heard of Yi Zhihong?

128
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,625
Also known as

129
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,910
the one who takes by telekinesis

130
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,083
with ease.

131
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,166
The Red-Clad Heroic Thief

132
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,458
of unparalleled beauty.

133
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,250
Such a renowned name,

134
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,458
how could I not know it?

135
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,160
Young Castellan,

136
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,768
why are you

137
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,750
looking at me like that?
