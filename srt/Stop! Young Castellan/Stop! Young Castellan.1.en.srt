00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,458
(The final chapter
of "Strange Tales" records)

4
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,712
(that a witch physician
discovered a miraculous herb.)

5
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:33,750
(Wuteng)
(This herb had two contrasting natures.)

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,330
(Its vines were
the most poisonous in the world.)

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,583
(When poisoned, the body would
be covered in vine-like blood vessels.)

8
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:42,848
(Hence, it was named "Wuteng".)

9
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:46,160
(Yet, its flower
could cure all illnesses.)

10
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,500
(It also had the miraculous
effect of immortality.)

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,824
(Named "Wuying".)

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,000
Yi Zhihong, surrender the Jade Buddha!

13
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,916
I'll spare your life.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,580
Because you say so,
doesn't make it true.

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,000
You need evidence to accuse someone,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,875
Mr. Ace Constable.

17
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,280
Bravo!

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:21,936
(Moon Pavilion)

19
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,250
Excellent fight.

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,000
Great!

21
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,375
Your skills are impressive.

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,750
Great!

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,708
Excellent!

24
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:37,330
Worthy of being an Ace Constable.

25
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,944
(Yi Zhihong, Swashbuckler)
(I'm Yi Zhihong,)

26
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,666
(a burglar.)

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,450
(Qin Yuntian, Constable)

28
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,500
How dare you deny it!

29
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:46,080
Who else could navigate
the General's Mansion undetected,

30
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,916
but you, Yi Zhihong?

31
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,916
(This man is my arch-nemesis.)

32
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't know you admired me so much.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,159
I'll take you in now.

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,816
Then I'll leave you a souvenir.

35
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,083
See you next time,

36
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:01,248
Mr. Ace Constable.

37
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:03,750
See?

38
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:05,520
Where did he go?

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,448
He ran away!

40
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,432
Shameless.

41
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,666
(I've come for one thing today.)

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,904
(I've waited ten years.)

43
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:51,664
(It has been ten years.)

44
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,583
(Does she still remember me?)

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,370
(What's this handsome man
staring at me for?)

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,864
(Is he interested in me?)

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,910
(Wu Baobao, Young Castellan of Wufengzhai)
(You do have a certain charm.)

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,200
(Such a lost look in your eyes.)

49
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,944
(You've forgotten me completely.)

50
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,750
Excuse me, please wait.

51
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,160
Well, are you calling me?

52
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:09,700
What are you staring at?

53
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,120
Haven't you seen a beauty before?

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,864
Come back to my place with me.

55
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,370
I'll make sure
you live a life of luxury.

56
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,875
I'm the best among men.

57
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,750
You won't be second among women.

58
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,333
Lady,

59
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:21,750
our fates are intertwined.

60
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,870
Here, take this lantern.

61
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,032
We'll meet again.

62
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,408
Take it!

63
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,688
Mysterious indeed.

64
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:33,750
=Stop! Young Castellan=

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,291
Beware, or I'll take you to my place.

66
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,840
(Wufengzhai)

67
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:43,916
Alas.

68
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,530
Young Castellan,

69
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:45,910
you're finally back.

70
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,320
(Uncle Chen, Butler of Wufengzhai)
Our men have been poisoned. And Castellan...

71
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:50,250
What happened?

72
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,208
Where's my father?

73
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,583
What exactly happened?

74
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,958
Did Heishanzhai do this?

75
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,208
I'll go kill them all now!

76
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,416
Young Castellan,

77
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,544
it wasn't them.

78
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:00,870
Our buddies' symptoms
are bizarre and terrifying.

79
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:02,384
Seems like they've been poisoned

80
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,791
by the legendary Wuteng Poison.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,916
The one recorded
in the "Strange Tales"...

82
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:08,750
The deadly Wuteng?

83
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,041
This one...

84
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,916
Is that so?

85
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,416
They drank from this well.

86
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:22,250
Young Castellan,

87
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,916
they drank from this well today.

88
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:26,791
Seal the well!

89
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,083
I, Wu Baobao, swear here and now,

90
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:32,944
to find a cure as soon as possible

91
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,500
and save my buddies in Wufengzhai.

92
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:36,416
Everyone, follow me down the mountain.

93
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,380
Find a physician.

94
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,752
Alright!

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,489
(Grandfather...)

96
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,040
(Ten Years Ago)

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,750
(Young Song Lian of Witch Physician family)
Eradicating Wuteng

98
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,166
(Master Song of Witch Physician family)
is the mission of our family.

99
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,125
Grandfather!

100
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,958
Don't leave me behind!

101
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,833
If

102
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,916
the Wuteng Poison appears again,

103
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,666
you must protect
the Young Castellan of Wufengzhai.

104
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,666
Protect the Young Castellan...

105
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,583
Grandfather!

106
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't leave me alone...

107
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,500
I'll remember your words.

108
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,083
(Finally, we meet again,)

109
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,409
(Young Castellan.)

110
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,632
(Chatelain's Mansion)

111
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,708
Chatelain.

112
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,291
Have you captured Yi Zhihong yet?

113
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,500
I have failed,

114
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,708
and he escaped.

115
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,916
If you fail to capture him again,

116
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,951
it will be a hidden danger
within the city.

117
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:28,870
Please rest assured.

118
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,120
I will not fail in my mission.

119
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,916
I heard many in Wufengzhai
have been poisoned.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,583
The symptoms are like Wuteng Poison.

121
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,541
It's true.

122
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:35,660
Though they are bandits,

123
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,083
they are also citizens of Lin city.

124
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,083
Let's go and see.

125
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:42,370
You cunning merchants!

126
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,250
What do you mean?

127
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,916
Your Wufengzhai has forcibly
taken physicians from the city.

128
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,458
Your audacity knows no bounds!

129
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,583
(Xu Zicheng, Adviser of Chatelain)
I came to suppress you bandits.

130
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,708
Suppress bandits?

131
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,083
Today, I'll suppress you first!

132
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,625
Take down these bandits!

133
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,458
Stop!

134
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,570
(Ouyang Jin, Chatelain)

135
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,583
Chatelain,

136
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,208
you're here to suppress the bandits?

137
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,870
Young Castellan Wu.

138
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,875
I heard that almost half of your men
has been poisoned by Wuteng Poison.

139
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:00,916
Don't pretend.

140
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,125
You're taking advantage
of it to bully the weak.

141
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,166
Although officials and bandits
are opposed,

142
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,916
they are also citizens of Lin city.

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,541
Zicheng,

144
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,166
issue a nationwide bounty.

145
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,740
Anyone who can
cure the Wuteng Poison

146
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,208
will be rewarded greatly by me.

147
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:14,833
Yes.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,291
May I try to help?

149
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:21,250
Excuse me,

150
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,583
please step aside.

151
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,083
Thanks.

152
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:23,750
Who are you?

153
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,208
I'm Song Lian.

154
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,666
A wandering physician.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,583
Upon hearing about the Wuteng,

156
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,583
I came to investigate.

157
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,375
It's you?

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,958
So you're just a fraudster.

159
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,500
I'm telling you,

160
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,666
no one here will be fooled by you.

161
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:38,330
Come with me.

162
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:45,666
Excuse me.

163
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,166
May I come in?

164
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,541
You guys...

165
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,699
I don't even want to come in here.

166
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,080
Humph.

167
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:02,896
Lady, what are you doing?

168
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,352
Don't be so rude.

169
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:24,580
It really is the Wuteng.

170
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,583
Dissolve this medicine in the well.

171
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,750
It may temporarily
suppress the poisoning.

172
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,791
You have an antidote for the Wuteng?

173
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,083
Could it be...

174
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,875
You're a descendant
of the witch physician?

175
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:45,950
The witch physician
who discovered the Wuteng years ago?

176
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,375
Young Castellan, do you know

177
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:48,500
only the Wuying can cure

178
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,936
the Wuteng Poison?

179
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,750
Expect the descendants
of the witch physician,

180
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,583
I can't think of anyone else.

181
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,666
Chatelain, you think highly of me.

182
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,541
I just mixed different herbs together

183
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,083
and tried my luck.

184
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,083
It's not certain

185
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,750
that it will help you.

186
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,500
Chatelain Ouyang, you know
quite a bit about the Wuteng.

187
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,208
Oh, I remember.

188
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:18,916
Your mother

189
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,833
is the legendary enchantress,

190
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,583
Madam Rou.

191
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,916
I don't know where you
heard such nonsense.

192
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,583
There's no outsiders here.

193
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,125
Just tell me the truth.

194
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,708
I really need to find the Wuying.

195
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:39,580
Sorry, I can't help you.

196
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,410
I have other matters.

197
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:41,250
I'll be going now.

198
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,608
Don't go!

199
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,990
Let's chat for a while. Chatelain...

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,708
Young Castellan,
since you know the cure,

201
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,916
I hope you can find the Wuying.

202
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,291
I'll take my leave now.

203
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:49,968
What?

204
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,541
You know so much.

205
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,083
I can't possibly let you go.
