00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,152
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,916
You know so much.

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,458
I can't possibly let you go.

5
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,250
Young Castellan...

6
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,458
What do you want?

7
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,416
Go inside!

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,848
Wait for Young Castellan to summon you.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,750
You're violating
the regulations of Lin City!

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,500
Let me tell you,

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,250
are you bandits?

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,264
Just stay here!

13
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:51,875
Oh, sorry.

14
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:52,659
I almost

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,632
forget you're bandits...

16
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,875
Let me out!

17
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:56,608
Let me out!

18
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:57,120
Step back!

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,599
(Chatelain's Mansion)

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,272
(Cultivate Your Moral Character)

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,700
(If only I had practiced
my lightning skills better.)

22
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,916
(It's said that Madam Rou)

23
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,791
(took the antidote Wuying to cure)

24
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,041
(her wuteng poisoning,)

25
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,291
(and became an immortal
legendary enchantress.)

26
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,039
(Since Chatelain Ouyang won't talk,)

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,224
(don't blame me
for investigating on my own.)

28
00:01:58,875 --> 00:01:59,916
(There's nothing here.)

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,540
(What's this hard thing?)

30
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,083
(Yi Zhigong?)

31
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:41,750
Hurry!

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,216
Don't let that witch escape!

33
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,083
Hurry up! Chase her!

34
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:44,916
Chase her!

35
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:46,500
We can't let her escape.

36
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,750
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

37
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,583
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,250
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

39
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,791
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

40
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,248
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

41
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,520
(Madam Rou, Legendary Enchantress)

42
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:11,410
Burn the witch!

43
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,625
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

44
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,041
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

45
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:23,000
(Ouyang Xiong, Former Chatelain)

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,958
Rou,

47
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,375
people outside say that you
took the enchanted flower Wuying

48
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,208
to maintain your youth and beauty.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,083
Wuying appears
once every hundred years,

50
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,333
and the only one

51
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:38,080
has been taken by me to cure my poison.

52
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,791
There's

53
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:41,232
no Wuying left in the world.

54
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,000
What?

55
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,916
Then where did you find it initially?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,416
Tell me the location.

57
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,408
I swear to protect you
and keep you safe.

58
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,041
Well,

59
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,541
that's Wuying.

60
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,208
This is Wuying?

61
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,450
Is this really the legendary

62
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,560
Wuying that grants immortality?

63
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,875
So this treasure has been
in your cabinet all this time.

64
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,333
Ouyang Xiong,

65
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,791
I know it was you
who plotted against Yue.

66
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,875
You plotted against my husband
to forcibly marry me,

67
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,208
so you should have
seen this day coming.

68
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:45,870
You... You wicked woman...

69
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,000
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

70
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,375
Burn the witch!

71
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:07,120
Surrender the enchanted flower!
Burn the witch!

72
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:08,910
Jing'er,

73
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,166
I'm sorry for you.

74
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,344
(Ten Years Later in Chatelain's Mansion)

75
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,083
(Yi Zhihong?)

76
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,360
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,080
Could it be

78
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,440
that you're also looking for Wuying?

79
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,250
Lady,

80
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,750
show me what you stole.

81
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,424
In your dreams!

82
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:35,620
That's not up to you.

83
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,500
You're...

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:36,958
Shh.

85
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:53,125
My lightning skills are poor.
Take me with you.

86
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,541
Or we're both staying here.

87
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,791
Move again, and I'll drop you.

88
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,333
No...

89
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm just curious what you look like.

90
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:17,541
Chase them!

91
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,368
Yes!

92
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:25,875
Hey,

93
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:26,541
you!

94
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,291
(Could it be)

95
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,750
(that he's also come for Wuying?)

96
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,875
This bronze mirror seems simple,

97
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,541
but Madam Rou keeps it by her pillow.

98
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,208
What mystery could it hold?

99
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,791
Ouyang Jin's mother, I'm sorry.

100
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:49,040
If it turns out to be useless,

101
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,375
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

102
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,875
Please don't be angry.

103
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,250
(I must find clues about Wuteng.)

104
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,000
(I apologize for disturbing)

105
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,416
(your former quarters.)

106
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,083
Our Young Castellan is amazing!

107
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,830
She'll surely become
a great hero someday.

108
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,541
(Grandfather,)

109
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,583
(is she the Young Castellan
you asked me to protect?)

110
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,416
Where did you come from?

111
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,708
Let me go!

112
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,750
Uncle Niu,

113
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,916
put him down, please.

114
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:41,750
Alright.

115
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,291
Be careful.

116
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,333
Here.

117
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,539
Take my candy,

118
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,360
and you'll have to be my bride.

119
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,083
You're so arrogant,

120
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,256
Young Castellan.

121
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,875
(Where could she have
hidden the bronze mirror?)

122
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:10,784
Young Castellan.

123
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,083
Young Castellan...

124
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,125
Wake up!

125
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,744
Come with me.

126
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,416
Uncle Chen...

127
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,083
What's going on?

128
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,083
Uncle Chen,

129
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,056
what happened?

130
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,580
Chatelain's Mansion
was robbed last night.

131
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,708
Ouyang Jin has sent soldiers
to capture you.

132
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:34,790
(For a bronze mirror, he's making
a big deal to capture me?)

133
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,272
(This bronze mirror truly has a secret.)

134
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,928
Young Castellan,

135
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,000
you're suspected of stealing
from Chatelain's Mansion.

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
Please come back with me.

137
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,450
Young Castellan,

138
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,416
hurry and go.

139
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:51,950
Cut the crap!

140
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:53,420
If you want to kill, then come.
