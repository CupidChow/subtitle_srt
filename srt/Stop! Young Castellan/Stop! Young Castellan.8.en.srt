=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,333
Lady Yun,

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,791
stop it right now. It's enough.

5
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,583
Lady Wu,

6
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,166
what do you mean?

7
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,000
Your fingers are delicate,

8
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,166
obviously you've never
done manual labor.

9
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,375
Furthermore,

10
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,416
the fragrance on you
seems familiar to me.

11
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,333
Last night, I went to the Moon Pavilion,

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,083
I noticed the incense
in the owner's room.

13
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,125
It smelled exactly
like the scent on you.

14
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,250
Perhaps,

15
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,583
since I've been serving Lady Yu
for so long,

16
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,166
I've probably absorbed
the fragrance from her.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
That day in the forest
when we were in danger,

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,272
you pretended to be robbed
of "Drunk in Paradise".

19
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:16,625
But in reality,

20
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,416
you deliberately dropped it.

21
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,916
I was just so scared.

22
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,416
I didn't want to die.

23
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,541
I see.

24
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,375
What about this?

25
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,000
I found it in Lady Yu's
secret compartment.

26
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,708
I guess,

27
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,291
you're going to say

28
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,791
that you only resemble
the person in this painting.

29
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,166
Then I'll just burn it.

30
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:42,750
Dare you!

31
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,625
Lady Yun, do you care
about this painting,

32
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,083
or the person in it?

33
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,750
I know you have a favor to ask of me.

34
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:03,875
But why

35
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,916
do you think I'll help?

36
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:19,750
How did it go?

37
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:23,875
Well,

38
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,291
as you predicted,

39
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:26,916
Lady Yun

40
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,375
did have a past with the man
in the painting.

41
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,416
But he was a rogue

42
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,166
who betrayed her.

43
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:32,791
One day,

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,656
the rogue suddenly
disappeared without a trace.

45
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:36,080
Lady Yun was devastated.

46
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,790
She offered a large reward
for his whereabouts.

47
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,416
Eventually,
after traveling far and wide,

48
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,250
Lady Yun found the rogue.

49
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,000
Something happened between them,

50
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,333
and Lady Yun had changed dramatically.

51
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:48,160
And she put out a notice
seeking a husband.

52
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,083
Why did she choose Lady Yu
to replace her?

53
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,125
Isn't she afraid of being discovered?

54
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,000
It's said

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
that Lady Yun didn't like to be
in the public eye before.

56
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,333
Few people have seen her.

57
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,916
As for why,

58
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,458
Lady Yun hates men deeply.

59
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,500
She wants everything she can't have.

60
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,416
Lian,

61
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,791
she's now set her sights on you.

62
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:13,910
Song,

63
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,375
I

64
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,458
won't let you

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,083
lose your innocence.

66
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,250
Initially, I thought Young Master Qin
was upright and innocent,

67
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,083
making him a suitable husband.

68
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,916
But now...

69
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm deeply attracted
to your intelligence.

70
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,250
If it's for my own husband,

71
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,833
I'd gladly decipher
the Suo Clan's script.

72
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,458
What do you think?

73
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,916
Lady Yun, you're pretty

74
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,375
and intelligent.

75
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,375
I am

76
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,000
in awe.

77
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:30,791
Young Master Song?

78
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,624
Not leaving?

79
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,958
I won't let you

80
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,083
lose your innocence.

81
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,666
I see some people are eager
to become a wealthy husband.

82
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:48,958
Lady Wu,

83
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,416
your tone...

84
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,083
Is it concern for Song

85
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,291
or jealousy?

86
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,750
What nonsense are you talking about?

87
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,125
Now,

88
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,700
we have a favor to ask of her,

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,540
so we have to

90
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:08,950
temporarily agree to her demands.

91
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,000
Well,

92
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,583
Young Castellan,

93
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,750
didn't you get what you wanted?

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,916
Why do you still look unhappy?

95
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,875
We obtained the clue,

96
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,333
and you got the beauty.

97
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,541
A win-win situation.

98
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,791
I'm overjoyed.

99
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,416
Lady Wu,

100
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,583
Song is trying to obtain clues.

101
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,750
He needs to play along with her.

102
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,541
Don't be angry.

103
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,333
Shut up!

104
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,083
Song, let's go.

105
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:44,708
Okay.

106
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,250
Maybe we should reconsider.

107
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,750
I'll find a chance
to capture her and threaten her.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,208
She'll be more cooperative then.

109
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,041
Young Castellan,

110
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:06,370
are you so reluctant to let me go?

111
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,958
Who cares about you?

112
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:09,833
Wait.

113
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,250
Here.

114
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,458
For self-defense.

115
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,208
How adorable.

116
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:25,712
(Happiness)

117
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,541
You?

118
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,250
You...

119
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:58,833
You...

120
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,583
Why are you here?

121
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,125
As a loyal member of Wufengzhai,

122
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,750
I would never truly sacrifice you.

123
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:13,700
Since you're already here,

124
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:14,416
why don't

125
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:15,580
we have a drink?

126
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:16,700
I get drunk after one cup.

127
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,440
I can't drink.

128
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,416
Well,

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,958
such good liquor,

130
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,291
it's a waste

131
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,583
not to drink it.

132
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,328
You should have a cup too.

133
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,791
I get drunk after one cup.

134
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,000
What are you doing?

135
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:54,870
Just have half a cup,

136
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,208
then you won't get drunk.

137
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,958
Let's share

138
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,583
some good fortune.

139
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,708
What are you doing?

140
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:07,750
I...

141
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:08,750
Lady Yun,

142
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,375
I have a deal to make with you.

143
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:16,832
(Happiness)

144
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:19,875
Tell me.

145
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,250
What kind of deal?

146
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:24,750
I suspect,

147
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,000
all of your actions are

148
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,708
to win back your lover's heart.

149
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,583
Someone! Lady Yun has been poisoned!

150
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,166
Someone!

151
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,583
Lady Yun has been poisoned!

152
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,580
(Medical Assistance Notice)

153
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,916
The owner of Moon Pavilion
has been poisoned

154
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,708
by someone.

155
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,410
She's seeking a physician
with a hefty reward.

156
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,708
She just got married yesterday.

157
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,800
Could it be the groom,
seeking to kill for money?

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,870
This owner...
