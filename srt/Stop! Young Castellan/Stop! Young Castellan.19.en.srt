=Episode 19=

3
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,666
Zicheng, come on.

4
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,083
Singing while drinking.

5
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,916
How many years of life are there?

6
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:06,750
Fill it up!

7
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,541
Life is like morning dew.

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,750
The past days are filled with sorrow.

9
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:34,624
Zicheng,

10
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:38,708
do you think

11
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,916
I'm ridiculous?

12
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:45,700
Chatelain, for me,

13
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,136
you're both a father and a friend.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,410
(Six Years Ago)
I'll kill you!

15
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:50,910
Orphan with no parents!

16
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,208
You filthy low-life

17
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,416
has sticky fingers!

18
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,333
Beat him to death!

19
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,666
Get out of here!

20
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,375
Get lost!

21
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:13,666
It's okay now.

22
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,250
Don't be afraid.

23
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,958
What's your name?

24
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:18,500
Xu...

25
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,583
Xu Zicheng.

26
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,208
Zicheng,

27
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,250
from now on,

28
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,708
you'll follow me.

29
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,856
(Three Years Ago)
Zicheng,

30
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,864
I've carried it with me for years.

31
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,375
Today,

32
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,916
I'm giving it to you.

33
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,870
Chatelain,

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,166
it's too valuable.

35
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,784
I can't accept.

36
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:45,416
Take it.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,750
Thank you, Chatelain.

38
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:20,916
Chatelain...

39
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,291
I'll keep you company.

40
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,666
Fortunately, Ouyang Jin
released you all.

41
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,000
Uncle Chen,

42
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,000
help me put on the veil.

43
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:50,958
Okay.

44
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,888
The auspicious time has arrived.

45
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,125
Congratulations.

46
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,541
Castellan, congratulations.

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,528
May you have a long
and happy life together.

48
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,333
Bravo!

49
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,125
Great!

50
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,583
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

51
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:02,592
(Happiness)

52
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,500
Second bow to the ancestors.

53
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,248
(Happiness)

54
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,096
Husband and wife bow to each other.

55
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,792
The ceremony is complete.

56
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,750
Wonderful!

57
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:33,541
Kiss her!

58
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,541
Bravo!

59
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,864
(Wufengzhai)

60
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:33,370
What are you grinning at?

61
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,290
I'll lift it myself.

62
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,750
No, you can't.

63
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,708
Let me lift it.

64
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,424
Give me the antidote for alcohol.

65
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,000
I want to drink my fill tonight.

66
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:55,958
Alright.

67
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,290
But you have to promise me

68
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,200
that don't overdo it with the drinking.

69
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,375
So, shall we

70
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,456
move on to the next part?

71
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,416
The next part?

72
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,264
Yes.

73
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,370
Okay.

74
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:35,600
Let's go.
