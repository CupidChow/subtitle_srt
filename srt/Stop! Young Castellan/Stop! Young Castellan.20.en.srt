=Stop! Young Castellan=

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:39,875
Awesome!

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,583
Why are you here on your
wedding night instead of

5
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,750
in your bridal chamber?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,541
This is...

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,910
"Drunk in Paradise"?

8
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,250
I was reluctant
to give it to Lady Yun initially.

9
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:58,370
Fortunately, she gave it back
to me as a wedding gift.

10
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,000
She's quite considerate.

11
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:02,976
Come on!

12
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:04,450
Let's drink until we're drunk.

13
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,744
Let's drink until we're drunk.

14
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,500
You know,

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,166
it's quite amazing.

16
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,416
Who would have thought

17
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,916
that the three of us

18
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:29,750
would become

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,958
such close friends.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,583
And

21
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,688
even lovers.

22
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:40,958
Here!

23
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,416
Cheers!

24
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,370
Knowing you guys

25
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,208
is...

26
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,125
my great fortune...

27
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,250
I...

28
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:00,916
feel like...

29
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,583
a little bit...

30
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,125
Qin,

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,952
your alcohol tolerance is not good.

32
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,291
You need to practice more.

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,250
You've also had too much to drink.

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,856
The antidote isn't working anymore.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,104
Let's go back to our rooms.

36
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,500
I'm fine.

37
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,750
We should do our matters.

38
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,375
Do you think

39
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,541
when someone's blood is drained,

40
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,750
would they look ugly?

41
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,333
No.

42
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,112
Still be as beautiful as now.

43
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:42,958
Song Lian,

44
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,291
you must promise me.

45
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,083
After seeing

46
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,708
the vast landscapes for me,

47
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,208
you will grow old naturally.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,791
Or else,

49
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,083
even if you come,

50
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,666
I won't see you.

51
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,750
Hurry up and answer me.

52
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,040
Or I won't be able to close my eyes.

53
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,000
Baobao,

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,916
meeting you

55
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,708
makes me very happy.

56
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,750
Song Lian...

57
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,432
Don't forget about me.

58
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,750
Are you ready?

59
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,041
I'll go down

60
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,375
to conquer the land.

61
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:47,916
When you're there,

62
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,660
you can be the second in command.

63
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:31,648
(Three Years Later)

64
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,976
(Tablet of the Beloved Wife)

65
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:09,958
(Baobao.)

66
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,916
(I'll keep Wufengzhai safe for you.)

67
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,048
(Thirty Years Later)

68
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey, old man!

69
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,583
This road is paved by me.

70
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,791
This tree is planted by me.

71
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,375
If you want to pass by,

72
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:59,008
leave your toll money.

73
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,000
Wu Baobao...?

74
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:12,128
(The End)

75
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,400
(Thank you for watching.)
