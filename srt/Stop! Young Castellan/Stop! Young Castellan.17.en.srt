00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,032
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,208
Come on.

4
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,583
It's time to tell you something.

5
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,291
You can't drink alcohol.

6
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,750
Don't try to be tough.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,208
(How does she know I can't drink?)

8
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,416
(Even Song Lian doesn't know this.)

9
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,750
Are you curious how do I know it?

10
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,128
Yes.

11
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,791
Well,

12
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,916
I delivered you when you were born.

13
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,336
I gave this bracelet

14
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:41,083
to your mother years ago.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,791
Auntie.

16
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:14,416
My husband was killed by villains.

17
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,375
I must protect my child!

18
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,458
Please help me.

19
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,750
Use your most precious possession

20
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,416
to exchange with me.

21
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,541
Auntie,

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,791
I'm willing to trade my life.

23
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:38,708
Alas...

24
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,791
A hundred years of trouble

25
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,166
must finally come to an end.

26
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,333
(Using all my skills,)

27
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,375
(I helped her safely
deliver a baby girl.)

28
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,125
(Later...)

29
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,416
Your face never fails to captivate me.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,916
After your mother gave birth to you,

31
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,791
she was captured by Ouyang Xiong.

32
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,250
I entrusted you to your uncle

33
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,000
and he brought you to Wufengzhai.

34
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,291
To ensure your safety,

35
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,083
they concealed the truth from you.

36
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,208
Therefore,

37
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:56,416
my real parents were both killed
by Ouyang Xiong...

38
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,416
Then I and Ouyang Jin

39
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:03,958
are...

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,583
Half-siblings.

41
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,791
Ironically,

42
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,541
one of you possesses the blood
of Wuying, which can cure all poisons,

43
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
while the other,

44
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,791
since birth,

45
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,125
has been poisoned by Wuteng.

46
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,583
Perhaps,

47
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,500
this is karma at work.

48
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,250
Good girl.

49
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,458
You can choose to ignore all of this.

50
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,375
Find someone who loves you deeply

51
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,458
and live a happy, fulfilling life.

52
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:49,083
Everyone is born with their own destiny.

53
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,583
No need to worry about anything else.

54
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,291
Give me your hand.

55
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,580
Auntie, thank you.

56
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,291
We'll be leaving now.

57
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,083
Song Lian,

58
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,666
I've lived a carefree life for too long.

59
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,416
Now I realize

60
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,291
that people grow up

61
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,750
in just one night, it seems.

62
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:54,916
You said,

63
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,583
each of us has our own path to walk.

64
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,208
I know which path I should take.

65
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,291
Don't do it.

66
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,333
Song Lian.

67
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,125
We all have our own missions to fulfill.

68
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,541
Chatelain,

69
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,166
Wu Baobao used her blood
to detoxify Wuteng Poison.

70
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,083
Are you sure?

71
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,125
You heard that correctly?

72
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,541
I'm certain!

73
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,708
Absolutely true!

74
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,666
Great!

75
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,250
Go and claim your reward.

76
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,875
Yes!

77
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,000
Zicheng,

78
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,291
I need Wu Baobao's blood!

79
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:26,870
Understood.

80
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,083
I will immediately capture her

81
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,708
to cure your poison.
