00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,936
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:30,032
Song Lian!

4
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,375
Don't fall for their trap. Go!

5
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:33,040
Chase him!

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,458
Hurry, chase him!

7
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,590
I know her! She's from Wufengzhai.

8
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,125
The girl is lovely, how did she...

9
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,500
She is guilty of countless crimes.

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,916
Not only did she steal
Chatelain's mother's relics,

11
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,250
but she also poisoned dozens
of lives in Wufengzhai.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,549
How could she do this?

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,784
One cannot be judged by his look.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,000
She has a heart of a viper.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,170
She's unworthy of being human.

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,083
Unworthy of being human.

17
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:53,916
Beat her to death!

18
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:54,916
Shameless!

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,160
Beat her to death!

20
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,199
Not in our place!

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,272
Unworthy of being human.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,580
Unworthy of being human.

23
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:03,750
Unworthy of being human.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,420
Unworthy of being human.

25
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:06,592
Beat her to death!

26
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,660
Execute her immediately!

27
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,250
Execute!

28
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:25,540
(Don't come any closer!)

29
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,166
Run, quickly! Murder!

30
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:41,080
Hurry! Someone is killing!

31
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,875
Hurry up! Run!

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,700
Hold on a moment.

33
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,125
You won't escape.

34
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:02,192
Let's go now!

35
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:03,952
I've rescued Qin.

36
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:05,330
He'll return to Wufengzhai tomorrow.

37
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,344
The Red-Cloaked Thief,
truly deserving of the name.

38
00:02:12,544 --> 00:02:13,700
That treacherous Xu Zicheng

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,056
actually used poisoned arrows.

40
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,000
Lie down slowly.

41
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,666
What should we do?

42
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,540
Where's the antidote?

43
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,333
Don't die, please.

44
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:26,750
Song Lian.

45
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:29,840
Song Lian!

46
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,583
(Which one is the antidote?)

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
(Forget it. I'll take a chance.)

48
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,541
Come on.

49
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:51,370
Song Lian,

50
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,500
wake up.

51
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:55,330
Swallow it.

52
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,083
You're awake.

53
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,750
You're okay now.

54
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,583
What did you give me?

55
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,125
These.

56
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,875
I found them on you.

57
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,300
I didn't know if they were poisonous.

58
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,290
I gave them all to you.

59
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,166
Your hand!

60
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,752
How did you get hurt?

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,375
It's just a small cut.

62
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,583
What's the big deal?

63
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,916
Is there a problem?

64
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,458
(I can't let her
discover her true identity.)

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,166
What happened?

66
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,291
Tell me about it.

67
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,000
Nothing much.

68
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:48,583
Maybe

69
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,166
a mix of several medicines

70
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,750
cured me.

71
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:55,958
It seems

72
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,208
I have some talent after all.

73
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll get you some water.

74
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,000
Tomorrow, you can return the village.

75
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:22,330
I need to go out for a while.

76
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,166
Where are you going?

77
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,708
I need to retrieve a medical book.

78
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,708
Okay. I'll wait for you.

79
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,500
Okay.

80
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,375
Wu Baobao, don't leave me.

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,250
Help me!

82
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,916
How could you suddenly have an outbreak?

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,824
Please help me, Castellan!

84
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,750
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,583
I haven't found a solution yet.

86
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,791
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,750
It's subsiding.

88
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,916
It's really subsiding.

89
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,333
Could it be...

90
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,250
I'm getting better.

91
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:49,916
(So that's how it is.)

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,250
Young Master Xu,

93
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,458
I've found Wu Baobao.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,750
Bring her back to me.

95
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,375
Yes!

96
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,250
Qin?

97
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,750
Yesterday, Song Lian took you
to the clinic for treatment, right?

98
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,583
But how...

99
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,500
Lady Wu,

100
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,208
I know you've lost your loved ones.

101
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,750
But don't be afraid.

102
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,250
You...

103
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,541
Still

104
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,083
have us.

105
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,125
Lady Wu,

106
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:52,960
I have feelings for you.

107
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,583
What?
