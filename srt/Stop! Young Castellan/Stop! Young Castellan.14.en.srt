00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,168
(Wufengzhai)

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,072
(Funeral)

5
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,119
Young Castellan.

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,024
You're back.

7
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:02,500
Young Castellan.

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,088
Condolences, Young Castellan.

(Tablet of the Benevolent Father)

10
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,583
My father...

11
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,672
Young Castellan.

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,579
You're finally back.

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,192
(Funeral)

14
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,333
Young Castellan.

15
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,760
Here.

16
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:10,708
Father...

17
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:16,176
(Funeral)

18
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:23,504
(Chatelain's Mansion: Guest Room)

19
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,166
Stop!

20
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,125
Who are you?

21
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:27,580
I've come to deliver food.

22
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:29,750
Enter.

23
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,250
Put it down and get out quickly.

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,520
Song...

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,952
Shh.

26
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,208
How are you?

27
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,380
Come here.

28
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,375
You've suffered.

29
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:53,080
It just looks intimidating.
It's nothing serious.

30
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,916
Just to be safe,

31
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,250
eat this.

32
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,750
Deliverer guy! Hurry up!

33
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,333
Alright. I'll be right out.

34
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,458
Rest and recover.

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,250
Wait for us.

36
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,875
You should be careful.

37
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,666
Take care.

38
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,540
Here I am.

39
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:40,200
Young Castellan,

40
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,120
our men are waiting for you.

41
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,000
Uncle Chen,

42
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,541
I'm back too late.

43
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,583
I couldn't save my father in time.

44
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,250
I'm an unfilial daughter.

45
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,541
Young Castellan,

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,450
you must pull yourself together.

47
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,791
Let's go.

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,176
Greetings, Castellan.

49
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,500
Greetings, Castellan.

50
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,333
Greetings, Castellan.

51
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,750
Greetings, Castellan.

52
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,458
Greetings, Castellan.

53
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,208
Greetings, Castellan.

54
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,916
Greetings, Castellan.

55
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,583
Song Lian...

56
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,250
I don't have a father anymore.

57
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,583
I still arrived too late...

58
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:26,580
Wu Baobao,

59
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,125
you did your best.

60
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,536
There's nothing wrong with that.

61
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,750
The guards at Qin's imprisonment
are not very tight.

62
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,791
We have a chance to rescue him.

63
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's go now then.

64
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,458
Get some rest first.

65
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,580
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

66
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,375
Lie down now.

67
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,500
Here.

68
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:52,750
Slowly.

69
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,541
Don't worry,

70
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,708
I'll always protect you.

71
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,791
Sleep early.

72
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:15,370
The intelligence has been verified.

73
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:16,000
Really?

74
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:17,410
Chatelain, you won't worry anymore

75
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,360
if we get the descendant
of the witch physician.

76
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:20,916
Wonderful.

77
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,290
Have you thought
of a way to capture him?

78
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,250
Once a person has a weakness,

79
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,333
they become vulnerable.

80
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,208
If we capture Wu Baobao,

81
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,416
he'll surely surrender willingly.

82
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,125
Okay.

83
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,083
Using Qin Yuntian as bait,

84
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,375
we'll wait for them
to fall into our trap.

85
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,791
You're wise!

86
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:53,910
They must think
we'll rescue him at night,

87
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,250
but people are most vulnerable

88
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,369
in the early morning.

89
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,752
I feel like something's not right.

90
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,583
What's wrong?

91
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:01,916
I just think

92
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,500
it's too quiet.

93
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,708
Who cares? Success or death, we'll see.

94
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:06,791
Don't move.

95
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,750
I'll go rescue him.

96
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,583
You provide backup.

97
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,450
Why are you pulling me?

98
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,790
You promised to listen to me later.

99
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,416
Alright then.

100
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:13,410
Be careful.
