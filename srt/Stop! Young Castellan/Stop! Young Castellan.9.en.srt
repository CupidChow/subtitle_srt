=Episode 9=

2
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,666
(Medical Assistance Notice)

3
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,958
The owner of Moon Pavilion
has been poisoned

4
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:31,750
by someone.

5
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:33,550
She's seeking a physician
with a hefty reward.

6
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,750
She just got married yesterday.

7
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:37,910
Could it be the groom
seeking to kill for money?

8
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,541
Please come this way.

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,333
Well,

10
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,208
our Lady Yun has been
unconscious all day.

11
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,291
Please examine her.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,291
Hello?

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,333
My diagnostic methods are unusual.

14
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,541
Please wait outside.

15
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:10,583
This...

16
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,750
You actually care about my life,

17
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:17,666
Chu?

18
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,250
Lady Yun,

19
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:29,330
why do you do this to yourself?

20
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,000
Young Master Chu's presence today

21
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,750
means he still cares for Lady Yun.

22
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,458
If he still has feelings,

23
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,750
why did he leave her in the past?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,291
Do you know why?

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,166
Perhaps it's because

26
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,291
they're not suited for each other.

27
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:00,750
Lady Yun wants
a peaceful life with her love,

28
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,458
while Young Master Chu
prefers wandering the world.

29
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,916
Their desired lifestyles
are vastly different.

30
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,583
If no one compromises,

31
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,875
even love cannot bring them together.

32
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,000
Why can't they each compromise a little?

33
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,125
Some things cannot

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,791
be compromised.

35
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,583
Everyone has their destiny

36
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,750
and path to follow.

37
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,875
Relationships between men and women

38
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,750
are truly the most
unpredictable things in the world.

39
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,458
Are you done?

40
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,333
Thank you for creating this opportunity.

41
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,291
It helped us resolve our issues.

42
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,041
I've decided to accompany Chu

43
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:57,160
and see the vast
landscapes of the world.

44
00:02:59,375 --> 00:02:59,958
Give it to me.

45
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,708
I'll decipher it for you.

46
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,083
This is an acrostic poem,

47
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:20,910
pointing to a specific location.

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,250
What place is it referring to?

49
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:23,916
Cloud

50
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:25,875
Seeking

51
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,166
Mountain.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,880
(Cloud Seeking Mountain)

53
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,291
Zicheng,

54
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,583
do you have any ideas?

55
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,166
As far as I know,

56
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,375
no place is called "Cloud
Seeking Mountain" within our borders.

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,458
Could this be false information?

58
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,125
He wouldn't send false information.

59
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,916
I just didn't expect

60
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,083
that Wu Baobao would
actually find something.

61
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,370
Don't worry, Chatelain.

62
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,500
I'll make sure to get there before them.

63
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,875
Alright.

64
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,083
Then I'll leave it to you.

65
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:35,750
Could it be

66
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,290
that there's no such place
as Cloud Seeking Mountain?

67
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,250
Who said that?

68
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:49,120
Because you've traveled a bit,
doesn't mean you've been everywhere.

69
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:05,916
Song,

70
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,958
your moves earlier

71
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,750
reminded me of a notorious thief
I once faced.

72
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:12,500
Yi Zhihong.

73
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,500
I know who you mean.

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,458
The one with a mask on his left face,

75
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,083
always dressed in red.

76
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,375
Yes.

77
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,875
He was the most troublesome

78
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,708
and skilled opponent I've ever faced.

79
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:31,410
If even you found him difficult,

80
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,083
he must be extraordinary.

81
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,125
Doesn't that mean I'm also impressive?

82
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,541
Why are you looking at me like that?

83
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,416
Saying you're like a thief,

84
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,333
and you're actually proud of it.

85
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,416
Qin,

86
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,208
you're really mistaken.

87
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,848
This guy doesn't
resemble Yi Zhihong at all.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,583
You're right.

89
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,416
It was just a fleeting resemblance.

90
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:56,583
Lady Wu,

91
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,708
you look tired today.

92
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,583
Why don't we discuss this tomorrow?

93
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,208
Okay?

94
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,333
Okay.

95
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,333
(Where's he going this late?)

96
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,250
(How did he go so fast?)
