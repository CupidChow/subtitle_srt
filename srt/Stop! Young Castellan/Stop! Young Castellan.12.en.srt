=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,904
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,750
When did you discover him?

4
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,083
That night you followed him.

5
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,958
(I saw his agile movements)

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,120
(and I felt a sense of familiarity.)

7
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:43,875
(So I roughly)

8
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,708
(deduced his identity.)

9
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,291
You've been chasing him, haven't you?

10
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,125
Why didn't you expose him directly?

11
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,041
I don't know why Song

12
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,083
disguised himself among us,

13
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,000
but I inexplicably trust him.

14
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,541
He would never harm us.

15
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,750
I thought with your righteous character,

16
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,750
you would arrest him immediately.

17
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:18,750
Though I'm

18
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,291
dedicated to eradicating evil,

19
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,708
capturing all villains in the world,

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,875
traveling with you two

21
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,458
has changed my perspective somewhat.

22
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,250
You and Song,

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,875
one from a bandit village,

24
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,125
the other a thief.

25
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,166
Yet both of you

26
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,583
are incredibly kind-hearted.

27
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,375
So being with you both

28
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,583
is joyful

29
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,333
and comforting.

30
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,333
Lady Wu,

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,916
I will stand by your side.

32
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,500
If you don't forgive him,

33
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,708
neither will I.

34
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,083
Lady Wu,

35
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,125
eat well and rest early.

36
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:20,750
Song,

37
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,500
I genuinely consider you and Lady Wu

38
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,916
as close friends.

39
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,916
You deceived us,

40
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,541
but it seems

41
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,208
you also protected us.

42
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,583
Do you have

43
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,083
a compelling reason?

44
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,125
Song,

45
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,541
sometimes when one has too many secrets,

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
it becomes difficult
to connect with others.

47
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,125
Here.

48
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,083
Do you like Young Castellan?

49
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,166
Lady Wu is kind and adorable.

50
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,750
I have feelings for her.

51
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:16,000
How coincidental,

52
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,208
so do I.

53
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,750
But I'm not giving her up to you.

54
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,250
Song, you're overthinking it.

55
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,583
I'll definitely compete fairly with you.

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,666
Lady Wu, are you...

57
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,666
Let's set out immediately.

58
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,583
Since the Wuteng clue is gone,

59
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,080
I want to go find All-knowing Auntie.

60
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,250
Okay.

61
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,125
Don't worry.

62
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,875
I will definitely accompany you
to find the clue.

63
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,291
I'll go out and wait for you.

64
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,083
Okay.

65
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:09,410
All-knowing Auntie,
I have something to ask.

66
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,875
You can't ask.

67
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,250
I won't ask you, but he can.

68
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,125
Qin,

69
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,416
this is where you trade your
most precious thing for information.

70
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,449
If you're unwilling, it's okay.

71
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:31,936
It's fine.

72
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,750
As long as I can help you.

73
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:36,500
Qin,

74
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:37,791
you're nice.

75
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,708
In this lifetime,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,291
you're my only brother!

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,041
(How can I make you)

78
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:45,910
(see me as more than just a brother?)

79
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,083
This is my reward

80
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,041
after capturing my first bandit.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,041
To me,

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,450
it holds great significance.

83
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,291
What do you want to ask?

84
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,750
The whereabouts of Wuying.

85
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,458
The vast land is far away,

86
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,410
yet my wishes are right on the doorstep.

87
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,375
Could it mean

88
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,791
Wuying is in Lin City?

89
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,583
It seems to be the case.

90
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,041
Perhaps

91
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:25,750
we looked in the wrong
direction from the start.

92
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:29,750
Song,

93
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,250
you've been following us all the way.

94
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,583
At least say something.

95
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,375
Why are you asking him?

96
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,375
Let him follow us and set another fire?

97
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,333
Wuteng has appeared,

98
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,750
so Wuying should be nearby.

99
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,708
You've been out for so long.

100
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,096
Shouldn't you go home
and check on things?

101
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,291
Qin.

102
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:50,875
Yes?

103
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,166
Let's set out early tomorrow

104
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,000
and try to enter the city before dark.

105
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,583
Okay. You've been traveling constantly.

106
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,291
You should rest early today too.

107
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,125
Yes.

108
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,500
You should also rest early.

109
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,291
Okay.

110
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,750
Goodnight.

111
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,166
Song,

112
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,700
I'll be leaving now too.

113
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:12,290
Goodbye.

114
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,708
It's nothing.

115
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,750
Go ahead.

116
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,125
Retreat immediately!

117
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm ordered to capture fugitives.

118
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,500
Surrender now, criminals!

119
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,916
I've already explained
everything to Chatelain.

120
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,291
And I'll bring them to see him myself.

121
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:41,875
Step aside!

122
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:53,290
It's you?

123
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,875
I should thank you, Constable Qin,

124
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,708
for keeping us informed along the way.

125
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,625
Nonsense!

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,352
I only communicated with...

127
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,500
Chatelain and you...

128
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,000
Chatelain holds you in high esteem.

129
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,666
If you capture the fugitives and return,

130
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,458
Chatelain will surely
reward you greatly.

131
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,080
Impossible!

132
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:19,291
Song,

133
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,291
take Lady Wu and leave.

134
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,083
I'll handle this.

135
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:25,744
We'll leave together.

136
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,250
I already had a problem with him.

137
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,250
Whoever captures the fugitives today

138
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:32,784
will be greatly rewarded by Chatelain.
