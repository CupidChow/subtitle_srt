00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,710
=Stop! Young Castellan=

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,112
(Moon Pavilion)

4
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,750
(Is this a pavilion or a jewelry shop?)

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,541
(There are even traps here!)

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,541
The trap inside is triggered.
Go in and search.

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,541
Yes!

8
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,000
Search!

9
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,583
Manager, no one here.

10
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,384
Well, no one on the other side too.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,333
Go to search the back.

12
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,208
(They seem well-trained.)

13
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:24,790
(As if they're prepared for this.)

14
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:25,750
(Never mind.)

15
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,083
(I should find Lady Yu now.)

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,944
This way!

17
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,083
My saver!

18
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,291
Why are you here?

19
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,416
Isn't this Lady Yu's room?

20
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,375
I'm making Lady Yu's bed.

21
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,416
She should still be
handling accounts now.

22
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,041
Well,

23
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,750
what are you...

24
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:15,791
I...

25
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,750
I have something to discuss with her.

26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,916
When will she be back?

27
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,416
Sir,

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,250
what's the matter?

29
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,504
We're searching for thieves.

30
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:26,750
Is everything alright here?

31
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:27,583
What?

32
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,583
Is Lady Yu safe?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
I've been here the whole time.

34
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,958
I haven't seen anyone else.

35
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,791
Lady Yu is fine.

36
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,250
Let's check other places.

37
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:36,880
Let's go.

38
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,583
We've been robbed before.

39
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,000
So Lady Yu is sensitive about it.

40
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,500
After this incident,

41
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,410
it'll be harder to get close to her.

42
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,910
No wonder there are so many traps here.

43
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,958
Now, the only way
to get close to Lady Yu

44
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,416
is to become her husband.

45
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,458
But today, you...

46
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,760
Lian!

47
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,552
What are you doing?

48
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:11,072
You didn't knock before coming in!

49
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:12,250
I...

50
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,040
You're a man, what's
there to be shy about?

51
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,291
Lian, you're in good shape.

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,291
Why be shy?

53
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,125
In my village,

54
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,458
there are plenty of men.

55
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:22,870
I've seen it all.

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,912
Great.

57
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,291
Great for what...?

58
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,416
Didn't you say

59
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:51,660
you wanted to see?

60
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:58,330
Song Lian!

61
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,096
No more water.

62
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,583
Looks like your raid tonight

63
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,875
didn't yield much.

64
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,000
Alas,

65
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,579
Lady Yu is extremely cautious.

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,291
The Moon Pavilion is full of traps.

67
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,375
So I can't catch her.

68
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,250
I think

69
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:41,750
we need use our wit.

70
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,125
Become her husband!

71
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,375
Now, the most likely
candidate is Constable Qin.

72
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,916
But that man seems unyielding.

73
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,458
A bit tricky.

74
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,125
I don't think so.

75
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:58,875
Stubborn people

76
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,416
are actually

77
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,500
easier to manipulate.

78
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,500
Young Castellan, why you look so tired?

79
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,541
Don't mention it.

80
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,208
Without my mother's bracelet,

81
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,708
I can't sleep peacefully.

82
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,200
Here he comes.

83
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,424
Hurry up!

84
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,291
Bold thief!

85
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,291
Surrender now!

86
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,250
Ah!

87
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,232
Rascal!

88
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,288
Get out of here!

89
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:12,910
Lady...

90
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:13,833
I didn't mean it.

91
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:14,720
Lady!

92
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,749
You think you can take
advantage of my vulnerability.

93
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,720
So you spy on me while I bathe
and ruin my reputation.

94
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,666
I can't go on living like this!

95
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,958
I'll take responsibility for you.

96
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,504
Whatever you say goes.

97
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,750
How dare you trap me!

98
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:47,916
I refuse

99
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,958
to collude with you guys.

100
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,541
We did set you up,

101
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,750
but you did see my body, didn't you?

102
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:58,750
That's right.

103
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,916
And you did agree last night.

104
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,875
A gentleman's word

105
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,666
is final.

106
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,083
Yes!

107
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,083
Final indeed.

108
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,083
I will

109
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,791
pay with my blood.

110
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,166
It's not a big deal.

111
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,958
You don't value yourself.

112
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,200
Such a dullard.

113
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:22,583
Well,

114
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,083
Constable Qin.

115
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,541
Don't be so impulsive.

116
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,708
Here, take a seat.

117
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,016
Why not listen to the story
behind Young Castellan's wanted status?

118
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,424
You can listen. Come on.

119
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not a big deal.

120
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,166
I had to do it to save
the lives of my Wufengzhai's people.

121
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:49,776
I had no choice but to steal
from the Chatelain's Mansion

122
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,333
to find clues about Wuteng.

123
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,916
I know what I did was wrong.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,083
I promise you,

125
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,660
once I find Wuying and save my people,

126
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,791
I'll turn myself in
to the authorities immediately.

127
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:01,583
Whether it's death or punishment,
I won't flinch.

128
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,291
Right now,

129
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,958
only if you become Lady Yu's husband,

130
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,000
can we find answers
about Wuteng the fastest.

131
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,500
(You're the master of moral blackmail.)

132
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,416
Let's make it clear.

133
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:17,870
I'm doing this to save lives,

134
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,166
not to help you.

135
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,333
However, Lady Wu,

136
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,579
today's incident

137
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,768
was your trap in the first place,

138
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,000
and it tarnished your reputation.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,264
Let's not mention it again later.

140
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,750
You silly!

141
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,500
You still have
a chivalrous heart, I see.

142
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,291
If you're willing to sacrifice yourself,

143
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,416
then from now on,

144
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,416
we'll be brothers
with a bond as close as skin.

145
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,541
By the way,

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,968
this is the task list from Lady Yu.

147
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,458
Retrieve "Drunk in Paradise"
within three days.

148
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,410
What's "Drunk in Paradise"?

149
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,290
If you can drink this fine liquor,

150
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,125
then you haven't lived in vain.

151
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,541
Hence the name "Drunk in Paradise."

152
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:06,330
So it's just a jar of liquor.

153
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,916
Where can we buy it?

154
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,583
This liquor maker is eccentric,

155
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,888
with an unpredictable whereabouts.

156
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,672
He only gives away his wine
instead of selling it.

157
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:15,910
This is difficult.

158
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,750
Where should we go to find him then?

159
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,125
Hello, Young Master Song,

160
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,583
Young Master Qin,

161
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,250
and Lady Wu.

162
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,541
Lady Yun, why are you here?

163
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,250
I sneaked out.

164
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,520
I don't know if there's anything
I can help with.

165
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,916
Have you heard of "Drunk in Paradise"?

166
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:50,120
Your task is
to retrieve "Drunk in Paradise"?

167
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,580
I know where that liquor maker is.

168
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,125
I can take you there.

169
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,816
Lady Yun, you're truly my lucky star.

170
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,416
Well,

171
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,848
you can prepare yourselves first.

172
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,208
I'll take my leave.

173
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,625
Okay.

174
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:10,666
Here.

175
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,000
Eat it.

176
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:11,620
Okay.

177
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,708
(As a girl,)

178
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,540
(you should be reserved.)
