00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Legend of Qingcheng

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Guards!

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Arrest Third Miss and lock her up in the woodshed!

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You...

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What are you doing?

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to see my mother.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to see my mother!

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If you want to blame Third Miss,

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
blame your Second Sister for insisting on getting rid of her.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Her Ladyship has no other choice.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't let you talk nonsense.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Take her to the General's Mansion.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let me go!

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let me go! Let me go!

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Miss, at least eat something.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You won't be able to hold on if you keep going like this.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How is the investigation going?

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Third Miss has been locked up in the woodshed and waiting for her to be released.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It seems that Her Ladyship is determined to make her bear this burden.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I should have guessed it earlier.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You found someone to follow Aunt Ping.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then...

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The General's Mansion

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
General, Third Miss has returned to Lord Anping from Jiangling.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She must be the one who framed you for kidnapping and kidnapping.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Since she took action, it means that she is anxious.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The more anxious she is, the more clues she has left.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It will be more beneficial to us.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But you have been released from the coffin.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The evidence we have is not enough to prove her crime of colluding with the enemy.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What if Third Miss takes this opportunity to pull the General's Mansion apart?

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then...

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You go to the capital in person.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You must hand this over to the Crown Prince.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
A'chu.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Princess, you said you would help A'chu.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Does that count?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A'chu.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Zhenge.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know why you called me and the elders to the ancestral hall today.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My dear elders, my aunt died of innocence.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Someone has poisoned her.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is the account book of the medicine shop.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The person who registered the medicine three days ago and went to buy it is Aunt Ping, who is with my mother.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What's going on, Aunt Ping?

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Madam, I'm wronged, madam.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was about to leave at that time.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Third Miss, you are not feeling well.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I brought her some medicine.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You are old and have different medical skills.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How do you know that the medicine can kill people?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Aunt Ping, you are the most capable person around my mother.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How can you willingly listen to Third Sister's death?

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What do you mean?

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you suspecting me, the head of the family?

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I dare not.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's just that people are watching.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If the murderer is killed,

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
it will be difficult for you to live in heaven.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How dare you!

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come on, give me a slap.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mother is angry.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Second Sister is not feeling well.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's hard to control her.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why don't you call Third Sister?

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
She can talk to Aunt Ping face to face.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Bring Third Miss here.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Third Miss,

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
did you ask Aunt Ping to buy medicine from the medicine shop

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and serve Madam wrongly?

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It caused her to die from poisoning.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If you want to live,

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you can only admit your crime of killing.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Otherwise,

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you will be punished.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are not a good person.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are not a good person.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You are not a good person.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You are not a good person.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You are not a good person.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Otherwise,

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you will be sent to reunite with your mother.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Third Miss,

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
did you hear what Madam said?

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Answer her quickly.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Li Qianqian,

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
are you crazy?

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I made a mistake.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I killed Aunt Ping.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Please punish me and the elders.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Third Miss is young and ignorant.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Please punish her.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Please punish her.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If so,

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
send Third Miss to the country's temple

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and never come back.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You can all leave.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No,

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it's not like this.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The matter has not been investigated.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
These are all their thoughts.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wait,

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you can't go.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have to report to the government

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and let the people of Yamen investigate.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A'chu,

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
you can't go.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You can't go.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No,

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
you also believe what they said.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I was just being unreasonable.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I swear,

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I will never let Aunt Ping die in vain.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I will never let Aunt Ping die in vain.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The second Miss is getting used to you.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If this continues,

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
she will become a big trouble sooner or later.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The truth is like the past.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm afraid only my mother knows it best.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You do it yourself.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You...

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Li Qianqian.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is the dowry that Madam Ying gave you.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Take it with you.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Li Qianqian,

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
what on earth are you doing?

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Where on earth did Madam Ying let you down?

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The worst thing she did was to adopt you.

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Li Chuchu,

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the wind and water are in a circle.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
As long as I'm alive,

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you don't want to live a good life.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry, Madam Ying.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Chuchu was useless.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What are you doing here?

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Chuchu,

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
listen to my explanation.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What else can you explain?

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
My brother spoke out of his mind

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and said that he would support me to avenge Madam Ying.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But he stood on the side of the murderer.

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I should have thought about it.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I should have thought about it.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You should have.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You should have.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I should have.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You should have.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I should have thought about it.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I would only put the General's pets

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
in the first floor.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
As for the other pets,

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
they can be sacrificed at any time.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Chuchu,

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I know you feel wronged.

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But now, it's not the right time.

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You have to put the overall situation first.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Overall situation?

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If one day,

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I am in danger of the overall situation,

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
will you also give up on me without hesitation?

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,600
A'chu,

169
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,000
we've been through so much together.

170
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,560
You still made a vow in front of the ancestors.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,880
Have you ever

172
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,880
truly trusted me?

173
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,120
Will you send your mother to the prison?

174
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,640
No.

175
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Please go back, brother.

176
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
Don't disturb my mother.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,760
Have you heard of my father?

178
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,040
His blood reaction will slow the transplantation process.

179
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,640
Hi, how are you?

180
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:18,080
Chi,

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If you are lucky, you can take care of your fate with my hand.

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Miss, you don't look well.

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's find a doctor to check you.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm fine.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm just a funeral worker who is busy with my aunt.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm a little tired.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Miss, are you okay?

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm fine.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You haven't been coming to the water for this month.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Your Highness.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Your Highness.

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Although the State Palace is in the hands of Ansheng,

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
it's not right to say it.

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you think you can think of a way to get rid of me?

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What's the hurry?

196
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Your mother's case has shocked my father.

197
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's good enough to keep your position as the Crown Prince.

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't do unnecessary things.

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Just remember it.

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not going to do anything.

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm going to take care of my father.

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't do unnecessary things.

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Just remember it.

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Thank you for your advice.

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Your Highness.

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's really outrageous.

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Your Highness, what happened?

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The Crown Prince has abused several people in the court.

210
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He even said that Li Bao was gone.

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He's not only taking over the position,

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
but also has two more weeks of military power.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Your Highness.

215
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
General Qin Li is here to see you.

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Doctor, how is it?

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's the meridians.

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This lady has been pregnant for about a month.

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's just...

220
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What is it?

221
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a fake.

222
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a fake.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a fake.

224
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The baby...

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's too late to keep it.

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

227
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
General, don't stand on ceremony.

228
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was just about to come in

229
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
to congratulate you on your promotion.

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You came first.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I happen to have something to ask you.

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
General, please go ahead.

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I know everything.

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You don't have to avoid it.

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Because this has something to do with the Duke's Manor.

236
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The battle of Jiangling three years ago

237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
caused my father's death

238
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,780
because of the

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
General's disappearance.

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
No.

241
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Take him down.

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Doctor.

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Please keep this a secret.

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I understand.

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What did you say?

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Li Chu Chu is pregnant?

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes.

248
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I saw Mingyuan's maid

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
sneaking around.

250
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So I kept it a secret.

251
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This just got back to normal.

252
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How did she say that?

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What should I do?

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
My Lady, please hold on.

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This child...

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
can't be kept.

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.
