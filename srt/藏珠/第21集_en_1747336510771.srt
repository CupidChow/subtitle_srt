00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Li Chuchu, wait for me.

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why did you spend so much money this month?

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Where did you spend it?

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Young Master,

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
it's because my lady asked Madam to take care of her.

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So...

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Nonsense!

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
From now on, without my permission,

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you are not allowed to give her a single penny.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Young Master,

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the letter from Third Prince.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
To kill Li Zhen.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Lin Xiaogong

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Young Master Lin,

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
how are you?

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who are you?

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your...

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
old friend.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Since you are so anxious,

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I came to see you.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You are so sneaky.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you want to say?

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I just want to ask you one question.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you want to know

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
who ruined your wedding?

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Who made Madam go to prison?

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Master.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Master,

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Young Master Lin is here.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Tell him to wait in the front hall.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll be there in a minute.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Lin Xiaogong

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
General Li.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You came here without permission.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's the matter?

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm here to take my newlywed wife back.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I told you long ago

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
that you are not allowed to have a wedding.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Young Master Lin is here.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He said he would take you back to the Mansion of Duke.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Today,

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't take Lin Ansheng back.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I won't let you go.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Young Master Lin, please go back.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's all my fault.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You and I are destined to be a couple.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why?

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Is your love for me

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
all fake?

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I...

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Li Chuchu,

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
do you really think

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you can fool everyone

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
in the valley?

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now,

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you don't even give me a reason.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you really think I'm a fool?

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Please forgive me, Young Master.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have my reasons.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Reasons?

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What reasons?

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you my sister's reason?

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's so obvious.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't even see it before.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Li Chuchu,

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
why do you like to

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
flirt with your brother so much?

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If I want to flirt with my brother,

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to flirt with Li Zhen, too.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you like Lunlun so much?

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't know.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't know.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Do you think your relationship

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
is not revealed?

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm telling you,

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
if you don't give me Li Chuchu,

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll expose your relationship.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll see how you will be in Anping County.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Threaten me?

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is the last time.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Even if I don't do it,

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I won't let you get along well.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's see

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
which side of justice

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
is on the other side of the world.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Young Lord.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You don't have to worry about this.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll handle it.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Master.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Second Miss.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Bad news.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Young Lord Li is making trouble outside.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is a dirty place.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This doesn't deserve the name of the prison.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Guards.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Take the whip down.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Stop.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Get out of my way.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Lian Sheng.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You only know these tricks.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Tricks?

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
General Qilin

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and his sister Gou He.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do I need to use more clever tricks

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to deal with you?

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Do I deserve it?

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Whatever you want.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Just come at me.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you think I'm not capable?

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I gave these three punches to Chu.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Give them back.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Can you give them back?

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Give them back.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Lian Sheng, listen.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll give them back ten pounds.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm more qualified than anyone else to be with him.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I won't allow anyone

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to insult him, insult him, or trample on him.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Li Chu Chu.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You wanted to leave,

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but you deceived me.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll let you taste it soon.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You lost your right to love.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Lian Sheng.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Lian Sheng.

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Miss, are you really leaving?

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If I stay like this,

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll only drag you down

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and bring shame and trouble to the General's Mansion.

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're so hardworking to get close to me.

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What do you want from me?

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Do you want to be the mistress of the Duke's Mansion?

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Young Lord Li,

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you're overestimating yourself.

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're just a palace maid.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I really don't like you.

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I really don't like Li Qian Qian.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You don't like the mistress of the Duke's Mansion?

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you want to be the princess?

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If I had the help of Young Lord Li,

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
why not?

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Besides,

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can help you stand on the third prince's feet.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Isn't it?

165
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why are you here?

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You still want to leave?

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You lied to me.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You killed the Empress.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How could you leave without saying a word?

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Go.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Li Chuchu,

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
what do you think you are?

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's been so long.

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We can't be brothers

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
or husband and wife.

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's good to be separated.

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Separated?

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You killed my child.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I will never let you go.

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You stay here.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Day and night,

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I will be your wife.

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I want to run towards the wildness.

188
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I want to forget all the past love and hate.

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I want to take the risk of being covered in frost.

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I just want to ask you,

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
are you willing to stay?

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
