1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:15,200
for more, cashea SPA why going back to stars?

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,160
OK?

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,560
Cancel the plan

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your Highness.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You don't remember me?

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I feel so relieved

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to see you

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
at the Spring Festival.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I also thank you

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
for your help.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Beauty,

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
who sent you here?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Duke Ling Xiao.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If so,

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I won't let you

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
go back.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Miss.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Miss.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's a drunken spirit outside.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please leave.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What should I do?

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No one will know

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that I did it.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please leave.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Chu,

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I came back from abroad

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to prevent you from suffering

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and suffering.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm a minister

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and I'm willing to die for the country.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But I've already

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
broken my oath as a brother.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Since you and I are brothers,

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll never see

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
this chance again.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I want to control my heart

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and have the time to think about you.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But I can't.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I want to control my heart

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and have the time to think about you.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll always be responsible for this.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's hard to do it.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But Chu,

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
no matter what, you have to believe

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that my heart

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is the best in the world.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm willing to die

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
for this.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm willing to die for this.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The Last Supper

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're awake.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Young Master,

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
why did you tie me up here?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Li Chu Chu,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you're so smart

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that you can fool people

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
into falling in love.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
In the past,

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
we could have worked together

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and achieved what we wanted.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I believe this time,

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you can still help me

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and make everyone happy.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What do you mean?

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Could it be...

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
My good sister,

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
do you think

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
with your little tricks,

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
you can really deal with my mother?

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If I hadn't secretly cooperated,

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
your heart

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
would have been dead by now.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I said no, but no.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As long as I'm alive,

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you can't decide

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
everything in the Mansion of Duke.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I didn't expect this bastard

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
to be alive

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and become the Second Miss of the General's Mansion.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The Second Miss?

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's better to find a place

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
where no one is there

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and kill her secretly.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So...

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's you.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's right.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I knew you were alive.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Then why didn't you tell me?

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Tell me.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why should I tell you?

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I need you

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to deal with my mother

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
who loves to play tricks.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why don't you talk?

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you blind?

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What?

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is it not good to be played by someone?

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You're so ridiculous.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was even a little guilty

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
of being with you.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now it seems that I don't need it at all.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're a lunatic.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you want to kill me,

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
then do it.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's not that easy

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to die.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I was so careless

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in the Mansion of the General's.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I didn't let you die

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
so easily.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What on earth do you want to do?

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What do I want to do?

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You'll know soon.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
These days,

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
has the Third Prince

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
made any new moves?

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He probably thinks

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
we've caught a lot of thieves

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and dared not to act rashly.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He's a cunning man.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He can't be careless.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
General,

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
you'd better go back and rest.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm fine.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
General,

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
there's a letter from the mansion.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The second girl is missing.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sir,

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
are you looking for me?

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Where did she go?

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't know.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't blame you.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Tell me,

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
where did she go?

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I really don't know.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't dare to ask

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and I can't bear to ask.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're suffering

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and it's even more painful.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Please punish me.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
General.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How is it?

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Any news?

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
As you ordered,

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
we've sent people

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to all directions.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But we haven't found

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the girl's whereabouts.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Li Chu Chu,

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
your wish has come true.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But you lied to me.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll make you taste

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the taste of losing your lover.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What I'm saying now

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
is more like

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm trying to take her away.

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Could it be that...

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Keep searching.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll go to the mansion

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and check it out.

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
General Li, please wait.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll go tell Young Lord.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Get lost.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
General Li,

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you're here so soon.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's good

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that I don't have to send people

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
to inform you.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Chu.

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Brother,

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
leave me alone.

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go.

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Leave me alone.

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Chu, you're the one who killed her.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why did you kill her?

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
General Li,

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
if you cooperate with me

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and hand over

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
what Third Prince wants,

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and commit suicide,

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I promise

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I won't hurt my sister.

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't promise him, brother.

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't, brother.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't promise him.
