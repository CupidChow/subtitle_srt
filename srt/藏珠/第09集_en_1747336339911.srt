1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,560
Love and described by development

2
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,600
Episode 19

3
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,300
Original Li Chu Chu

4
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,300
He's dead.

5
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,440
From now on,

6
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,800
just fiction.

7
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,240
Don't mention it again.

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,440
I will blame it all on łuc No. 8

9
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,240
There's no gr obligatory even in death.

10
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,240
I've buried my whole life

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
A'Chun

12
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
The hatred that I haven't repaid

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Has been buried in my heart

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,240
If there's no love

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,240
I'll be content

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,240
If I miss the one I met in the first place

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,240
But the night is full of stars

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,240
No one is with me

19
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,240
I've buried my whole life

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,240
I've buried my whole life

21
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,240
I'll be content

22
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
If there's love

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
I'll be content

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
If there's love

25
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,240
I'll be content

26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
It's my obsession

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
It's my fault

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
It's my fault

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
It's all my fault

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
It's all my fault

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Why is Tian Tian having a red mole today?

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Miss Tian is always weak

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
And she's allergic to many things

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Maybe she's allergic to something

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Tian Tian

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Mother

37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
How could this happen?

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
It seems that you can't go to the Spring Festival Gala

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I've prepared for so long

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
But I'm going to lose my job

41
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Since the General's Mansion has accepted the post

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
It's not good to not go

43
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Madam, do you think we should let the second lady go

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Or the third lady go?

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
Madam

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Madam, bad news

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Madam, bad news

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
The third lady has diarrhea

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
She's very sick

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
It's good to find a housekeeper

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
To deal with such a small thing

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
And just tell her

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Yes

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I know

55
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
But in this situation

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
It's too strong

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Mother

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Sister

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
It's the Spring Festival Gala

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Tian Tian has a red mole

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Qianqian is not feeling well

62
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
You can only go to the General's Mansion

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Mother

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Chu Chu is always on the stage

65
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
She's not only very beautiful

66
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
But also

67
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
I'm afraid that if she goes

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
What if she does something wrong

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
And the General's Mansion will be criticized

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Since you know your own problem

71
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
You should be more careful

72
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Come back when you show your face

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
I know

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Put on this dress

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
And go to the Spring Festival Gala

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Yes

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I will

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
I will

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
I will

81
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
I will

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
I will

83
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Put on this dress

84
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Don't lose the face of the General's Mansion

85
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Chu

86
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Why are you here?

87
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Why can't it be me?

88
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,240
The Spring Festival Gala is the most important event in Ping'an County

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
The female members of the General's Mansion

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Of course can participate

91
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Chu

92
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
You've been very out of tune lately

93
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
What happened?

94
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Brother and Miss Lin are about to get married

95
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Of course, sister should hurry

96
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
In the Spring Festival Gala

97
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Maybe we can meet a better girl than Young Master

98
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Let me go

99
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Listen

100
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
I will never marry Lin Shu

101
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Or anyone else

102
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Because a long time ago

103
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
I promised another girl

104
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I will be with her forever

105
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Brother's wedding has nothing to do with A'Zhu

106
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Sister

107
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
The third sister is here

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
The third sister is here

109
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Sister

110
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Sister

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Why are you here?

112
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Are you not feeling well?

113
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Brother

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Sister

115
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
I've never been to the Spring Festival Gala

116
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
You can take me to see it

117
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
But can you hold on?

118
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm almost recovered

119
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Sister

120
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Take me there

121
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Let's go

122
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
The Young Master is poisoned in the Spring Festival Gala

123
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
It's the best chance to get out of the country

124
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I can't miss it

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
The West Gate

126
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
It's my honor to be in the show

127
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
You deserve it

128
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
I'm Li Zhen

129
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Greetings, Third Prince

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Rise

131
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
I've heard of General Jiuwen's name.

132
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Today, I see that he is really a man of great power.

133
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,240
I've heard my father mention the Third Prince's name

134
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
in the past.

135
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I respect him very much.

136
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Really?

137
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
In the battle of Jiangling,

138
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,240
my father was framed and put in prison.

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I wonder what His Highness thinks.

140
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,240
General Li is very strict.

141
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
If this is passed on to His Majesty,

142
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
I'm afraid he will

143
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,240
be angry with the Li family again.

144
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Thank you for your consideration.

145
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Thank you.

146
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Thank you.

147
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:56,440
So

148
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,240
테

149
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:12,240
虹君柳墨外苔死损柚边

150
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,520
破曲

151
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,780
优秀如飞越

152
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,500
生千变善

153
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,460
Becauseerer

154
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
You are so brave.

155
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
How dare you to take action under the broad daylight?

156
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Who are you? Stop!

157
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
You are so brave.

158
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
You are so brave.

159
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
You are so brave.

160
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
You are so brave.

161
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
You are so brave.

162
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Sister, are you okay?

163
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Miss, why is your clothes made of phoenix's pattern?

164
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
The phoenix is so noble.

165
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
The mother of the country is so poor.

166
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Li Chuchu dares to provoke the public.

167
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
The queen is the mother of the third prince.

168
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Li Chuchu is so bold.

169
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
The third prince is here.

170
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
You should be punished for the crime of disrespecting the king.

171
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Chuchu is my sister.

172
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
She is young and ignorant.

173
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
If you blame her, you will punish me.

174
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
A little sister.

175
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
General Qilin values her so much.

176
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
It's a pity that I always reward and punish the people.

177
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Her crime is not as severe as yours.

178
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
You are right.

179
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I should be punished for my mistake.

180
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
But,

181
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
please see.

182
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I am not wearing phoenix's pattern.

183
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I am wearing peacock's pattern.

184
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I think Miss Lin was just blind.

185
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
She is so mean.

186
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I am afraid she wants to offend the third prince.

187
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I should be punished.

188
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I was in a hurry.

189
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
I was wrong about Miss Chuchu.

190
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Miss Chuchu

191
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
is a very good person.

192
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
She is a very good person.

193
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
I think she is a good person.

194
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
I think she is a good person.

195
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Miss Chuchu.

196
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Miss Chuchu is not frightened, right?

197
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
The third prince is very kind to the queen.

198
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
I am not afraid of him.

199
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Damn it.

200
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
She escaped again.

201
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Don't be angry.

202
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
She is lucky this time.

203
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
It's not sure next time.

204
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
The person who did this is reliable.

205
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Don't let the whole family find out.

206
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Don't worry.

207
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Take care of everything.

208
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
If there is no love

209
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I will be sad

210
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Looking back, I have missed the first person

211
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,500
But the eyes are full of tears

212
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I can't help it

213
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Forgetting all the past

214
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
The cruel years

215
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I hope I can be a hundred years old

216
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Life is like a life

217
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
If you have the heart to stay with you

218
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I will keep my promise with you

219
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
To be together

220
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
If you have the heart to stay with you

221
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I will keep my promise with you

222
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
To be together

223
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
To be together
