00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This time, both families have been punished.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
They have paid a price for what they did.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, I should investigate the mother's death.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Today is a good day.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You should go out and have a look.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I have an appointment.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Third Miss, Madam is thirsty.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why don't you serve her?

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No need.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I punished you because you were wrong.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But after the punishment, you will do whatever you want.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I won't treat you badly.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Madam, please teach me.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now that Tiantian has returned to her hometown,

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will take it as a gift

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and treat you as my own daughter.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But you have to learn the rules.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will teach you a lesson.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know nothing.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you, Mother.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Qianqian and Mother are of one mind.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Miss Chu Chu.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Young Master, I waited for you all day.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I thought you wouldn't come.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry for the accident at the wedding.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You thought Young Master had changed his mind?

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why are you saying this?

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If I had this intention, I would have been beaten to death.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why are you saying this?

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I believe you.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I care about you too much.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have been watched closely lately.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Someone has been watching me.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm afraid I can't say a few words.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's okay.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We have a long way to go.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Father,

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
today,

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
you can tell me about your childhood.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I want to know more about you.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Third Prince is very cautious.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The evidence of the case

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is almost unreliable.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
After investigating for so long,

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
there is still no more clue.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then we can only wait for them

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
to make another move.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
General,

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
our spy found out that

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Third Prince went to Jiangling secretly yesterday.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Jiangling?

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why did he go to Jiangling?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Feng Lin,

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
go and prepare.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm going to Jiangling in person.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Jiangling.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I didn't expect you to be so naughty when you were a child.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Those old servants in the mansion

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
are not hiding from you now.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
My mother asked them to be cleared out

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
a long time ago.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Fortunately, there is a register in the mansion.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When I become the head of the family,

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can still think of a way to invite them back.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
My mother has been watching me closely lately.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I have to go back first.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Rest assured.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You must wait for me.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Jiangling

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If I can get this register,

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can find the old man's identity card.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Miss,

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I found what you wanted.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Jiangling

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It seems that

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the money that was given to my mother

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
when she entered the mansion

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
was probably this money.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I heard that a thief was found in the mansion.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't worry, Madam.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I didn't lose anything valuable.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's just a list of the register

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that I found more than ten years ago.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is too strange.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It seems that someone did it on purpose.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I have to be careful.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Madam Qi,

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you go to a place quickly.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Jiangling

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hello.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Is Mrs. Qian at home?

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hello.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Is Mrs. Qian at home?

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Miss, you came by accident.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She passed away yesterday.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Passed away?

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
There are many good Mrs. Wen outside.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't know why,

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
but recently, everyone came to see Mrs. Qian.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There are also outsiders coming.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Outsiders?

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Who are they?

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Probably a year ago.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It seems that the surname He

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
also asked about the incident

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
of the madam of the Duke's Mansion, Lin Hen.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When she left, she left an address.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She said that she would write to her

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
whenever she remembered something.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The surname He?

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I have the surname He.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is this person her family?

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Can you tell me the address?

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I can only ask the former madam of the coffin.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But I heard her say

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that she is a drug dealer from Jiangling.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She sells drugs to newlyweds every year.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Now all the clues are broken.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If we can find the surname He,

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
maybe we will find a way.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But this trip is long.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The madam will definitely stop us.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You should wear more thick clothes.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Jiangling is cold.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The time you have to go

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
may be longer.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You told Mingyue to tell me that she had something to tell me.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why are you drinking so much here alone?

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I am happy.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What's the good thing?

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's go.

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Be careful.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I heard that

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the flower festival in Jiangling

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
is a holy festival.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No one has seen it before.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I heard from the couple that

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
my brother is going to Jiangling.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I wonder if he can take me with him.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I am going to do business this time.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Didn't you always owe me a birthday gift?

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't want to be a fool.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I want to go to the flower festival.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Chu,

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you are drunk.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I will send you back to your room to rest.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Chu,

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you are so lucky now.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You don't even know what you are doing.

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I am so happy.

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I am so happy.

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I am so happy.

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I am so happy.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If there is no love

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will not miss you

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I will not miss you

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The first person

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But the night is full of dreams

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No one understands

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I will not forget all the memories

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I will not forget all the memories

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I will not forget all the memories

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I will not forget all the memories

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will not forget all the memories

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's go.

175
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's go.

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Madam, why are you here?

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You bitch!

178
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You gave me a good daughter.

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You even seduced my brother and eloped.

180
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't tell me you don't know anything.

181
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Madam,

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I really don't know.

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But there must be some misunderstanding.

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No wonder the marriage between Brother Zhen and Miss Lin is so complicated.

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It was this Changfu who was behind it.

186
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's not him.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No way.

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Miss and Master are getting along well since they were little.

189
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They are just brother and sister.

190
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I...

191
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Madam,

192
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I am sorry.

193
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I am sorry.

194
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I am sorry.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I am sorry.

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Madam.

197
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Madam, it's not my fault.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Second sister and Brother Situ

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They are the ones who made it up.

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Madam,

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
When did you know about it?

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Mother, don't worry.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Qianqian has her own rules.

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
She won't talk nonsense.

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The most important thing in the world is the law.

207
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If it is spread,

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
the whole Li family will be ruined.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You all will die.

210
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I will never leave you

211
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I will never leave you

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I will never leave you

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I will never leave you

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I will never leave you

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I will never leave you

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I will never leave you

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I will never leave you

218
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I will never leave you

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I will never leave you

220
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I will never leave you

221
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I will never leave you

222
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I will never leave you

223
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I will never leave you

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I will never leave you

225
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I will never leave you

226
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I will never leave you

227
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I will never leave you

228
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I will never leave you

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I will never leave you

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I will never leave you

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I will never leave you

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I will never leave you

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I will never leave you

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I will never leave you

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I will never leave you

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
I will never leave you

237
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
I won't leave you
