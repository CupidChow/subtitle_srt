The Long Ballad

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Miss, General Feng is here.

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Second Miss.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
General Feng, what can I do for you?

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Second Miss.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is all the money we have.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You must keep it.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why did you give me this?

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So much money.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What does he mean?

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
All right.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Aunt Ping.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Tie him up.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What does he mean?

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Aunt Ping.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Today is the day of her wedding.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have to see him off.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
She said

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
it's because she's the one who is going to marry him today.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She's reluctant to lose the chance.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Keep an eye on him.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't let him go out.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
General.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I've handed the thing to Second Miss.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Chu.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
At least the money

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
can keep you and Lin Ansheng

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
out for a few years.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't come back

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
if you leave.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Otherwise, I won't let you go.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Amitabha.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
God bless you.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You must live a happy life.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm always worried.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Take care of Fushao.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll go and see Tiantian.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's cold in the spring.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't get cold.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Take a good rest.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The window is burning.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sister Ta cares about her sister.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
First, bow to the heaven and earth.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Second, bow to the high hall.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Bow to each other.

49
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Look.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Isn't this the official wife of the Ministry of Defense?

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How could she be the bride of Young Lord Lin?

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Everyone.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is the official wife of the Ministry of Defense.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I saw her entertain two guests that day.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Who is talking nonsense here?

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's going on?

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This...

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Today is the wedding day of the two families of Linli.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Some people are too...

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Madam.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
These people are jealous of our marriage.

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They are making a mess of us.

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't believe them.

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I believe Miss Li's character.

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But there are so many people here today.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If we don't give them an explanation,

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm afraid it won't end well.

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What you mean is...

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let me check Miss Li's body.

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Madam.

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is just a trick.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's not for others.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Madam Li.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't be too much.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Tiantian.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's wrong with Miss Li?

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Please come with me.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Please.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Stop.

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Where are you going?

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't think I don't know what you are thinking.

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Today, your marriage with Miss Li is not allowed.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can't go to see Li Chuchu.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Li Chuchu.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You bitch.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are the one who hurt me.

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm going to kill you.

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why are you so angry?

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Is it because the Lin family has broken off the marriage?

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You bitch.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going to drag you into the world

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and throw your body into the dust.

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You killed me.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Aren't you a friend of the Pope?

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Who else would want you now?

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Even so,

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going to kill you.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't be angry.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've already done it for you.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What do you mean?

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The Lin family's young lord said

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
he would take me to the wedding.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Look.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm not angry now.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I abandoned him.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is this a way to vent your anger on me?

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Li Chuchu.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm going to kill you.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are indeed a ghost.

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You don't even kill people.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why don't I teach you?

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Stop.

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Brother.

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Second sister is crazy.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She wants to kill me.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Li Chuchu.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you going to do?

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Are you crazy?

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Send Tiantian back first.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let go.

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm going to kill her.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Li Chuchu.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to kill you.

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let go of me.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Mother, you saw it.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's not Chuchu who wants to kill the big sister.

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's the big sister who wants to kill Chuchu.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If you're so stubborn,

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
why would she kill you?

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Mother, you're wronged.

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Chuchu was tied up in the room by the Pingu.

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The doors and windows are locked.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I haven't even taken a step out of this room.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Isn't this still a good way to be stubborn?

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Mother.

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Mother.

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The big sister is in this situation now.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's not suitable to stay in the Pingu.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's better to send her back to the temple for a while.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Clean up.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Send Tiantian to the old house and temple tomorrow.

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes.

143
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's good for the young lady.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
After today,

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Anping Jun will be exhausted for a while.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
She will only be more and more broken here.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't understand this principle.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's just that Tiantian is a child.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He has to be with the old woman.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't understand this principle.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's just that Tiantian is a child.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He has never left my side

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
since he was a child.

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't worry, Madam.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Time will pass.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You will slowly forget.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We will always have a time when we bring the young lady back.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This time, Li Chuchu did a great job.

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But she made people can't catch any evidence.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I really pity her.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No matter how bad she is,

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
she has to rely on the General's Mansion to survive.

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
As long as she is still in this house,

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
she can't beat Madam.

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
She hurt Tiantian.

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I can't just let it go.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let me do it.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I will do it.

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Wait.

170
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Men and women are not close.

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Wait.

172
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Wait.

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay.

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't talk.

175
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Your wound, I will heal it.

176
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm leaving.

177
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
A'chu,

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
aren't you going out?

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think they can't take care of you now.

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Where to?

181
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know.

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Where?

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you don't go,

184
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
then have a good rest.

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mother, you want to see me?

186
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Your big sister is sent back to her hometown.

187
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I just heard about this.

188
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Big sister must be framed.

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's all your good deeds.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't know what I did wrong.

191
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Please, Mother.

192
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You are shameless.

193
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't think I don't know you are trying to hurt Tiantian.

194
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But you are trying to hurt Li Chuchu.

195
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You made her go astray.

196
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm so sorry.

197
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Mother,

198
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I really don't know why.

199
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I just can't stand it.

200
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Second sister is trying to frame big sister.

201
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
To teach her a lesson.

202
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's the result?

203
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You put my Tiantian in the hole.

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This is your good way.

205
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I will teach you a lesson.

206
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This is your good way.

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Mother,

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I know I was wrong.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You can punish me.

210
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But please,

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Mother, don't do this again.

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It will hurt your body.

213
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You are good at talking.

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Since you know you were wrong,

215
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
you can kneel here

216
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and apologize to your big sister.

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
