The Legend of Chuchu

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This jade pendant is for you, Miss Chuchu.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Just take it as my apology.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In the future, if you encounter any trouble,

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the jade pendant will come to me.

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No one will stop you.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I also thank you on behalf of my sister.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Your Highness.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness,

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
will you promise me to go to my house for tea?

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Sure.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll go right now.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Miss Chuchu,

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
please rest assured.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll definitely be there.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Young Lord,

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm willing to wait for you no matter how long it takes.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There are many people here.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You should go back first.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Congratulations, Sister.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You've won the Third Prince's favor.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's go back first.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Chu, let's talk.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're so mean.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're harassing my brother,

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and you're seducing Young Lord.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You even want to go to Third Prince.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Li Chuchu,

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
why should all men be after you?

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not as weak as you.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That woman has been caught.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She said she was just using her skills.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why?

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Someone else knows.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Although she did this,

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
she's determined to find out.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You know who she is?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Chu is just talking nonsense.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Third Sister is still waiting.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll go back first.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Wait.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Third Prince is not a good person.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't go too close to him.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Be careful not to be caught.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
In my brother's eyes,

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
no matter which man approaches me,

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
he's not good.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Chu,

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I know you've been through a lot.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
When you're close to Third Prince,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you're just looking for a backer.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But it's really dangerous.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't jump into a fire pit.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Jump into a bigger fire pit.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Chu chose this path himself.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Even if it's a mountain of knives and fire,

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't regret it.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I really don't.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This Li family of Anping Jun

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is really capable of killing people.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now Li Zhen is like the sun in the sky.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The two sisters are also extraordinary.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a little interesting.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm willing to serve you.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you need me,

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
why must you do it?

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm not talented.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm willing to serve you.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
With my relationship with the old Prime Minister,

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm the first to choose you.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
In a few days, I'm going to Jiangling.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You take care of Anping Jun.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If anything happens, report to me at any time.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
General, please wait.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What's the matter, Miss Lin?

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
General, when are you going to come to my house to propose?

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
General, what are you doing?

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have a secret.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not a good girl.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't want to waste your time.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I don't want to be a part of this marriage.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please forgive me.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What did I eat?

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have a stomachache.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm also feeling a little stuffy.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But last night,

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mingyue went to the kitchen to get porridge for me.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Mingyue?

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Chunriyan was supposed to be attended by Li Tiantian.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But I accidentally got a stomachache.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can only let Second Sister go.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I can only let Second Sister go.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She went to the kitchen.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And Her Highness remembered her.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What a sisterly love story.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ask someone to take care of Ange.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Her Highness is the royal family's most important.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She must not be neglected.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't worry, Madam.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've already told her.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I've already told her.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Mother, I don't want to marry Li Zhen.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What happened to you?

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Li Zhen looks like a...

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A silver-medicine-pillow.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A useless embroidery pillow.

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't want to be a guard for my whole life.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Forget it.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Just don't marry him.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Just don't marry him.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Otherwise, I'll ask Ange to marry Li Tiantian, the legitimate daughter of the Li family.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
In this way,

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can also prevent Li Chuchu from being a little demon.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Big Sister.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What are you doing here?

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just want to tell you something.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Li Chuchu, this bitch.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How dare she trick me?

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But what can I do?

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I think I'd better forget it.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
After all, the second sister is now protected by someone.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
She is easy to move.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Especially after the Spring Festival.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Big brother sent several people to watch her.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's not necessarily.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Big sister.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You want to see me?

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Second sister.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Tonight is the lantern show.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Come with me to go out.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We take this opportunity

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to dress up more.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Thank you for your help.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But...

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You don't want to go out with me?

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Then let's go now.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sit.

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is even more beautiful.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's go.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Second sister.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There is a very good clothing store in front.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's go and see.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's go.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wait a minute, big sister.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What? There's something on your face.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Wait a minute.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Really?

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's go.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Madam.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Someone just reported that

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the second girl was kidnapped

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and went to the church.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I know.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let her go.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you want to

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
or send someone to tell the doctor

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
so as not to hurt the mother and son?

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Amitabha.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
After the two are born,

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
send someone to the military camp to report.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Little beauty.

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Little beauty.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Master.

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You are so bold.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You are really a little crazy.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You will be fine in a while.

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You caught the wrong person.

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Wrong person?

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We are looking for this hairpin.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I really don't know.

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I will give you a lot of money

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
when you get married.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's go.

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can't go in.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You are the girl who was caught by the police.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I am in your room.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Wait a minute, big sister.

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What? There's something on your face.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Wait a minute.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Really?

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
