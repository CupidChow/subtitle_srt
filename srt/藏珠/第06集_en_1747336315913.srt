The Legend of Qingcheng

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Be careful!

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's really you!

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Who are you?

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let me go!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Chu, what do you want me to do?

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You...

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How can I trust you?

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The trust between us

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
should have been broken years ago.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I hate you!

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I hate you so much!

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Miss.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You've been upset these days.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you feeling better?

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm fine.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What's wrong?

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Someone sent you a letter.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You may leave.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Miss Chu Chu,

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry for what I did.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I missed you so much.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was so depressed today.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I wanted to inform you of the situation.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I hope you can understand.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm trying to persuade my mother to marry you.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I have some money to borrow.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Lin Xiaohu is so stubborn.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Should I tell her the truth?

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Miss Chu Chu, bad news!

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I heard that Master was injured in the camp.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Take me to see him.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,960
The

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why are you here?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Master bled a lot.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The doctor said he needs to rest.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He can't move around.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't run!

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Everyone can only see

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that fox, Li Chu Chu.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No one takes me as a ghost.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Good girl.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're angry.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's not be angry.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I promise you that

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the one who likes to act will disappear soon.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Really?

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I won't let anyone

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
threaten the future of the General's Mansion.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's almost time.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Aunt Ping, let's go.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's have fun.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Who are you?

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why did you bring me here?

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Miss Chu Chu,

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
what are you talking about?

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Didn't you ask me to come here?

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Li Chu Chu, you're so bold.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How dare you!

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Madam, please forgive me.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was Miss Chu Chu who seduced me.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
She said that as long as I could take her away,

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
she would give me the silver jewelry

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
as a gift.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mother, she's talking nonsense.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know her.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Madam.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't dare to lie.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She's the one who seduced me.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Guards,

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
tie this scoundrel up.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Take him to the prison and wait for his sentence.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Guards, please wait for the sentence.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
General,

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
according to the clues we found these days,

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the old Duke Lin is just a puppet.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There's another person behind the scenes.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The biggest beneficiary of the battle in Jiangling

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
should be the Third Prince.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Not only did he get the military power

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
of the 12 provinces of the south,

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but also received a lot of support from the court.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm afraid that

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
if it's really him,

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
it's not easy to deal with him.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No matter who he is,

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
if he dares to do anything to harm the people of the country,

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I, Li Zhen, will never forgive him.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
General,

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
the Duke's manor, Miss Lin, is here.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
My dear elders,

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
the General's manor has been in such a mess.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
As the head of the family,

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm really ashamed.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not easy to deal with him.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You should deal with this matter

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
with a proper manner.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You should be punished.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
According to the rules of the family,

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
those who disobey the law

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
should be punished by the court.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Madam! Madam! Madam!

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Madam,

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm not a good daughter.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
For the sake of the deceased,

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
please forgive me this time.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I love you, but I'm not willing to marry you.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This matter is not confirmed by the court.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The husband has committed suicide.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How can I let him suffer?

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Come on!

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Take Li Chuchu to the back yard.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Madam! Madam!

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Madam! Madam!

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Second Sister is dead.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you want me to be implicated?

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Madam! Madam!

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
General Li,

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I found a cook today

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to learn some new cakes.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Try it and see how it tastes.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Miss Lin,

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
our daughter is different

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and we meet each other.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's not appropriate for you to do this.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the General's manor has already officially proposed a marriage.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Madam Li also said

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
to make the manor set a date as soon as possible.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
She wants to sign the marriage contract in person.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This matter?

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
A Chu!

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Chu!

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let go!

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Forget it.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's the family's blood.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let her suffer less.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Madam is really kind.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I hope the second girl

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
can understand the good and evil of her mother.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She can make a good family in the next life.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
viel

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,680
Today, Lord directly hereby

146
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Please go to the garden and cook.

147
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
A'chu.

148
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
A'chu.

149
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
A'chu, wake up.

150
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Come on.

151
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
I'm sorry to have made you laugh.

152
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Zhenge has been kind since he was a child.

153
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
He and the second girl are like brothers and sisters.

154
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
He just wants to save his heart.

155
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
A'chu, wake up.

156
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
A'chu, wake up.

157
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Master, I'm afraid the second girl is not awake.

158
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
You'd better come up.

159
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Get lost.

160
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
A'chu, wake up.

161
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Wake up.

162
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
As long as you're alive,

163
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
you can do anything to me.

164
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Zhenge, the second girl has broken the rules of the tribe.

165
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
You shouldn't do this.

166
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
You shouldn't do this.

167
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
You shouldn't do this.

168
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
You should be punished.

169
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
You shouldn't do this.

170
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
You shouldn't put your ancestors in the eyes.

171
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Mother,

172
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,680
you and I know what's going on.

173
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,680
If you insist on not letting A'chu go,

174
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
I don't want any face.

175
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Let's make it clear in front of the ancestors.

176
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Shut up.

177
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
There must be something wrong with this.

178
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
We need to check it out.

179
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Take the second girl back to her room.

180
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Come to me as soon as you change your clothes.

181
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Go.

182
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Bastard, are you crazy?

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
You want to abandon the Li family

184
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
for the sake of that fox.

185
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
You're so mean.

186
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
It's a big scandal.

187
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Once it's out,

188
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
the whole Li family will be destroyed by you.

189
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Mother,

190
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
