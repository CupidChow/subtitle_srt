00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Qianqian.

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Qianqian.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Qianqian.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Today is Madam's big day.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You usually go to her place to have fun.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why are you so slow today?

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You are not fast enough.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Madam.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Just wait until the banquet is over.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Have you finished your work?

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Does it make me look like a stranger?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Madam.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you are in a hurry,

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
you can go by yourself.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What's wrong with you?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Forget it.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'd better go to the kitchen to keep an eye on her.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In case something happens,

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Madam will be angry again.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mother.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I embroidered this Songhe Yan Nian Ping Feng.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I wish you a happy and prosperous day.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you, Madam.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I should have prepared the Qibao Geng for you.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll go and get it for you.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
As long as you solve Li Chuchu's problem,

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I will officially appoint you.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You will be the daughter of the General's manor.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You will be the daughter of the Qing family.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I wish you a long life and a long life.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's hard for you to think about the Qibao Geng

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
after a long time.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Madam.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are so filial.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was just trying to stop you.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Are you dissatisfied with me?

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, I dare not.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Then get out of here.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Madam, what's wrong with you?

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is there something wrong with the Geng?

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wait.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If there is something wrong with the soup,

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
then I will be the one who will be accused.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Today is Mother's good day.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Madam, don't be confused.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let go of Second Sister.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
General, this is the letter from the General.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have found out that

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Third Prince and the spy of the enemy have secretly returned.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This will collect evidence.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Soon, we will have a progress.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
General Li.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How dare you break into the military camp?

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
General Li.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
General Li.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
General Li.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
General Li.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Someone has accused you of robbing the camp

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and corrupting the society.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
His Majesty is furious.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He ordered the Dali Temple to investigate.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
His Majesty means

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
that before the matter is clear,

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
you should not interfere with military affairs.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You should go home and rest for a while.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is it His Majesty's intention

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
or Third Prince's?

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yuzhan,

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you should not offend someone.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It is better to be aware of the situation.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Young Lord, you should take good care of your family.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't be too careless.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Be careful not to get caught in the fire.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You!

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Also,

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you should not be so careless.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Also,

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you and A'chu have not left the city yet.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Your marriage will not be accepted.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Madam, please forgive me.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I am very sick.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I haven't had such a delicious soup for a long time.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have a mouthful of it.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Since you are sick,

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you should go home and rest.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Thank you, Madam.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I...

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will go and see Madam off.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Madam!

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why did you do this?

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
For Li Chuchu,

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you even give up your life?

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I did not do this for Chuchu.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I did it for you.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Madam, please forgive me.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Madam,

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
please do not do this.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You two are...

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You are my children.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Li Chuchu!

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Only I am your biological daughter.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Only I am your stepdaughter.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Only I will get rid of my own daughter.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is all your fault.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Li Qianqian,

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
are you still a human?

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How can you say that?

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I am stronger than you.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Li Qianqian,

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Li Chuchu,

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you are a shameless scoundrel.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You seduced your own brother,

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and now you even hurt Madam.

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I hate you.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I hate you!

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Qianqian!

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Qianqian!

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Madam!

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Madam!

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Madam!

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Madam!

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Someone!

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Someone, please go and get a doctor!

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Madam!

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am sorry.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Your sister is young.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It is all your fault.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Madam, do not say that.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There must be a way.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Wait for me to find a doctor.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait for me.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Madam,

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I have never done anything to you.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Please go away.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I want to give you a chance

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
to get rid of your sister.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I will do it.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
As long as you are alive,

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I will do anything you say.

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Madam!

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Madam!

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Madam!

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Madam!

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Madam!

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Someone, please come!

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Madam!

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
posts

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
crab

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,300
Flower

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
OrNow

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You shouldn't have funeral.

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,640
I am The One Initially.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A'chu.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I told you to get out!

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A'chu.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A'chu!

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Miss, don't be too sad.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll serve you to change your uniform.

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Go and guard the tomb for Madam.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Shouliang?

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
She doesn't have a daughter like me.

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why should I give her a horse?

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss,

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
are you possessed?

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Madam, she's a bastard.

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
She's a bastard!

173
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh no!

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She's possessed!

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No!

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't die.

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't die.

178
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Brother,

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't have a mother.

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't be afraid, A'chu.

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll protect you for Madam.

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I always thought that Madam was biased towards me.

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
She didn't love me much.

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Although she didn't tell me,

185
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
she kept a grudge in her heart.

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I only understood it when she died.

187
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
She had already made me a daughter.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
A'chu,

189
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can understand your feelings.

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
For you,

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Madam is not only a benefactor,

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
but also a mother in real sense.

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Madam is poisoned.

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Madam died of poison.

195
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
She poisoned her sister to frame her.

196
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But she couldn't be so bold.

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
There must be someone else behind this.

198
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I must investigate this matter.

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll avenge Madam.

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Just tell me what I should do.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No matter who I investigate,

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
will you help me?

204
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Of course.

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What if I investigate Madam?

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're so cruel.

207
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You almost killed Li Chuchu.

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're so cruel.

209
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Madam, don't be angry.

210
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't be angry with your body.

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're not the only one who died.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You didn't get the whole body.

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Now we've cleaned it up.

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If we want to do it again,

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
it will be difficult.

216
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We must get rid of the antidote we prepared.

217
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'll do it.

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes.

219
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Mother, you're asleep.

220
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Zheng, why are you here at this time?

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There's a death case in the family.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I want to ask you

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
how to deal with it.

224
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Madam is very ill.

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
She's been sick for a long time.

226
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I feel sorry for her.

227
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I want to read more of her soul-destroying porridge

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and read it.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Madam didn't die because of illness.

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
She was poisoned.

231
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is that so?

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Aunt Ping,

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you must investigate it carefully.

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You must investigate it carefully

235
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
so that the evil person won't have any trouble.

236
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes.

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll do it.

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Zheng,

239
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
what do you mean?

240
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Mother,

241
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Chu is not my biological daughter.

242
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I've decided to marry her.

243
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What?

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Not your biological daughter?

245
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Even if she's not your biological sister,

246
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
she's also a sister of your brother.

247
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If this is known,

248
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the General's Mansion will be broken into pieces.

249
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I can't agree to it.

250
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm not here to ask for your opinion.

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Something happened in the court recently.

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
My son has been suspended.

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If anything goes wrong again,

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
if someone catches you and makes a complaint,

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm afraid you can't get over it.

256
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're a traitor.

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're a traitor.

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How dare you threaten your mother?

259
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Didn't your mother say

260
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
that the future of the General's Mansion is in my son's hands?

261
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Then don't force your son to do something unfilial.

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You...

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Your Majesty,

264
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

304

I'm sorry.

305

I'm sorry.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

321

I'm sorry.

322
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
