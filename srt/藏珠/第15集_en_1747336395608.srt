00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How do you know we can't be a couple?

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you know that we are not brother and sister?

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A'chu, what are you talking about?

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
My birth mother is the original wife of the old Duke Li.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
She was adopted by my birth mother.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She hid this secret from me for 18 years

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so that I could live in the General's mansion.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A'chu, why didn't you tell me earlier?

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I just found out a few days ago.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Besides, there are so many things going on.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A'chu, I... I'm not dreaming.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If I were dreaming, I would never wake up.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
May the moonlight be like a dark night

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and a little brighter

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so that you and I can have an absurd dream

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
without any miscalculation

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The obsession of life is overlapping

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and it is self-explanatory

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I hold on to the pain of heart and hug you

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
without asking for farewell

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want to run towards the vastness of the desert

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and escape from the window of the sea of people

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to cross the light to reach your side

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't want to be alone, I'm not afraid of the distance

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I want to cross the wind and snow in the world

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to break through the clouds and save a glimmer of light

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I want to hold on to the vow of love

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and prove that I'm not afraid of the distance

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I drank a little too much.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This girl is using the most powerful medicine in the world.

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It can cure all diseases.

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you can't stop the heart, you can't quit your body.

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm afraid you'll die.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is there any other way to save her?

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There is a way to save her.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A'chu, wake up.

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A'chu.

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I was born to be a monster.

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've been missing you because I was poisoned by the medicine.

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A'chu, now you can tell me

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
why you insist on coming to Jiangling.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I came to Jiangling

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
to find someone.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Who?

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This person may have something to do with my life.

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I only know his name is He.

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He is fifty years old.

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He is a military man.

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He is doing medicine business nearby.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There are too few clues.

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Jiangling is small,

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but it's no different from the sea to find someone.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I understand.

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But as long as there is a chance,

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I won't give up.

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll help you.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Brother.

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
A'chu, I found He.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But he is not a medicine merchant.

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He is a herbalist.

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Herbalist?

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is anyone here?

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who are you looking for?

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This lady looks familiar.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Have we met before?

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sorry to bother you.

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I want to ask

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
if you know the third lady of He family

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
from eighteen years ago.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Who are you?

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm her daughter, Chuchu.

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You are right.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your eyes look exactly like your mother.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My child, I'm your uncle.

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Uncle?

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Do you know what happened?

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The poisonous woman

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
killed your mother

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
with your father's love.

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now the whole family is in danger.

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But you can't kill her

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
with your own hands.

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Uncle, do you have any evidence?

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Chuchu, come in and pray for your mother.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Mother.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Brother.

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I want to go back to Anping.

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
A'chu, the family of Duke Guo is very big.

92
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You have to take care of your mother.

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can't fight them alone.

94
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is the new identity I prepared for you.

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
As long as you can

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
let go of your grudges and grudges at any time,

97
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you can start to live freely.

98
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you for thinking about me, A'chu.

99
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But,

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can't repay you for your mother's hatred.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I have to live alone for many years.

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't think A'chu will come back in this life.

103
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Since A'chu is determined to die,

104
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have nothing to say.

105
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But,

106
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
can you stay a little longer?

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why?

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Today is the death of Chu Baochuan,

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
A'chu's birthday.

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
A'chu.

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is my first time making noodles.

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know how it tastes.

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Come on, have a taste.

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A'chu, this is...

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Are you in disguise?

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A'chu knows

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
that I won't let you go easily.

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm not afraid of you.

119
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm not afraid of you.

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'd rather go back alone.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It seems

122
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
A'chu is not smart enough.

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Brother, don't be angry with A'chu, okay?

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's my birthday today.

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Silly girl.

126
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How could I be angry with A'chu?

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's good that you're not angry.

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
After I leave,

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you have to be fine.

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You can't get hurt again.

131
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
General.

132
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Have you arranged everything?

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They will do their best

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to protect you.

135
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The Third Prince

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
seems to know

137
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that you're still alive.

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It doesn't matter.

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We pretend

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that we don't know anything

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and check the people in Jiangling.

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Now,

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
the enemy is in the dark,

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and we are in the dark.

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't help

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
his fox tail.

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Nonsense.

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Li Zhen fooled you.

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Please forgive me.

151
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Forget it.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Since Li Zhen

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
can climb to the position of General Qilin,

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
he has the trust of the Crown Prince.

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He must have a place

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to spend time with people.

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I underestimated him.

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What about

159
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the negotiation with the other side in five days?

160
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Explain it to me.

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Report to me if anything happens.

162
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes.

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Which girl is this?

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What is she doing?

165
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The Wen family.

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't understand this.

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is the second girl from Li's Mansion.

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
She's coming to propose marriage to Duke of the State.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Li's Mansion?

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Which Li's Mansion?

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I haven't seen the Qilin pattern on the box.

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In the whole Anping,

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
who else dares to have it?

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is General Li's house.

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
A girl's proposal?

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This is a mess.

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

178
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
How can a girl propose?

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Open the door.

180
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
A girl's proposal.

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Open the door.

182
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Open the door.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Open the door.

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Open the door.

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Open the door.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Open the door.

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Open the door.

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Madam.

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
General Li Chuchu is here to propose marriage.

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Which part of the world is this?

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
How can a girl in the same class

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
propose marriage for someone?

193
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Madam, you're mistaken.

194
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Chuchu is not proposing marriage for someone.

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
She's coming to propose marriage to Duke of the State.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What did you say?

197
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Li Chuchu is coming to propose marriage to Duke of the State.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Lin Ansheng.

199
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This...

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This...

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Miss Chuchu,

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
are you sick and talking nonsense?

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Come in and have a rest with me.

204
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you for your concern, Miss Lin.

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Chuchu is in good health.

206
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Li Chuchu,

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you're a virgin.

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How dare you go crazy here?

209
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Madam.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Send her and the people who are watching the show

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
away.

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The marriage proposal is here.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Is Duke of the State

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
going to propose marriage?

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Impossible.

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This marriage proposal must be fake.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If it's true, it's fake.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Just ask the young master.

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I've signed the contract.

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You can rest assured now.

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Even if it's true,

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you must have used some trick

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to trick me.

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You can't cheat me.

227
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Miss Chuchu didn't lie.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I did give her

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
this marriage proposal.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Shut up!

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Marriage is the life of parents.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
How can you be so ungrateful?

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Madam, you're wrong.

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This marriage proposal

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
was signed by you in front of the old couple.

236
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
In the past,

237
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
they were all fake.

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How can you say it's fake?

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mother,

240
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm in love with Miss Chuchu.

241
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please punish me.

242
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes.

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They are a match made in heaven.

244
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How can you let them go?

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Duke of the State of Tang,

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
you're so ungrateful

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
to bully a girl

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
who hasn't married yet.

250
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Duke of the State is too much.

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Duke of the State is too much.

252
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're bullying her.

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're bullying her.

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're bullying her.

255
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're so ungrateful.

256
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You're so ungrateful.

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You're so ungrateful.

258
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What on earth do you want?

259
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I have a dream.

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I was in love with you.

261
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I was in love with you.

262
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If I could be with you,

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I would be happy.

264
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I would be happy.

265
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I would be happy.

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have never hated you.

267
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I have never hated you.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The hatred I haven't repaid

269
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
is still there.

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If there is no love,

271
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
it will be full of me.

272
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
When I look back,

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I will miss the first person.

274
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But the eyes of the eyes

275
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
are like dreams.

276
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't see the truth.

277
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I forget all the past.

278
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I hope I can turn back time

279
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and run to the next life.

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If I could be with you,

281
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I would be happy.

282
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If I could be with you,

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I would be happy.

284
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Thank you for watching!
