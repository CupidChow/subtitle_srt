The Long Ballad

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's weird.

4
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Aunt Ping's mouth is broken.

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid she'll see Wan Yin Xing's misunderstanding.

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's bad.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I gave you the hairpin before I went out.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why didn't you take it?

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who are you?

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Go away!

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why did you get up so late?

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Aunt Ping has gone out.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She asked me to give it to you.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My hand is hurt.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's late.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll go back to my room.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Chu, do you really like her?

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Long Ballad

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't go on like this.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Since I know it's a bad omen,

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I should have made an early decision.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So you've got the general of the Li family.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mother, go and get the matchmaker to propose to her.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't worry.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Girls don't know how to be reserved.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Besides, Li Zhen has a bright future.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He has a lower family background.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Even if he wants to propose,

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
he has to let them propose first.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't worry.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, I got it, mother.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mother, I like the second lady of the Li family.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please help me.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You mean that girl?

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
She's the daughter of the Li family.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The second lady, Li Chuchu.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why does this girl look familiar?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I think I've seen her somewhere before.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's okay to marry her back.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But the girl's face looks really familiar.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I mean,

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I want to marry her as a wife.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you crazy?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
As long as I'm alive,

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you can't decide your marriage.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Chu, what should I do with you?

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Brother, do you have to go to war?

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can't bear to leave you.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll be back when the war is over.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Chu.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Brother, take this hairpin back.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You want to draw the whole world for me, right?

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're so cruel to me.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Just for Lin Xiaoguo.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If I lose you,

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I won't allow you to be together.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If brother is a guest,

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and teach us to separate,

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll miss him all my life.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know that.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Lin Xiaoguo

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you really hate me so much?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Then why do you keep this hairpin?

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I just...

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I just want to return it to you.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you really hate me so much,

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
then kill me.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Kill her.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Chu,

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
what do you believe in?

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You still need me.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Give me your hand.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I beg you, don't leave me.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Only if you marry Lin Xiaoguo,

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
can you really feel safe.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll never

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
betray you.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Miss.

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is the news reliable?

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The people in Zhuangzi received the good news

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that we sent in time.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It won't be fake.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll go and check.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll go now.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll go now.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll go now.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll go now.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll go now.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll go now.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll go now.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll go now.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay.

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It won't be fake.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
General.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're hurt.

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It doesn't matter.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What happened?

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We found the general's assistant general.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He has something important.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sister,

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
please find a way to save my mother.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What happened to her?

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She's seriously ill in Zhuangzi.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There's no doctor there.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She's going to die.

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But...

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But it's so far away.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What can I do?

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now that you're happy with your brother,

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and you're taking care of Young Master Lin,

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
how can you not have a good solution?

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm afraid you're the only one in your heart.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You don't have a mother.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You...

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're so selfish.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I didn't think you and Aunt...

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No.

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Now that you're sick,

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you should go with those

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
who are useful to us.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I won't go even if I die.

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't pretend to be so serious.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You should think about your sister and aunt.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If you don't want to go,

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you'll have to sell out all three of them.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I...

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I won't go.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I will go.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I will go.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But you have to...

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I will sell...

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will sell my body.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Otherwise,

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'd rather die.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If it wasn't for you and Aunt,

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
how could I have lost you?

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're so stupid.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Sister,

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No matter what,

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll just die.

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Peike,

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I...

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Take me to my home.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I...

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I've been here all day.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But you still saw me.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
At this moment,

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
we are all the concubines of the General's Mansion.

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Peike,

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
where are you going?

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you want to save your mother,

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
you should take something important with you.

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's go.

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
