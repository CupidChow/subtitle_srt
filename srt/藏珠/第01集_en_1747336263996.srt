1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The world is cruel.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's hard to make a mistake.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
After my father died,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the General's Mansion was destroyed.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The only brother in the mansion who loved me,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the doctor was too kind.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He was willing to kill me.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
My mother raised me to be the birthday girl of Yangzhou.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
She let me marry the nobleman.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was able to live a life without a family.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Brother.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Brother, you're back.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Am I dreaming?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wei, I heard that A'chu

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
was punished by her mother.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I came to see you.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I remember you.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We've always Şa ㅋㅋㅋ

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mountain

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You shameless bitch!

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How dare you seduce my brother

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and steal his money?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Take him to the back yard to be punished!

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Brother.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A'chu.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You asked about the love and affection of the Xiong Lei.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How could you have such a big and immoral heart?

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Brother.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They are brothers and sisters.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How dare you!

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The general's family outside will be ruined!

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How could a brother and sister do such a cruel thing?

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How dare you throw the general's face away!

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How could you do such a thing?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How dare you!

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How could you do such a thing?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not like that.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't have a brother.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How could I have such a dream?

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Xiong Mei is in love with someone else.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She thinks she is a human.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Brother has been out of town for three years.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He is a ghost.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Li Chuchu must stop thinking about this.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here is the imperial edict.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The general's family is leaving.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The country is protected.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The general is appointed as the general of Qilin.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He will guard Anping.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,620
This is the

55
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,500
last time the master has ever been in the world.

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
He was killed in the battle.

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,000
This is the last thing he has.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He is finally back.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
From now on,

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
no one dares to underestimate the general's family.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Congratulations, General Qi Yi.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Congratulations, Madam Ou.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mother.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why don't you see sister?

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Miss.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There is a guest tonight.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She is busy now.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
See you later.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You have been working hard.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Go inside and rest.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mingyu.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where is Miss.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mingyu.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Now that the ghost is gone,

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the ghost has gone.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I still can't escape from Yangzhou's

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
life.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Will I be able to

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
completely free myself

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
only by dying?

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Who will save me?

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I was careless.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Back then, besides Mingyue,

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
there should have been more people

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to take care of Chu.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Go away.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Go away.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Sister, please

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
let me go.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Damn it.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are a scoundrel.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why did you

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
force me to do everything?

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You want to live in peace.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's it.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Chu.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Chu.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Chu, where are you?

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Chu.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Chu, where are you?

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Chu.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Chu.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Chu.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mingyu.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Chu.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Chu.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I killed someone.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I killed someone.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I killed someone.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I killed someone.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Chu.

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Are you okay?

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Are you hurt?

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Brother.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I was just dreaming.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Chu.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm late.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I killed someone.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Go away.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Chu.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Listen.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I killed him.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The court has been against Liu Qianhu.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I killed him.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The court won't forgive me.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Chu.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Chu.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You suffered a lot.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why didn't you tell me?

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So what?

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't see Jing.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's just a day's troubles.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Besides,

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
according to my mother's temper,

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the more you find out,

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
the more difficult my life is.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I won't do it again.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm here.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can protect you.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I fell into a pit.

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm a man.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm a man.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm a man.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm a man.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Brother.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Will it get you into trouble?

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or I'll just turn myself in.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Chu, don't worry.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm here.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've been buried in the past three years.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Three years have not passed.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Chu,

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
can you trust me?

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't have the heart to think about it.

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I just hope I can get out of the bitter sea earlier.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And live a relaxed life.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Since

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm back now,

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I can also consider it.

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The heart is like a dream.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's like a dream.

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Forget all the past.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The years are cruel.

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Forget me.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The other side of the snow.

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Turn around and run to the next life.

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If you have the heart, you can fight.

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Fate is on the side of the shadow.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This part.

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Died.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The audience, please stand and read it out loud.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Died.

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Died.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Died.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Died.

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Died.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Died.

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Died.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Died.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Died.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Died.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Died.

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Died.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Died.

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Died.

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Only the morning

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Stuck in my heart

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Looking back, I missed the original person

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Pity, the stars are like dreams

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Suddenly, they are all the same

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Forget all the troubles

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The years are cruel

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Looking back, I missed the original person

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Pity, the stars are like dreams

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Suddenly, they are all the same

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Forget all the troubles

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Pity, the stars are like dreams

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Suddenly, they are all the same

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Forget all the troubles

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The years are cruel

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Forget all the troubles

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The years are cruel

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Looking back, I missed the original person

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Pity, the stars are like dreams
