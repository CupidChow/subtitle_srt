00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is this?

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I found these three silver needles

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in the body of the corpse.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
These needles caused the wife to die of blood loss

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and caused the blood to run dry during the production.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If I'm not mistaken,

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
these are the silver needles of the Qiao family.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's not difficult to pass on the daughter.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The only one who will remember this

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
is you, Madam.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nonsense!

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The silver needles of the Qiao family

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
are always used to save people.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How could they be used to harm people?

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
These are not the things of our family.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There is a mark on this silver needle.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's easy to prove.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I remember now.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The silver needles of our family

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
were stolen.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's you!

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You want to kill my sister!

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You want to kill my sister!

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's you!

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You want to kill my sister!

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Chu Chu, I'll kill you!

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Chu Chu!

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Chu Chu!

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mother!

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mother!

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mother!

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you okay, Mother?

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Come on!

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Take her away!

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Mother!

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Lord Qu!

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mother!

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You are blind!

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mother!

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You are the master of my miserable sister!

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Lord Qu!

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Lord Qu!

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Mother, I finally avenged you.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How is the situation in the Palace of the Great Duke?

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's really clear.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I heard that something happened on the way to the wedding.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They went to the Commandery Prince's Office.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You continue to investigate.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll go to the Palace of the Great Duke.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll go to the Palace of the Great Duke.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Lord Ling Xiao,

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it seems that the wedding is not going to continue today.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll take you back first.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's go.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Wait!

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
General Li,

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Miss Chu Chu is already my wife.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can't take her away.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Such a scandal happened at the wedding.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it shocked the government.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't let my sister get involved in such a chaos.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I will definitely give Miss Chu Chu an explanation for this.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Believe me.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Since you say so,

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
then deal with the mess in the Prime Minister's Mansion.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then apologize to my sister in person.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go home.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's go.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Madam.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Madam.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How is it going?

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The Lord took the second girl home.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That means it's not going to happen.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank God.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank the Buddha for blessing me.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Chu Chu is the daughter of the Old Duke.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If she really gets married to Lord Ling Xiao,

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
she will be struck by lightning.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Fortunately, it didn't happen.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Fortunately, it didn't happen.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Li Chu Chu is the eldest daughter of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That means

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm the only one in this family.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Only me.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Only me.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Only I am the daughter of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Only I am the most humble and lowly.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why is it always Li Chu Chu?

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why?

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The reason why you were forced to do that

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
is because you didn't tell the truth.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm afraid you want to preserve the wealth of your children.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You won't let them go back to their roots.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Chu Chu is not here as the daughter of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's a good gift.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Chu Chu

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You still remember what you said just now.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You said you would make it up to me.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Chu Chu

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Chu Chu is wearing a wedding dress.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Do you like it?

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I like it.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But Chu Chu is wearing a wedding dress today.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not good that there are no flowers in the East.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Do you want to drink it or not?

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't want to drink it.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you want to make a flower in the East,

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
you have to be a little bit more polite.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Chu Chu

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We'll go to the West later.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wait for me.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Chu Chu

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Will you marry me?

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then on my mother's birthday,

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll find a chance to tell this to her parents.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She won't answer us.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't worry.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll take care of everything.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When father is in a bad mood,

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll take you to a place where no one can stand.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Be a normal father.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Madam, you're finally back.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I met the Marquis Wenyuan outside.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He took me for a chat for half a day.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's wrong?

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This bitch.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I knew she wouldn't let go of Zhenge.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If it goes on like this,

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,960
Zhenge will be more and more

139
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
If it goes on like this,

140
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
there will be no chance to get back.

141
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
We can't let them continue to make trouble.

142
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,960
If the enemy's brothers, sisters, and friends

143
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
are spread to the ears of the current emperor,

144
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
not only will Zhenge not run away,

145
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
but all the generals will be laughed at.

146
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
But from what I see,

148
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
this girl is very cunning now.

149
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
And there's a big man behind her.

150
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
It's getting harder to deal with.

151
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,920
To prevent the whole of us from leaving Ximen,

152
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,920
it's best to kill her with a sword.

153
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
You know it.

154
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Brother, why do you still have the heart to drink?

155
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Hurry up and think of a way

156
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
to get your mother out of prison.

157
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
This case is already set on the board.

158
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
The gods can't be saved.

159
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Why do you and I have to bother with the situation?

160
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
You don't go.

161
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I'll go myself.

162
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Why are you back?

163
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Your Highness, why are you here?

164
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I came to find you.

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
I came to find you.

166
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I came to find you.

167
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I came to find you.

168
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
I came to find you.

169
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I came to find you.

170
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I came to find you.

171
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
I came to find you.

172
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
I came to find you.

173
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I came to find you.

174
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I came to find you.

175
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I came to find you.

176
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
I came to find you.

177
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
I came to find you.

178
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
I came to find you.

179
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
I came to find you.

180
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
I came to find you.

181
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
I came to find you.

182
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
I came to find you.

183
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
I came to find you.

184
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
I came to find you.

185
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
I came to find you.

186
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,960
I came to find you.

187
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
I came to find you.

188
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
I came to find you.
