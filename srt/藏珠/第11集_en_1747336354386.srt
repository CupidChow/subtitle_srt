The Long Ballad

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Tiantian, how could it be you?

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't come over. Please don't come over.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Tiantian! Tiantian, don't come over! Don't touch me!

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
My poor child, who hurt you like this?

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Tiantian, come over!

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Guards! Arrest all the teachers!

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't you dare talk to them!

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Tiantian, you're finally awake.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is there anything wrong?

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't want to die!

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tiantian! Tiantian!

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't want to die!

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't want to die!

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Tiantian! Tiantian!

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't want to die!

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Tiantian, you can't die!

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Listen to me.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I've already sent someone to bring you up.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're going to marry Young Master Ling as the wife of the heir.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Tiantian.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Really, mother?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
When did I lie to you?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Good child, forget about this, okay?

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Everyone who knows about this has been imprisoned by your brother.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Forget about him.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He's a bad man.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mother.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've become so miserable.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I was born out of the earth.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're such a vicious bitch.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How dare you collude with outsiders to kill your enemy?

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Aunt Ping, beat him hard!

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mother, I'm innocent.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've always respected you.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How could I do such a thing?

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mother, you're going to be punished. You need to have evidence.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How could you slander me?

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How dare you?

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Aunt Ping, beat him hard!

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sister, wait!

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is the Third Prince's life.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you dare to do this, you'll ruin the royal family.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Do you want to be beheaded?

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you crazy?

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You think I can't beat you with the Third Prince's support?

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll beat you to death!

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You!

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Mother, I've checked everything.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The whole thing was planned by my sister.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It has nothing to do with others.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How could you send yourself to the Ministry of Education every day?

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is the contribution of everyone.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
My sister's maid admitted that everything was arranged by her.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe she really wanted to send someone to the Ministry of Education.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But the Heaven King was too proud to do that.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He was punished by himself.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Come, I'll take you back to your room.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You bitch!

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You know everything, right?

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
A'chu, in this situation,

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
you'd better leave the General's Mansion as soon as possible.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Are you going to drive me away?

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, because too many things have happened recently.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's too dangerous for you to be alone.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But staying at home is not safe.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I want to take you with me to the villa to spend some time.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But it's too naive.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This brother and sister,

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
they are all alone.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If the world could see through it, they could drown you and me.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But I still have a lot of time.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
A'chu, what do you want to do?

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Can you tell me?

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What should you do?

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I want to believe you.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I want to believe you.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Madam, do you really want to give all these to the eldest lady as dowry?

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
In this case, the mansion will be empty.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The eldest master hasn't married yet.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
How about this? The more dowry you give,

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the faster the marriage will be settled.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can't care so much.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why is Li Chuchu still staying at home?

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why don't you kill him?

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't worry.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There will be many opportunities to deal with Li Chuchu.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The most important thing now is to settle your marriage.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So you won't have too many dreams.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Mother, will this really be discovered?

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The wedding will be held in three days.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You must hold on and don't make any mistakes.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No, I will never marry Li Tiantian.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This family is not yours for now.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The dowry is already here.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You have to marry it after three days.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You have to marry it even if you don't.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm afraid this time, I disappointed you.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want to marry the one I really like.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If I accuse you of being unfilial,

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
not only the Third Prince doesn't dare to use you,

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
but even the successor of the Mansion of the Prime Minister,

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm afraid it's hard to protect.

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What?

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Child, one day you will understand

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
how much I care about you.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Young Lord Li is here. He wants to see you.

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I know.

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Miss, Young Lord Li and the First Miss are getting married.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why aren't you angry at all?

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why should I be angry?

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can't be happy.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can leave now.

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Miss Chu Chu.

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Aren't you going to marry the First Miss?

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you still looking for me?

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't change the fate of this matter.

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But I swear to Lian Sheng,

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I will never marry you.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I will never marry you.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I will never marry you.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I will never marry you.

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I swear to Lian Sheng,

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will never marry you.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I will never marry you.

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will never marry you.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You are a good young man.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In your heart, the position of the whole family is more important.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Chu Chu, will you go with me?

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's find a house to settle down first.

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll take you to the mansion when I'm officially married.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Of course I will.

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But now is not the time.

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Because we are being watched.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Miss Chu Chu is really good at thinking.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is more appropriate.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's just...

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You have been wronged.

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
As long as I can be with Young Lord,

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't care about anything.

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Chu Chu, sit down.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Brother, is there something wrong?

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Chu Chu,

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
if we were not siblings,

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
how nice would that be?

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What do you mean?

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Could it be that she already knew my identity?

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Brother, are you confused?

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why did you say such a strange thing?

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Ah Zhi is right.

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Brother is really confused.

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He actually said such a silly thing.

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You just pretend that you haven't heard it.

157
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Chu Chu, take care.

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Love does not need to be restrained.

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Sadness is enough to be satisfied.

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
General, since you know that you cannot be controlled,

161
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
why do you have to be so stubborn?

162
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The End
