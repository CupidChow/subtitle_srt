The Long Ballad

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Second Sister,

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
do you think

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
after Big Brother became a general,

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
our lives would be better?

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The mountain village girl,

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
her identity is low.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If she doesn't want to escape from this prison,

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in the end,

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
she will only be a pawn for the people.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Miss,

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Madam is here with the big girl.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Mother,

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mother, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Mother, please calm down.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You are so bold today.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You didn't even tell me

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that you had a good job.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And you are still making trouble in the back.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Mother,

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
today is a happy day.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Please forgive me.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mother,

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,980
these maids from the

26
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,000
Madam's family should be taught well.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They should not be beaten or beaten.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Second Sister, save me.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Forget it.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Today I will teach you a lesson.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now the whole Gaosheng

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
will be taught by the noble families.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Be careful.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In case you lose the face of the General's Mansion.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How is it, Sister?

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Does it hurt?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why didn't you just

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
give in to the bad guys?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The more we give in to the bad guys,

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the more they will beat us.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why?

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why only the two of us

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
are the maids born by the Madam?

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
God is so unfair.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
When I become a noble lady

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
after the next title,

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
no one will dare to bully us.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I can't be a substitute

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
even if I have to fight with every step.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can't be a substitute.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I must think of a way to leave the General's Mansion.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Madam,

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the flowering night at the Palace of Lin will be soon.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Lady Qiao has ordered a post

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to invite the Master and the three ladies to attend.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mother,

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I heard that the Lin family has just passed the official ceremony.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm afraid there will be no one to choose from.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Prepare yourself.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's best to have a family gathering.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Zhenge,

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you are now at the age to get married.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are many concubines in the Anping County.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But in my opinion,

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the most suitable one

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
is the Lady Lin of the Duke's Mansion.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Mother,

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't want any concubines.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Just eat.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Second Lady,

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Mother has cooked the soup for you.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Go and keep an eye on it.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't let it get too dry.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How could the Second Lady of the General's Mansion

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
be used as a bait for her to keep company?

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How dare you!

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How could you say such things to Mother?

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will not let you get away with this.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How could you say such things to Mother?

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You don't need to worry about the matter between you and Second Sister.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I will take care of it.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
General Qilin, you are here.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You really make Han She proud.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Madam, please forgive me.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is my daughter, Shu Hui.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Young Master is here.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Young Master is here.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Greetings, Mother.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Come on in.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Madam, please buy some flowers for Young Master and Young Master.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you, Young Master.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You are welcome.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
These flowers are very suitable for you.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You have a good look.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What a pity.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You look like a bad person.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Miss Chu Chu,

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I have a request for you.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Miss Chu Chu,

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I am very grateful to you.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thank you for your kindness.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But,

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
marriage is the order of parents.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not the right time to say it.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We should settle it privately.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So,

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you are willing to marry me?

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't worry.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will see you another day.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And no one will propose to you.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Young Master Lin is not like what you think.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I know.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I am rich and I am poor.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can't take care of my mother and Qian Qian.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are far away.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are so reluctant.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You and that Lin Xiao Gong is old friends.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We met by chance.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You met by chance and you took the gift?

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Give it back to me.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But I am afraid that mother will not agree.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And brother.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Who?

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ming Yu.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you outside?

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Chu Chu, it's me.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What are you doing here?

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Get out.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't be afraid.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I came to give you medicine.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are you doing?

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We must get rid of the snake poison.

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It has a venom.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait a moment.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,680
Madam, why are you here?

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,080
Please wait a moment.

140
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,680
I'll go in and tell her.

141
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Get out of the way.

142
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,720
Do you have any orders

143
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,160
for me to come here?

144
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,480
Don't be nervous, Miss.

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,920
I'm here to apologize.

146
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,200
I really couldn't

147
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,360
do anything about it these years.

148
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,400
You're too harsh.

149
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm not willing to do it.

150
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,320
Thank you for saving me today.

151
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,320
It's just that

152
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,480
men and women are different.

153
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,640
I'm afraid of being criticized.

154
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,600
If there's nothing else,

155
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,560
don't come to me.

156
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,560
You're doing this for Young Master Lin?

157
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,160
I don't want to be hurt by the people

158
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,920
and let Young Master Lin misunderstand me.

159
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,280
Do you really like Lin Ansheng?

160
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,080
Yes.

161
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Chu is not married.

162
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,720
She'll be with you forever.

163
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,480
Honey.

164
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,000
It's just that she hates me.

165
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm the only one who really hates her.

166
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,120
Here's a murder weapon.

167
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,720
I love you.

168
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,560
ago

169
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,200
What are you doing here?

170
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,500
Son means

171
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,580
no one of the Before and After is

172
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,680
the same.

173
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
Just Love.

174
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,260
You don't even know

175
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,640
who you're with.

176
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,140
A hairpin

177
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,140
Who gave you this stone?

178
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,140
As long as it's from the Immortal,

179
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,140
even if it's a stone,

180
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,140
A'chu will still be in the right hands.

181
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Could it be that Zhenge really...

182
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,140
No, it can't be.

183
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140
He won't be this stupid.

184
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
Madam, the First Master is here.

185
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,140
I should have made the plan earlier

186
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
to prevent the danger from Wei Ren.

187
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,140
Mother.

188
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,140
Zhenge,

189
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm not feeling well today.

190
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
I'm afraid your grandfather is very sick.

191
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
You should go for me.

192
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
You don't have to rush back tonight.

193
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Grandfather's illness?

194
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
Didn't he get better a few days ago?

195
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,140
Maybe it's because he's old

196
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,140
and his condition is always changing.

197
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
He should see it with his own eyes.

198
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Yes.

199
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,140
Yes.

200
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,140
Everything is ready, right?

201
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,140
Don't worry, Madam.

202
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,140
I chose this for you.

203
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,140
I gave you a lot of money.

204
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,140
A'chu, are you there?

205
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,140
Yes.

206
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Brother, you can talk outside.

207
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,140
I'm going out.

208
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Please don't go out.

209
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
I'll talk to you when I get back.

210
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
Sister Chu Chu, don't be angry, okay?

211
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
If she knows she's wrong,

212
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,140
smile like me.

213
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
It's been so many years.

214
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
It's still the same as when I was a kid.

215
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,140
Second Miss,

216
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Madam told you to go over.

217
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
She has something important to discuss.

218
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Mother, you wanted to see me?

219
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,140
My Chu Chu

220
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,140
is getting more and more handsome.

221
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,140
You're getting more and more handsome.

222
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
Good girl,

223
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,140
you're getting old.

224
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,140
You haven't been married for a long time.

225
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,140
I'm worried about you.

226
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Did I mention it?

227
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,140
Thank you for your concern.

228
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,140
I chose a good person for you.

229
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,140
Although it's not a big family,

230
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,140
it's a rich family.

231
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
Pack up and marry tonight.

232
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
Mother,

233
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,140
I'm not in a hurry to marry.

234
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,140
It's not up to you.

235
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Aunt Ping,

236
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,140
dress up for the bride.

237
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,140
Don't let the Fu family dislike you.

238
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,140
No, no, no.

239
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Mother.

240
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Miss, Miss.

241
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Miss.

242
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,140
Miss,

243
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,140
Second Miss is tied up in a sedan chair.

244
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,140
What? Are you sure it's Second Miss?

245
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,140
Although it's just a word,

246
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,140
I'm sure.

247
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Well,

248
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,140
remember to find a way to inform the others.

249
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
But don't reveal your identity.

250
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
Otherwise,

251
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,140
we will become the top

252
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
in the eyes of Mother and Big Sister.

253
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Then life will be more difficult.

254
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
Yes.

255
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,140
The auspicious time has come.

256
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,140
Bride and groom, bow to the bride.

257
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
