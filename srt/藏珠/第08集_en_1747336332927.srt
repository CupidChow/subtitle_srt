Episode 16

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who are you?

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We're from the Magistrate's.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Tell me,

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
who ordered the Old Prime Minister to leak the defense plan

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and frame General Li Yun?

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Please spare me, General.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I really don't know.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You don't know?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I...

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I remember now.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I saw you and the Old Prime Minister

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:45,780
talking in the study the night before the

17
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,780
Great Han,

18
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,780
I have no grudge against you.

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,780
Why did you stab me in the face

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
in broad daylight?

21
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,780
Could it be

22
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
someone behind you?

23
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,780
You're quite smart.

24
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,780
It's a pity

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,780
that you can only be a clear-cut traitor.

26
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,780
Miss Chongshu,

27
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,780
how are you?

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Thank you for coming in time, Young Lord.

29
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,780
I'm really touched.

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
Otherwise,

31
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,780
I would have become a dead man.

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,780
Don't be afraid.

33
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,780
As long as I'm here,

34
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
I won't let you be bullied again.

35
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,780
It's just that

36
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
they came prepared.

37
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,780
But you and I are meeting here today.

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,780
Who else would know?

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,780
Could it be...

40
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Miss Chongshu,

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
did you find anything?

42
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,780
Actually,

43
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,780
I asked my maid to send a letter

44
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,780
to the Duke's Mansion yesterday.

45
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
It's a pity that

46
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,780
she was a little confused

47
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,780
and didn't hand it to you.

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm afraid

49
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,780
someone has intercepted this letter.

50
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
What?

51
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,780
It must be Mother.

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
I didn't expect

53
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,780
she would do such a cruel thing.

54
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Young Lord,

55
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
Madam said something in the mansion.

56
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,780
Chongshu,

57
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,780
if she doesn't allow you,

58
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,780
I'm afraid you can't hold on for a while.

59
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Chongshu,

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
to be honest,

61
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm the heir of Zhenger Bajing.

62
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,780
After three years of filial piety,

63
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,780
I'm the last one.

64
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,780
I'm in charge of Duke's Mansion.

65
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,780
This letter

66
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
is for a servant

67
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,780
of Duke's Mansion.

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
This letter

69
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
is for Young Lord.

70
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,780
He must see it

71
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,780
before he dies.

72
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
It seems

73
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,780
that Madam Qiao has found

74
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
my identity.

75
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,780
Otherwise, she wouldn't be so anxious.

76
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,780
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,780
Die!

78
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,780
Brother.

79
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,780
A'chu,

80
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,780
are you okay?

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,780
Young Lord,

82
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
are you okay?

83
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
Miss Chongshu,

84
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,780
I...

85
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
It was an emergency.

86
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,780
Luckily, you arrived in time.

87
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,780
We can't stay here for long.

88
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
You'd better go back.

89
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
Okay.

90
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
Wait for me.

91
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,780
I've promised

92
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,780
to marry Li Chuchu as my concubine.

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,780
Why do you

94
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,780
still want to kill her?

95
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
I have my reasons.

96
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
This woman can't stay.

97
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,780
She can't enter Duke's Mansion.

98
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,780
Why?

99
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,780
I want to know the reason.

100
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,780
Why?

101
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,780
I said no.

102
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,780
As long as I'm alive,

103
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,780
everything in Duke's Mansion

104
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,780
will be solved.

105
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
You can't decide

106
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,780
everything in Duke's Mansion.

107
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,780
Mother,

108
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
you're so cruel.

109
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,780
If you're not cruel enough,

110
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,780
how can you take the position of the crown prince?

111
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,780
I'll go back

112
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
and find a doctor.

113
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
Be careful not to get infected.

114
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
Why did you ask Lin Ansheng

115
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,780
to come to the wilderness?

116
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,780
Do you like that Lin Xiaogong so much?

117
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,780
So what?

118
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,780
A'chu,

119
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,780
it's okay if you find a good match.

120
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Duke and Lady Qiao are so fierce.

121
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,780
Lin Ansheng is not a man who can fight with the difficulties.

122
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,780
According to what I saw,

123
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,780
who is A'chu's match?

124
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,780
Don't meddle in my business again.

125
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,780
You and I are not good friends.

126
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
We won't be together.

127
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
It's been more than half a month.

128
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,780
Nothing happened to Lady Qiao.

129
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,780
I think she's afraid of

130
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,780
the long-term memory.

131
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Why hasn't the wedding of

132
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
Brother Ansheng and Lady Lin been decided?

133
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,780
It's been a long time.

134
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,780
But Lady Qiao seems to be

135
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,780
very concerned about

136
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,780
Lady Qiao and Duke.

137
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,780
I think she's worried about

138
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,780
Lady Qiao and Duke.

139
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,780
I think she's worried about

140
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,780
Lady Qiao and Duke.

141
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,780
So she's been holding on.

142
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,780
Li Chuchu is a troublemaker.

143
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,780
She likes to seduce men.

144
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
I think

145
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
we should sell her to the general office.

146
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,780
There are many men

147
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,780
who are working for her.

148
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,780
Lady Qiao, don't worry about this.

149
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,780
Think about how the wedding

150
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,780
will be held.

151
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,780
Maybe Duke will

152
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,780
change his mind.

153
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
I'm too old-fashioned.

154
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,780
If this goes on,

155
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,780
I can't get revenge.

156
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
I'll be in a dilemma.

157
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
Maybe the Spring Festival Night

158
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,780
is just a chance.

159
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,780
General, His Highness has ordered

160
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,780
the secret army of Lord Anping

161
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,780
to meet at the Spring Festival Night.

162
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,780
This is the best chance to get close to him.

163
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
All right.

164
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,780
You go and arrange it.

165
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,780
Yes.

166
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Go.

167
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,780
Come with me.

168
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,780
There's nothing to talk about between us.

169
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,780
I'll leave the news to Miss Lin

170
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,780
and the Guanyou Li family.

171
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,780
I can't stand

172
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
your attention.

173
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
A'chu, don't go.

174
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,780
A'chu, even if we can't

175
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
be close to the past,

176
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
we shouldn't become

177
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
enemies.

178
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
I promise to protect you.

179
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
I'll never change my promise.

180
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
A'chu.

181
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
A'chu, eat.

182
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
Mother is asleep.

183
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,780
She won't wake up.

184
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Brother, I'm fine.

185
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
You have a fever.

186
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Are you feeling better?

187
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,780
It's getting dark.

188
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,780
I'll ask the doctor.

189
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,780
A'chu, eat.

190
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,780
I'll go.

191
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,780
A'chu, eat.

192
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,780
I'll go.

193
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
