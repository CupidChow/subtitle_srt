1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Why the Monster?

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,940
The

3
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,940
Episode 18

4
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,740
A'chu,

5
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,140
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,340
I didn't protect you well.

7
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,940
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,940
You're still alive.

9
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
Miss,

10
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
you're finally awake.

11
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
Thank God,

12
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,940
you've been burning for two days.

13
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
I was kidnapped, right?

14
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,940
How did you come back?

15
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,940
Don't worry, Miss.

16
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,940
I've already investigated it.

17
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,940
The new maid

18
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,940
admitted that she took the money

19
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
and took you there.

20
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,940
She also stole the jewelry and money.

21
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,940
It's really a good arrangement.

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,940
Even the scapegoat found the right place.

23
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,940
It's hard for them.

24
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
Miss,

25
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
there's another big thing

26
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,940
going on in the mansion.

27
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,940
The Prime Minister's wife

28
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,940
came to discuss

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,940
the marriage of our master

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,940
and Miss Lin.

31
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
I see.

32
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
You may leave.

33
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,940
Please come in person.

34
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
I'm really sorry.

35
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,940
According to the etiquette,

36
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,940
we should visit her first.

37
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,940
You're welcome, Madam Li.

38
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,940
We're family now.

39
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,940
We're not separated.

40
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
You're right.

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,940
We're a family.

42
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
What kind of family

43
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,940
can make you think so?

44
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
By the way,

45
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,940
I have a little thing

46
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,940
to tell you.

47
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,940
What is it?

48
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
Ansheng, the son of the whole family,

49
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,940
fell in love with the second lady of the mansion.

50
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,940
She insisted on marrying her back.

51
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,940
If you don't mind,

52
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
I'll send a sedan chair

53
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,940
to carry her these days.

54
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
Well...

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
Who's there?

56
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
Come out.

57
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,940
Madam, it's me.

58
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
Madam,

59
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,940
I'm here to deliver tea to Gui Ke.

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,940
Put it here.

61
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,940
You bitch,

62
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
you're blind, aren't you?

63
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
Be careful.

64
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,940
I'll sell you to a duck.

65
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Madam.

66
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Madam, please forgive me.

67
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
Actually, I'll go get a new one.

68
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,940
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,940
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,940
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,940
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,940
I've never seen you before.

73
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,940
I'm sorry to have made you laugh.

74
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,940
Madam,

75
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,940
may I ask

76
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,940
the date of your second daughter's birthday?

77
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,940
It seems to be the eighth day of April.

78
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
Madam,

79
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
I...

80
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
I suddenly thought

81
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,940
there was something else at home.

82
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,940
I'll go first.

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
I just mentioned

84
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
the matter of marrying the second lady.

85
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
I think it's better not to do it.

86
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,940
The eight characters of the two people don't seem to match.

87
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,940
How could this be?

88
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,940
Back then,

89
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
he was just a young master who couldn't keep his eyes off.

90
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,940
Now,

91
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
why is he married?

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Madam, what happened?

93
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Chuchu,

94
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,940
you can't marry into the Lin family.

95
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,940
You can't marry into Lin Ansheng.

96
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Why?

97
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,940
Because...

98
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
you're the child of the Lin family.

99
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
You're the child of the Lin family.

100
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
You and Lin Ansheng

101
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
are...

102
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,940
brothers.

103
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,940
Madam,

104
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,940
what nonsense are you talking about?

105
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,940
How could this be?

106
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
I'm not talking nonsense.

107
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,940
If I were to be seduced,

108
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
I would be punished by heaven.

109
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,940
Your birth mother

110
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,940
is the wife of the late Duke of the State.

111
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
And I

112
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,940
am his maid.

113
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
The current Duke of the State's wife

114
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,940
is just a concubine.

115
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Madam,

116
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
you'll be fine.

117
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
Madam,

118
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,940
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,940
I won't let you go.

120
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
This child...

121
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,940
This is all I have.

122
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
Just now,

123
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
I was in the middle of a fight.

124
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,940
I was so scared.

125
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
I didn't want to...

126
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:38,260
For the sake of our

127
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,940
Madam, Madam.

128
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Later,

129
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,940
I became General Li's maid.

130
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
After having a daughter,

131
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
she took me back to the mansion.

132
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Even Madam thought

133
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
we were living outside.

134
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
I thought I'd let you

135
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
live a peaceful life.

136
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Who knew

137
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
after 18 years,

138
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,940
I'd be involved with the Lin family again.

139
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,940
I've been living for the sake of my daughter.

140
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
But in the end,

141
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,940
I'm just a joke.

142
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
God,

143
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
you are so unfair.

144
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,940
How can you live a peaceful life

145
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,940
without any guilt?

146
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
You're just a child.

147
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
You're not a child.

148
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,940
You're just a child.

149
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,940
You're just a child.

150
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
You're just a child.

151
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
You're just a child.

152
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,940
The hell is

153
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
in the hands of the devil.

154
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
Chu,

155
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,940
you just recovered.

156
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Why did you want to be a maid again?

157
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
Did Mother punish you?

158
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
It turns out that you and I are not brothers.

159
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Those dreams

160
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
are not mine.

161
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
Brother,

162
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
who am I?

163
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
Chu.

164
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Didn't you want to leave the General's Mansion?

165
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,940
I'll take you away from here now.

166
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,940
Chu,

167
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
it wasn't me.

168
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
I didn't make any mistakes.

169
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Why should I run away?

170
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Since everyone in this world has lost their lives,

171
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,940
instead of waiting for the mercy of power,

172
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,940
No.

173
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,940
I'll fight against this unfair fate.

174
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
I'm not your real brother.

175
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
I'm not your real brother.

176
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
In this life,

177
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,940
we can't be together.

178
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Chu's feelings are not right.

179
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
You send someone to keep an eye on him.

180
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,940
If anything happens, report to me immediately.

181
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
Chu's feelings are not right.

182
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
No matter how difficult this road is,

183
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,940
I must let the pit be filled with our lives.

184
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
No matter how long it takes,

185
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,940
I will never give up.

186
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
No matter how difficult this road is,

187
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,940
I must let the pit be filled with our lives.

188
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
No matter how difficult this road is,

189
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,940
I must let the pit be filled with our lives.

190
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,940
No matter how difficult this road is,

191
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
I must let the pit be filled with our lives.

192
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Mingyue,

193
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,940
did Young Master write a letter?

194
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
Not yet.

195
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
It's okay.

196
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,940
I can write to him.

197
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,940
Second sister made such a big trouble.

198
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
She even dared to dress up as a flower and come out to take a look.

199
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
She's a official.

200
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Women are more beautiful when they are married.

201
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
I dressed up for Young Master.

202
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Unlike you,

203
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
you work hard every day,

204
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
but no one cares.

205
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
Let go of me!

206
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
You'd better be ashamed.

207
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,940
You'll be bitten by a rabbit.

208
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,940
Why did I suddenly become so bold these days?

209
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,940
I didn't expect this bastard to be alive.

210
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,940
He even became the second lady of the General's Mansion.

211
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,940
In order not to let the old master doubt,

212
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
I found a baby corpse to read.

213
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
If this matter is brought up,

214
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
I'm afraid it won't end well.

215
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
Madam, don't worry.

216
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
A little girl is a liar.

217
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
What big trouble can she make?

218
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
We can use any means

219
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,940
to make her die without a place to bury.

220
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,940
It's better to be careful.

221
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,940
There is an emperor supporting Li Zhen.

222
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
Ange is very obsessed with that girl.

223
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
What if someone finds out and makes her passive?

224
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,940
It's better to find a place where there is no one

225
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
to hide.

226
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Madam,

227
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
the letter for Young Master

228
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
seems to be sent by the General's Mansion.

229
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
What a bad fox!

230
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,940
How dare she meet Ange in private?

231
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
She...

232
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,940
She is deliberately trying to make trouble.

233
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,940
Madam, calm down.

234
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
The opportunity is coming.

235
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
How about this?

236
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,940
Mingyue, have you sent the letter I asked you to send?

237
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Yes.

238
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,940
Miss, what kind of medicine do you sell in your throat?

239
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Why do you...

240
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
It's none of your business here.

241
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,940
You can go.

242
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
Who are you?

243
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,940
Chinese TV Series Exclusive YouTube

244
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
If there is no love

245
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Stare at my heart

246
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Looking back is the first person I missed

247
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,940
Pity, the stars are like dreams

248
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Unbearable

249
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,940
Forget all the past, the cruel years

250
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Forget all the past, the cruel years

251
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,940
Life is like a lifetime

252
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,940
If there is a heart with you, I will take it

253
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,940
With you, the heart will keep one promise

254
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,940
How many points

255
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,940
If there is a heart with you, I will take it

256
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,940
With you, the heart will keep one promise

257
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,940
How many points

258
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,940
Thanks for watching!
