1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This...

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The seal of the Tibetan Sect was left by my father, Lin Siqian.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The seal of the Tibetan Sect is complete.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The old general has been telling you for thousands of years.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Behind it, there are people of great power.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You must wait until the general has enough power

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
before he can give it to you.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Zhen'er,

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll wash the people of Li's family.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You'll be in charge of the people of Guangyou Sect.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Otherwise, I'll die in the dark.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Father,

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I won't let you down.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
General,

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the second lady is here.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You all leave first.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I've already withdrawn the seal of the Tibetan Sect.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't let anyone come in and disturb us.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A'chu,

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
this...

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Brother,

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I want to take my aunt and third sister

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to leave the General's Mansion.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please, brother.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You don't have to do this.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Get up and talk.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you don't agree,

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll kneel down and not get up.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Didn't you say

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you were a member of the Lin's family?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why did you suddenly leave?

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A'chu thought about it.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think what brother said makes sense.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've been in danger for years.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I want to go to the Mansion of the Prime Minister again.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not easy.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My mother and my sister have always been my eyes.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Instead of staying in this mansion and being in a hurry,

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'd rather leave.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My father is deeply in blood.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Once the thing I want to do is out of the skin,

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
it is the sin of the imperial family.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have to let him leave

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
is the best choice.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Brother,

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
please help A'chu.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Please.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Brother.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It turns out

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that's what they're like.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Brother and sister are a big thing.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Once exposed,

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the mansion will be in chaos.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If brother is in a state of mind,

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will be the one to suffer.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Brother.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Brother.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Brother.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Brother.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
After dawn,

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will take you and third sister

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
to the house for a while.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then I'll send someone to pick you up

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and send you away.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Thank you, brother.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You and I don't have to say those two words.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In this world,

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I hope you are better than anyone else.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's getting late.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll go to bed early.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I want to chase after a beautiful world.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I want to run to the edge of the sea

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to save this village.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What did sister mean just now?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She wants to take aunt and me

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
away from the mansion.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Qianqian, are you asleep?

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You and I don't have to say those two words.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
In this world,

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I hope you are better than anyone else.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Brother, you're awake.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I made some cakes.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you like them?

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're so considerate.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm glad you like them.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Chu.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Take care of yourself.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't worry.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I will.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll never see you again

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
after we parted.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Brother.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Come in.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Brother, mother is here.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mother.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Mother, why are you here?

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I heard that aunt is sick in the village.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I sent someone to pick her up at night.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You two go and visit aunt.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank you, mother.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mother, how did you know

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that you two were in the camp?

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Didn't you send someone to tell mother?

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Look at your memory.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, there are a lot of things in the camp.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can go ahead.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll take them back.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Go and check

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
who reported the letter to the general in the camp.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Go.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Madam.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Madam.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Madam.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Madam.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I won't bother you.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If you need anything,

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
just tell me.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you, madam.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Madam.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let me see you.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You little bitch.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
How dare you take away my brother's life.

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I must find a way to get rid of this trouble.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's good.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Find a matchmaker

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
to represent the Li family to the Lin family.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Ask the madam to marry the girl.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Make the marriage of my brother soon.

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You are thoughtful.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Madam suffered in the camp.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She is ill.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
She might get sick if she cries.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why are you looking at me like this?

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Good girl.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I heard that the young master of the Shi family has fallen in love with you.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's the gossip of the servants.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't believe it.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's good that the young master of the Fu family has fallen in love with you.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's good.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can live a comfortable life in the future.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you have more dowry,

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you can split the money to open a family.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You mention my marriage.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Just for this?

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Second sister.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I didn't mean that.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm tired.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm going back.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Second sister.

156
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Send this to the general's mansion.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This money is yours.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you doing now?

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What else do you want to do?

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
A'chu.

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is not a tradition between me and my mother.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I have found out that it was the illness of a woman who was sick in the camp.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Someone used money to call her.

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Who?

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The fireman said that this person had not appeared yet.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So his identity is not good.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
A'chu.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I will never lie to you.

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You believe me?

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Believe you?

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I just believe you too much.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I thought brother had a little true love for A'chu.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Now it seems not good.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Be careful.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You are the one.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I will never lie to you.

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You believe me?

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Believe you?

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Believe you?

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Believe you?

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Believe you?

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Believe you?

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Believe you?

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Believe you?

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Believe you?

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Believe you?

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Believe you?

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Believe you?

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Believe you?

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If there is no love

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I will be sad

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Looking back, I have missed the first person

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But the eyes are full of dreams

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Suddenly, they are all the same

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Forgetting all the troubles

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The years are cruel

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I hope I can be with you forever

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And turn around and run to the next life

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
If I have the heart to stay with you

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I will keep this promise with you

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
How many points

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If I have the heart to stay with you

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I will keep this promise with you

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How many points

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Thank you for watching!
