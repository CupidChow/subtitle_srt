00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuan

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your Highness, aren't you curious

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
what I've found in Jiangling?

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuan

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was just a misunderstanding.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I was too hasty.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
General, don't mind it.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're welcome, Your Highness.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll take my leave then.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Take care, General.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuan

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Your Highness,

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
why are you being threatened by him?

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Li Zhen has the evidence

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to prove my weakness.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I haven't done my job yet.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't risk it.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why did you have to alert the enemy?

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Isn't it a way to stop them?

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,720
This is called the

22
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,000
Mountaineering.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you want to deal with a suspicious person like Ji Qingyun,

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
you have to take the wrong path.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He'll think that we've caught him.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We can't act rashly.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're smart, General.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I admire you.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
By the way,

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Miss Li just sent a message

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
asking you to go home.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Miss, have you really thought it through?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you have to do this?

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Since this child can't be kept,

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
let the one who deserves to die

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
be buried with him.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mother,

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
why are you here?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What are you doing?

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't hurt my child.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Even if you die today,

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
this child can't be kept.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't want to.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This can't be kept.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have to take the medicine.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Stop.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mother,

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
what does this mean?

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Brother,

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
save me.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Save our child.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Child?

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
A'chu,

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
what did you say?

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There's a child in your belly?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It hurts.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It hurts.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It hurts.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It hurts.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It hurts.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It hurts.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It hurts.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
My child.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Brother can't be kept.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Zhenge,

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
don't blame me.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Mother did it for your own good.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This child can't be kept.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why can't it be kept?

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If the child is born,

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
how will the people outside see you?

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you want your future?

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Future?

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In your eyes,

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
there is only my future,

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the future of the General's Mansion.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You know clearly

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that A'chu is not a brother.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You have two children.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why can't this child be kept?

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't believe me.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You want to kill him.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But you never thought about

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the child in his belly.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's also my blood.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Blood is in the bones.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This child is a scourge.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He is the shame of the General's Mansion.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
As long as I have one breath,

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can't tolerate him.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This woman went back to rest.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Without my permission,

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
you can't go out.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What are you doing?

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm your wife.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let me go.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
As long as this evil servant

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
is dragged out,

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
he will be beaten by twenty gangs

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and driven out of the General's Mansion.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Master,

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Master, please spare me.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Master,

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't dare to do it anymore.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A'chu,

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A'chu,

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A'chu,

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mingyue.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Go and find a doctor.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hurry up.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A'chu,

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A'chu,

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A'chu,

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
wake up.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let me go.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How dare you!

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me go.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will punish you.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm the Mistress of the General's Mansion.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why do you treat me like this?

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Help me.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Help.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Zheng'er won't treat me like that.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I gave birth to him.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He is his biological mother.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I see him as my pride.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Zheng'er,

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I knew it.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You must be reluctant to be my mother.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You came to let me out, right?

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's all because of Li Chuchu.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm going to kill him.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm going to kill him.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Mother,

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You still don't know your fault.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What did you say?

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You raised A'chu as the leader of Yangzhou.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You let him be humiliated,

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
humiliated and even want to kill him.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm afraid of him.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Not to mention,

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you killed Zhang Yining.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Shut up.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Everything I did

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
was for you,

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
for the general and for us.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What did I do wrong?

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't make excuses.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Everything you did

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
was for your own honor and dignity.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you did it for me,

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
you wouldn't do it again and again.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This kind of thing is against the law.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll send someone to the ministry of the imperial court to make a false temple.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
In the future,

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you are not allowed to interfere in

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
all the affairs of the general's mansion.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
A'chu.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you satisfied today?

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What do you mean?

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You've been planning for a long time.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You asked me to come back.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You asked me to come back

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to show me

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the night when my mother forced you.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't understand

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
what you are talking about.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you really want this child,

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
why didn't you tell me earlier?

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why did you choose to kill your mother today?

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
A'chu.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You are really cruel.

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
For revenge,

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you even want your own child.

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This child

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
shouldn't be punished.

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So you just have to kill her.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You shouldn't be punished.

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So you've been lying to me all the time.

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Do you really love me?

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Even if just a little.

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Only if

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't live in this family.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I beg you, A'chu.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't believe me.

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So,

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the truth

208
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
is always about yourself.

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No matter what happens,

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you have to take care of your own body.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is just a small room.

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Crying like this,

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
you will be in trouble for the rest of your life.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I've decided

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
to leave this child

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
so that my brother and I

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
can't go back to Kunqu.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But after you want to,

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I can't help you.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm ready to run to the next life.

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you have the heart to fight with me,

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
your fate will be in your hands.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Only if

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I can't live in this family.

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I beg you, A'chu.

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No heart.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
A'chu,

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I will be with you

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
in this life.

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I will be with you.

237
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The stars in the sky are like dreams.

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No one is with me.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Forget all the troubles.

240
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The years are cruel.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You've been well these days.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What happened?

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I heard that you were sick.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I've been sick for only a few days.

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're his mother.

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't dare to be careless.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I've been told to report to you in the camp.

248
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Since my mother is sick,

249
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I should take care of my daughter.

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're so strong.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You don't look sick.

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I should have killed you.

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I should have killed you.

255
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're so stubborn.

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:41,680
Yangzhou's

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You bitch.

258
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is for my mother.

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This is for myself.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You've done so much.

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But you never regretted your decision.

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You can't get rid of these sins.

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You'll wait for the next 18th floor.

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yangzhou's

265
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yangzhou's

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yangzhou's

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yangzhou's

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yangzhou's

269
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yangzhou's

270
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yangzhou's

271
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yangzhou's

272
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yangzhou's
