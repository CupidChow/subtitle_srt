The Long Ballad

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 17

3
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yu Niang, you hit me!

4
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You are really going to kill your second sister!

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's my second sister and your big brother!

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not talking nonsense!

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You still say that!

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You hit me! You hit me to death!

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You came to me

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
because you think your second sister is more important than me.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But why do all of you like Li Chu Ci?

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then what am I?

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, no, no, no.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't want to see you!

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sister.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sister.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sister.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Sister.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
From now on,

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you only have one daughter.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Choose her or choose me.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Make a decision as soon as possible.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sister.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Sister.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What happened?

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Long Ballad

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hong Ling, take Chu away first.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll handle this.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
General, you go first. I'll wait.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is the military order.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can't disobey.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Brother Bu, if you want to go, we'll go together.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you want to die, we'll die together.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't be afraid.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I won't let anything happen to you.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Stop talking nonsense!

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No one can leave today!

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Get out!

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Go!

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Brother.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Brother.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Brother.

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Kill them!

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Brother!

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Kill them!

46
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Brother.

47
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Brother.

48
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you okay?

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Chu, don't be afraid.

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Brother.

51
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Brother.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Brother is alive.

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Your Highness.

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Li Zhen's sister was seriously injured and was not sent.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But I think it's too dangerous.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This Lin Ansheng.

57
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why didn't he say that Li Chuchu also dared to come?

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Forget it.

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was just trying to get a position.

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I need a role to play as a partner.

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I've checked.

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Li Zhen never participates in the war on the surface.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He actually had a deep relationship with the Crown Prince.

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If he finds out that the Crown Prince died for his own purpose,

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the consequences will be unimaginable.

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Although Li Zhen is a talent,

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
it's a pity that he's an old man who doesn't know the truth.

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
In order to avoid a long night,

69
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I had to take the initiative.

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Doctor, how is he?

71
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This young man is seriously injured and has lost too much blood.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Fortunately, he is strong.

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If he can recover from the injury tonight,

74
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
he should be fine.

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you, Doctor.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Achi, hurry up.

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Achi, hurry up.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hurry up.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hurry up.

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It turns out that he has been helping me to kill him more than his own life.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Achi.

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Achi.

83
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Achi.

84
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Achi.

85
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Achi.

86
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Achi.

87
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Achi.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Achi.

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If we're not brothers,

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
how good would that be?

91
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Brother,

92
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
don't leave Su'an.

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't leave me.

94
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't leave me.

95
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Brother,

96
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
what are you going to do?

97
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
A'chu,

98
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I know you're going to save me.

99
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You pack up slowly.

100
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll go get something to eat.

101
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Who is the mastermind behind this?

102
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Who is so bold to kill his neighbor?

103
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If I'm not wrong,

104
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
it's not the Third Prince.

105
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The Third Prince?

106
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
A'chu,

107
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I've been suspecting that

108
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
the Third Prince was the one who killed Father.

109
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I came to Jiangling to find evidence

110
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and expose his real identity.

111
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Now,

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the enemy is in the dark.

113
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm afraid that he's not going to be able to escape.

114
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Now,

115
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
the enemy is in the dark.

116
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You must be careful.

117
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You'd better not get in touch with him again.

118
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay, I understand.

119
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The people in front are so hungry.

120
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What are they doing?

121
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
They're probably celebrating the Flower God Festival.

122
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Rumor has it that the lovers who get the flower god blessing

123
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
can have a heart of gold.

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The time has come.

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're so impulsive.

126
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sure you're here to pray for the flower god blessing.

127
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Niu, we are...

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's right.

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We're the newlyweds from the outside.

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'd like to ask you a question.

131
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you know each other?

132
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Come on.

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Come on.

134
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Please.

135
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What do you want?

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Please.

137
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Madam.

138
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What do you think?

139
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've checked the city.

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,640
Master went to Jiangling this time

141
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,840
for official business.

142
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,560
But he didn't say when he would come back.

143
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,080
It's really not a personal escape?

144
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,760
Madam, don't worry too much.

145
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,520
Master has always been well-mannered.

146
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,720
He will never come back.

147
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,080
But when it comes to Li Chu Chu,

148
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,320
he's like crazy.

149
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,480
He doesn't care.

150
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,280
Chu,

151
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,560
why did you lie in the daytime?

152
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
We are not a couple.

153
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
We are not a couple.

154
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
How do you know we are not a couple?

155
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Do you know

156
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
we are not a couple?

157
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Chu,

158
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
what did you say?

159
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Chu Chu Chu,

160
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Chu Chu Chu,

161
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Chu Chu Chu,

162
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Chu Chu Chu,

163
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Chu Chu Chu,

164
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Chu Chu Chu,

165
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Chu Chu Chu,

166
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Chu Chu Chu,

167
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Chu Chu Chu,

168
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560

169
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560

170
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Chu Chu Chu,

172
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,560
Chu Chu Chu,

173
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
