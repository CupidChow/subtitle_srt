1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 14

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The time has come.

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The bride and groom will bow.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
One bow.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Two bows.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Three bows.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Three bows.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
General.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The shoes I just received.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Go back.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You want me to marry a dead person?

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hurry up.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The bride and groom are waiting for you to get married.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Maybe,

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
you two can catch the last boat of Wangchuan Bridge tonight.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Besides,

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
it's nothing.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
As long as the bride and groom are given enough,

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
how many people want to send their daughter here?

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't want to.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will not marry.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to the government to sue you.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What are you waiting for?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hurry up and catch her.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Beat her to death.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Beat her.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hurry up.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Young Master.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What are you laughing at?

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm laughing at you, silly.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Think about it.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are so beautiful.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You talk so much.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You sold me to a dead person.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You'd better sell me to a living person.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are really beautiful.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If I sell you to the one who is a good-looking,

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Marquis Changping,

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I will have a lot of money in the rest of my life.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You...

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You...

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hurry up.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's on fire.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's on fire.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hurry up.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Miss Chuchu, are you okay?

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can't go back to Li's Mansion.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I can't go back to Li's Mansion.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Brother.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Brother, where are you?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Miss Chuchu,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
you should go with the guest.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Help.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Miss Chuchu.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Come.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Miss Chuchu, you are awake.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You said you wouldn't go back to Li's Mansion when you were in a coma.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I had no choice.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I had to take you to the inn.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I saved you once again.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know how to repay you.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You and I don't talk about this.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Miss Chuchu,

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
can you tell me what happened?

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Maybe Lian Sheng is the one who can help me get out of the bitter sea.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Lin Xiao,

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you brought your sister to the inn at midnight.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What do you want to do alone?

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Brother, you misunderstood.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's Lin Xiao who saved me.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Chu, come with me.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
General Li.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What did you do

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to make Miss Chuchu walk around in the middle of the night?

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is a private matter of the General's Mansion.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You are not an outsider.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Who said I was an outsider?

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have a relationship with Miss Chuchu.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I will propose to her in a few days.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Marry her.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Brother is the father.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Without my brother's permission,

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
this marriage can't be done.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why do you object so?

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
In terms of family and character,

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I am the number one and number two in Anping.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Lin Xiao, you don't have to say much.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I have made up my mind.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Please return it.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Miss Chuchu, don't worry.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will never give up.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Brother, didn't you go out?

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why are you here?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Zimeng,

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
do you think I disturbed you and Lin Xiao?

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You shouldn't have come.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You really shouldn't have come.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Zhu, don't be too naive.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The State Mansion is not yet Lin Ansheng's master.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's not easy for you to be the wife of the Crown Prince.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Where is the wound?

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Where is the wound?

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Master, the lady sent me to see you two go back.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mother, what time is it?

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why are you still praying?

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't worry.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Next time, I will make sure that he can't escape.

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who are you going to make sure that he can't escape?

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You are here to ask for forgiveness.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Brother,

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
we also want to find a good family for the second sister.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If anything goes wrong,

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
it's also her fault.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You!

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You actually hit me for Li Chuchu.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You don't know how to repent.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
From today on,

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
give me a month to go to the House of Rebellion.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Brother Zhen,

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the second girl is just your sister.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You seem to care about her too much.

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The Qi Lin Army is back.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Do you know how many imperial censors will report to me

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and impeach me to leave the country

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
if I tell you that the second sister is out?

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You!

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Forget it.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I will not interfere in the second girl's marriage anymore.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I hope you can do what you said.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't let the child down again.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Brother Zhen is really crazy.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you want to escape,

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
your family may not be the only choice.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A Chu.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why is my brother here?

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What is this?

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The most reddish rouge.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A Chu,

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
in a few days,

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
it will be your lucky day.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Do you have any birthday gift you want?

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I want the most reddish rouge.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I heard it's hard to get.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Brother Zhen, bad news.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Your father is in trouble.

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The dead things are too precious.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I started to take it back.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Tong Qi,

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A Chu doesn't like the pearl anymore.

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There is a glimmer of light.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The master is back.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You should look for the master carefully.

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't make any trouble

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to the general's mansion.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Who is there?

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm here.

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm here.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm here.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm here.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm here.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm here.

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm here.

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm here.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm here.

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm here.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm here.

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm here.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm here.

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm here.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm here.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm here.

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm here.

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm here.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm here.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm here.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm here.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm here.

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm here.

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm here.

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm here.

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm here.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm here.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm here.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm here.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm here.

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
