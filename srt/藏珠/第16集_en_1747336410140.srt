The Long Ballad

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What a cunning woman!

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
She promised me a marriage.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What does she want?

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Mother, say something.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Do you want them to keep making trouble here?

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's okay if you agree to it first.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let bygones be bygones.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Since the marriage is real,

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the Mansion of Duke will accept the marriage.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's all leave.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Chu Chu and Young Lord are deeply in love.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Since the marriage is fixed,

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
we should get married soon.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Ten days later,

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it will be a rare day.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Di Chuchu,

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
don't be too hasty.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You'll be late.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mother,

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I beg you to allow me to marry her.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As you wish.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We'll get married in ten days.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Young Lord,

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can finally marry you.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I hope you won't blame me for what I did.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Chu Chu,

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm the one who's incompetent.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm the one who's incompetent.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not to blame.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then,

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll go.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
How dare you!

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Li Chu Chu,

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you dare to bully me!

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can't marry Anger.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to be punished by God.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't worry, Madam.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's not a big deal

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to get married.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Even if it's done,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
it's not up to us

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to decide whether we can get married.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When the time comes,

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
the Duke of the State will come.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The Madam will be confused.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We'll find a way to get rid of her.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What do you mean?

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If I have to risk my life to enter the Duke's Mansion,

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have to bear the consequences.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Chu Chu wants to marry Lin Ansheng.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sir!

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There's a movement in the Third Prince's Mansion.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They're going to meet at the Fengyuan Villa.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll go with you.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Brother,

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Chu's plan is about to succeed.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Madam.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's the matter?

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you really going to marry that Duke of the State?

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I've made up my mind.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But you're brothers.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You'll be punished by God.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Madam, the Duke is not in the mansion yet.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you go on like this,

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
as long as...

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't worry, Madam.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have my own plans.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
All right.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I'm afraid

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Madam won't agree to this.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're wrong.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm afraid

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
she can't wait.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If Chu Chu wants to marry,

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
let her go.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't let anyone stop you.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This disaster will be over sooner or later.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
As long as it can be cut off from the whole,

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
let her go

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
as she wishes.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, Madam.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Brother,

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
aren't you going to stay in Jiangling for a while?

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why didn't you tell me

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
when you married me?

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
According to the rules,

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I should be taught by you.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You should go.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Chu Chu,

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you still have time to repent.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Brother, you're worrying too much.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now that I've decided,

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't let this go.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What if...

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There's no if.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I've been planning for so long.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's impossible.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I will never allow her to make a mistake.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Have you ever thought that

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I want you back

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
instead of letting you send yourself out?

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Brother,

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
it's not the time to talk about this.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Brother, don't worry.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know what I'm doing.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Go.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Brother.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Brother.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Brother.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Brother.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Brother.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Brother.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When this is over,

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I will make it up to you.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay?

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The first bow to Heaven and Earth.

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The second bow to the high hall.

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
My poor sister.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're so miserable.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're so far away.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
My poor sister.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Who are you?

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How dare you cause trouble

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
at the wedding of Duke of the State?

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
My sister is the wife of Duke of the State.

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She's married to a good man.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Duke of the State's people are dying.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I came today

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to seek justice for her.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Guards.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Guards.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Take him out.

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Wait.

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
My lady.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Today is the wedding day of my sister and Duke of the State.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I should be there.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But as General Qilin,

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I should let the people know that

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I have to send you off.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Bring him in.

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Guards.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
My sister's tomb is here.

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
General, you can open the tea party.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The truth will be revealed.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Today is the wedding day of my daughter.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
How can you make such a fuss?

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Although General Li is guarding the Anping County,

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,960
the death of the

156
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,000
death is not within your range.

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You are so different.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You are not for other purposes.

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I am the one who is responsible

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
for the injustice in the people.

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
My lady.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The people's lives are more important than the sky.

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This old man said it was an injustice.

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think it's better to investigate it

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
in case it ruins the reputation of Duke of the State.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Zhao Jingshe, don't listen to this scoundrel.

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He is here to cause trouble.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What are you waiting for?

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Get him out of here.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Old man, you have to think it over.

171
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you can't find anything in the opening ceremony,

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
you are going to break into Duke of the State's tomb

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and learn a new lesson.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I am sorry.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I am willing to take the blame.

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Enough.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You are so arrogant.

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You have already made a plan

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
to make Duke of the State's tomb look ugly.

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
My lady.

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Today, the public is watching.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If this news is spread,

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
the emperor will blame us.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I am afraid Duke of the State's tomb is difficult to save.

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then we have to wait for the imperial edict.

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I am sorry.

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Since we are not guilty,

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it's okay to open the door.

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Open the door.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Before the emperor dies,

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
he will put this ring in his belly.

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He must be trying to accuse the murderer.

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's okay.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We have a ledger in Duke's tomb.

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We can find out

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
who is the murderer at any time.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I am sorry.

198
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I am sorry.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I am sorry.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I am sorry.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This ring

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
is given to me by my wife.

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Mother Qi.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's all my fault.

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I hate Qian Zhu Mu for suppressing my wife.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's why I gave her a beating.

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I didn't expect

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you would be so angry

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
for such a big crime.

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I am sorry.

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You are not a young girl.

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Good.

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You are a man of your word.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You are a woman of your word.

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let her go.

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No.

217
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Mother Qi.

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Mother Qi.

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You are so bad.

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You found the murderer.

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Let her go.

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let her go.

223
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Mother Qi, you are guilty.

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But she is still a senior in Duke's family.

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If we don't find out the truth,

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I am afraid we will be caught.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I am a good person.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I am not afraid of being caught.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I am not afraid of being caught.

230
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You are not afraid of being caught

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
or guilty.

232
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You dare not to admit it.

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What do you mean?

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You are saying that my mother is the murderer, right?

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Duke.

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
My brother is also afraid of

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,300
Chu's

238
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
and Qin's.

239
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Although the wife is innocent,

240
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
he is not afraid of her.

241
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
What is this?

242
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I am sorry.

243
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I am sorry.

244
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I am sorry.

245
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I am sorry.

246
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I am sorry.

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I am sorry.

248
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I am sorry.

249
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I am sorry.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I am sorry.

251
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I am sorry.

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I am sorry.

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I am sorry.

254
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I am sorry.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I am sorry.

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I am sorry.

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I am sorry.

258
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I am sorry.

259
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I am sorry.

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I am sorry.

261
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I am sorry.

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I am sorry.

263
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I am sorry.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I am sorry.

265
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I am sorry.

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I am sorry.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I am sorry.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I am sorry.

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I am sorry.

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I am sorry.

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I am sorry.

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I am sorry.

273
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I am sorry.

274
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I am sorry.
