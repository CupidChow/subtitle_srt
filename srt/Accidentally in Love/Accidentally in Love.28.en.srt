A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:58,605
EPISODE 28

3
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:02,365
Sir.

4
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:04,085
Mrs. Lan is not feeling well.

5
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,445
Why don't I take you home first?

6
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,125
We'll take care of Xinya.

7
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:09,245
You must look after Xinya.

8
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:10,805
Don't worry.

9
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:12,565
Gu Nanxi.

10
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,085
I'll leave it to you.

11
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:15,805
Let's go.

12
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:22,165
Xinya.

13
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,725
Lanting.

14
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:27,805
Knife.

15
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:29,645
Do you have a knife? Do you?

16
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:32,925
Didn't you say that if I hurt myself,

17
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,725
I could keep Feng by my side?

18
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,005
I'm going to hurt myself.

19
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:39,365
-Xinya.
-I'll do whatever it takes.

20
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,365
Situ Feng is not going to come back.

21
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:44,165
Give me the knife. I beg you.

22
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:45,645
Let me keep him by my side.

23
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,365
Hua Munian, do you have a knife?

24
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,325
-Give me the sleeping pills.
-Xinya, knock it off.

25
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,285
Lanting.

26
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,885
Please help me.

27
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:02,685
-I beg you. Please help me.
-There's nothing you can do.

28
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,565
Even if you hit your head on the wall,

29
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:07,565
-Situ Feng wouldn't care.
-I beg you. Please help me.

30
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:08,845
Gu Nanxi.

31
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,765
Can you drag this crazy woman,
Yang Lanting, out?

32
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:13,005
Did you call me a crazy woman?

33
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,645
Did you not hear what I said?

34
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:17,365
Look.

35
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,165
You're a selfish, despicable
and reckless, crazy woman.

36
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:22,845
You don't understand anything.

37
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:24,565
I was only helping Xinya--

38
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:25,605
Helping Xinya?

39
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,885
Look at her right now.

40
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:29,805
Look at what you've done to her.

41
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:31,045
You weren't helping her.

42
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,605
This was Chen Qingqing's fault.

43
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:35,445
This has nothing to do with Chen Qingqing.

44
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,245
You're the one who should be responsible.

45
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:40,845
If you didn't plot any of those things,
Xinya wouldn't have become this way.

46
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:43,165
Her parents wouldn't have
to worry about her every day.

47
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:45,645
Situ Feng and Qingqing
wouldn't have had to endure that.

48
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,885
Today's farce wouldn't have happened.

49
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,405
All right. Stop fighting.

50
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:51,765
Let Xinya calm down first.

51
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:54,845
Lanting, come outside with me.

52
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,165
Feng.

53
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,045
Lanting.

54
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,525
Weren't you going too far this time?

55
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:13,125
You have to fight for what you truly want.

56
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:16,204
But that doesn’t mean
that you can put a person's life at risk.

57
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:18,845
You knew that Situ Feng
didn't like Lan Xinya.

58
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,245
How could you help her?

59
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:23,805
Gu Nanxi.

60
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:26,165
I'm very disappointed in all of you.

61
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:33,045
Lanting has left.

62
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:35,845
Nobody else will help me.

63
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:43,605
Xinya, if you want,

64
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,045
I can help you.

65
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:50,525
You?

66
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:54,205
Xinya.

67
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,645
From now on,
you have to let go of your past

68
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,525
and start a new life.

69
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:03,965
A new life?

70
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:08,045
You can't stop thinking
about Situ Feng right now.

71
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,205
But I'm telling you.

72
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,445
In a few days,

73
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:16,525
a few months or a few years,
you won't think about him anymore.

74
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:21,325
You will meet a better man.

75
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:25,125
Don't cry for a man who doesn't love you.

76
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,805
Without Feng,

77
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,245
what else can I do?

78
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:34,525
You'll definitely meet a man

79
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:36,805
who's better and more talented
than Situ Feng.

80
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:41,405
He will at least be ten times
or 100 times better than him.

81
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,645
Don't hurt yourself
for a man who doesn't love you.

82
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:50,485
It won't be easy to find such a man.

83
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:53,725
Besides,

84
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,285
I'm not worthy of love.

85
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:58,485
You are.

86
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:05,645
Do you want to bet?

87
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:08,165
You'll definitely find that man.

88
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:09,965
And...

89
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:11,845
I...

90
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,405
We can look for him together.

91
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,885
-Hurry, let's go.
-Let's go.

92
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:36,205
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

93
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,285
Where are we going?

94
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,565
To the airport.

95
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,845
I'm afraid that Lan Xinya
will create more drama.

96
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:42,685
I'm going to hide you at my house.

97
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:45,645
Qingqing, I'm sorry.

98
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:47,445
I don't think I can go with you.

99
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:48,965
-What?
-What?

100
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:52,845
What do you mean?

101
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:55,285
Are you going to leave me behind again?

102
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,605
-Seriously?
-Seriously?

103
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:00,445
Qingqing.

104
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:02,525
You're silly.

105
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:04,645
I didn't bring my ID.

106
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:05,885
I can't get on the plane.

107
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:08,885
That's right.

108
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:09,805
Qingqing.

109
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,085
I've promised you.

110
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,965
I will never let you go.

111
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:14,965
That's great.

112
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:25,685
So...

113
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,005
Where should we go now?

114
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:30,965
Nowhere.

115
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:35,365
Sometimes, when I run out of inspiration,

116
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:39,765
I will hop on a bus
and just wander aimlessly.

117
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:44,165
The view outside the window
will brighten up my mood.

118
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,805
Then, inspiration will come to me.

119
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,205
What are you doing?

120
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,125
I'm writing down what you said.

121
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:57,525
I'm making an illustration book

122
00:07:57,605 --> 00:08:00,325
of Situ Feng's best quotes

123
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:02,125
to give back to my fans.

124
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,165
It's time for me to collect materials.

125
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:06,005
You're putting pressure on me.

126
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,845
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

127
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:11,405
You have the right to remain silent.

128
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:13,205
Anything you say can and will become

129
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,085
Hebiancao's source materials.

130
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,845
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

131
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,885
Shaofang, hurry up and ask Hebiancao
if she could get me a VIP ticket.

132
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:14,885
Hey!

133
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:18,685
Let's make Hebiancao's boyfriend
a resident singer at my place.

134
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,565
He'll sing every song that we request.

135
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:22,125
Hold on.

136
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:23,885
Calm down.

137
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:27,205
Have we all just become lovesick?

138
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,165
His Highness has a girlfriend.

139
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:34,925
I think that it's wise of him
to date someone like Hebiancao.

140
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:37,325
That's right. His Highness
has found the right girlfriend.

141
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:38,805
He has good taste in women.

142
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:39,925
I think that Hebiancao

143
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:42,485
will take His Highness's career
to the next level.

144
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:48,285
It's an honor to worship a star
with all of you.

145
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,445
Cheers to our bond.

146
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:51,765
-Cheers to our bond.
-Cheers to our bond.

147
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,605
Lin Yiyang.

148
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,485
Thank you for treating me to a movie.

149
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:56,445
Don't worry about it.

150
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:02,805
Fangfang.

151
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:04,645
I...

152
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:06,085
What is it?

153
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:08,725
It's nothing.

154
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:15,525
The movie was nice.

155
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:17,845
Did you like the female lead?

156
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:21,565
Yes, I liked her.

157
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,685
She's pretty. Why wouldn't I like her?

158
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:27,845
They went through so much in the movie.

159
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:29,605
They could finally be together.

160
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:30,685
What a nice ending.

161
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,285
Hey.

162
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,165
I didn't see anything.

163
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,765
You're a pervert.

164
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,805
Hey, I didn't see anything.

165
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,125
I didn't see anything.

166
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,565
I'm going back to the dorm.

167
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:22,005
So...

168
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,365
Are you going
to the library again tomorrow?

169
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:31,405
I really didn't see anything.

170
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,045
Stop talking about it.

171
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:50,845
Guys.

172
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,925
Are you both waiting
for the other person to talk first?

173
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:57,565
Are you trying to burn my tongue?

174
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,325
My little master, Situ Feng
and Madam Chen Qingqing.

175
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:05,125
Can you give me a heads-up
before you cause trouble next time?

176
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:06,805
The press was looking for me.

177
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:09,445
Do you know how much money I spent
to settle this matter?

178
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:11,685
By the way, Daniel.

179
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,285
You've maxed out all these cards.

180
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:16,805
Is there another way to pay?

181
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:17,925
They're all maxed out?

182
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,925
That's right. It's better to pay in cash.

183
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,085
I've got an idea.

184
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:23,885
I've borrowed 150,000 yuan from 9Fbank.

185
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:25,525
Withdraw the money.

186
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,685
Okay.

187
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:34,445
Well...

188
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:36,765
I'm sorry, Daniel.

189
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,965
We'll give you a heads-up next time.

190
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:40,365
There's no next time.

191
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,925
Luckily, the fans reacted positively
to the news of you two dating.

192
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,885
It seems like if you find
the right person to date,

193
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,685
the fans won't overreact.

194
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,925
Let me think of a way
to settle this matter.

195
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,405
By the way, Situ Feng,
have you checked the chart lately?

196
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,685
Your album has remained
among the top five.

197
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:03,005
The agency thinks very highly
of you and trusts you.

198
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:04,925
Talented boy, keep up the good work.

199
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:07,485
But...

200
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:08,685
Daniel.

201
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:11,205
-Yes?
-The things between Qingqing and I

202
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:14,365
may not be so simple.

203
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,405
We've caused

204
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:20,005
a small problem.

205
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:22,565
Stop. Let me take a sip of water
before you tell me.

206
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:26,685
Do you remember Qingchen?

207
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:28,405
Yes, I do.

208
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:36,925
Chen Qingqing? Qingchen?

209
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,005
Is she Qingchen?

210
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,525
It's you.

211
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,085
You're also Hebiancao.

212
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,805
You're quite an actress.

213
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:47,405
Do you want to join showbiz
and help grow the film industry?

214
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,605
I didn't have a choice.

215
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,845
Daniel, would it be a problem

216
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:55,165
if my fans found out

217
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:56,525
that Chen Qingqing is Qingchen?

218
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:58,565
But I shouldn't keep this from them.

219
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,805
I'll draft a news release regarding this.

220
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:03,005
And make the public
accept the fact step by step.

221
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:06,805
Can you stop giving me
a challenging problem each day?

222
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,285
I swear.

223
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,445
This is the last problem.

224
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:21,845
Hey!

225
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:25,005
Isn't this Zhang Fangfang?

226
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:28,685
I heard that you're dating Lin Yiyang.

227
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:31,645
Where is he?

228
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:32,965
Are you waiting for him?

229
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,885
He will be here soon.
Is there anything you need from him?

230
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:37,725
Nothing special.

231
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:40,965
But Zhang Fangfang,
if I remember correctly,

232
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,965
you came to our school
on scholarship, didn't you?

233
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:46,805
But you're hanging out with Lin Yiyang.

234
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,725
He's a bad influence.

235
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,325
I'm afraid

236
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,405
that you might end up getting
kicked out of school.

237
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:56,165
Xinyan, what are you talking about?

238
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:58,525
That will never happen to Fangfang.

239
00:14:58,765 --> 00:14:59,805
And think about it.

240
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,645
If she becomes Lin Yiyang's girlfriend,

241
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:06,005
she will be able to live a wealthy life.

242
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,205
She won't have to go to school.

243
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:12,525
However, Lin Yiyang
is just dating you for fun.

244
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:14,005
I...

245
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:18,725
Let's go, Fangfang.

246
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:25,085
Lin Yiyang,
you haven't apologized to me yet.

247
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:27,885
I'm sorry, Hong Xiaoman.

248
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:29,205
Let me apologize to you for him.

249
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:31,845
Why are you apologizing for him?

250
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:34,205
Do you really think
that you're somebody to him?

251
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,245
I...

252
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,765
Of course she has the right
to apologize for me.

253
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,205
But you don't have the right
to accept her apology.

254
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:45,405
I heard what you said just now.

255
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:47,165
But you were wrong about something.

256
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:50,005
If Fangfang doesn't deserve
to attend this college,

257
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:53,045
I'm sure that the two of you
would get expelled sooner than her.

258
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,765
How dare you bully us?

259
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,885
Aren't you afraid
of getting kicked out of college?

260
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:58,965
Did anyone see you getting bullied by me?

261
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:01,925
But something came to my mind

262
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:03,565
after seeing you two.

263
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,965
I have a very special hobby lately.

264
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:07,205
Isn't that right, Fangfang?

265
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:09,685
Yes.

266
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:11,965
Lately,

267
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,285
I like to raise scorpions.

268
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,165
A scorpion loves to sting a girl's lips.

269
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:21,205
If you don't leave Fangfang alone,

270
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,005
I promise

271
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,405
to give scorpions to you as a gift.

272
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:28,045
Xiaoman, let's go.

273
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:35,765
Let's go, Fangfang.

274
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:46,725
Fangfang.

275
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,885
Do you want to be the person

276
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:52,765
who gets to decide things
for me in the future?

277
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,885
What do you mean?

278
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:57,765
Why are you so dumb?

279
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:00,045
Be my girlfriend.

280
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:15,964
I made a lot of mistakes in the past.

281
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:23,405
But I really want to be
a part of your world.

282
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,204
I will try to become the person

283
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,685
that you expect me to be.

284
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,005
So...

285
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:33,925
will you be my girlfriend?

286
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:01,285
Sir, is there anything you need?

287
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:05,085
You.

288
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,445
Release Chen Qingqing's information

289
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,525
to the paparazzi.

290
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:13,485
Sir, but shouldn't we give
Mr. Chen a heads-up?

291
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,365
Don't worry about that old man.

292
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:19,005
Just listen to me.

293
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:20,285
Yes, sir.

294
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,565
Every girl tries to dress up,
but you dress down instead.

295
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:50,325
I don't know what to say to you.

296
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:52,565
I'm used to this look.

297
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:54,685
Which version of you do you prefer?

298
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:56,885
Well,

299
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:58,605
every girl wants

300
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,605
to look pretty.

301
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:01,805
Right?

302
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,885
Look at me.

303
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:08,005
Look at these pair of glasses,
these freckles and this hair.

304
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:11,165
Come to think of it.

305
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:12,365
I look

306
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:15,125
like a combination of SpongeBob and Arale.

307
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,045
Do you think so?

308
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:17,125
Look.

309
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:20,285
"Look, Patrick Star.

310
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:23,965
A cloud has appeared in the clear sky."

311
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,005
"That cloud is really a cloud."

312
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,525
Besides, I'm doing this

313
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:38,685
because I'm afraid that my grandpa
and Lu Jingyang will catch me.

314
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:42,765
Therefore, I have to act like Spider-Man.

315
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:45,685
This is my mask.

316
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:48,525
But you don't have to be afraid anymore.
You don't need the makeup now.

317
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:50,325
You're right.

318
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:53,725
Today's the first day of school.

319
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,725
Why don't you go to school looking pretty

320
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,165
and see how everyone will react?

321
00:19:58,965 --> 00:19:59,925
Really?

322
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:02,645
But I'm used to this look.

323
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:06,285
If I become pretty all of a sudden,
I will be making a counterattack.

324
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:09,365
-You will become the campus beauty.
-Really?

325
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:11,125
The Goddess will become a joke.

326
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,805
They've always been a joke in my eyes

327
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:19,285
The biggest joke ever

328
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:25,125
Chen Qingqing?

329
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,165
She's so pretty.

330
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:43,885
Isn't she Qingchen?

331
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:45,485
I can't stop drooling over her.

332
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,045
She's so pretty.

333
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:55,685
There are two good-looking people

334
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:58,325
in the class.

335
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,085
You must feel really lucky.

336
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:01,125
That's right.

337
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:02,845
Zhang Fangfang is also very pretty.

338
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,245
We're really lucky.

339
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:06,205
That's right. We're aware

340
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:08,085
that we'll never get
to date girls like them.

341
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:10,845
Therefore, I'm happy
to just be able to look at them.

342
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:12,365
That’s true.

343
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:15,645
-Chen Qingqing is so beautiful.
-Chen Qingqing is so beautiful.

344
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,365
Please don't go away.

345
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:26,485
-So pretty.
-So pretty.

346
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:32,045
Situ Feng.

347
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:37,325
Do you notice anything different
about me today?

348
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:40,485
No, I don't.

349
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,245
You didn't wear your glasses.

350
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:45,285
Even if you walk on the streets like this,
no one will take a glance at you.

351
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:53,645
What are you looking at?

352
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:55,365
Don't you need to study?

353
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:58,565
You only care about your appearances.

354
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:00,365
You should be embarrassed of yourselves.

355
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,605
Have you solved the permutations
and combinations on the blackboard?

356
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:08,565
Turn around.

357
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,445
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

358
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:12,365
Teach me.

359
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:16,085
But Your Highness,
this is the Chemistry textbook.

360
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:21,125
Are permutations
and combinations not Chemistry?

361
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:23,845
Yes.

362
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,405
You're close.

363
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,365
Nanxi.

364
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:46,165
Over there.

365
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,245
Right there.

366
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:57,165
Who's looking at you?

367
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:59,205
Why were you trying
to act cool all of a sudden?

368
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:00,645
The word is out.

369
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:02,205
My fans have come here.

370
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:03,645
Fans?

371
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:05,685
Where?

372
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:08,805
Ten o'clock.

373
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,805
Hello. So you've found out
where I go to school.

374
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:18,365
Situ Feng, are you a student here too?

375
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:21,045
That's right. Do you want my autograph
or do you want to take a photo with me?

376
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,285
We're looking
for the famous Chen Qingqing.

377
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,125
We heard that she goes to this school.
She's a wealthy girl,

378
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:27,765
but she chose to live like a commoner.

379
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:28,885
We're really inspired by her.

380
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:31,205
Can you give her
these flowers and letters?

381
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:33,365
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

382
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,685
-Okay.
-Thank you.

383
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:38,805
Thank you.

384
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:44,205
Actually, I can give you my autograph.

385
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:46,005
Well,

386
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:49,165
I went to your signing event once.
I've already got your autograph.

387
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:51,085
But thank you.

388
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:10,285
Can you tell us the progress
of your latest comic book?

389
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,085
Hey!

390
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:13,965
-Show me the characters.
-Move.

391
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:16,525
Hey, what are you doing?

392
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:18,805
She's pretty, but it doesn't mean
that you can harass her.

393
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:21,445
Also, stop giving her gifts.

394
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:23,525
Can you not be so shallow?

395
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:26,885
We represent
the Ballet Academy of Yuncheng.

396
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:31,125
Miss Chen Qingqing's ballet technique
has reached the realm of the fairies.

397
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,765
We really hope to witness
your performance.

398
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:34,925
Thank you.

399
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:36,805
We're from the Comics Club.

400
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:41,325
Goddess Chen Qingqing's drawings remind me
of several pioneer cartoonists from Japan.

401
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,605
I hope to directly learn from her.

402
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:45,525
We're from the Piano Association.

403
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:48,725
Miss Chen Qingqing's music
has cleansed our souls.

404
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:51,965
Just the thought of it
makes me want to cry.

405
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:57,205
You're exaggerating.

406
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:58,125
It's true.

407
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,325
After seeing the video
of Goddess Chen Qingqing,

408
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:01,245
we were all shocked.

409
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,245
And it's unbelievable
that she's also so pretty.

410
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:05,765
I'm no match for her.

411
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:12,685
After hearing your confession,

412
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:15,805
I'm pretty shocked too.

413
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:20,325
Mister, please don't block our way.
We're trying to learn from our goddess.

414
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,965
Thank you.

415
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,405
Excuse me.

416
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:34,325
Goddess.

417
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:35,365
Thank you.

418
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:39,125
-Miss Chen Qingqing, I worship you.
-Goddess Qingqing, you're amazing.

419
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:49,965
Hello, Daniel.
Qingqing's gone back to being pretty.

420
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,165
Aren't you going to step in?

421
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:52,925
Gosh. You've never asked me

422
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,845
to step into anything
since you made your debut.

423
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:55,805
I...

424
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:57,925
I'm doing this for her.

425
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:58,845
Think about it.

426
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:02,125
Once her looks are exposed,
she will get caught up in scandals.

427
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:04,685
People might bash her
for hiding her identity

428
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,645
in order to get close to me. Am I right?

429
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:08,725
It won't be fair to her.

430
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:12,845
Gosh, Situ Feng.

431
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,165
Give me some advice.

432
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:16,125
You don't understand the public at all.

433
00:26:16,565 --> 00:26:18,365
The frog became a prince.

434
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,005
The beast also became a prince.

435
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:22,405
The prince and princess
lived happily ever after.

436
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,085
Did the public get upset by the stories?
They didn't.

437
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:30,805
The public will be thrilled
to see an ugly girl become pretty.

438
00:26:30,885 --> 00:26:32,765
There won't be any negative coverage.

439
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:35,085
I think the public
will like Chen Qingqing.

440
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:36,325
You know what?

441
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:37,765
She should become a celebrity too.

442
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:39,005
I think this is a great idea.

443
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:40,365
What do you think?

444
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:41,285
Hello?

445
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,565
Situ Feng?

446
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,645
Hey!

447
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:46,405
Feng.

448
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:47,645
Hello?

449
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:56,045
I've done too many stupid things.

450
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:58,325
For someone who doesn't even love me,

451
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:00,005
I've forgotten what really matters.

452
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:02,805
Why are you here?

453
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,365
You don't have to work
in this cafe anymore.

454
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:07,045
What the hell do you think you're doing?

455
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,565
We're dating. We're not starring
in the drama The President's Lovely Wife.

456
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:13,165
I have done what you ordered,
Young Master.

457
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:14,085
This is smart of you.

458
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,645
This couple would not be able
to handle all the negative comments.

459
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:17,765
Come here.

460
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:20,325
Tell me. Why did you look at me like that?

461
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,005
I'm trying to drive a wedge between them.

462
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,245
Just wait and see.

463
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,085
