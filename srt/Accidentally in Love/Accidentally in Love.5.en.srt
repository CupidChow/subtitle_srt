A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:59,165
EPISODE 5

3
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:02,885
It becomes a proportional relationship
between the three horizontal segments.

4
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:04,085
The class is now dismissed.

5
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:09,164
Situ Feng is so handsome!

6
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,125
-He's so handsome!
-He's so handsome!

7
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:16,885
E-BOOK

8
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:24,165
I like it when he reads so quietly.

9
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:34,565
RECEIVABLES

10
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:37,685
Fangfang, are you ready?

11
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:39,445
Yes.

12
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:46,045
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

13
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,805
A school is a confined space

14
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:55,445
with a fixed number of individuals
and a fixed amount of purchasing power.

15
00:02:55,525 --> 00:03:00,205
Thus, we can find a solution
for businesses to obtain greater benefits.

16
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:04,005
And we will also gain
the corresponding profits.

17
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:07,685
The school is full of people
who live in style.

18
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,925
When their desire for shopping

19
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:13,405
is over 1,200 steps far away
from their purchases,

20
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,685
their desire to purchase

21
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:16,805
will not be able
to prevail over their laziness.

22
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:19,765
So let's help them get past
these 1,200 steps!

23
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:21,525
It's a win-win situation.

24
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:24,205
This will already
fulfill their hidden demands.

25
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,925
And with the merchants, we can reach

26
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:29,805
a strategic cooperation.

27
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:32,085
You mean your errands service?

28
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:37,085
-Hello, everyone.
-May I have your attention, please?

29
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:42,325
Today is the first day of business
for Qingqing's Errands Service.

30
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:45,965
We'll run errands, get food from
the cafeteria and buy snacks for you.

31
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:48,445
Starting from just ten yuan per errand.

32
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:50,485
Ten yuan. Just ten yuan.

33
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,445
Really, it costs just ten yuan.
It's cheap.

34
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,725
Qingqing, I don't think
anyone is listening.

35
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:57,925
You'd better just let them come to us.

36
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,405
I have an idea.

37
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:07,645
We'll run errands, get food from
the cafeteria and buy snacks for you.

38
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,485
Starting from just ten yuan.

39
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,245
We'll run errands, get food
from the cafeteria and buy snacks for you.

40
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:13,765
Starting from just ten yuan.

41
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:15,685
Starting from just ten yuan.

42
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,644
Hey, what are you doing?

43
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,325
Chen Qingqing, you're seriously
disturbing my studies.

44
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:24,165
You too, your studying is seriously
disturbing my campaign.

45
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:27,445
-Are you trying to argue with me?
-So what if I am?

46
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:32,925
He's so handsome!

47
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:43,485
Some people just come here
with an ax to grind.

48
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,245
I think you're not really studying.

49
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:52,805
Are you doing this just to please
your fans out there?

50
00:04:58,525 --> 00:04:59,685
What are you looking at?

51
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:03,365
"To the ugly person, being peered at
is a kind of cruelty."

52
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:07,045
-Situ Feng!
-From Qian Zhongshu's Fortress Besieged.

53
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:11,565
Are you done yet, Situ Feng?

54
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,285
Qingqing, that's enough.

55
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:22,325
I think starting a business is going to be
tough at the beginning.

56
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,805
No one changes their habits that fast.

57
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:25,965
That's right!

58
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:29,485
So, whenever there's a new product,

59
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:33,125
it will need a marketing trial
to give some input.

60
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:37,165
I need people to try the sample
to see if it works.

61
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:39,525
You mean, someone to promote it?

62
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:40,685
Do you need Situ Feng?

63
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:41,965
Oh, no.

64
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,205
You know Situ Feng.

65
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:47,005
He always puts up that sour face.

66
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:48,445
If we have him,

67
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:51,405
they'll surely think he's plotting
something with us,

68
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,085
or that I'm blackmailing him!

69
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:55,405
And most importantly,

70
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:57,725
I don't like him.

71
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:02,765
But I've found my first customer.

72
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:03,765
Don't you worry.

73
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:07,085
I'm sure he's the right candidate.

74
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:10,645
He has a good image
and is great at persuasion.

75
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,485
Qingqing.

76
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,045
Can you please get me a beef rice set
from the cafeteria?

77
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,045
Plus, a bottle of cola.

78
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,605
Sure, coming right up.

79
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:27,405
Here.

80
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:31,325
Okay, I've made payments for the meal
and the errands.

81
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:34,125
Thanks for coming, Mr. Gu.

82
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:38,085
Does anyone else want to try?

83
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:39,205
Anyone else?

84
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:42,685
-Me!
-Me!

85
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:43,725
-Me!
-Write it down.

86
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,605
-It's so lively here.
-What's going on?

87
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:48,085
-Let's check it out.
-Let's go see.

88
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:50,445
Who wants the set that Gu Nanxi bought?

89
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:51,725
-Me!
-Me too!

90
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,245
-Me too!
-That makes three.

91
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,165
What would you like?

92
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,285
-Coffee milk.
-Coffee milk.

93
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,245
-Coffee milk for two.
-Gu Nanxi.

94
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:59,485
-Could you get me some snacks?
-Sure, anything you want.

95
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:00,925
What is it?

96
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,405
Hey, Gu Nanxi.

97
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:03,565
Are you possessed?

98
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,165
This isn't the first time
you're surrounded by fans.

99
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,165
-Three for you.
-Okay, let's go.

100
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:27,085
SPECIAL PRICE

101
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:53,285
Fangfang, you go to Class 3
while I go to Class 1.

102
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:59,325
Guys, here comes your snacks!

103
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:03,485
Come and see which one is yours.

104
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,445
-Who does this belong to?
-This one...

105
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,045
This is the QR code for our service.

106
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,485
Everyone, please take note.

107
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:10,685
Please take note.

108
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:16,005
Chen Qingqing is so broke,
she's even running errands on campus.

109
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:19,005
The entire Ming De College
has fallen under her spell!

110
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,565
And she's sitting next to Situ Feng.

111
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:22,525
Shut up, will you?

112
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,125
-Here are your snacks!
-Thanks.

113
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:26,885
-We'll send them over after class.
-Sure.

114
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:33,205
Your afternoon tea is here, guys!

115
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,205
I want this one!

116
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:53,205
This is for you.

117
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:58,205
Chen Qingqing, you...

118
00:08:58,285 --> 00:08:59,845
Just open it!

119
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:03,525
Sorry, I have to turn it down.

120
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:05,805
-I'm not opening it.
-Situ Feng.

121
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:08,725
Do you want me to read it out
in front of everyone?

122
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,045
Hey.

123
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:12,525
Let me make it clear.

124
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,045
I don't want to have anything
to do with you.

125
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:22,285
-Hey.
-“Dear--"

126
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:32,925
Chen Qingqing.

127
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,445
Just give it up already.

128
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,205
I've got fans queuing up all over.

129
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,845
-You'd better wait in line.
-Gosh.

130
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:44,725
Situ Feng.

131
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,965
I'm not the type who's going to...

132
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:48,445
Goodness.

133
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,445
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

134
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,165
Look.

135
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,165
What is this about?

136
00:09:56,245 --> 00:10:00,645
This is our new errands service.
Delivering love letters.

137
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,605
These are all for you.

138
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:04,645
Do you think I would approve that?

139
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:08,605
I'm trying to keep you popular.

140
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:12,205
I heard that you can't possibly
turn down fans' love letters.

141
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:15,525
Rather than have them line up outside
and disrupt everyone else's studies,

142
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:18,685
how about I make this more
professional and systematic

143
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:22,045
so everyone will benefit the most
out of it?

144
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:23,565
Look.

145
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:24,525
This, for instance.

146
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:26,525
To show respect, 20 yuan.

147
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,245
To show affection, 30 yuan.

148
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,125
To show lust, 50 yuan.

149
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:34,525
An autograph will cost you 100 yuan.

150
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:37,205
And this is the best one.

151
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:39,925
A reply will cost you 250 yuan!

152
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:47,285
All right. You want the money so badly,
so I'll give you a chance to earn big.

153
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,565
How kind of you!

154
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:52,205
I want to treat everyone for a drink.

155
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,445
I want the extra-large bottles!

156
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:56,485
One bottle for each person!

157
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,285
You can charge how much you want!

158
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,525
Zhang Fangfang, our business is growing!

159
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:04,765
Come here!

160
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,685
We accept your deal.

161
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:07,845
Okay.

162
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:08,965
Here's the money.

163
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,245
You'd better deliver.

164
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:12,285
You bet!

165
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,045
Fangfang, take this.

166
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:19,525
Sit down.

167
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,845
Qingqing, why aren't you buying anything?

168
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,365
-Buy what?
-The drinks!

169
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:50,685
Is Miss Chen Qingqing in this class?
We're delivering some drinks here.

170
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,485
Yes, just put them over there.

171
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:53,445
Sure.

172
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:54,845
Hey.

173
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:58,165
The campus supermarket
must be doing great now.

174
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:01,005
We placed our order online
for them to deliver.

175
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:02,605
Don't you know that?

176
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:07,405
So you're trying to outwit me?

177
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,085
Chen Qingqing!

178
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,885
We're late for swimming class.
Let's go! Run!

179
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:17,805
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

180
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,805
Gather around here once you've changed.

181
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:27,045
Fangfang.

182
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,685
Isn't that a bit too much?

183
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:33,725
I haven't mastered my swimming
for the past ten years or so.

184
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:37,085
So I've got to pass this one
with flying colors!

185
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:38,845
All right.

186
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:43,365
There are 15 minutes left before we begin
our swimming lessons for today.

187
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:44,805
You can do what you want for now.

188
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:48,645
After that, let's go over there
and get your swimming caps and goggles.

189
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:51,125
-I'll wait for you over there.
-Okay.

190
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,605
What's up with him?

191
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:01,485
What kind of person is Situ Feng?

192
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:03,965
He's always keeping his idol image.

193
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,365
He won't be swimming with us.

194
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:08,965
When they sneak-snap on him,

195
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:11,045
he would cover his eight-pack.
That's what I heard.

196
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:12,525
No way.

197
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:15,805
I heard that Feng is seriously
obsessed with cleanliness.

198
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:18,605
He will only swim in private pools.

199
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:20,405
That's an idol for you.

200
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:23,805
He even takes the finest details
so seriously.

201
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:25,765
Let's go.

202
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:49,645
Hey.

203
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,725
Why won't you swim with us?

204
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:56,925
Why do you care?

205
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,845
How dare you speak to me like that?

206
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,565
Do you want me to push you into the pool?

207
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:03,805
Listen here.

208
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,045
You can joke about anything else,
but this.

209
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:11,525
What the hell?

210
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:18,645
Situ Feng!

211
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,045
Situ Feng, you...

212
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:26,645
Help!

213
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:30,325
Help!

214
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:41,965
Lin Yiyang.

215
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:45,725
If you want to learn how to swim,
you've got to overcome your fear of water.

216
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:50,405
Qingqing, are you okay?

217
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:53,525
Fangfang, you scared me!

218
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,245
Let's be friends.

219
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,405
Hi, I am Zhang Fangfang.

220
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,085
Qingqing, this is--

221
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:11,565
I know. He's Lin Yiyang.

222
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:19,885
Hey, did you see what just happened?

223
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:24,245
-Qingqing fell into the pool?
-Yeah.

224
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:26,405
So many people saw it, but...

225
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:29,525
I heard that it was Lin Yiyang.

226
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:31,525
-Really?
-Yeah.

227
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:35,005
He pushed Qingqing's head
into the water without helping her up.

228
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:37,365
You know the fire in our campus'
chemistry lab last year?

229
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:38,525
He started it.

230
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,605
Why didn't they expel him yet?

231
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:41,605
He's got connections.

232
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:45,405
Guys, Li Yiyang didn't do that.
He actually saved Qingqing.

233
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:47,885
How do you know?

234
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:49,005
I saw it myself.

235
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:50,005
I saw it myself, too.

236
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,885
You just said you heard about it.

237
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,045
Everyone knows that Lin Yiyang
is the big bully on campus.

238
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:58,205
And there you go clearing his name.

239
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,285
Are you secretly in love with him?

240
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:06,045
-You guys go on. I've got to--
-Hold it right there.

241
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:09,525
What did you just say?

242
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:11,325
Nothing.

243
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,525
-Louder!
-Nothing!

244
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:14,685
Get lost.

245
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:17,445
Lin Yiyang?

246
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:18,925
Yes?

247
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,165
Just now...

248
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,965
Mind your own business.

249
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:32,045
Fangfang, who was screaming just now?
I heard it from inside.

250
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:34,245
It was nothing. Come on.

251
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:35,685
What's up with you?

252
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:47,765
Today was the best day of our errands
service's first week of operations.

253
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,845
Time to count our earnings for the week.

254
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:53,045
Let's do it!

255
00:16:57,805 --> 00:16:59,605
We only got this much?

256
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:02,805
Is this enough to cover the compensation?

257
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:04,605
We did great, Qingqing.

258
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,565
It's much more than what I earned
from my six months at the cafeteria.

259
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,405
I'll keep it for now.

260
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,724
My errands service has opened
for business for a week

261
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:17,405
and it didn't even reach 100,000 yuan.

262
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:20,045
I'm due to pay him by tomorrow the latest.

263
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:22,364
And I haven't even
joined the Student Council.

264
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:26,525
Am I going to be kicked out of college
just because I don't have the money?

265
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:32,445
DANIEL, CELEBRITY BROKER

266
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,965
Mr. Zhou, I've paid up
all the compensation.

267
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:40,125
-Don't break the rules next time.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:42,285
I'll follow what you told me.

269
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:43,725
May I go back to class now?

270
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:46,005
See you, sir.

271
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:50,685
-What are you doing here?
-Mind your own business.

272
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:53,485
Hey.

273
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:57,245
I heard you're now Feng's assistant.

274
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:59,765
Boy, the word got out fast.

275
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:03,165
That's right, I'm Feng's new assistant.

276
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:06,205
I'm his private, personal assistant.

277
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:09,925
Stop putting up an act.
I know that already.

278
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,485
But you're only an assistant by name.

279
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:16,525
That's what others think.

280
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:19,125
Now, I'm not only Situ Feng's deskmate.

281
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,925
I'm now his assistant.

282
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,725
His private, personal assistant.

283
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,045
And you.

284
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,645
You're none of that.

285
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:37,365
Did Qingqing really agree
to be your assistant?

286
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:39,565
That crazy bitch.

287
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:43,165
She said she wasn't a fan of mine,
yet she bought a lot of tickets.

288
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:45,565
I think you should be more careful.

289
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:49,445
You once said, whoever crosses you,
it's not going to end well for them.

290
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,205
I see that things haven't been great
for you lately.

291
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,125
This is the last one.

292
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,205
Thanks for coming.

293
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,445
-Bye.
-Bye.

294
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:07,605
Chen Qingqing.

295
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:09,205
What are you doing?

296
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:12,525
I didn't think your tickets
would sell so well.

297
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:15,925
All I did was post it
on the college's discussion forum

298
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:17,725
and everyone started asking
about the cost.

299
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:19,765
So I earned a lot
by reselling the tickets.

300
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:21,365
-Qingqing, you--
-Hey.

301
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,325
You didn't like her errands service,
right?

302
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:28,685
She'll stop the service
after she gets the money she needs.

303
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:30,885
Just like what you wanted.

304
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:33,125
What did you say about me?

305
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,005
Nothing.

306
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:39,205
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

307
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,725
Come on!

308
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:59,365
Golden VIP seats up for rent!

309
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:01,325
Right next to His Highness!

310
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:03,165
Nothing is stopping you to be with him.

311
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,445
Sometimes you may
run into him by accident.

312
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:09,565
It's a real face-to-face contact!

313
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:12,645
Limited seats available.
Hurry while stocks last!

314
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:14,285
SEAT FOR RENT - HIS HIGHNESS

315
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:17,205
Qingqing, don't you have
enough money already?

316
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:19,605
Even so, I can still earn more, right?

317
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:22,165
Besides, I've thought about it.

318
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:25,405
Neither of us want to share the same desk
with each other.

319
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:28,605
So instead, why don't I rent out my seat?

320
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:34,005
It just happens that I can help
those pure-hearted girls that like you.

321
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:37,925
Hey! What the hell, Situ Feng?

322
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:41,485
Your errands service
should stop right now!

323
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:43,925
You can go now.

324
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,325
Hey, don't go!

325
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:49,685
Situ Feng, why are you doing this?

326
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:52,005
Because you're my assistant.

327
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:57,445
Once you signed up to be my assistant,
if you breach the contract,

328
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,725
you'll need to compensate me more
than that painting is going to cost you.

329
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:04,685
Fine.

330
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,485
I am your assistant, Situ Feng.

331
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:10,725
Chen Qingqing is a woman of her word.

332
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:13,965
All right, my assistant.
Get me some water.

333
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:17,485
Go!

334
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,365
Hey, you spilled the water!

335
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:25,725
Aren't you going to drink it?

336
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,725
Hey, cold water? How many times do I have
to tell you? I have a sensitive stomach!

337
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,085
Hey, the water is so hot!

338
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:43,125
Do you want me to burn my tongue?
Get another one.

339
00:21:55,485 --> 00:21:59,885
Your gym teacher has an emergency.
We'll have math instead.

340
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,045
Distribute the papers.

341
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:09,685
Let's see how badly you did.

342
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,685
Situ Feng.

343
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,525
I'm warning you.

344
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:18,325
You'd better not leave anything
I can use against you.

345
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,645
If not...

346
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:26,445
Situ Feng.

347
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:29,205
Do you know that you scored
the lowest in your class?

348
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,965
And you've lowered the class average
by three points.

349
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,365
When I call your names,

350
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:37,565
you'll be paired up into study groups.

351
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:38,845
Group One.

352
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:42,005
Chen Qingqing, Situ Feng.

353
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:44,085
Group Two.

354
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:47,525
Ms. Chen, I don't want to be with her!

355
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:49,725
Ms. Chen.

356
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,805
I am very happy to accept
your arrangement.

357
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:54,965
As part of this class,

358
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:57,565
I am willing to help

359
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:58,925
someone physically underdeveloped

360
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:00,845
and simple-minded students

361
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:03,325
to step up with me
and defend the class' honor.

362
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:04,325
That's good.

363
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:06,965
Situ Feng, do you have any objections?

364
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:11,165
No, ma'am.

365
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:14,525
We're going to have a welcoming party
this weekend.

366
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,405
Every class has to come out
with a program.

367
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:19,045
Do you have any ideas?

368
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:20,565
Situ Feng should sing!

369
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:22,685
-Sing!
-Sing!

370
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,885
This requires the approval
of those involved.

371
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:28,165
Situ Feng, do you have any objections?

372
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:29,525
No.

373
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:33,765
Keep quiet now.

374
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,365
Let's discuss the papers.

375
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:37,165
Please refer to your papers.

376
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,725
First, let's look at question two.

377
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:17,245
You were so pleased with yourself,
weren't you, Situ Feng?

378
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:22,085
Now, let me show you what you get
when you cross Chen Qingqing.

379
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:28,845
Miss Chen Qingqing.

380
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,645
-We're so sorry for what we did.
-Yeah.

381
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:33,005
We didn't acknowledge you.

382
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:37,045
-We didn't acknowledge you.
-Yes, if you could just forgive us.

383
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,965
-We'll do anything to make it up to you.
-That's right.

384
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,725
You just have to share with us
His Highness's latest news!

385
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:44,765
Or you can just recommend us to him.

386
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:49,085
We're so envious that you can be
by His Highness's side every day!

387
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:53,885
That skin, those lips, that slender--

388
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,445
Okay, stop it.

389
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:59,125
I've told you before, right?

390
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,405
The reason why

391
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,565
they took pictures of me
with Situ Feng like that

392
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:10,845
was because we seem to be
good friends in private.

393
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:14,645
They didn't even care what sexes we are!

394
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:17,725
Besides,

395
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,845
for someone like Situ Feng...

396
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:23,605
He's usually quite unmanly, you know?

397
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,285
Lucky for you.

398
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:32,085
Everyone is getting ready
for the welcoming party.

399
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,805
We could use more hands here.

400
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:36,365
So I've told the secretariat about it

401
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:38,445
and they're willing to take you in.

402
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:40,245
I'll surely get the job done!

403
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:44,605
By the way, Mr. Gu.

404
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:46,045
Can I ask you something?

405
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,685
Which department is in charge

406
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,605
of our college archives?

407
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:54,565
Ming De's college archives are top secret.

408
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:56,885
Only those in the presidium
can access them.

409
00:25:57,565 --> 00:25:59,445
Qingqing, why did you ask?

410
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:03,285
Oh, it's nothing. I'm just curious.

411
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:06,925
You've had a little misunderstanding
with someone in the council.

412
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:08,645
You're just in time to clear the air.

413
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:10,605
Come on.

414
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:18,685
Chen Qingqing...

415
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:25,245
Chen Qingqing...

416
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,605
Chen Qingqing, you're right on time.

417
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:40,525
It's you again?

418
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,365
I hope you don't mind.

419
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:59,045
I don't blame you, but personal hygiene
is my highest priority.

420
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:02,485
Aren't we studying math?
What are we doing here?

421
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:05,605
It's so peaceful and quiet here,
so it's the best place to study.

422
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:10,405
I wrote this song for her.

423
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:15,165
What the hell happened?

424
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,205
Who's there?

425
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:18,045
Is something wrong with me?

426
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,365
It's 120 beats per minute?

427
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:22,925
Isn't there anyone you like?

428
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:25,645
I'm Chen Qingqing. Who would I like?

429
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,925
