1
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:35,765
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:58,605
EPISODE 15

3
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:17,565
Hello?

4
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:22,565
There's more to shoot?

5
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:28,085
Are you sure?

6
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:29,885
Why wasn't I aware?

7
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:32,365
All right.

8
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:51,085
"A music video series?"

9
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,805
Was I blind at that time?

10
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,125
How did I miss this part of the contract?

11
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:04,445
Qingqing.

12
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,525
Why are you up so early?

13
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:08,565
What's up?

14
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,045
It's nothing.

15
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,685
I guess I just fell into Situ Feng's trap.

16
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:16,925
A horrible trap.

17
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,045
I was told that you could even
skydive over there.

18
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,405
I want to go so badly.

19
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,005
-I really want to go!
-So cool!

20
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:26,045
Hey.

21
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:29,165
What are you guys talking about?
You sound so excited.

22
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:32,885
Hey, did you know, soon, we'll be leaving

23
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:34,725
for our college excursion.

24
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:36,365
College excursion?

25
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:38,285
It's for everyone in the Student Council.

26
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,205
A two-day and one night trip.

27
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:42,845
Is it like a field trip
for elementary students?

28
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,805
-What's so different about this excursion?
-Gosh.

29
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:48,325
Perhaps, you're not aware
that Ming De College excursion

30
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:50,645
has its traditions and is very popular.

31
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:53,085
It's the best time
to confess to the person you like.

32
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:57,245
Countless of romantic relationships
happened during this event.

33
00:03:58,645 --> 00:03:59,565
Are you sure?

34
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:00,805
Of course, I am sure.

35
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,845
Look.

36
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,005
This couple.

37
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:05,645
That couple.

38
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:07,365
And that couple.

39
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,925
They were all a product
of last year's excursion.

40
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:14,125
Furthermore, the Leonids meteor shower

41
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:16,125
is happening this year.

42
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:19,485
The success rate for love confessions
will surely increase.

43
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:22,765
Qingqing, do you have someone you like?

44
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:23,765
Me?

45
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,404
-Yes, do you?
-Yes, do you?

46
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,365
-She's blushing.
-She's blushing.

47
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,525
-Who is it?
-No one!

48
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:40,005
All the guys here are too immature
for me to like them.

49
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:43,525
Class is starting.

50
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:44,845
Let's go.

51
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,045
Gu Nanxi.

52
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:52,605
-Yes?
-Class is starting.

53
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:53,765
Yes, it's starting.

54
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:54,805
It's starting.

55
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,765
Most of you would have heard

56
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:18,725
that the time for
Ming De College's excursion has come.

57
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:23,405
Calm down!

58
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:27,725
For this excursion,
we'll be going to Luzui cliff.

59
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,205
It'll be a camping trip
for two days and one night.

60
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:32,645
The trip is set for this weekend.

61
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,925
Don't you have a music video shoot
this weekend?

62
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:39,565
How did you know?

63
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,605
I'm your assistant.

64
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:46,445
Isn't it normal for me to know?

65
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:49,885
There is going to be credits
given for this excursion.

66
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,965
Unless it is absolutely necessary,

67
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:54,565
you cannot excuse yourselves.

68
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:58,805
See.

69
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,125
I can't excuse myself.

70
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:06,005
If Situ Feng is going to the excursion,

71
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:08,685
does that mean I won't have
to shoot the music video?

72
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,165
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

73
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,925
Does it make you that happy
to go camping with me?

74
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:23,045
Situ Feng, why are you so shameless?

75
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,005
Hello, Daniel.

76
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:46,005
Okay.

77
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,365
I got it.

78
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:50,765
Okay.

79
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,365
That conversation was so short.

80
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:05,365
I suppose his manager is really efficient.

81
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:13,125
Hello, Daniel.

82
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:14,725
What's up?

83
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,165
Qingchen, here's the thing.

84
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:19,285
Situ Feng has plans for this weekend.
He's going to his college's excursion.

85
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:20,405
It's compulsory.

86
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:22,805
There'll be last minute changes
for our music video shoot.

87
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,525
Qingqing seems to be in a good mood.

88
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:27,725
Why is she giggling?
who is she talking to?

89
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,445
I see.

90
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:31,245
That's too bad.

91
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:33,525
I was all prepared for it.

92
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:35,845
But don't worry.

93
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:37,405
School is more important.

94
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,285
No, it's not cancelled.

95
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:40,805
We're just changing the location.

96
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:42,685
They will be going to Luzui cliff

97
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:46,085
so we'll shoot our music video there.
It was originally an outdoor shoot anyway.

98
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,845
Camping will start right after
the shooting.

99
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,445
We're killing two birds with one stone.

100
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,485
It might trouble you.
I hope you're okay with it.

101
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,245
No.

102
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,125
Don't worry, it won't affect you
that much.

103
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:58,325
I'll send you the schedule later. Bye.

104
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:01,125
Hello? I'm not finished yet. Hello?

105
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:02,125
Hello?

106
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:07,725
I wasn't even done yet.

107
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:12,765
What's wrong with you?
Are you high on drugs?

108
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,205
It's all because of you.

109
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:20,525
Because of me?

110
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:28,565
All right, you're dismissed.

111
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,205
Hand in your 10,000-word report
by tomorrow.

112
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:42,684
Ms. Chen.

113
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,845
Yes? How can I help you?

114
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,564
It's about the excursion this weekend.

115
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,285
Can I apply for a leave of absence?

116
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,525
Qingqing.

117
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:57,285
This is a compulsory trip
for all students.

118
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,365
We can't allow it.

119
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:01,565
Even Situ Feng can't excuse himself.

120
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:03,725
He has to come after his shoot ends.

121
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,085
Then is it possible for me
to go there a bit late?

122
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,805
I promise I won't be late
for the gathering, please?

123
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:11,805
Pretty please?

124
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:12,885
Can I?

125
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:14,005
All right.

126
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,725
Try to come as soon as possible.

127
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:28,405
Am I hallucinating due to extreme hunger?

128
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,485
The old witch is smiling now.

129
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,565
I think I'm hungry too.

130
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,245
LUZUI CLIFF

131
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,165
Okay, cut! That's a wrap.

132
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:54,005
-Thank you, director.
-Thank you, director.

133
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,045
-Thank you, director.
-Thank you, director.

134
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,845
An assistant accidentally spilled
some of the warm water.

135
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,245
This is all we have left.

136
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:06,285
Qingchen, drink this. It'll warm you up.

137
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:07,805
Thank you.

138
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,045
Your hands are cold.

139
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,565
Why don't you drink it?

140
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:15,965
I'm all right.
My body can take it. I don't feel cold.

141
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:17,245
You should drink it.

142
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,005
The shoot was a success today.

143
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:23,245
The two of you look great together

144
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:26,245
and your chemistry has gotten better.

145
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,365
This...

146
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:28,445
How do you say it?

147
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,325
I have an eye for talent.

148
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,965
I've even thought
of your onscreen couple name.

149
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:35,925
Any guesses? Yes or no?

150
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:38,005
It's called Fengchen Couple!

151
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,245
Daniel.

152
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:40,965
Is my car ready?

153
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:42,925
-I'm in a hurry.
-It's over there.

154
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,165
Ready to go at your command.

155
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,165
What about me?

156
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,445
-How do I leave?
-Another car is on the way to fetch us.

157
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,525
-Just hang on for a while.
-Okay.

158
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,605
Hello?

159
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,605
What's the matter?

160
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:57,165
Well...

161
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,445
Our car broke down on the way here.
We might need to wait a little more.

162
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,725
So you're saying...

163
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:06,525
So I'm saying you can wait here with us.

164
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,645
Qingchen, are you in a hurry?

165
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:14,285
I...

166
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:16,605
Why don't you go with me?

167
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,485
My driver can drop me off
at the camping site

168
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:19,885
then send you off to town.

169
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:23,645
Should I tell him I'm heading
to the campsite too?

170
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,765
But we can't go together.

171
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,565
Don't trouble yourself.

172
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,405
I don't have any plans later
so I'm not in that much of a hurry.

173
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:31,805
Why don't you take his car?

174
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,005
I have no idea what time the other car
can make it here.

175
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:36,125
That's right, it's better to be in a car

176
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:37,885
-than to wait here.
-That's right.

177
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,325
They're right. Let's go.

178
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,085
Okay, screw it.

179
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:43,565
Okay.

180
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:46,005
Would the two of you follow us
to change your outfits?

181
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,005
Okay.

182
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:51,285
Fengchen Couple!

183
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,125
Isn't it awesome? Tell me it's awesome!

184
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:56,485
-It's awesome.
-Can't you add a little more zest?

185
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,325
Can't you say it like it's really awesome?

186
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,125
Qingchen, you did a good job today.

187
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:02,565
You did a better job than me

188
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:05,405
even with your packed schedule.

189
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,565
Whereas for me,
this is my only trip for today.

190
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:11,725
Right, last time I said
I'd take you to Yuncheng.

191
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:15,725
Gu Nanxi invited you several times,
but you weren't available.

192
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:20,085
There's always a chance next time.

193
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:22,165
Screw that. Let's do it today.

194
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:24,725
Luzui cliff is a popular destination
in Yuncheng after all.

195
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:27,925
But...

196
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:30,165
Didn't you say that you were free?

197
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,805
Yes, I did.

198
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,125
But the thing is

199
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:40,085
everyone there is your classmate

200
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:42,085
and I don't know anyone.

201
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:44,445
I don't think it's a good idea for me
to show up like that.

202
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:48,285
Don't worry, they're all really friendly
and Gu Nanxi will be there too.

203
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,285
You know him, right? Let's go.

204
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:51,845
But...

205
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,525
What do I do with Chen Qingqing now?

206
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:04,445
Gu Nanxi.

207
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:08,805
Qingchen?

208
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,525
What are you doing here?

209
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:13,805
You should thank your friend.

210
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:15,525
He dragged me here.

211
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:19,765
What a surprise, isn't it?

212
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,085
Yes, what a surprise.

213
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,925
But in a panicked kind of way.

214
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:26,845
Have a seat.

215
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:28,445
Please.

216
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,485
Situ Feng came with someone really pretty.

217
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,365
I saw them just now.

218
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,005
Could they be a couple?

219
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:40,205
Who would date Situ Feng?
His fans will get really mad at her.

220
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:46,925
-Hey, Xinya.
-Feng.

221
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,005
Why are you here?

222
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:54,245
Isn't this our beautiful Miss Qingchen?

223
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:56,325
Yes, it's me.

224
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:58,365
It has been a while.

225
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,725
You're not a student from Ming De College.

226
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,285
Why are you here for our excursion?

227
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:04,685
Xinya, stop it.

228
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:05,845
We're all friends.

229
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,605
That's right, we're all friends.

230
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:09,565
-Can't we just hang out?
-She's my friend?

231
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:11,805
Chen Qingqing is gone,

232
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,605
but now Qingchen is here.

233
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:15,925
This sucks.

234
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:17,045
That's right.

235
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,365
Where's Chen Qingqing?

236
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:22,285
She's going to be late.

237
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:24,565
She told me that she's still on the way.

238
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:26,885
Give her a call.

239
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,245
Why isn't she picking up?

240
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,245
Chen Qingqing is an idiot.

241
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,325
Why is she running off on her own?

242
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,885
Chen Qingqing is a smart person.
She's going to be fine.

243
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:43,765
Don't worry.

244
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:44,765
Yes.

245
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,085
I don't think that classmate of yours

246
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:48,525
is unreliable.

247
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,605
Maybe she just didn't want to come.

248
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:55,285
This isn't an easy place to find.
Could she have really gotten lost?

249
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:56,365
Of course she wouldn't.

250
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:57,845
She's always full of ideas.

251
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,325
-Let's inform the lecturer.
-No.

252
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:02,965
This won't do. I will go look for her.

253
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,685
-Gu Nanxi, take care of Qingchen for me.
-Okay.

254
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:07,725
Hey, Feng.

255
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,245
Look around.

256
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:12,125
It's too dangerous
to be going around alone.

257
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,525
Let's just wait a little longer.

258
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:15,085
Xinya, I will be back soon.

259
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,205
Qingchen, I'm sorry.
I'm going to look for someone.

260
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:23,605
I'm sorry, guys.

261
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,765
I need to go to the washroom.

262
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:27,205
I'll go with you.

263
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:28,685
It's okay.

264
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:30,765
I'd like to walk around on my own.

265
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:31,805
Don't worry.

266
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:34,925
I'm not going to get myself lost
like that friend of yours.

267
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:49,285
Chen Qingqing!

268
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:50,965
Chen Qingqing!

269
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:53,485
Chen Qingqing!

270
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,285
Chen Qingqing!

271
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:58,285
Chen Qingqing.

272
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:04,565
Where did you go?
Why didn't you pick up your calls?

273
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:06,645
My cell phone's battery died.

274
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:09,965
What happened to your leg?

275
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:14,285
It's nothing. I'm here
because I wanted to use the washroom,

276
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:16,005
but when I came out of the washroom,

277
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,965
I noticed all the trees here

278
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,165
looked the same

279
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,205
so I walked around
and that's how I got lost.

280
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,085
Then I realized,

281
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,405
there were so many steps here

282
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,565
so I walked and walked
and sprained my leg.

283
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:32,605
Sit down, let me have a look at it.

284
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,285
-I...
-Mind yourself.

285
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:36,125
It's not a big deal. Seriously.

286
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:38,445
Where does it hurt?

287
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,805
-Here.
-Here?

288
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,565
It's your ankle again?

289
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:45,685
You're going to develop
chronic injuries, you know?

290
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,165
It's not that serious.

291
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,445
Don't lie to me.
Do you know everyone's worried about you?

292
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:52,325
Worried?

293
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:57,325
Are you saying you're worried about me?

294
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:02,205
Of course.

295
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,085
I was not the only one.

296
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,444
Gu Nanxi was also worried.

297
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,365
So was Fangfang.

298
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,645
Everyone was worried about you.

299
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:12,844
Can you walk?

300
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:16,084
Of course I can walk. Do you want to bet?

301
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,925
I can even run 100 meters

302
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,204
and be way ahead of you.

303
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:21,165
Just like this.

304
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:23,405
All right, save your energy for now.

305
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:24,805
Slow down.

306
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:26,565
Let's take baby steps.

307
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:30,885
Is your ankle really fine?

308
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:34,725
I have a friend to introduce you.

309
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,205
Friend? What friend?

310
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:37,365
Her name is Qingchen.

311
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,565
Qingchen?

312
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,085
Yes, I've told you about her many times.

313
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,405
Slowly. We're back.

314
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,845
-Hi, Munian. Gosh.
-Slow down.

315
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,725
-You're finally here.
-Yes.

316
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:54,405
You didn't pick up our calls.
We were really worried.

317
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,565
I'm so smart.
What could've happened to me?

318
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:59,405
-Am I right?
-You're right.

319
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:01,965
All you know is how to sprain your ankle.

320
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:04,285
I told you.

321
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:07,565
You guys were worried for nothing.

322
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:09,925
Hey.

323
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,045
Where's Qingchen?

324
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:16,445
Well, she said she wanted
to walk around for a while.

325
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:21,165
It's been half an hour.
Could something have happened?

326
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:22,805
Gu Nanxi.

327
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,925
This place is so isolated
for a girl to be alone.

328
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:25,965
You should look for her.

329
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,685
What's wrong with you?

330
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,885
Nothing. I just choked myself.

331
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:39,445
This is just a thought.

332
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,245
Maybe Qingchen

333
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:44,525
just wanted to have a look around

334
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:47,805
and spend some time by herself, you know?

335
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,165
Perhaps you guys shouldn't disturb her.

336
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,925
Hey, this won't do.

337
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:56,485
I brought her here.
I can't let her get into any accidents.

338
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,125
I'll have to go look for her.

339
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:05,685
I think I'm going to the washroom now.

340
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:07,845
I will be right back in a while.

341
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:09,605
Wait for me, okay?

342
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:11,805
Please help me look after this, thanks.

343
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,605
I'll be quick.

344
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,525
I'll be really quick!

345
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:23,965
Qingchen!

346
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,325
Were you looking for me?

347
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,205
We've found Qingqing.
I'll introduce you to each other.

348
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,285
-What?
-Let's go.

349
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:30,805
Where's Qingqing?

350
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,645
Qingqing, where are you going now?

351
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:37,805
To the washroom.

352
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,245
Where's Qingchen?

353
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,005
Hey, where's Chen Qingqing?

354
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:50,965
Where's Qingchen?

355
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:53,485
Where's Chen Qingqing?

356
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:55,605
Why is she gone again?

357
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:57,325
I'm going to look for her.

358
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,725
I'm sorry, please excuse me.

359
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,605
I need another visit to the washroom.

360
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:17,125
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

361
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:21,965
Gu Nanxi.

362
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:25,885
Why are you here?

363
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:27,925
Were you looking for Chen Qingqing?

364
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:31,565
Let me help you check
if she's in the washroom.

365
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,285
You don't have to pretend anymore.

366
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:37,565
I already know everything.

367
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,805
Qingchen is Chen Qingqing.

368
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,245
When did you find out?

369
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:58,125
Actually, it's been a while.

370
00:20:58,205 --> 00:20:59,805
Why didn't you tell me?

371
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:05,365
I believe you have your reasons.

372
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:07,765
Otherwise, you wouldn't want
to trouble yourself like that.

373
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:09,965
That's true.

374
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:14,845
The reason I'm here is because of my dad.

375
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17,285
You probably didn't know this.

376
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:19,325
I've never met my mom and dad
since I was little.

377
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:21,685
My grandpa was the one who raised me.

378
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,525
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:26,365
No worries.

380
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,085
After my mom passed away,

381
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:32,245
my dad disappeared.

382
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,485
That's why I disguised myself.

383
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:36,565
I came to this college
without telling my grandpa.

384
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,645
It is all because I wanted
to search for my dad.

385
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:41,485
He graduated from Ming De College too.

386
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:43,845
Have you found anything yet?

387
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,765
This was what I found recently.

388
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:48,405
Not only was my dad an honors graduate,

389
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:50,525
he was also the president
of the Student Council.

390
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,885
No wonder you've been asking me
about the Student Council.

391
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:58,485
So are you planning

392
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:00,565
to ever tell Situ Feng about this?

393
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:04,885
Actually...

394
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:07,205
I haven't thought about

395
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:08,965
how to tell him yet.

396
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:13,085
But I do realize that my lies
are slightly getting out of hand.

397
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,565
Once I have the information I needed,

398
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,685
I will leave this place.

399
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:21,645
Gu Nanxi.

400
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:25,285
Can you please help me keep this a secret?

401
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:27,925
Okay.

402
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:29,565
Qing...

403
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:32,085
Now, I'm confused over what to call you.

404
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:34,205
I can swear to you

405
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,325
that my name is real.

406
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,085
Chen Qingqing is my real name.

407
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:39,485
All right, Qingqing.

408
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:40,445
I promise you.

409
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,125
But you have to promise me this too.

410
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:46,445
If you're facing any difficulties,
you need to tell me.

411
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:47,645
Never keep it to yourself.

412
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,485
-Okay, I promise.
-Okay.

413
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,045
I was wondering about you guys.

414
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,005
Where's Chen Qingqing? Did you see her?

415
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:04,445
Well, Qingqing ate too much earlier

416
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:07,805
thus Qingchen and I think
we should let her rest.

417
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:09,925
Then I shall go look for her.

418
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:11,805
-Don't!
-Don't!

419
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:14,605
Well, she could be sleeping

420
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:17,605
so let's not disturb her.

421
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:18,685
That's right.

422
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:20,965
But Chen Qingqing...

423
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:25,045
Class President, where are you guys going?

424
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,085
It was on the news that

425
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:28,365
the meteor shower will start
around seven in the evening.

426
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:30,805
We will be able to see the meteor shower
if we go up the hill.

427
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:32,805
After that, it's the campfire party.

428
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,245
Don't let the lecturer hear us, let's go.

429
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:40,285
That sounds interesting. Let me tag along.

430
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:46,325
Feng.

431
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:50,405
Let's go watch the meteor shower.

432
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:55,445
What about Qingqing?

433
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:57,005
Don't you worry.

434
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:59,365
We should go watch the meteor shower
with Xinya.

435
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:01,125
Just as we said before,

436
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:04,125
we have to show Qingchen around Yuncheng.

437
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:05,565
You should come too.

438
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,525
Let's get going or we will miss it.

439
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:12,565
Let's go.

440
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:14,445
Fangfang, let's walk together.

441
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:19,125
Here.

442
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:21,205
It's steep here, mind your steps everyone.

443
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,325
This path seems dangerous.

444
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:33,205
Plus, there are so many girls with us.

445
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,965
I think we won't be able
to reach the peak in time.

446
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:37,925
There's no phone connection too.

447
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:40,325
For the sake of safety,
why don't we go back down?

448
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:41,805
I agree.

449
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:42,725
Yes.

450
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:43,725
Safety comes first.

451
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:47,885
It feels eerie here
and it gives me the chills.

452
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:49,085
Let's head back.

453
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,445
I agree.

454
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:52,645
Let's go then.

455
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:54,565
Okay, let's go.

456
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,445
-Feng!
-Xinya!

457
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:02,885
They fell down. What should we do?

458
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:05,525
No, I need to save them.

459
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:07,805
-Feng!
-Calm down, Xinya!

460
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:09,885
Situ Feng!

461
00:25:10,565 --> 00:25:12,085
Qingchen!

462
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:13,045
Feng!

463
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,765
It looks very steep.

464
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:17,125
Xinya, why don't you go back with the rest

465
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:18,925
and call for the rescue crew?

466
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:20,965
No! They're in danger right now.

467
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:22,765
How do you expect me
to leave them like this?

468
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:24,085
We're not leaving them.

469
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:26,525
We just need to think
of an effective strategy to save them.

470
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,685
Hua Munian, please call
for the rescue crew.

471
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:32,725
Xinya, we need the rescue team
to save them.

472
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:34,445
Hurry up!

473
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:36,925
Don't worry.

474
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:38,805
Wait for me here.

475
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,005
I'll be back very quickly.

476
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:41,565
-Hurry up!
-Hurry!

477
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:46,045
Class President, you should stay here

478
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,645
so the rescue crew will know
where to look for them.

479
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:51,325
I'll try to search for a way down.

480
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:52,805
Wait for me here.

481
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,405
Situ Feng.

482
00:26:20,485 --> 00:26:21,765
Situ Feng, what's wrong?

483
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,005
Are you injured?

484
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:28,525
How are you feeling?

485
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:30,325
It should be fine.

486
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:33,245
Let's go. Let's move over there.

487
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:37,645
Slowly.

488
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:38,605
Slowly.

489
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,085
It should be fine.

490
00:26:53,805 --> 00:26:55,765
I lost my phone. What should I do?

491
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:00,885
I lost mine too.

492
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:03,925
It's getting so dark here.

493
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:06,085
Without our cell phones...

494
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,645
What if Gu Nanxi can't find us?

495
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:11,765
What's going to happen to us...

496
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:14,365
Don't you worry.

497
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:15,405
I'm here.

498
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:22,085
Stop crying now.

499
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:24,205
It's freezing here.

500
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:27,885
Your tears will turn into ice
and it'll look really weird.

501
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:32,605
Why are you so talkative today?

502
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:36,885
Right, here.

503
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:38,685
Take it.

504
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:43,125
It'll keep you warm.

505
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,405
Gu Nanxi!

506
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:57,805
Gu Nanxi!

507
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,085
Anyone?

508
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:00,965
Hello!

509
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:03,805
Is anybody around?

510
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:11,925
Did we fall too far for them to hear us?

511
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:16,205
Probably, but I'm sure
they will come for us.

512
00:28:16,725 --> 00:28:19,005
It's cold out here.
Let's go inside and rest.

513
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:31,005
This is a good opportunity to be a hero.

514
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,165
Gu Nanxi should be here.

515
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:36,365
I didn't expect
someone as serious as yourself

516
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:38,565
would choose a time like this

517
00:28:38,765 --> 00:28:40,365
to make jokes about the situation.

518
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:51,045
Qingchen.

519
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:52,685
-Yes?
-What's wrong?

520
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:53,845
I'm not sure.

521
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:56,925
It hurts here.

522
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,365
Let me have a look.

523
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:04,565
You're injured here.

524
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:20,125
I like you.

525
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:27,605
Goodness.

526
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:29,725
What did I do?

527
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:32,045
Why am I being an idiot?

528
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:34,045
Qingchen.

529
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:37,965
When did you start liking me?

530
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,085
I'm not sure.

531
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,325
Maybe...

532
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:51,205
Maybe since the first time I met you.

533
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,645
Perhaps I've already liked you then.

534
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:58,765
I'm afraid that if I don't tell you now,

535
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:00,685
I might not have a chance later.

536
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:03,925
Qingchen.

537
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:06,525
I'm sorry.

538
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:10,885
I already have someone I like.

539
00:30:12,165 --> 00:30:13,005
Who is she?

540
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:19,205
Chen Qingqing.

541
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:30,525
Chen Qingqing is the person I like.

542
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:33,605
I'm sorry.

543
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:36,925
So...

544
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,885
When did you start to like her?

545
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:43,965
Well...

546
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:51,165
At first,

547
00:30:51,885 --> 00:30:52,765
I thought

548
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:54,485
she was rather special

549
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:56,965
even though she was troublesome at times.

550
00:30:58,325 --> 00:30:59,165
She was

551
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,245
very stubborn.

552
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:04,965
She never cares if the whole world
thinks she's wrong.

553
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:07,725
She's still going to persevere.

554
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:11,685
Whenever we spend time together,

555
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:16,485
I feel very comfortable and relaxed.

556
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,845
I can just be myself without feeling
the burden of being an idol.

557
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:21,085
Later on,

558
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:23,925
gradually, I realized that

559
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:26,645
unknowingly, I began

560
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:28,405
to take notice on everything she does.

561
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:30,965
I keep on looking for her.

562
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:35,205
Whenever she interacts with other guys,

563
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:38,365
I would feel frustrated,

564
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,365
lousy and throw a tantrum at her.

565
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:44,925
Until one day,

566
00:31:46,245 --> 00:31:47,925
I saw she was wrongly accused.

567
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:49,605
Then I knew

568
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,565
Chen Qingqing

569
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,605
is just like any other girl.

570
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:55,765
She too needs to be loved and cared for.

571
00:31:58,045 --> 00:31:59,925
From that moment,

572
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,605
I was certain

573
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:04,885
that I have fallen for her.

574
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:09,725
I have fallen deeply for her.

575
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:13,765
I want to hold her in my arms

576
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:16,645
and protect her

577
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:19,965
even if

578
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,645
the world is against me.

579
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,405
Qingchen, look!

580
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:37,925
It's the meteor shower!

581
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:44,285
If Chen Qingqing was here,

582
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:46,405
it would be perfect.

583
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:51,725
Let's make a wish.

584
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:55,365
Okay.

585
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:10,565
Qingqing, don't tell me

586
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,645
that you like Situ Feng too?

587
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:26,205
What do you think of Gu Nanxi?

588
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:27,605
Did she find out
what happened at the cave?

589
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:30,045
She seemed furious
whenever I mentioned Qingchen.

590
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,285
Where's Qingqing?

591
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:34,165
She asked me to tell you
not to go see her.

592
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:35,405
Excuse me.

593
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:36,725
Stop running, you pervert!

594
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:38,005
We need to catch this pervert!

595
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:41,125
The reason you came to this college
was because of your dad, wasn't it?

596
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:43,565
So it was all a lie.

597
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:44,965
Liar!

598
00:33:45,045 --> 00:33:47,405
If you ever need help,
you should come and look for me.

599
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:49,525
-Happy Birthday, Qingqing!
-Happy Birthday!

600
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:51,765
How did you know today was my birthday?

601
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:53,445
Baby, you should thank our president.

602
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:55,245
Thank you, Gu Nanxi.

603
00:33:56,565 --> 00:33:58,365
