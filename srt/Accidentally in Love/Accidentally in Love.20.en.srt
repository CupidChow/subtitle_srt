A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:58,205
EPISODE 20

3
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:01,605
Qingqing.

4
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:03,165
Why are you walking so fast?

5
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:04,765
Situ Feng, tell me.

6
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:08,565
You and Lan
were rolling on the ground just now.

7
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,565
What exactly were you two doing?

8
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,205
There was a wind,

9
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:14,165
-then--
-Wind? Nonsense.

10
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:18,405
What happened to your hand?

11
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:20,445
-I'm all right.
-Show me.

12
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,005
It's only a small scratch.

13
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:30,845
Hey, Qingqing.

14
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,445
Is Lan really your best friend?

15
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:35,765
Yes, why?

16
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,245
It's nothing.

17
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,685
I think that you haven't met
a lot of people yet.

18
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:41,565
You still need to learn
how to read people.

19
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,885
Don't just pour your heart out to anyone.

20
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,125
Why are you laughing?

21
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:50,485
It's nothing.

22
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:55,685
Hey, there's a scarecrow.

23
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:05,485
Hold this.

24
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:46,405
Qingqing.

25
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:48,845
You really like flying kites, don't you?

26
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:51,885
When I was young,

27
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,005
I flew a kite once with my parents.

28
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,365
That's my only memory of them.

29
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:03,245
I understand

30
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,325
how you feel.

31
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:09,885
My mom left me

32
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,525
when I was young. And my dad,

33
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,085
you've met him.

34
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,125
He's never cared about me
since I was young.

35
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:20,084
Every time we meet,

36
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,084
we'll get into a fight.

37
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,445
I've wanted to talk to you about this.

38
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,365
Perhaps your dad

39
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:32,325
is not as mean as you think.

40
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:34,485
My dad?

41
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:37,525
He thinks that I've brought disgrace
upon him by becoming a singer.

42
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:39,245
He would love to disown me.

43
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,405
That's not true.

44
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:42,045
Let me show you something.

45
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,365
Remember that last time you got sick?

46
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:47,965
I went to your house to visit you.

47
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,845
I walked into the wrong room at that time.

48
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:52,325
I accidentally went into his study.

49
00:04:58,925 --> 00:04:59,805
Situ Feng?

50
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:13,765
In fact,

51
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,685
your dad loves you more
than you can imagine.

52
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:23,045
He just doesn’t know
how to express himself.

53
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:27,605
I actually envy you.

54
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,445
I've been trying hard

55
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,165
to get used to a life

56
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:34,005
without my parents.

57
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:36,645
I've become so tough.

58
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:38,725
Even if no one likes me,

59
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:41,085
I don't care.

60
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:45,725
Sometimes I would fly a kite alone

61
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:48,445
and that's when

62
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:50,405
I would feel

63
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:53,205
that no matter how hard I try,

64
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,485
I couldn't make the kite fly.

65
00:05:58,365 --> 00:05:59,285
Then, I would think,

66
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,245
if someone

67
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,325
could stay by my side,

68
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:06,845
how nice

69
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:09,925
it would be.

70
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:19,165
Qingqing.

71
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,885
I have something to tell you.

72
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:24,485
You were the one

73
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,365
who helped me overcome my darkest moment.

74
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,765
If possible,

75
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:34,245
I hope that I could always
keep you company.

76
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:38,485
Ever since I met you,

77
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,165
I've noticed

78
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:42,245
that I've started to care more and more

79
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:46,645
about what you think.

80
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:52,845
Qingqing.

81
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,085
I...

82
00:06:57,605 --> 00:06:58,765
I like you.

83
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:05,605
Situ Feng.

84
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,845
Actually...

85
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,005
There you are.

86
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,885
Mr. Chen asked me to come
and look for you.

87
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,605
There are jackals around.

88
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,085
Hurry up and come home with me.

89
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,165
Come on.

90
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:24,645
Let's go.

91
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:42,965
-Let's walk together.
-Sure.

92
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,325
It's getting late.

93
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,005
It's time for me to go home.

94
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:49,885
Didn't you say that my grandpa asked you--

95
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:52,965
Actually, I wasn't only doing
Mr. Chen a favor.

96
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:54,725
As your best friend,

97
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:56,725
I also wanted to check him out for you.

98
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:59,205
I wanted to make sure
that he is compatible with you.

99
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:05,605
When we were hanging the bed sheets...

100
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:11,245
Let's go downtown tomorrow.

101
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:14,245
It's far more interesting
than this small village.

102
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:15,645
Sure.

103
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,405
We can ask Qingqing to come with us.

104
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,965
You're a city boy.

105
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,645
Don't you find the life here
really boring and intolerable?

106
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:24,405
Not at all.

107
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:27,045
I wanted to see the place
where Qingqing grew up.

108
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:29,045
I think that

109
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:30,845
this is a really good place.

110
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,164
You can't stop talking about Qingqing.

111
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,725
I don't think that you two
are just classmates.

112
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:39,725
You obviously care about her.

113
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:41,804
That's right.

114
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,405
We have been through a lot together.

115
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:49,164
To me, she's not just
an ordinary classmate.

116
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,965
Actually, an outstanding guy like you

117
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:59,685
shouldn't be hanging out
with an ugly and poor girl.

118
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:03,325
Why don't you consider me?

119
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,565
Hey!

120
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,405
Although Chen Qingqing
doesn't have great looks,

121
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,925
in my opinion, she's a great girl.

122
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,805
I won't let you badmouth her.

123
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:16,765
We outsiders probably worried too much.

124
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:18,205
You have good taste in men.

125
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:21,805
Let's go.

126
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:23,445
Let's go.

127
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:34,405
Grandpa.

128
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,325
It's inappropriate
for a young man and a young lady

129
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:39,565
to wander around in the mountains.

130
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,805
He's going to spend the night here.

131
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,845
Hurry up and tidy his room.

132
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:47,165
There's no electricity here.

133
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:48,885
You won't be able to see anything later.

134
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:50,045
Mr. Chen.

135
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:51,645
There's no electricity?

136
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:54,805
Grandpa.

137
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:56,325
This is unbelievable.

138
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:57,725
Are you not providing electricity?

139
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,685
We're living in a village.

140
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,245
That's how impoverished this place is.

141
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:04,085
Mr. Chen, that's not what I meant.

142
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:06,605
I will help Qingqing out.

143
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,245
Why don't we

144
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:26,605
-sit here?
-Sure.

145
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:30,405
Here.

146
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,605
Situ Feng has done so much for me,

147
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,485
yet I've been lying
to him this whole time.

148
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:00,525
Qingqing.

149
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:03,565
-Yes?
-How do you feel

150
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:05,525
about what happened

151
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,085
this morning?

152
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:14,965
Situ Feng.

153
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,245
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

154
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,645
I will give you an answer later.

155
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:36,165
Look.

156
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,205
The stars tonight are so pretty.

157
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:41,565
Yes, they are.

158
00:11:58,965 --> 00:11:59,805
Situ Feng.

159
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,045
What are you doing?

160
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,525
I'm trying to fix the wires.

161
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:03,925
You know how to do that?

162
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,365
Yes.

163
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:11,725
-The electricity is back on.
-Yes.

164
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:13,485
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

165
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:15,245
-I need to tell you something.
-What is it?

166
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:17,525
I...

167
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:20,085
I have to leave.

168
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:21,445
Right now?

169
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,245
I'm going to release my new album soon.

170
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,685
My agency has arranged for me
to get some training in Korea.

171
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,205
Daniel has already left.

172
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:28,725
I will meet them there.

173
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,685
Let me take you to the airport.

174
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:35,525
You don't have to.

175
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:39,405
Stay with your grandpa.
I'm going to go now.

176
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,445
Be careful on the road.

177
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:44,685
Qingqing.

178
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:47,485
I really had a good time
these past two days.

179
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:51,445
I'm going to go now.

180
00:12:57,325 --> 00:12:58,165
Qingqing.

181
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:00,045
See you later.

182
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:02,525
Travel safely.

183
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:07,445
Remember to give me a call.

184
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:16,885
Go inside. It's cold out here.

185
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,045
Grandpa, you're awake.

186
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:38,845
The light?

187
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:40,725
Situ Feng fixed it.

188
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,525
Where is he?

189
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:46,605
He just left.

190
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,605
Why didn't he tell me?

191
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:51,085
He didn't want to disturb your sleep.

192
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:52,685
He's quite thoughtful.

193
00:13:57,645 --> 00:13:58,605
Grandpa.

194
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:05,525
I want to tell Situ Feng the truth.

195
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,765
If you think it's worth it,

196
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,565
you can make your own decision.

197
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:19,125
You'll be the one who will bear
the consequences anyway.

198
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:25,365
KOREA

199
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:34,965
Chen Qingqing.

200
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:38,445
When are you going to call me?

201
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:45,805
Hello, Qingqing?

202
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,725
Hello?

203
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:48,845
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:52,085
I'm going back to campus tomorrow,
so I was packing my luggage.

205
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:55,045
My grandpa forced me
to bring a lot of things.

206
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,885
Are you going to bed now?

207
00:14:58,485 --> 00:14:59,965
It's still early.

208
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,485
I can talk to you for a while.

209
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:04,205
Qingqing, let's do a video call.

210
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,285
No!

211
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,365
I mean,

212
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:12,045
there was a power cut.

213
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,005
You know, the power went out.
It's really dark.

214
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:16,365
You won't be able to see anything.

215
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,125
Fine.

216
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,325
You were training all day.

217
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:23,365
Was it tiring? Were you exhausted?

218
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,405
It was all right.

219
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:29,925
It wasn't really tiring.

220
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:31,765
I had nothing to do just now.

221
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:32,805
So...

222
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:35,125
So I kind of missed you.

223
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:41,445
Hey.

224
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:42,765
Situ Feng.

225
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:44,685
Stand by the window.

226
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,165
The window?

227
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:49,645
Hey, Qingqing.
Don't tell me that you came to Korea?

228
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:50,725
Situ Feng.

229
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,805
You haven't removed
your makeup yet, have you?

230
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,085
That's right. I haven't.

231
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:58,005
Qingqing, where are you?

232
00:15:58,205 --> 00:15:59,845
Are you really in Korea? I don't see you.

233
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,685
Did the liquid foundation
get into your brain?

234
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:03,085
Haven't you cleansed your brain?

235
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:06,005
I don't have the money to go there.

236
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:08,005
Are you really not here?

237
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,085
I'm really not.

238
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:15,525
Situ Feng.

239
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:16,965
Look outside the window.

240
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:20,965
The moon is so round today.

241
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:22,845
It's indeed very round.

242
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,325
What should I do?

243
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,405
I'm really

244
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:32,685
not sleepy at all right now.

245
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,165
How about this?

246
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,325
I will sing you a song.

247
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:39,285
Which song?

248
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:41,565
The title track of my new album.

249
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:44,325
-Am I the first listener?
-That's right.

250
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:46,925
You've just got a Super VIP pass.

251
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:47,965
Hey, Situ Feng.

252
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:48,885
Hold on.

253
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:52,125
This is such an important song.
I need to prepare something.

254
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:54,245
Prepare what?

255
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,965
Change the frequency to 72.5MHz.

256
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:58,605
Change the frequency to 72.5MHz.

257
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:02,885
You're currently listening
to Ming De College Campus Radio.

258
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:06,244
Idol singer, Situ Feng, is bringing you

259
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,964
the title track of his newest album.

260
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:10,324
The name of the song...

261
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,444
It's a secret.

262
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:13,565
I'm going to sing now.

263
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:20,525
Wounds are smoothened by memories

264
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:23,165
Thank you for being here

265
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:27,565
There are too many memories

266
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:31,885
Our worlds begin to cross path

267
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:36,965
You exist in my past

268
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:39,765
Like a novel

269
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:44,085
The stories are hidden under a tree

270
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,965
Quietly waiting for you to pass by

271
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:51,365
Waiting for you to pass by

272
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:55,845
This song is great.

273
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:58,525
I'm certain that this song
will be really popular.

274
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:03,605
What should I do?

275
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:06,125
It's even harder for me to sleep now

276
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,765
after hearing this song.

277
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:10,325
How about I sing you another song?

278
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,365
Sure.

279
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:12,965
Do you have another song?

280
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:15,285
What should I sing?

281
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,365
Hey, Qingqing?

282
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:21,965
Qingqing?

283
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,125
Good night.

284
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:43,165
Chen Qingqing.

285
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,285
I'm not around. Who are you going
to see a movie with?

286
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:46,285
How did you know?

287
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:48,805
I've planted an informer around you.

288
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:50,725
It's Gu Nanxi, right?

289
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:52,245
Don't change the topic.

290
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,765
Tell me. Who's going with you?

291
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,005
Fangfang doesn't have to work today,

292
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:57,845
so we decided to go watch a movie.

293
00:18:58,005 --> 00:18:58,925
All right.

294
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,645
Go to the movies with me when I come back.

295
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:01,725
I pity myself.

296
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,405
I've only watched a few movies this year.

297
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,205
Chen Qingqing.

298
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:13,925
Welcome back.

299
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:15,045
Come on.

300
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,725
I've arranged a celebration for you.

301
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:17,965
Let's go eat together.

302
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,485
Thank you, Lin Yiyang.

303
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:21,765
I'm going to the movies with Fangfang.

304
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:23,445
I'm busy.

305
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,845
Aren't you going to eat?

306
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:26,285
Let's eat together.

307
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:28,805
I'm not hungry. I don't want to eat.

308
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:31,525
-Qingqing.
-Fangfang.

309
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,565
I'm so hungry. Let's go eat.

310
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:37,565
Perfect.

311
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,685
I've reserved a table
at the restaurant across the street.

312
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,045
Let's go eat together.

313
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,125
It's a free meal.

314
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,125
Let's go eat.

315
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,125
Feel free to order anything.

316
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:01,405
You don't have to be modest.

317
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:04,245
Chen Qingqing.

318
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:08,925
I think you look prettier
after you came back from your hometown.

319
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:17,085
What's gotten into Lin Yiyang?

320
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:18,765
He just complimented me.

321
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,765
Did you hear that? Pretty?

322
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:31,085
Well,

323
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:33,765
I think I will go to the bathroom first.

324
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:37,405
I know this place well.

325
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:38,845
Let me take you there.

326
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:40,365
I can go there on my own.

327
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:42,125
I need to go to the bathroom too.

328
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:52,645
Chen Qingqing.

329
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:54,765
I want to talk to you alone.

330
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:56,925
There's nothing
that we need to discuss alone.

331
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,245
Fangfang is waiting for me.

332
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,205
Qingchen.

333
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:02,405
Or

334
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:04,485
should I call you

335
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:07,645
the granddaughter of Chen Xiaotian,
the wealthiest man in Jincheng?

336
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:09,285
Chen Qingqing.

337
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:10,565
Did you investigate me?

338
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,125
Chen Qingqing.

339
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,205
You blew your cover by going home.

340
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:20,525
No.

341
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,325
Actually, your background

342
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:25,765
simply catches people's attention.

343
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:28,405
But don't worry.

344
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:30,005
I'm not interested in you.

345
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,045
One more thing.

346
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:34,565
Stay away from Situ Feng.

347
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,805
What does this have to do with Situ Feng?

348
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:38,725
I know.

349
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:40,285
You two are close.

350
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:42,205
But have you ever thought about it?

351
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,845
If Situ Feng finds out

352
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:46,925
that you've been lying to him,

353
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:48,485
what will happen?

354
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:52,885
If the press and Situ Feng's fans find out

355
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,565
that he has been lying to them,

356
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,445
what's going to happen?

357
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,885
"A liar who has fooled his fans."
This kind of negative coverage

358
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:04,245
will ruin his reputation.

359
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:07,365
Lin Yiyang, you're distorting the truth.

360
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:08,805
No one will believe you.

361
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,765
I can make up any scandals.

362
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,205
By the way,

363
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:15,445
Situ Feng is about

364
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:16,805
to release his new album.

365
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:21,005
Imagine how his reputation

366
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:23,645
could be destroyed by you.

367
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:26,285
Why are you doing this to Situ Feng?

368
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,965
Because he doesn't deserve love.

369
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:30,285
Is this because of Lan Xinyu?

370
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,965
It happened a long time ago.

371
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:36,885
-Lin Yiyang, why can't you let it go?
-Chen Qingqing.

372
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:39,805
You don't understand.

373
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:45,485
Anyway, Situ Feng's career
is in your hands.

374
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:47,685
It's up to you.

375
00:22:49,445 --> 00:22:50,765
Let's go.

376
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,565
Qingqing, what took you two so long?

377
00:22:58,805 --> 00:22:59,965
They've served all the dishes.

378
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:04,005
Go ahead and eat.

379
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,365
What happened just now,

380
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:07,845
you know I didn't do it on purpose.

381
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:09,085
I hope

382
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,085
that we could get along peacefully

383
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:12,645
from now on.

384
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:18,605
Welcome back, Chen Qingqing.

385
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,405
Is the movie over?
Can you talk on the phone now?

386
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:05,565
Qingqing, why don't you answer it?

387
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:07,165
It's just a crank call.

388
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,325
Hello, Gu Nanxi?

389
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:15,725
Qingqing is right next to me.

390
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:16,885
I'm not here.

391
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:21,485
She has fallen asleep.
Should I wake her up?

392
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:26,405
All right, bye.

393
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:33,485
Situ Feng must've made Gu Nanxi call you
in order to talk to me.

394
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:37,125
What happened between you two?

395
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,605
We had a small fight.

396
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,165
It's not a big deal.

397
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:46,845
You've worked hard.

398
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,005
Go home and get some rest.

399
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:50,445
We'll soon start promoting your new album.

400
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,125
Daniel, take me back to school.

401
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:53,445
There's something I need to do.

402
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,885
What do you want to do there?

403
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:56,485
Go home and rest first.

404
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:58,165
Go back to school first.

405
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,205
All right. I'll listen to you.

406
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,205
Back to school.

407
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:03,565
Come on. Let's go.

408
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:13,125
Talk to him.
I'll go back to the dorm first.

409
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:25,965
When did you come back?

410
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:27,965
I came here straight from the airport.

411
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:29,765
You must be exhausted
from all the training.

412
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,205
Why didn't you go home and rest?

413
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:32,725
Because...

414
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:36,605
I miss you.

415
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,205
Qingqing.

416
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:45,205
I've been standing here for too long.

417
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,125
My legs are numb.

418
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:48,725
Can you give me a hand?

419
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:50,365
Sure.

420
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:51,485
Give it to me.

421
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:53,165
No.

422
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:55,525
You're so stupid.

423
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:01,765
Qingqing.

424
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:03,845
Why didn't you answer my calls?

425
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:08,765
My battery ran out.

426
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:10,885
I see.

427
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:20,645
Qingqing.

428
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:27,165
Have you eaten yet?

429
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:31,205
Is there something
that you want to ask me?

430
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:33,205
Go ahead and ask.

431
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:38,645
I have a feeling that you're avoiding me.

432
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:41,285
Why is that?

433
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:49,765
Do you remember

434
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,085
when you were at my place,

435
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:55,205
I promised to give you an answer?

436
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:57,285
I remember.

437
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:03,525
When I came back,

438
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:07,285
I thought hard about it.

439
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:12,485
So...

440
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:15,525
I have the answer now.

441
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:20,365
Do you want to hear it?

442
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:22,725
Yes.

443
00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:28,085
I think...

444
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:34,205
I think

445
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,765
it's better for us to stay as classmates.

446
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:40,605
As normal friends.

447
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:57,325
Are you sure about this?

448
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:02,645
Don't you like me at all?

449
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:05,965
Yes.

450
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:08,445
I'm sure about it.

451
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:12,845
I don't like you at all.

452
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,085
Oh, right. I still have work to do.

453
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:18,445
I have to go back.

454
00:28:50,005 --> 00:28:52,005
Qingqing, Situ Feng is in trouble.

455
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:53,165
What happened?

456
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:58,885
IDOL SINGER, SITU FENG,
IS ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING.

457
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:00,885
How did this happen?

458
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,165
Situ Feng released his new album today.

459
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:04,405
Many people soon discovered

460
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:07,285
that this song is very similar
to another original song on the internet.

461
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:08,925
Although I don't know much about music,

462
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:12,045
a lot of musicians have pointed out
that there's a possibility of plagiarism.

463
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,965
After all, that song
was released two weeks ago.

464
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,925
Therefore,
the press is talking about this matter.

465
00:29:20,645 --> 00:29:24,765
Wounds are smoothened by memories

466
00:29:24,845 --> 00:29:27,405
Thank you for being here

467
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:31,485
There are too many memories

468
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:36,005
Our worlds begin to cross path

469
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,165
Where is Situ Feng right now?

470
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,445
Does he know about this?

471
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:40,445
I've just asked him.

472
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:42,805
He's at the agency.
He probably has heard of it.

473
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,205
Gu Nanxi, there's something I need to do.
I have to go back to my dorm.

474
00:29:57,085 --> 00:29:59,445
There's no way to prevent a thief
who lives under your roof.

475
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:00,765
Did I give you my permission?

476
00:30:03,045 --> 00:30:04,205
Lin Yiyang.

477
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:06,805
I knew you were the one who did it.

478
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:09,525
There's no evidence to prove
that we stole the music sheet.

479
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:11,885
I'm going to do everything
to make him miserable.

480
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:13,485
Stop me if you can.

481
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:14,925
Quit now.

482
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:18,285
Quit? What's in your head?

483
00:30:18,365 --> 00:30:20,765
I didn't know Situ Feng
was this kind of person.

484
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:23,645
I've recorded what you said.

485
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:27,925
Situ Feng's reputation will be ruined.

486
00:30:29,805 --> 00:30:31,645
