A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,765
EPISODE 24

3
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:09,044
Are you Hebiancao?

4
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,525
Why are you wearing...

5
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:18,805
I'm His Highness's fan.

6
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,245
I'm afraid that I'll lose my composure
when I see His Highness.

7
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,565
His Highness might get frightened
by my facial expressions.

8
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,765
Therefore, I'm wearing a mask.
Is that okay?

9
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,605
-Sure.
-Okay.

10
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:31,725
As long as you're happy.

11
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:32,965
Thank you.

12
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:34,645
Have a seat.

13
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:35,685
Okay.

14
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:40,405
Slightly to your right.

15
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:47,805
Well...

16
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:49,485
Nice to meet you.

17
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:51,085
It's my pleasure to work with you.

18
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,525
Your Highness.

19
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:12,525
I'm your die-hard fan.

20
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,205
Your Highness.

21
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:17,165
Your skin is so white and smooth.

22
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:18,845
Your figure

23
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:20,965
is excellent.

24
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:23,485
You don't have any fat all.

25
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,165
-Calm down.
-How do you maintain your figure?

26
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,725
Please calm down, all right?

27
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,005
I'm sorry for losing my cool.

28
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:33,645
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:35,165
Please sit over there.

30
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,485
Over there.

31
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,165
Okay.

32
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,525
His Highness's manager, Daniel,
is still dealing with other things.

33
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,565
Please wait here for a while.

34
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,925
He'll be right here

35
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:55,245
to explain to you
the detail of this collaboration.

36
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:57,845
Okay.

37
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:10,565
Are you really Hebiancao?

38
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:11,605
That's right.

39
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,045
By the way,

40
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:15,325
I've brought some of my manuscripts.

41
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,685
You can take a look.

42
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,245
Chen Qingqing, what are you doing here?

43
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:37,285
Where's the cartoonist?
I thought she has already arrived.

44
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:41,965
I'm Hebiancao.

45
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,245
Hebiancao?

46
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:46,965
Are you Hebiancao?

47
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,085
The press is going
to have a good story to write.

48
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:53,365
His Highness's number one fan
turns out to be his personal assistant.

49
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,445
Sit down.

50
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:59,565
Qingqing, you should've told us.

51
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:02,765
This is a long story.

52
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,445
Qingqing Hebiancao.

53
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:07,125
I understand the meaning now.

54
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:09,165
Was it fun to make a fool out of me?

55
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,205
I didn't do it on purpose.

56
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:12,885
Since she's one of us--

57
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:15,885
If I didn't blow your cover,
you would've kept that mask on, right?

58
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,925
Situ Feng, I wanted to tell you the truth.

59
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,125
But so many things have happened lately.
I didn't have the chance.

60
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:25,205
What's the truth? Like how many
secret identities have you got?

61
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,525
I'll explain everything to you
if you give me a chance.

62
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:29,485
Explain everything?
Can you explain everything?

63
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:32,005
Situ Feng, can you drop that attitude?

64
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:34,085
If you were me,
would you not react the same way?

65
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,245
Is this necessary? It was just BL comics.

66
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:38,565
Can you two listen to me?

67
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:39,725
-No!
-No!

68
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:43,605
There's a press conference this afternoon.
Are you two still working together?

69
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:44,725
-Yes!
-Yes!

70
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,605
Daniel, make sure
that you pay every dime owed

71
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,285
for her works.

72
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,605
Unlike someone, I don't scam people.

73
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:56,205
Daniel, I won't accept a penny from you.

74
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:57,525
Please donate the money.

75
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,045
Unlike someone,

76
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,445
I'm a considerate person.

77
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,885
Why are they acting like enemies?

78
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,805
SITU FENG, CHEN QINGQING

79
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:13,365
Hello.

80
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:16,045
Are you collaborating with a fan
for your new album

81
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,165
to thank your fans
for their constant support?

82
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:20,125
Regardless of this collaboration,

83
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:23,325
I'm always thankful for the support
and trust that my fans have given me.

84
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:27,205
We're collaborating with Hebiancao,
mainly because the style of her drawing

85
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:30,725
fits the concept
of my new album, Break Through.

86
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:33,845
Hebiancao, why do I feel
like I've seen you before?

87
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,085
That's right. You used
to be Situ Feng's assistant, right?

88
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,165
Yes.

89
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:39,925
I used to be His Highness's assistant,

90
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:43,005
but I'm also his number one fan.

91
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:44,565
As your closest staff member,

92
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:45,685
Situ Feng, did you know

93
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:47,605
that you were the character of her comic?

94
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,245
I just recently found out.

95
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:51,685
I was very angry.

96
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:56,765
That was a joke.

97
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:58,885
I was worried
that they'd get into a fight.

98
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,805
Luckily, they're putting the interests
of the album above everything else.

99
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,525
Fangfang,

100
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:14,765
your happiness is in your own hands.

101
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:17,765
You have to work hard
to seize your own happiness.

102
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,525
That's right. I have to be confident.
I shouldn't look down on myself.

103
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:43,205
Excuse me. Where can I find this book?

104
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:44,645
It was still here yesterday.

105
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,285
Hold on. Let me take a look.

106
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:50,285
Is this the book?

107
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,885
Someone borrowed the English version.

108
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,365
Do you want the Chinese version?

109
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:56,605
-Okay. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

110
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,845
Why is this book so popular lately?

111
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,245
Everyone wants to borrow it.

112
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:02,765
Really?

113
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:06,885
Excuse me.

114
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,845
Can you call Lin Yiyang for me?

115
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:10,045
Hold on.

116
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:13,285
Lin Yiyang isn't here yet.

117
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:14,885
All right.

118
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:19,805
Fangfang.

119
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,845
Are you looking for our boss?

120
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:23,325
Are you an idiot?

121
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:26,245
Ever since our boss decided to study hard,

122
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,725
his attractiveness
has increased drastically.

123
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:32,765
So many ignorant girls have come
to confess their feelings to him.

124
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:38,645
Dalei, are we going
to have a sister-in-law soon?

125
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:40,725
He's our boss.

126
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:44,005
Do you think anyone can be his girlfriend?

127
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:45,485
Fangfang.

128
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,125
We're friends after all.

129
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:49,245
Right?

130
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,565
Why did you jump on the bandwagon?

131
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:52,645
You're so silly.

132
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:54,965
I didn't.

133
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:01,445
What's the matter?

134
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:03,045
It's nothing.

135
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:10,685
Pricks.

136
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,365
Why did you say to her?

137
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:14,965
How dare you make fun of my friend?

138
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:16,965
Stop laughing.

139
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:00,685
Stop crying.

140
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:07,445
Lin Yiyang.

141
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:11,045
I really don't know what to do.

142
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,925
I know that we're from different worlds.

143
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:19,245
What are you talking about?

144
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,085
Aren't we friends?

145
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,165
We're friends.

146
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:32,565
Whoever

147
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:34,685
upsets you from now on

148
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,085
upsets me, Lin Yiyang.

149
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:38,645
Do you hear me?

150
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:42,765
All right. Stop crying.

151
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:52,245
Where is my book?

152
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:58,445
Is it this one?

153
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:01,485
Mine is in Chinese.

154
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:04,805
It should be this one then.

155
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,725
It was you who borrowed this book.

156
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,725
Why did you ask me
what book I was reading then?

157
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,365
What are you reading?

158
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,285
If you're able to score well
for your exams

159
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:24,965
and make it into the top 100,

160
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,445
I will tell you.

161
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,565
I didn't know

162
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,965
that you would read such cheesy poems.

163
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,605
It gave me goosebumps.

164
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,565
Come on. It's really romantic.

165
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:01,925
Everyone has shown
a big improvement in this exam.

166
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:07,125
Especially Situ Feng.
You've improved your math grades.

167
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:08,045
Congratulations.

168
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:12,325
Situ Feng.

169
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:14,885
You should thank your classmate,
Chen Qingqing,

170
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:16,965
for taking the time to tutor you.

171
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:18,045
Chen Qingqing.

172
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:21,285
Thank you so much
for what you've done for me.

173
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:23,885
There's no need to thank me.

174
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:26,365
I was glad to help.

175
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,525
All right, everyone.

176
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:32,365
Go wild and crazy during your long break.

177
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:33,645
You're officially on vacation.

178
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:51,205
Qingqing.

179
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:52,605
Why aren't you eating?

180
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,565
I'm not hungry.

181
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,965
Qingqing, it's the holidays.

182
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,445
Why do you look so down?

183
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:07,765
You don't have any appetite
and look lethargic.

184
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:10,445
People might think
that you're going through a breakup.

185
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:13,645
I'm afraid that it's over

186
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:15,885
before it even began.

187
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:17,285
Is the guy

188
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:19,125
our classmate?

189
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:20,365
Hey, Xiaoyi.

190
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:22,645
Look at Qingqing's condition. Stop prying.

191
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:24,005
So, is he our classmate?

192
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,565
Gosh, it's nothing.
I'm having a bad year, that's all.

193
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:29,045
Nothing is going my way.

194
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:30,325
How about this?

195
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:32,765
Why don't you put the school legend
to the test?

196
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,125
-What legend?
-What legend?

197
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,245
Do you know there's a clock tower
in our college?

198
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:38,565
Legend has it that if you enter
the clock tower

199
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:40,845
and express your regrets sincerely,

200
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:44,325
it would turn anti-clockwise
if the clock is touched by your sincerity.

201
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:46,525
You'll be able to return to the past.

202
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:47,765
Why don't you give it a try?

203
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,085
You have nothing to lose anyway.

204
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:50,685
The clock tower is spooky.

205
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,485
Usually, there's no one there.

206
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:53,925
Aren't you scared, Qingqing?

207
00:13:58,565 --> 00:13:59,525
I've made up my mind.

208
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:01,925
I'm going to do it now.

209
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:03,685
Please clear the table for me.

210
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:05,965
Go, Qingqing.

211
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:32,845
Xinyu taught us how to play this song.

212
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:36,765
Xinyu said it was the perfect song to play

213
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,405
when we start to fight.

214
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:45,525
And surprisingly, we would calm down
every time we heard this song.

215
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:48,485
Xinyu was amazing.

216
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:54,245
I still remember that Yiyang
and you used to fight over her.

217
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:57,045
Actually, I really liked Xinyu too.

218
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,365
I don't know why.

219
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:06,085
I swore to you that we'd never
fall for the same girl.

220
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:10,725
But people always contradict themselves

221
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:14,765
and often say things that they don't mean.

222
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:19,525
If I could go back in time,

223
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:21,685
I think,

224
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,565
I would still make the same decision.

225
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,845
Some things are destined to be.

226
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,565
My best friend and I,

227
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:37,205
fell for the same girl

228
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:38,845
twice.

229
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:43,125
I didn't have much choice in life.

230
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:45,845
Therefore, I panicked every time I ran

231
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,565
into a multiple choice.

232
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:53,125
In the end, I narrowed down
the answers to just one.

233
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:07,485
Gu Nanxi.

234
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:08,925
Sometimes,

235
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,725
I'd rather fight it out with you

236
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,565
than listen to your confession.

237
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:16,325
It truly wears me out.

238
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,845
But I've finally understood this time.

239
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:24,645
So what's your decision?

240
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:27,245
You'll find out soon.

241
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:04,285
Nice to meet you.

242
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:12,885
My name is Chen Qingqing.

243
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:14,324
Rumor has it

244
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:18,165
that you can reverse time.

245
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:19,285
Is that true?

246
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:23,084
If you could take me back in time,

247
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:27,525
take me back to the day
I ran away from my wedding.

248
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:29,604
I wish I had never come to Yuncheng.

249
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:32,604
I wish I had never met him.

250
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:34,245
No.

251
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:36,685
That one doesn't count.

252
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:39,885
Take me back to the day
when he confessed his feelings to me.

253
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:43,525
I should've come clean at that time.

254
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:46,725
If I had,

255
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:50,165
he would have gotten mad at me.

256
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:55,685
Then, all the good memories
of that night wouldn't have existed.

257
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:06,325
Oh, dear clock.

258
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,285
Can you tell me?

259
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,245
If I could really go back in time,

260
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:17,765
I don't know which day I should choose.

261
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,645
You're the only one who can decide.

262
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:30,645
This is crazy.

263
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,085
You can talk?

264
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:34,205
You're the crazy one.

265
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,645
I'm going to reverse time.

266
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,365
I'm going to take you back to Jincheng.

267
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:40,885
And make your grandpa lock you up forever.

268
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:51,765
Chen Qingqing.

269
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:53,285
Chen Qingqing.

270
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:00,245
Situ Feng.

271
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:01,285
Are you crazy?

272
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:02,685
Chen Qingqing.

273
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,565
Did you actually believe
in this stupid legend?

274
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,405
What's gotten into you?

275
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:10,965
And you even made
such a sappy love confession.

276
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,245
Why are you here?

277
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:14,445
Did you come here
to turn back the time too?

278
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,605
Time will only reverse

279
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:19,725
at 3:10 p.m.

280
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,685
You can only make your wish at that time.

281
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:25,525
The clock will then decide
whether or not to grant your wish.

282
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,845
Please, can't you transfer students,

283
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:31,325
at least get your facts straight?

284
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:33,805
Or else, it's useless.

285
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:39,045
You're making up all these stories
and ridiculous lies,

286
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,205
I think that you're the idiot here.

287
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,285
We're both are.

288
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:46,685
Perhaps, we're both idiots.

289
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:49,925
Chen Qingqing.

290
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,445
I was mad

291
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:56,285
because the person
who went through everything with me

292
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:58,605
was Chen Qingqing whom I came to know.

293
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:03,045
Everything that has happened to us
was so real.

294
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:05,925
I want to cherish

295
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:07,485
every second,

296
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:10,245
every minute of it.

297
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:12,365
I thought

298
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,285
that Chen Qingqing

299
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:17,605
was merely a disguise.

300
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,365
But ever since I met you,

301
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:23,005
I've started to feel confused

302
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,485
about the real me.

303
00:20:26,445 --> 00:20:29,565
Gu Nanxi taught me how to simplify
a multiple choice question.

304
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,245
Whether you're Chen Qingqing,

305
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,565
Qingchen,

306
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:37,445
or Hebiancao,

307
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:39,085
I don't care.

308
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:41,725
I just like you.

309
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:21,645
Hello?

310
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:23,645
Qingqing.

311
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:24,925
I'm home.

312
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:25,925
That was fast.

313
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:31,685
So...

314
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,125
Are we

315
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:36,325
a couple now?

316
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,045
Yes.

317
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:43,125
You're my girlfriend.

318
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:46,365
-I'm your boyfriend.
-Hey!

319
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,285
By the way, Situ Feng.

320
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:52,085
Our relationship

321
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:55,165
shouldn't be made public for now.

322
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,445
Although it's our personal business
to date each other,

323
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:04,525
I'm afraid of affecting your career.

324
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:07,845
I will think of what to do.

325
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:11,045
You'll be affected for sure
if it's made public.

326
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:14,285
But at least,
we have to let the people around us know.

327
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,965
Qingqing, I have to answer a call.

328
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:20,605
-Give me a second.
-Okay.

329
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:23,405
Hello, Lanting.

330
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:24,645
Hello, Feng.

331
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:25,885
Are you back in town?

332
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:26,845
I'm on a vacation.

333
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:28,685
Let's catch up if you have time.

334
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:30,525
I was waiting for you to say that.

335
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:32,565
How about this weekend?

336
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:34,325
Let's also invite Xinya,

337
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:36,125
Yiyang and Nanxi.

338
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,885
Let's have a party on the beach.

339
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,925
Don't tell me that you're not available.

340
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:41,405
No.

341
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:44,085
If you say so, I'll be there.

342
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:47,125
All right. I have to hang up now.
I'll see you this weekend.

343
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,045
Bye.

344
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:52,645
-Qingqing.
-Hello?

345
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,045
I've got an idea.

346
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:55,685
What's that?

347
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,845
Come somewhere with me this weekend.

348
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:58,765
Okay.

349
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:05,045
How did it go, Lanting?

350
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:07,045
Feng agreed to it, didn't he?

351
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,085
Don't worry. I've got it.

352
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:12,445
I will make Situ Feng listen to me
during this trip.

353
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:15,445
Lanting, I'm counting on you.

354
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:35,485
Take a look.

355
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:39,605
I've gone through every project
that we'll be collaborating.

356
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:43,645
I've purposely brought
all my newest manuscripts.

357
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:45,485
This one is for the album cover.

358
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:48,485
I can also sell you the copyright
of the cute version.

359
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:51,285
Here are the manuscripts. Take a look.

360
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:55,085
Qingqing, you're so talented.

361
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:57,845
I'm going to show them to my colleagues
in the Planning Department

362
00:23:58,365 --> 00:23:59,645
and also bring you the contract.

363
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,165
-Thank you, Daniel.
-You're welcome.

364
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:06,725
Hey.

365
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:09,645
You're using me to earn money again.

366
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:13,085
What's wrong?
Do you have a problem with that?

367
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:14,605
No, I don't.

368
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:17,085
Ask me for more if you don't earn enough.

369
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:22,165
Hey.

370
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:24,645
I'm not happy with one of the pictures.

371
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:26,365
Which one?

372
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:27,645
This one.

373
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,085
-This?
-Yes.

374
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:30,965
There's only the male lead

375
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:33,605
in this picture.

376
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:35,285
Where's the female lead?

377
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,085
Here. Give it to me.

378
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:43,245
Done.

379
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:46,605
What is that? It's a stick figure.

380
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,165
You're talented in drawing,

381
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:52,405
but I'm quite creative too.

382
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:55,885
I'll show you my creativity.

383
00:24:59,285 --> 00:25:02,245
I designed everything in this box.

384
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:03,445
Look.

385
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:07,085
The most popular box

386
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,085
out of the six boxes

387
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:10,245
is this one.

388
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:13,565
Situ Feng with a naked butt.

389
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,925
Chen Qingqing, you...

390
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:19,285
Come here.

391
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:24,325
Oh, my God. What are you two doing
in the office?

392
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:25,845
I can't look at you two.

393
00:25:26,085 --> 00:25:27,165
Situ Feng, you are really...

394
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:29,125
Damn.

395
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:31,245
Daniel.

396
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:32,365
Have you prepared the car?

397
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:33,925
Of course.

398
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:37,525
You will have to work nonstop for a year
after you release your new album.

399
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:40,605
I went to great lengths
to make the boss arrange a car for you.

400
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,685
You must be careful during the trip.

401
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:44,205
Make sure you put on sunscreen.

402
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:46,365
And don't let the press
take pictures of you...

403
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:48,365
Stop doing this.

404
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:50,765
The news of His Highness

405
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:52,725
and Hebiancao's collaboration
has been released.

406
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:54,765
-Take a look.
-What?

407
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:02,885
Isn't she His Highness's assistant?

408
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:05,325
The news has gone viral on the forums.

409
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:07,125
The fan who has been supporting

410
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:09,565
His Highness all this time

411
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:11,445
was His Highness's little assistant.

412
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:13,485
Isn't this inspiring?

413
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:15,765
A little fan, who managed
to become her idol's assistant,

414
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:18,645
anonymously promoted
her idol's career on the fan page.

415
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:20,205
And eventually, on her own efforts,

416
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:22,245
she got to perform
on the same stage with her idol.

417
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:25,285
She's the winner of everything
that a fangirl dreams of becoming.

418
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,485
I admire her so much.

419
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,365
I'm so looking forward
to His Highness's new album.

420
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:32,365
Me too.

421
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,965
This is the first time
we're going on a trip together.

422
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:44,965
-What are you doing here?
-Why? Am I not welcome here?

423
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:46,285
Let's play something.

424
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:47,525
How about dodgeball?

425
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,685
We'll have a good time with her later.

426
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:52,965
Hey!

427
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:58,085
There's something
that I don't want to hide anymore.

428
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:59,525
I hope all of you would understand.

429
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:01,645
Especially Xinya.

430
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,085
Situ Feng, hurry, go check on Xinya.

431
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:05,885
Xinya!

432
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:08,765
Chen Qingqing, don't cause more trouble.

433
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:11,205
If you weren't here,
things wouldn't have been like this.

434
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:14,565
