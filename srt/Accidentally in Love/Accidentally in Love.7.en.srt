00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:35,765
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:58,485
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:04,245
When breathing hurts without you

4
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:08,285
It's such a great song!

5
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:10,285
With more than a million reposts on Weibo,

6
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:12,885
goodness, this is an achievement.

7
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:15,565
We should take advantage
of the song's popularity now.

8
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:18,245
We'll include "Breath"
into your upcoming album.

9
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,725
This could be a great opportunity
to make a fortune.

10
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:23,205
What do you think, Ms. Wang?

11
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,125
Good.

12
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,125
Since it's so well-received,

13
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:28,565
you guys should give it a go.

14
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,525
Under one condition.

15
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:34,085
I want this song to go viral.

16
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:35,125
Not a problem, Ms. Wang.

17
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:38,885
I will do my absolute best
to make this album a hit.

18
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:40,485
Good, I have to go now.

19
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,205
Carry on with the discussion if you will.

20
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:43,125
-Got it.
-Okay.

21
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,365
We should see Ms. Wang off.

22
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:47,885
-See you, Ms. Wang.
-See you.

23
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,285
-Take care, Ms. Wang.
-Bye.

24
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:52,605
I didn't expect Ms. Wang
to have a change of mind.

25
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:57,245
Daniel, you're looking good today.

26
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:59,245
You're good at sucking up to others.

27
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,205
Daniel, thank you.

28
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:06,525
I'm your manager.
You don't have to be so polite.

29
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:10,085
Speaking of Hebiancao,
don't you remember anything about him?

30
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:11,965
Hebiancao?

31
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:13,405
Why are you bringing this up?

32
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,325
Look, there was only a small group
of media representatives that day

33
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,645
and I didn't see other people.

34
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:20,525
That means that Hebiancao

35
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:23,845
is very likely to be your classmate
who has admired you for a long time.

36
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:26,925
That couldn't be. Hebiancao created
the comic to spread rumors about me.

37
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,925
Hence, I have a reason to believe
Hebiancao is a girl.

38
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:34,165
They say they're not into you,
but their action proved otherwise.

39
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,485
They say they don't like you
when in fact they do.

40
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:37,605
What are you doing?

41
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:41,365
Did you forget that I am a girl?

42
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,405
I could sue you
for defamation of character.

43
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:45,765
I keep on forgetting
to treat you like a girl.

44
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,645
Chill out.

45
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:03,165
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

46
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:16,245
Our secretarial department has been
documenting all new registrations.

47
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:18,204
It has been going well.

48
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,885
Chen Qingqing.

49
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,205
Are you waiting for my invitation
to take down the meeting minutes?

50
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:32,965
I'm ready, chief.

51
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:33,965
Please go ahead.

52
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:36,525
Moving on, we might need help
from other departments...

53
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:40,965
Bye.

54
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,125
Oh, right. Chen Qingqing.

55
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,645
I almost forgot to tell you.

56
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:55,805
Your final task for this training

57
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,205
is to take all of these student IDs,

58
00:04:58,285 --> 00:04:59,965
make sure to stamp
and register each of them

59
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:02,605
before distributing
to the respective student leaders.

60
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,765
Please finish it today.

61
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,565
And thanks in advance for your hard work.

62
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:07,645
We've got to go now.

63
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,445
There's so much to do!

64
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,285
NAME: LAN XINYA

65
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:37,245
Are you trying to gang up on me?

66
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:40,405
Just you wait
until it's your payback time!

67
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,485
Fangfang.

68
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:50,005
What's wrong?

69
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,685
Are you not feeling well?

70
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:52,685
I'm okay.

71
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,245
I'll feel better after a nap.

72
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,005
Fangfang, what do you feel like eating?

73
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:00,925
Fangfang.

74
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:04,285
Is there something bothering you?

75
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:07,885
Actually, my dad is hospitalized.

76
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,485
What happened to your dad?

77
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:12,245
Should I go to the hospital with you?

78
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,005
It's all right.

79
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:15,525
My dad has always been sick.

80
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,325
This time he needs surgery.

81
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,965
It's going to cost more than 100,000 yuan.

82
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:23,485
I have no idea
how I am going to afford it.

83
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,765
Fangfang, don't you worry.

84
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,445
Take it easy, I'm here.

85
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:30,845
I will help you find a way.

86
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:35,405
It's okay, Qingqing.
I will try to solve it by myself.

87
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,045
I'm going to the hospital tonight.
I won't be having dinner with you later.

88
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:39,965
I've got to go.

89
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,285
Bye.

90
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:55,565
These three girls, aren't they...

91
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,165
They're here, let's go.

92
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:03,285
Xinyan.

93
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:04,845
Have you noticed?

94
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,885
The way people are looking at us today.
Isn't it rather strange?

95
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:09,405
Yes.

96
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:12,845
Judging by the way they look at us,
it seems like they're just admiring us.

97
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:15,165
Perhaps it's because of our powerful aura.

98
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:21,765
BARE FACE REVEALED
IMPENDING DOOM, ABSOLUTE HORROR

99
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:42,525
Fangfang, I've figured out a solution.

100
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,165
A solution for what?

101
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:49,725
A solution for us to raise a large sum
of money for your dad's surgery.

102
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:53,445
Look.

103
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,845
"Female Lead Audition for a Music Video"?

104
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,925
You're not missing
this important information, right?

105
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,845
"Prize money of 150,000 yuan."

106
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:03,765
But you missed
this important information here.

107
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,525
"Outstanding qualities are required."

108
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:08,165
Outstanding qualities?

109
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,685
I have them.

110
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:27,965
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

111
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,205
I know you're really trying to help me,

112
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:32,885
but you don't have to try so hard.

113
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:34,725
I'm not.

114
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:36,725
It's simply a role for a music video.

115
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:38,725
How difficult can it be?

116
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:39,845
Don't worry.

117
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,085
How can Chen Qingqing
be so full of herself?

118
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,804
Look at her.

119
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,285
She has the guts to join the audition?

120
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:47,765
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

121
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:51,365
Are you going to audition
for our campus' music video?

122
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:52,285
Yes.

123
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,445
The 150,000-yuan worth of prize money
is going to be mine.

124
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:58,085
My application form has been filled out.

125
00:08:58,165 --> 00:08:59,605
I'll submit it after this class ends.

126
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:01,925
Then I'm off to practice
for my performance.

127
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:05,045
Hey, I suggest that you skip the audition

128
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,325
so that you don't trouble of yourself.

129
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:10,565
I, Chen Qingqing,

130
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:12,565
am not someone
who admits to defeat easily.

131
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:16,045
Don't assume that everyone is like you,
who judges people by their looks.

132
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:16,965
I--

133
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:21,565
I am going to use my talents

134
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,365
to prove everyone wrong.

135
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:27,005
FEMALE LEAD AUDITION FOR A MUSIC VIDEO

136
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:30,885
Wait for your number to be called.

137
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:31,885
Next.

138
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,605
Hi, I am here for the audition, thank you.

139
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:48,045
Hi.

140
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,685
You may go home and wait for our call.

141
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,005
-Next.
-Hey, wait.

142
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:55,925
The other girls are all waiting here.
Why should I wait at home?

143
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:57,485
Just go home and wait.

144
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:00,805
-Please leave.
-Exactly, hurry up and leave.

145
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:02,885
Stop blocking others from the queue.

146
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:05,245
-How annoying.
-Get lost.

147
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,005
There were rumors
about you joining the audition.

148
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:15,245
I didn't believe it at first.

149
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,965
Apparently, it's true.

150
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:17,885
So what if it's true?

151
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:21,885
Are you not aware that they're looking
for someone with outstanding qualities?

152
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:23,885
Look at yourself.

153
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,645
Do you really think you could be
in Situ Feng's music video?

154
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:29,405
What?

155
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:32,565
This is Situ Feng's music video?

156
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:37,485
Stop pretending.

157
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,405
Back then, you pretended to be
his assistant.

158
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:42,645
Now, you're trying
to approach him on purpose again.

159
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,285
Who wants to approach him?
I can't wait to get away from him.

160
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:46,525
Anyway, let me tell you this.

161
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,645
I'm going to be the female lead
in this music video.

162
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:50,085
It's better for you to give up now.

163
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,125
I almost forgot.

164
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:56,045
It seems someone's application
hasn't been accepted

165
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,365
and was eliminated right away.

166
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:58,605
Lan Xinya!

167
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,285
All right, I've got to go.

168
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,685
My time is precious.

169
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:02,645
Bye.

170
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,365
A music video by Situ Feng?

171
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:09,165
There's no way I'll ever be in it
even if he begs me to!

172
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,125
But the prize money...

173
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:13,285
Gosh.

174
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:16,365
For the sake of Fangfang,
I will sacrifice myself.

175
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,925
No one will recognize me
without makeup anyway.

176
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:19,885
No.

177
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:23,365
Grandpa's men could already
be here in Yuncheng.

178
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:27,445
Why do I have to deal
with these shallow people

179
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,445
and put up with them ordering me around?

180
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,005
But without the prize money,

181
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:34,165
Fangfang won't be able
to pay for the surgery.

182
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,325
Hi.

183
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:03,645
Your name is Qingchen?

184
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:06,845
I'm sorry, I didn't provide my picture.

185
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,045
That's not a problem.

186
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:09,965
I left out my phone number too.

187
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:10,885
No worries at all.

188
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:13,085
I think you're a great fit for the role.

189
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,485
Please take a seat.

190
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,045
Thank you.

191
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:19,485
I am so jealous.

192
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:21,405
-I'm so jealous.
-Who is that?

193
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:24,925
-Lan Xinya!
-Lan Xinya!

194
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,685
-She's outstanding!
-She's outstanding!

195
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,085
-She's lovely!
-She's lovely!

196
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,445
-She's the best!
-She's the best!

197
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:35,925
Welcome, everyone.

198
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,205
Congratulations, all of you for advancing
into the second round of the audition.

199
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:40,445
We have a test for you today.

200
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:43,725
Please act out an emotional scene
as if you've been dumped by your lover.

201
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,485
Your act should portray
how miserable you are after such breakup.

202
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,685
Shall we start?

203
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,365
Go to hell.

204
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,485
Why would you leave me?

205
00:12:57,565 --> 00:12:59,365
How could you?

206
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:08,645
Should I look it up online?

207
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,165
HOW SHOULD YOU FEEL AFTER A BREAKUP?

208
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:21,765
That's it!

209
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,045
The girl without any facial expression.

210
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,045
Yes, you.

211
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,325
You have a unique style and composure.

212
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,605
I like how you stared
at the breakup text messages,

213
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,845
looking all dejected and exhausted.

214
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,445
Your acting

215
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:40,125
was how I imagined
the female lead to be like.

216
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:43,005
You were born to be an actress.

217
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,005
I think she's the right girl for the role.

218
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:56,565
However, why do I find your face familiar?

219
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:57,885
Have we met before?

220
00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:00,165
Are you sure?
I don't find your face familiar.

221
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,085
As the saying goes,

222
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,645
"Swans are beautiful,
but they all look similar

223
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,845
while it's easy to spot an ugly duckling."

224
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:07,565
Since you're the chosen one,
I'll cut to the chase.

225
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:11,045
Situ Feng is the male lead
of this music video.

226
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,765
Situ Feng. Do you know him?

227
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,125
There's a reason
this audition was kept a secret

228
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:24,765
as we want to keep the mystery alive
for this music video.

229
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,005
I hope you'd understand.

230
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:28,525
Shooting will start next weekend.

231
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,325
You should get prepared before that.

232
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,205
Are there any questions?

233
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,165
I have a question about my prize money.

234
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,605
When can I get it?

235
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,965
You're selected to work with your idol.
Aren't you excited?

236
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:44,405
Why am I constantly
running into odd people these days?

237
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,405
As for that 150,000 yuan,

238
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,605
it will be given to you
once the shooting ends.

239
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:49,765
We can meet up then.

240
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:52,565
By the way, this video
that you'll be shooting

241
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,245
is Situ Feng's latest single.

242
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,165
"Breath."

243
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:58,325
"Breath"?

244
00:14:58,405 --> 00:14:59,245
Yes.

245
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:00,325
Here's the demo.

246
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:01,725
Bring it home and listen to it.

247
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,805
Keep this to yourself or that 150,000 yuan

248
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,205
might slip away.

249
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,845
Qingqing, you're back.

250
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:18,885
Fangfang.

251
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:22,685
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:24,445
I didn't make it through the audition.

253
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,485
It's okay.

254
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:27,645
I'll think of other ways.

255
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,325
Fangfang, don't worry.

256
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:33,085
Before this coming weekend,
I'll solve this problem for you.

257
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,325
It's okay.

258
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,845
Please trust me.

259
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:38,645
-Let me handle this.
-Okay.

260
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:39,765
I'll make a move first.

261
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:58,165
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE

262
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,765
LITTLE BEE, A BOX OF CHOCOLATE

263
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,445
"Little Bee, a box of chocolate"?

264
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:11,765
Why can't I remember
selling chocolate to this person?

265
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,245
Little Bee?

266
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,645
What kind of name is that?

267
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:32,125
Weren't you eliminated from the audition?

268
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:34,325
Why are you so late?

269
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:35,565
It's none of your business.

270
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,245
Qingqing, don't be sad.

271
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,005
It's okay that you're eliminated.

272
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:47,565
I've already told her
not to embarrass herself.

273
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:51,085
From now on,
you should learn to talk less.

274
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:53,165
I don't want others
to know that you're my assistant.

275
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,725
I don't want to look stupid.

276
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,645
You're right.

277
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:57,445
I didn't make it.

278
00:16:58,565 --> 00:16:59,965
Thanks for your concern.

279
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:02,045
I wasn't concerned at all.

280
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,525
You seem to be good at eating.

281
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:06,685
If you join an eating contest,
maybe you will stand a chance.

282
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:17,405
Apologies, Your Highness.

283
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:19,645
You shouldn't have placed
your foot underneath mine.

284
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:21,765
Do you know it's blocking my steps?

285
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:25,724
Also, to have your foot stepped on
by someone like me

286
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,685
must have hurt real bad.

287
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,844
-Qingqing.
-Hang on.

288
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:35,245
Can you share some gossip
about Situ Feng with us?

289
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:39,325
I don't want to talk
about that person today.

290
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:41,365
But...

291
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:45,245
I have a question for you guys.

292
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,245
Do you know who is Little Bee?

293
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:50,405
Of course I do.

294
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,605
Little bee buzzing
And off they fly into the bushes

295
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:54,885
That's not what I meant.

296
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:56,405
That's not it!

297
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:59,565
I don't know about Little Bee,
but I do know about Situ Feng.

298
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:04,165
Hey.

299
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,365
Why don't you guys
go ahead to the canteen now?

300
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:08,485
You guys go ahead.
I left something in the classroom.

301
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:09,485
Wait for me.

302
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:23,765
LITTLE BEE

303
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,085
Little Bee!

304
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:30,445
I caught you!

305
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,725
-What are you doing?
-Lower down your voice.

306
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:39,885
-The class next door can hear you.
-Situ Feng.

307
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,765
The burden of being an idol

308
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:44,285
has robbed you of your abilities
to buy your own food?

309
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:47,885
I have to do this to stay in shape
and my diet is restricted by my agency.

310
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,165
Snacks are prohibited.

311
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,645
If I get caught,

312
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:53,485
it's considered a violation
of the contract.

313
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,685
So what if you've got so many supporters?

314
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:01,165
You can't even eat a bar of chocolate.

315
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:06,405
If you agree to one of my conditions,

316
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,925
I'll keep this a secret
and I won't tell anyone.

317
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:10,085
-Condition?
-Yes.

318
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:12,765
What condition?

319
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:16,325
If you agree to help me run errands,

320
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:19,005
then I'll keep this secret for you.

321
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:22,925
Are you trying to use me for publicity
to get more customers?

322
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:24,605
Listen to me.

323
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,965
It's never going to happen.

324
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,845
Situ Feng, think about it.

325
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:33,165
If you help me run errands,

326
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:35,565
it's an opportunity to exercise
and stay in shape.

327
00:19:35,645 --> 00:19:38,605
You could eat plenty of snacks.
Nobody would notice.

328
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,245
What do you think?

329
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:41,565
Let me tell you.

330
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:44,085
This chocolate

331
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:47,125
honestly tastes amazing.

332
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:49,685
Do you want to have a bite?

333
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,045
Are you sure you're not going to have any?

334
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:56,125
Why don't I

335
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,805
give you two more? What do you think?

336
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:07,565
Isn't that Situ Feng?

337
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:09,205
It looks like he's delivering something.

338
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:10,685
Let's go.

339
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:23,805
Yang Menglin,

340
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,205
Zhang Jingwen.

341
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:29,685
Here are your snacks.

342
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,445
Here.

343
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:34,605
Here you go.

344
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,645
Here's yours.

345
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,285
How much are they?

346
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:44,325
Three plus five plus eight...

347
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,805
We haven't worked out
the total cost in advance.

348
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:52,405
Chen Qingqing, you've trapped me.

349
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,845
Situ Feng, you haven't
collected your money!

350
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,805
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

351
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,845
Situ Feng is now running errands?

352
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,045
It used to be Chen Qingqing, right?

353
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,405
What's going on today?

354
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:06,885
What's wrong with Situ Feng today?

355
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,365
I want Situ Feng
to run errands for me too.

356
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:10,565
It feels like

357
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,085
-he's delivering snacks as my boyfriend.
-Yes.

358
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:15,125
It must have been Chen Qingqing again!

359
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:20,885
That was quick.

360
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:22,605
Are you all done?

361
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:24,765
Here's your money.

362
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,685
That's a lot.

363
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:30,805
You're worthy of your title

364
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:31,885
of an idol.

365
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:33,485
Look how much tips you've got.

366
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:34,445
That's right.

367
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:35,725
Great job.

368
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:38,725
You seem a little weak.

369
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:39,645
Excuse me?

370
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:41,325
-Who said I'm weak?
-I'm saying that.

371
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:44,085
There were only two errands
and you're running out of breath.

372
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:45,365
I'm not out of breath!

373
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,165
Potato chips as a reward from your boss.

374
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:53,685
Catch.

375
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:55,805
Go ahead and eat it.

376
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,005
I shouldn't eat this.

377
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:07,005
Look how much control other people
are having over your life.

378
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:08,485
Don't you feel frustrated?

379
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:11,765
-Give it back if you're not eating it.
-Who said I'm not eating it?

380
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:17,245
I used to feel frustrated,
but I don't anymore.

381
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:20,165
That's because feeling angry or frustrated
serves no purpose for me

382
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:21,685
which is why I've chosen to let go.

383
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:27,485
Why is having a purpose so important?

384
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:31,325
Why is it that for everything we do,
we have to define its purpose?

385
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:32,685
If you're angry, just be angry.

386
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:34,725
Eat and drink whenever you want.

387
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:36,165
Eat, drink, play and have fun.

388
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,485
Eating is the most important thing.
Don't you know?

389
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,725
Why think about it so much?

390
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:42,285
Forget it.

391
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:46,285
I should say something useful.

392
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,045
One hundred and twenty-five!

393
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,045
Are you going to eat this?

394
00:22:50,405 --> 00:22:52,605
Listen, Situ Feng.

395
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:55,445
With the calories we consume every day,

396
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:58,045
as long as you find a way to burn them,

397
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,005
you'll be able to stay in shape.

398
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,405
Keep going!

399
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,325
One hundred and twenty-eight!

400
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:06,205
One hundred and twenty-nine!

401
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:09,565
Come on, Situ Feng.

402
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:11,965
Five.

403
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:13,725
Don't even think about eating.

404
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:15,285
I'm not.

405
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:20,005
Are you still trying to be sneaky?

406
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:31,845
Focus on height rather than speed.

407
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:34,645
Continue, higher!

408
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:37,005
Come on, Situ Feng!

409
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:38,885
Keep going.

410
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,765
Situ Feng, why are you carrying
huge waterbottles?

411
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:45,925
It's hot outside!

412
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:47,285
I'm thirsty!

413
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:53,765
Situ Feng.

414
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,365
Was it raining outside?

415
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:57,525
Why are you all wet?

416
00:23:57,605 --> 00:23:58,485
I went skipping.

417
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:00,325
Oh, skipping.

418
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:02,205
Skipping?

419
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:04,685
Chen Qingqing's sorcery is frightening.

420
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:15,485
Let me join.

421
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:17,125
Am I hearing this correctly?

422
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:20,525
Haven't you always said
playing basketball will mess up your hair

423
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:22,005
which was why you never joined us?

424
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,645
That's in the past. I'm playing today.

425
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:24,605
Catch this.

426
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,085
Let's go.

427
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:38,365
Excuse me.

428
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:40,245
I'm sorry.

429
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:41,605
Excuse me, please.

430
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:42,805
Excuse me. Let me through.

431
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,325
-That's so cool!
-That's amazing!

432
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:03,405
That suffocating burden
of being an idol...

433
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:04,605
It's none of your business.

434
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:18,125
Sorry, excuse me.

435
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:19,205
Thank you.

436
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:26,725
Hello?

437
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:28,845
Yes, speaking.

438
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:30,885
Tomorrow?

439
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,645
Where is the location?

440
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:38,765
Ming De College?

441
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,605
Okay, see you.

442
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:01,445
What am I going to do
if someone recognizes me?

443
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:03,125
It's you.

444
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,765
Situ Feng.

445
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:09,885
Now that I look beautiful,
you're trying to make a move.

446
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:12,805
Chen Qingqing is with me now.

447
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:14,685
Don't ever sing "Breath" again.

448
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:17,925
Situ Feng!

449
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,725
