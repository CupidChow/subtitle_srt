A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:58,605
EPISODE 9

3
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,965
"Breath" really invokes emotions.

4
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:14,565
Do you feel the same?

5
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:18,445
Goodness, my master.

6
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,325
Aren't you busy? Why did you come here?

7
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:23,285
Take a look at this.
They sent us the music video.

8
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:25,325
It's great.

9
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:27,285
We already thought of various ways

10
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:29,805
to make you and Qingchen
into a national couple.

11
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:31,965
Daniel.

12
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,525
I don't want to release this song.

13
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:35,885
That's for sure.

14
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:38,485
What? You don't want to release it?

15
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:41,005
Why? Explain to me clearly.

16
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:42,205
There's no specific reason.

17
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:44,165
I just wanted to do so.

18
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:46,325
You're really childish!

19
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:50,205
I'll bear the consequences myself.

20
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:51,285
Hey!

21
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,525
Stop right there!
Can you bear it yourself?

22
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:02,725
Xinya.

23
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:05,525
I heard that, last night,

24
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:08,885
Situ Feng and Gu Nanxi
were with Chen Qingqing.

25
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:10,325
What?

26
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,805
That's why they didn't accompany you.

27
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,525
Chen Qingqing!

28
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,245
I won't let you live in peace!

29
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:36,525
Hello, Mr. Gu.

30
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,365
Chen Qingqing.

31
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:39,325
It's me.

32
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,405
I have something to ask you, sir.

33
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:44,285
Why do you have to do this
if you want to ask a question?

34
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:47,005
If I don't do this,
I can't stand properly.

35
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:48,125
Look at my leg.

36
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,725
Your leg is so swollen.

37
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:55,445
It's okay. The doctor said
I'll be fine after a few days.

38
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:56,685
Right, Mr. Gu.

39
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:59,045
Regarding yesterday's incident,
I have a question.

40
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,005
Ask away then.

41
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:01,525
Did you know Lan Xinyu?

42
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:03,685
How did you know about her?

43
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,685
I heard Situ Feng said her name
yesterday at the amusement park.

44
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:10,525
When he mentioned her name,
Yiyang got really angry.

45
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,605
The two of them almost fought.

46
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:16,285
So I'm guessing that
our honorable president

47
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,365
will definitely know what happened.

48
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,165
I placed the book
at the wrong place just now.

49
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:32,885
Regarding Xinyu,

50
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:36,765
all I want to say is that
after she passed away,

51
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,045
Situ Feng changed completely.

52
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,445
Yiyang too.

53
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:44,245
What happened between--

54
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,325
You should ask Situ Feng
about what happened.

55
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:49,005
Only he can decide
whether to tell you or not.

56
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:07,725
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

57
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:09,645
-Yes?
-How's your leg?

58
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:13,045
The doctor told me that he can

59
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,045
remove my leg cast after two more days.

60
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,045
-Let's study maths today.
-Hey.

61
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,685
I'm not tutoring you today.

62
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,445
-Really?
-Yes.

63
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:24,725
I'll go play basketball then.

64
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:28,205
Right, put the snacks into my drawer.

65
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,165
Stop!

66
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:31,805
Come back.

67
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:41,205
Although we're not studying today,

68
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:44,685
but I have an important matter

69
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:45,805
to share with you.

70
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:56,605
Let's begin

71
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:59,645
Lin Yiyang's Discipline Committee's
first meeting.

72
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,245
-Discipline Committee?
-That's right.

73
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,285
Hello, I'm Miss Chen Qingqing.

74
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:09,845
You're my sidekick, Situ Feng.

75
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:12,085
The purpose of today's meeting is

76
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:15,405
to bring justice upon Yiyang

77
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:19,125
for the kidnapping at the amusement park.

78
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:20,085
Please look at this.

79
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,565
After a few days of investigation,

80
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:29,285
I've already understood
our target completely.

81
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:30,285
Count me out.

82
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,205
Why?

83
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:34,285
I'm telling you,

84
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,045
I quit.

85
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:38,525
Hey!

86
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,405
Situ Feng!

87
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,245
Do you know what you're doing?

88
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,445
I want to ask you that.
Do you know what you're doing?

89
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:47,405
Discipline Committee?
What justice are you talking about?

90
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:48,525
Who do you think you are?

91
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:49,485
Are you the principal?

92
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:52,045
But Yiyang kidnapped me. He kidnapped me!

93
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,365
But he didn't hurt anyone.

94
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,885
Your injury was an accident.

95
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,085
Situ Feng.

96
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:01,605
Don't you think that Yiyang
always has something against you?

97
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:02,965
He's always harassing you.

98
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:06,205
Not just you, it's because of Xinyu too.

99
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:07,645
He's...

100
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,965
How did you know about that?

101
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:12,285
I...

102
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:16,725
Of course I would know about her.
What about it?

103
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:23,245
Hey! Situ Feng!

104
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:28,125
The school will handle
the matter regarding Yiyang.

105
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:31,485
Don't meddle in other people's affairs,
especially in this matter!

106
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:36,005
Situ Feng, you've crossed over the line.

107
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,885
I'll stay out of it! I don't want...

108
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:48,845
Chen Qingqing.

109
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,565
Why do you care about him?

110
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:52,725
It's annoying.

111
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:07,845
SITU FENG!

112
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:14,885
HOW PITIFUL, LET'S MOVE!
I'VE ASKED LAN XINYU TOO.

113
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,525
I put in so much effort.

114
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:24,005
In the end,

115
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:27,445
he said that I was a busybody.

116
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,525
Hebiancao has uploaded a new material.

117
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:34,525
His Highness's official account
shared it too.

118
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:36,125
Let's read it together.

119
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:38,564
His Highness is so cute.

120
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:42,405
It seems like Hebiancao
really understands His Highness.

121
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:45,445
I think we should talk to him sometimes

122
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,044
so that we can get news
about His Highness.

123
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,445
By the way, have you seen this?

124
00:08:58,565 --> 00:08:59,685
DON'T CRY, LITTLE FENG.

125
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,645
I saw it. It's that guy again.

126
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,245
I think it's quite good.

127
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,405
Look at your face
with two nose drips. How cute.

128
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,565
He's painting the wrong picture.

129
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:17,965
But I feel that the writer
really understands you.

130
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,125
Could he be someone we know?

131
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,485
Well, he better not
let me find out who he is.

132
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:27,805
I can't believe that someone

133
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:30,445
other than Qingqing can tolerate you.

134
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,485
Hey, get lost.

135
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,845
Situ Feng.

136
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:42,885
Please answer the second question.

137
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,085
Come to my office after class.

138
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:00,965
Qingqing.

139
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:02,445
I'll help you out.

140
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:03,885
Where are you going today?

141
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,765
I can do it myself.

142
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:06,965
It's just a small matter.

143
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,125
I don't want to bother you, Your Highness.

144
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:30,245
Are you free tomorrow, Qingchen?
I want to have dinner with you.

145
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:31,885
Sure.

146
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,765
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

147
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,645
You look so pretty today, Qingchen.

148
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:10,685
Thank you.

149
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:14,285
Are you this nice to every girl?

150
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:17,525
That's not true.

151
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,565
I don't like to lie.

152
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,765
If I say that you're pretty,
then I mean it.

153
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:26,285
Thank you.

154
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:30,165
For this restaurant,
I've ordered some signature dishes.

155
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,085
Try it and see whether it suits you.

156
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,165
Looking at the way you have the soup

157
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:44,045
suddenly reminds me of someone.

158
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:45,605
A friend?

159
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:48,325
No.

160
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:51,725
I'll get right to the point.

161
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,805
I asked you out today

162
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:56,405
is to explain to you

163
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:58,645
that I've decided not to release

164
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:01,845
the music video of "Breath."

165
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:07,085
You...

166
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,285
Aren't you surprised?

167
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:11,085
I believe that

168
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,405
you have your own reason.

169
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:18,685
Thanks for understanding.

170
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:33,845
Actually,

171
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:36,245
the releasing of this song

172
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,285
will cause harm

173
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:40,845
to someone.

174
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:42,925
Cause harm to someone?

175
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:45,845
"Breath."

176
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,605
What does it represent?

177
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,245
If you can't tell me,

178
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,045
then it's okay.

179
00:12:58,285 --> 00:12:59,125
"Breath."

180
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,325
Actually, I wrote it for an important...

181
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,485
A very important girl.

182
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:07,645
It's just that she...

183
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:09,565
What is it?

184
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:12,045
She passed away

185
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:15,445
three years ago.

186
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:20,485
So once the song is released,

187
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:23,525
it will invoke unwanted memories

188
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:25,525
and conflict to others.

189
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:32,845
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:34,245
I've talked so much.

191
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:36,685
You must be unhappy.

192
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:41,045
Although this music video wasn't released,

193
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,405
but the agency has watched the demo.

194
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:46,125
They love your acting.

195
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:49,525
Maybe there will be a chance for us
to work in the future.

196
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:51,445
Thank you.

197
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,685
Thank you for your honesty too.

198
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:58,725
Of course, we're friends after all.

199
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:00,085
Friends?

200
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:01,565
Yes, we're friends.

201
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,245
If Qingchen is your friend,

202
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:04,885
who is Qingqing to you then?

203
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,165
It's a pleasure having you as a friend.

204
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:12,485
It's a pleasure for me too. Thanks.

205
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:27,085
I'm sorry. I have something to do.
I need to leave first.

206
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:28,405
Now?

207
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,325
Do you want me to send you?

208
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,085
It's okay. I can go home on my own.

209
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:46,045
We should treat our friends sincerely.

210
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,685
When he talked to Qingchen,

211
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:49,765
he told her everything.

212
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,485
As for Chen Qingqing,

213
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:54,205
he told her not to meddle
in other people's affair.

214
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:55,925
Situ Feng.

215
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:59,565
So are you only friends
with beautiful girls?

216
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:06,445
SELF-REVISION TIME

217
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:11,125
I RECENTLY HAD A FIGHT WITH SOMEONE.
CAN I ASK FOR YOUR OPINION?

218
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,565
SURE.

219
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,325
THIS PERSON HAS A SECRET THAT
HE TOLD A STRANGER, BUT NOT ME.

220
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:36,845
What do you want, Situ Feng?

221
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:39,405
I saw you play with the phone
instead of studying.

222
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,685
-I will monitor you.
-Do I need to be monitored?

223
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:50,685
Hey, I'm just curious.

224
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:54,165
You must've done something shady.

225
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:58,365
You're right.

226
00:15:58,445 --> 00:15:59,765
You're the righteous one.

227
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,485
You tell others about everything.

228
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,765
I don't want to listen to you.
I don't have time for you.

229
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:09,325
What are you doing?

230
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:13,805
I just want one.
You've stopped supplying snacks to me.

231
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:16,485
You can't even have one. I won't allow it.

232
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,565
-I'll help you out.
-No!

233
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,645
Since we're not so close,
let's get straight to the point.

234
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:51,565
What kind of trouble
will you bring me today?

235
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,005
Qingqing.

236
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:57,045
I admit that it was our fault
for certain things before.

237
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,165
But we're here now

238
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,125
to become friends with you.

239
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:03,445
That's right.

240
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,925
We came here today to buy snacks from you.

241
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,325
You want to buy snacks from me?

242
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,285
Yes.

243
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,084
Xinyan.

244
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:27,604
Thank you, Xinya.

245
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,405
Everyone, we bought some snacks.

246
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:36,725
Help yourselves.

247
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,605
If you're tired in the afternoon,
have them for your afternoon tea.

248
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,645
Thank you.

249
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:42,285
Thank you, Xinya.

250
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:44,885
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

251
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:45,925
My stomach hurts.

252
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,325
Why does it hurt all of a sudden?

253
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:49,085
I think it's because of this biscuit.

254
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:52,005
Let me take a look.

255
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,885
There's a problem
with the manufacturing date.

256
00:17:57,965 --> 00:17:59,125
It has expired.

257
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:01,405
Don't eat it, everyone.

258
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:03,485
What? It has already expired.

259
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,205
Man.

260
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,765
Are you sure these biscuits
are the ones we bought from Qingqing?

261
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:08,965
Yes.

262
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:10,605
Qingqing is a profiteer.

263
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,925
-We must boycott her.
-Boycott!

264
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:14,885
Xinya, you must seek justice for us.

265
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:16,125
-That's right.
-Yes.

266
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,405
Don't worry, everyone.

267
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:19,205
I'll bring justice for everyone.

268
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,445
We can't easily let this go.

269
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,045
-That's right.
-That's right.

270
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:27,965
-Qingqing, are you done?
-Yes, let's go.

271
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,085
Qingqing, don't you dare run away.

272
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,525
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why would I run away?

273
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,005
Look at it yourself.

274
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,045
I bought these biscuits from you.

275
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:42,565
If you didn't do anything wrong,

276
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:43,885
don't you think this is absurd?

277
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:47,805
We bought snacks from you to support you.

278
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,885
But you sold the expired ones to us.

279
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,285
Expired?

280
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,485
If my classmate didn't get a stomachache,

281
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,245
we wouldn't know that we were cheated.

282
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:58,805
Xinya, there must be something wrong.

283
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:01,445
It's impossible for us to sell
expired products to you.

284
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:05,245
Will anyone still believe
the words of a liar?

285
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:10,405
I'll tell everyone about your evil deed.

286
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,365
Your service is doomed.

287
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:18,525
But isn't it odd

288
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,525
that one of the Goddess members
had a stomachache?

289
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:23,245
They found out
about the expired dates too.

290
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:24,285
That's right.

291
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:28,605
Plus, when I looked at Xinyan,

292
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,685
she didn't look like
she had a stomachache.

293
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,445
But those expired products

294
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,845
are definitely ours.

295
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:37,325
What should we do now?

296
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:42,645
Fangfang, why don't
I find Mr. Zhao and ask him tomorrow?

297
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:44,285
I'll ask about the source of the snacks.

298
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,285
All right.

299
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,445
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

300
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,845
I'm Chen Qingqing.
I bought some snacks from you before.

301
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,605
I'll reach your place in 30 minutes.

302
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:00,565
Okay, thank you.

303
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:06,925
Hey.

304
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:08,245
Qingqing.

305
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,245
It hurts.

306
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:14,085
I'm warning you, Situ Feng.

307
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:16,645
I'm in a bad mood today.
Don't mess with me.

308
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:17,845
Hey.

309
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,765
-I want to ask whether you need my help.
-Your help?

310
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:21,965
I beg you.

311
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:23,685
Please control your precious Xinya.

312
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,765
Don't let her disturb me.

313
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:27,525
As for you, Situ Feng,

314
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:29,205
stay away from me!

315
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:32,885
-Hey.
-Unless you want me to slap you.

316
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:33,885
Do you hear me?

317
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,085
Hey, I was being nice.

318
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:37,845
Why are you so vicious?

319
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,045
-It hurts!
-Were you being nice?

320
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:43,805
All of you are like this.

321
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:46,445
You always impose
your own views upon others,

322
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,685
no matter they want it or not.

323
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:49,765
Where do you get your confidence from?

324
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:55,685
Please.

325
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,485
Who cares about your feeling?

326
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,125
Who are you?

327
00:20:59,205 --> 00:21:00,445
The princess of ugly people?

328
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,405
My eyes are tainted by your ugliness!

329
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:10,445
Hey.

330
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,045
Gu Nanxi.

331
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:13,565
Hey, Qingqing.

332
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,245
Qingqing.

333
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:23,365
Did you ask the supplier?

334
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:25,725
Mr. Zhao told me that

335
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:29,245
the manufacturing date for the snacks
is on the first of May.

336
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,165
It's impossible that
the snacks are expired.

337
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:35,965
But all the receipts are gone.

338
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,045
There's no way to look at it.

339
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:41,165
I wonder if the whole school
knows about the problem.

340
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:43,885
Our Errands Service
has no business at all today.

341
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,205
Really?

342
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:57,005
Hello, are you responsible
for the school's surveillance?

343
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:58,085
Yes.

344
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:59,845
I need the surveillance video
of our class.

345
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:01,405
-No.
-Why?

346
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:02,725
It's the school's rule.

347
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,565
The rule is dead, but we're not.

348
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:06,325
No.

349
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,725
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

350
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,805
Are you one of my fans?

351
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,565
Are you willing to help me?

352
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:29,565
Can you...

353
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:33,285
Can you dance for me?

354
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:42,445
Situ Feng, you skipped class.
What are you looking at?

355
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:50,325
Why are your dark circles getting worse?

356
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,445
Gu Nanxi, look at this.

357
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:56,565
This is our class' surveillance footage
on the night before the incident.

358
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:57,645
Someone came.

359
00:22:58,845 --> 00:22:59,965
Okay.

360
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:03,325
It's enough to prove
Qingqing's innocence with this video then.

361
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:06,565
Wait a minute.

362
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:09,405
Were you watching the footage
for the past few nights?

363
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:11,685
I...

364
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:13,605
I wasn't.

365
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,325
You worked so hard to help her.

366
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,165
Shouldn't you two patch things up?

367
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:26,445
By the way, don't tell her that
I got the surveillance footage.

368
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:33,805
I seriously don't understand.

369
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,885
At first, you were the closest person
to Chen Qingqing.

370
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:41,765
Why did you two have a big fight?

371
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,845
You're still denying it.

372
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:48,325
How stubborn.

373
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,245
I'm sorry, I'm late.

374
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:54,245
Since everyone is here,

375
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,885
let's come up with an explanation
for Qingqing's Errands Service

376
00:23:57,965 --> 00:23:59,325
to clear things up.

377
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:04,365
Let's watch this surveillance footage.

378
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:06,685
From the surveillance video
of this classroom,

379
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,205
someone entered Qingqing's classroom

380
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:11,965
around 12 a.m. on the night before.

381
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:13,925
Although the reason is unclear,

382
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:17,005
but all these things are linked together.

383
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:20,165
This evidence is enough
to prove Qingqing's innocence.

384
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:22,765
If there's no objection,
that's all for today.

385
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:24,685
The meeting is dismissed.

386
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:42,445
Situ Feng, come to my office.

387
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:52,405
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

388
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:53,485
What's going on?

389
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:54,725
I don't know.

390
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:59,405
Do you think it's related
to the maths test, during the last class?

391
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,485
By the way, Gu Nanxi.

392
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:06,885
Fangfang and I want to treat you
this weekend to thank you.

393
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:07,885
Are you free?

394
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,485
-Sure. Okay.
-It's decided then.

395
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,765
Your maths result is bad.

396
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:19,245
You should spend more time
to do the questions.

397
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,725
It's okay if you can't answer it.

398
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:24,645
Why did you write down lyrics?

399
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:27,685
I had an inspiration so I wrote them down.

400
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:28,645
Excuses.

401
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:33,485
Situ Feng, you're an idol.

402
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:34,925
What's an idol?

403
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:36,965
A model and an example.

404
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:40,085
You had a chance
to be listed in the school history's book.

405
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:41,645
The saddest part is not that

406
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:43,765
you weren't able to do it.

407
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:45,485
You had the capability to do it,

408
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:47,565
but you let go
of an opportunity like this.

409
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:49,605
If you have the time today,

410
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:52,925
go to the College Archives
and look at your seniors' stories.

411
00:25:56,925 --> 00:26:00,725
Qingqing, you're lucky today.
It's finally the secretariat's' turn

412
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:02,645
to clean the College Archives.

413
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:03,805
This place is huge.

414
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,445
Are we the only ones cleaning it up?

415
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:06,965
How is that possible?

416
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,205
You're on your own.

417
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:11,485
Thanks for everything.

418
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:24,925
I thought it was going to be difficult
to enter the College Archives.

419
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:29,605
I can't believe that
I have this opportunity.

420
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,445
You scared me to death!

421
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:44,205
Why are you here?

422
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:46,605
Ms. Chen punished me
to go through the school history.

423
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:48,245
Why are you here?

424
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:50,765
I'm here to clean this place.

425
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:54,485
Continue then.

426
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,245
I'm leaving.

427
00:26:58,245 --> 00:26:59,925
I was so surprised. My goodness.

428
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:09,365
Why is it locked?

429
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:11,205
Hey, Chen Qingqing!

430
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:12,565
What?

431
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,365
Why is it locked?

432
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:19,885
Nice, we can't leave now.

433
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:53,725
Did sand get into her eyes?

434
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,325
Should I give her some tissues?

435
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:56,565
What about the rest?

436
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:58,805
Why are there so little details?

437
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:02,885
I've already cut ties with her.

438
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:07,245
Ms. Chen?

439
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:10,565
So Ms. Chen knows my parents.

440
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:13,445
I wonder if she has news about my parents.

441
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,925
There's a rat!

442
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:27,405
Situ Feng!

443
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:29,725
There's a rat!

444
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,165
Situ Feng!

445
00:28:32,365 --> 00:28:33,365
What are you doing?

446
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,845
-I'm scared of rats.
-Don't move. Get down.

447
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:36,885
Get down first.

448
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,325
-I refuse.
-Listen to me. Get down.

449
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:40,765
I'm scared.

450
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:41,725
Get down.

451
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:43,525
Look at me.

452
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:45,765
Look at me.

453
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:19,125
Situ Feng.

454
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:21,925
When can we leave this place?

455
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:23,845
I don't want to stay here at all.

456
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:26,045
-Don't worry. I'll call Gu Nanxi.
-What did you say?

457
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:28,925
I'll call Gu Nanxi!

458
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:36,885
Hello?

459
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:41,405
Okay, I'll help you to open the door now.

460
00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:45,405
Situ Feng!

461
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,765
Are you there, Situ Feng?

462
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:51,405
Situ Feng.

463
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,685
Are you two okay?

464
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:54,445
How are you, Situ Feng?

465
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:55,485
Nanxi.

466
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:57,045
Can you give me a hand?

467
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:57,965
Okay.

468
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:00,925
I was scared to death by a rat.

469
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,005
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

470
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:07,205
Give my headphones back.

471
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:14,365
Xinya, give me a hand too.

472
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,325
Gu Nanxi.

473
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:33,165
Fangfang wants to apologize.

474
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:34,885
Something came up so she couldn't come.

475
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:38,085
Only the two of us
will be eating together.

476
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:40,485
It's okay then.

477
00:30:40,565 --> 00:30:43,045
I have a small secret to tell you

478
00:30:43,485 --> 00:30:45,245
about proving your innocence last time.

479
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:47,005
What's the secret?

480
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:49,485
Xinya.

481
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:52,005
Why are you two here too?

482
00:30:52,405 --> 00:30:53,245
Situ Feng.

483
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:56,165
Let's sit here with them.

484
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,885
There are so many empty seats.
Why do you have to sit here?

485
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:01,445
What a coincidence.

486
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:03,485
Why don't you sit with us?

487
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:04,965
All right.

488
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:10,325
Thank you, Feng.

489
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,725
Gu Nanxi! I demand a duel!

490
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:34,005
I'm not afraid of you.

491
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:36,325
Chen Qingqing! Come out!

492
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:38,845
You have Hua Munian and Gu Nanxi.

493
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:40,605
What's your relationship with them?

494
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:43,405
Are you asking me
to be his assistant for real?

495
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,485
What? Chen Qingqing is coming too?

496
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:48,325
Let's show him who's boss
on behalf of Mr. Wang.

497
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:49,605
There's an extra scene.

498
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:51,965
Can you really not swim?

499
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:53,045
They're doing it on purpose.
