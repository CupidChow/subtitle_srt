A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:59,165
EPISODE 6

3
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:04,365
Qingqing, it was
under Xinya's recommendation

4
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:06,165
that you could join the Student Council.

5
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:09,365
So that makes the both of you
in the same department.

6
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:13,644
How can a snappy girl like you
have what it takes to work for me?

7
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,685
What a waste!

8
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,205
Qingqing, shake hands with her.

9
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,325
Be friends now.

10
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:29,285
You're going to deal with a huge burden
working at the secretariat.

11
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:32,485
Don't even think of living it easy
once you're in the Student Council.

12
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:34,965
As usual, we'll give you a one-week
probation period.

13
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:38,045
If you're incapable of satisfying us
within the given period,

14
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,085
I'm sorry, but you'll have to resign.

15
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,805
Well, I have something to attend to.

16
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,485
You be nice to each other, okay? Bye.

17
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:51,925
Splendor, I want splendor!
Don't you get it?

18
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:54,205
You have got to be kidding me
with that kind of budget.

19
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,045
We can't have an evening party like this.

20
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:59,885
Hua Munian, she'll be your assistant
for next week.

21
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:02,645
Don't hesitate to tell her
to do any chore.

22
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,885
That way, you'll help me see if she has
what it takes to be in the council.

23
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:08,885
If you find that she's unable
to satisfy us within the given period...

24
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:11,845
You can kick her out.

25
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:18,645
Hello, I am Hua Munian,
head of entertainment department.

26
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:20,445
Hello.

27
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,845
I am Chen Qingqing,
the head of entertainment's assistant.

28
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:24,965
Sorry, I don't like lame jokes.

29
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,285
I hope you don't mind.

30
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:35,565
I don't blame you, but personal hygiene
is my highest priority.

31
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:40,365
You know I always strive
to always keep my mind and body clean.

32
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:43,725
A rookie like you should be honored
to be able to join "Project Hua,"

33
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:44,925
even if it brings me grief.

34
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:49,845
Even though you're but a tiny screw
in our grand project, but--

35
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:53,645
That was gross!

36
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:54,645
I'm sorry!

37
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,685
-I'm sorry!
-Stop!

38
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,565
-Let me--
-I said, stop!

39
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:04,165
Do you know that water will ruin my coat?

40
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,085
God gave you a simple mind
and an ordinary look.

41
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,485
You should act the way you look.

42
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:14,685
I find the way you speak
quite interesting.

43
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,524
Hey, be serious.

44
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:22,765
How did you get into a conflict
with Lan Xinya?

45
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,485
You have to be careful around her.

46
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,165
The last time I wore the same outfit
as her, she gazed at me.

47
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,605
Boy, it scared me.

48
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:33,085
So can I begin with my first task now,
chief?

49
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:35,285
There are a few chairs over that side.

50
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:37,325
-Take them to the activity room.
-Okay.

51
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:39,325
-I'll wait for you there.
-Okay.

52
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:42,405
See you, chief!

53
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:46,405
A few chairs.

54
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,965
All right, we'll send them in a minute.

55
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:03,805
Chief!

56
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,525
I've moved them all!

57
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,205
Come here, baby!

58
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:13,645
Next, I'm going to give you
an even harder task.

59
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,205
"Supplies Procurement Checklist.

60
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:19,405
Bubble machines, dry ice machines,
salvo cannons,

61
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,205
inkjet posters, microphones,
audio systems, balloons..."

62
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:24,525
That's a lot!

63
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:27,085
-I have to get them all by myself?
-That's right.

64
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:31,005
Well, how much is the budget for all this?

65
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:32,165
Let me get it out.

66
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:33,565
Here.

67
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:35,205
Wait, there's more.

68
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:39,485
Go.

69
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:41,085
Are you kidding me?

70
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:42,925
Baby, come here.

71
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,645
I've heard about how well you ran
your errands service.

72
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:49,005
So I tailored this task just for you.

73
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:58,245
I have a really good news
to tell you guys.

74
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,965
-But don't be shocked.
-What is it?

75
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:04,565
Next Saturday at 8 p.m.,

76
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:09,045
His Highness will sing for the newcomers
at the party!

77
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:14,045
-Welcome to my domain
-My domain

78
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,045
-It won't take you a lot
-It won't take you a lot

79
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,045
-A toast and you're my homie
-A toast and you're my homie

80
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,445
-For nothing, don't call me!
-For nothing, don't call me!

81
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:23,405
Look.

82
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:27,845
There's so much blood. It's so violent.

83
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:32,045
But I like it.

84
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:34,605
Are you nuts?

85
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,845
This is an insult to His Highness.

86
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,405
Who drew this?

87
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,845
"Hebiancao?"

88
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:48,125
Sisters, let's plunder his Weibo!

89
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:54,005
So you think you're awesome?

90
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:56,205
Rocking the world
with that rotten pen of yours.

91
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,925
Hey, author, you're a piece of turd.

92
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:00,085
It will be a year's worth of gross
when I step on you.

93
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,365
Who do you think you are?

94
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:03,245
Why don't you stand beside the sun?

95
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:05,765
Are you trying to pick on me?

96
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,845
Sure, bring it on!

97
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:10,365
What a bunch of scoundrels.

98
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,765
Your mouths reek of gutter oil
when you speak.

99
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,525
It's so bad, it pollutes the earth!

100
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,885
Can you get back to work now?

101
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:30,205
It begins now.

102
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:33,005
-Your math tutoring.
-I have to go to the bathroom.

103
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,325
Then I have to go tell the witch.

104
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:42,805
Open your workbook
to page 29, question five.

105
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:46,845
Based on your IQ level,

106
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,085
we'll start from the basics.

107
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,325
Derive the angles
based on the known conditions.

108
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:58,245
Baby, how is the funding going?

109
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:10,325
What the hell?

110
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:12,285
Who told you to use the protractor?

111
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:14,885
Why can't I?

112
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,645
Situ Feng.

113
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:19,485
Your IQ level

114
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,805
is just like the oxygen in the Himalayas.

115
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:25,445
-And that is?
-Thin.

116
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:30,805
I have to rehearse. Bye.

117
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:36,405
Rehearse?

118
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:40,205
When breathing hurts

119
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,804
Without you

120
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:07,885
That was great!

121
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,005
Who would've thought Your Highness

122
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:12,125
could sing in such a mind-bending way?

123
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:13,445
You sang so well.

124
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:16,285
You hit those notes of despair and grudge
right to the bone.

125
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,085
-It reminded me when I was 17--
-But

126
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:20,325
you suggested

127
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:22,845
for "Breath" to be included
in your new album.

128
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,845
I don't think it fits.

129
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:29,405
Whether it fits the album or not
should be up for discussion.

130
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,165
Why doesn't it fit?

131
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:33,605
Can you tell us why, Ms. Wang?

132
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,605
From my perspective,

133
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:37,645
you're my product.

134
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:40,725
I truly appreciate your spirit
of exploration in music.

135
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:42,325
But you change your style a lot.

136
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:43,685
Your fans won't stick around

137
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:45,605
if you don't have a distinct personality.

138
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,765
The competition is so tough now.

139
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:50,165
It'd be suicidal if you keep doing this.

140
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:52,965
That was so insightful of you, Ms. Wang.

141
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:56,285
We've wasted so much effort
on your positioning and image.

142
00:09:56,685 --> 00:10:00,205
At first, you were going to be
like the ruthless kind of performer.

143
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:03,205
Then all of a sudden,
you're crooning love songs.

144
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:06,125
-Isn't this--
-Can't I just write the songs I like?

145
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,285
I think that

146
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:11,405
his own works deserve some promotion too.
What do you think, Ms. Wang?

147
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,485
As you can see,

148
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:15,205
our agency takes care of the idols image.

149
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,925
Of course you are talented.

150
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,365
But for now,

151
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:21,845
we need you

152
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:25,005
to give the market what they want.

153
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:27,765
You have to take our business
into consideration.

154
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:29,685
But--

155
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,805
Daniel, I need to take this.

156
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:35,085
You guys go ahead.

157
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:38,245
-Talk to Feng nicely, okay?
-Okay.

158
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,685
Hello? Mr. Li.

159
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:44,445
The site for the press conference
is too small.

160
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,885
Don't be discouraged.
I'll try it again for you.

161
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:54,965
Why are you looking at me?

162
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,205
I'm also in despair.

163
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,245
You saw it!

164
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,605
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:38,885
Ever since then,

166
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:42,165
I'm being punished

167
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:48,765
When breathing hurts without you

168
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,125
If I have to choose the best one

169
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:56,685
among your compositions,

170
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,285
I'll choose this one.

171
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,605
Is it because of Xinyu?

172
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:05,405
Yes.

173
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:07,805
I wrote this song

174
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:10,645
just for her.

175
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:14,525
I wish

176
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:16,205
that she could listen to this.

177
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,365
But the agency won't let me promote it.

178
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:23,405
If I don't sing it at the party,

179
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,085
then...

180
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,765
I won't get another chance.

181
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:43,645
Situ Feng.

182
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,645
Where are you going so late?

183
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:47,565
To rehearse.

184
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:51,245
But I need to tutor you for math tonight.

185
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,005
The party is around the corner.

186
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,205
I have to practice my song.

187
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,085
Really? Hurry along then.

188
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:57,965
But don't ever hold up your studies.

189
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,605
We have a math test next week.

190
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:03,045
If you end up at the bottom again,

191
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,685
not only will you embarrass me,

192
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:07,085
but the headlines are going to go,

193
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:10,965
"Up-and-coming Idol Situ Feng
Flunks in College!"

194
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:14,965
Where are you going?

195
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,205
To the classroom.

196
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:19,445
It's locked. Come with me.

197
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,085
-Hurry.
-What are we doing here?

198
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:28,965
Gosh. Hurry.

199
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:30,885
Go in.

200
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:35,485
Aren't we studying math?
What are we doing here?

201
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,405
We are.

202
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:38,925
It's so peaceful and quiet here,

203
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:40,925
so it's the best place to study.

204
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:51,765
SITU FENG CAMPUS DEBUT
AND WORLD EXCLUSIVE PREMIERE

205
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,005
SUPREME MAPLE

206
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:57,725
Up next, presenting the star of today,

207
00:13:58,285 --> 00:14:00,925
Situ Feng.

208
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,125
Love you. Go for it.

209
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:07,645
Go for it.

210
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,125
Good evening, everyone.

211
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:16,885
I am Situ Feng.

212
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:24,685
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

213
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:27,405
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

214
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:32,645
Your Highness has arrived

215
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:37,445
There's a cool man at the top

216
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:40,685
Ordinary men should step down

217
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:43,245
Welcome to my domain

218
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:44,885
-It won't take you a lot
-Baby!

219
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,685
-A toast and you're my homie
-You're here!

220
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,645
How did you get Feng to come here?

221
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:50,765
I'm his assistant.

222
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:53,165
I asked him to come and help
and he agreed to.

223
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,685
Situ Feng!

224
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:57,845
How much did a ticket cost?

225
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,365
A ticket costs them 1,000 yuan.

226
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:01,685
And there are 100 of them.

227
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,245
That makes it 100,000 yuan.

228
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:06,885
My evening party will be dazzling
with that amount of money.

229
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:09,245
-Thank you so much, baby!
-Stop!

230
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:17,005
Your Highness has arrived

231
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,165
There's a cool man at the top

232
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:24,445
Ordinary men should step down

233
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:31,485
I'll leave this to you.

234
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:32,965
And Feng too.

235
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,125
-I have to go, bye!
-Okay.

236
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,605
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

237
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:52,565
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

238
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:03,685
Thank you, everyone!

239
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,125
Fangfang.

240
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,845
Okay, you've worked hard today.

241
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:26,445
All the preparations went well.

242
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,005
The school's board looked pleased.

243
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,365
Especially with you both.

244
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:35,165
Thank you for the compliments.

245
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:48,885
Why aren't you happy?

246
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,765
Just don't take into heart
what our boss said.

247
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,525
She's just that kind of person, right?

248
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:56,365
-The hair is done.
-Okay.

249
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:58,685
The party is about to start.
I'll take you backstage.

250
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:01,325
Okay.

251
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:06,244
Is everything set?

252
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,925
Don't worry. I'll set it up.

253
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,285
What is set?

254
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:15,685
Set what up? Who's setting up?
I don't get it!

255
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,165
Up next,

256
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,005
presenting our school's popular idol,
Situ Feng,

257
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,484
-to sing us a song.
-Your Highness!

258
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:23,165
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

259
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:29,364
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

260
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:36,125
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

261
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:42,525
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

262
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:45,885
What's wrong with him?

263
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,045
Why isn't he singing?

264
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,325
What's going on?

265
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,045
-Are you in charge of the microphones?
-Yes.

266
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,365
-Do you know where you put them?
-Yes, they're backstage.

267
00:17:57,445 --> 00:17:58,805
I know where they are. I'll get them.

268
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:01,405
You better find them,
or they'll wreck the stage!

269
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:07,125
What the hell happened?

270
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:08,685
Goodness.

271
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:13,685
I definitely put it here.

272
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:17,005
Who's there?

273
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,365
Stop!

274
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,205
What are you doing backstage?

275
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:27,165
I...

276
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,125
I didn't take the microphones!

277
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,605
Dalei!

278
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,125
I went to take the microphones.

279
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,925
Suddenly, a heroine appeared.

280
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,285
Then I lost the microphones.

281
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:50,765
-A heroine?
-Yes.

282
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,605
-I'm sorry!
-Hey, what are you doing?

283
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:57,805
Wait.

284
00:18:58,725 --> 00:18:59,805
Isn't that Qingqing?

285
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:05,125
Where is the mic stand?

286
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:06,045
Mic stand?

287
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:10,165
It's me.

288
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:11,725
I'll be the mic stand.

289
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,685
You may start now.

290
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,325
I've never promoted this song before.

291
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,885
I'd like to dedicate it

292
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,325
to a special,

293
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,325
special person.

294
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,605
I hope you'll like it.

295
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:42,165
You are all useless!

296
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:54,565
As the ocean falls into deep silence

297
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,885
The wind blows to the bottom of my heart

298
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:05,165
Looking at you from a distance
In my memories

299
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,885
A familiar figure I see from behind

300
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:11,445
I didn't manage

301
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:15,205
To grab your hand

302
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:23,685
If I ever see you again

303
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:30,725
Even if just to say hello

304
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:34,485
Time will fish me out of the sea

305
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:38,245
While my heart is left adrift

306
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:40,045
All that's left

307
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,765
Is a chill in the air

308
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:47,365
To sigh with me

309
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,045
I took off my hand

310
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:56,205
And let you go

311
00:20:57,565 --> 00:21:03,685
I couldn't pretend that you weren't here

312
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:07,765
Ever since then,

313
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:11,285
I'm being punished

314
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:17,045
When breathing hurts without you

315
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:19,285
He's singing so well!

316
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:22,245
I took off my hand

317
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:25,645
And let you go

318
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:33,325
I couldn't pretend that you weren't here

319
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:36,885
Ever since then

320
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:40,565
I'm being punished

321
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:47,165
When breathing hurts without you

322
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:52,565
When breathing hurts

323
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,525
Without you

324
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:34,245
Why didn't you follow our plan?

325
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,045
You insisted on singing "Breath"!

326
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:38,205
Never mind.

327
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:40,285
Mei, take him to rest.

328
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,325
Damn it.

329
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:52,445
Hey! Fangfang, listen up--

330
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:11,605
Done.

331
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:19,085
Qingqing.

332
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:22,205
What is it?

333
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:24,125
I...

334
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:27,685
I forgot.

335
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:40,925
Please turn to page 32.

336
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:45,365
We will continue to talk
about the inscribed circle of triangle

337
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:48,965
and find the radius r
of the inscribed circle

338
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:51,365
based on the conditional angles
A, I and B.

339
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:55,365
We've discussed this diagram before,
so it's a common question...

340
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:57,685
Hey, what happened to your hand?

341
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:01,005
It's nothing, it's just a scratch.

342
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:21,885
What's that?

343
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:24,965
A band-aid?

344
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:26,605
Yes.

345
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,045
For me?

346
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:29,445
Yes.

347
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:41,125
Hey.

348
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:44,485
Is this a caricature of you?

349
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:46,965
It looks ugly.

350
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:50,445
-Hey. Give it back if you don't want it.
-I want it.

351
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:54,645
Who on earth would take back

352
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:56,445
what they just gave to someone?

353
00:24:57,485 --> 00:25:01,605
Besides, I hurt my hands because of you.

354
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:04,885
So there's nothing peculiar
about sticking your head on it.

355
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,685
Are you humming my song from yesterday?

356
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:30,125
You picked it up so fast.

357
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:40,045
Who told you to keep the melody so simple?

358
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,205
Of course I'd pick it up fast.

359
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:56,125
Is something wrong with me?

360
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,325
It's 120 beats per minute?

361
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:04,885
Qingqing.

362
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,125
What's wrong?

363
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:09,085
I don't know what's going on.

364
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:12,365
My heart is beating strangely lately.

365
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,445
Sometimes, it throbs so fast.

366
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:17,885
Isn't there anyone you like?

367
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:20,005
Fangfang.

368
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:21,885
You have got to be kidding me.

369
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:24,725
I'm Chen Qingqing. Who do I like?

370
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,725
I'm about to go out.

371
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:29,165
Do you want me to buy something?

372
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:31,085
No, thanks.

373
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,485
He's so handsome.

374
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:08,045
Situ Feng!

375
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,605
The comic has got a new update.

376
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,245
Let's see how badly
he disses His Highness this time.

377
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:19,765
He says,

378
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,885
"His Highness sang a song of resentment."

379
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:25,605
And the lyrics sounds a lot like "Breath."

380
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:29,005
How about we upload
a recording of that song

381
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:31,245
-and see what the fans think?
-Yeah.

382
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:37,365
SITU FENG NEW SONG
"BREATH" IS SO PLEASANT.

383
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,045
Since it's so well-received...

384
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,205
We'll include "Breath"
into your upcoming album.

385
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:50,405
Look at yourself.

386
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:53,365
Do you really think you could be
in Situ Feng's music video?

387
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:55,605
This is Situ Feng's music video?

388
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:59,365
Are you not aware that they're looking
for someone with outstanding qualities?

389
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,285
Qualities?

390
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:02,965
I have them.

391
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:07,165
So what if you've got so many supporters?

392
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:10,125
You can't even eat a bar of chocolate.

393
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:12,005
If you help me run errands...

394
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:15,485
You could eat plenty of snacks.
Nobody would notice.

395
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,805
