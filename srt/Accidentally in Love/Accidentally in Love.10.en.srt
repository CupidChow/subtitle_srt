A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:59,165
EPISODE 10

3
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:05,485
Thank you, Feng.

4
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:18,885
What a coincidence.

5
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:20,885
Well, you're here too.

6
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,125
That's right.

7
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:23,205
What a coincidence.

8
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:24,445
Why are you two together?

9
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:27,085
Chen Qingqing.

10
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,125
Since I have some free time today,

11
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,765
I'll educate you about wine.

12
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,605
Give me the 1978 Burgundy wine.

13
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:38,845
All right, please wait.

14
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,405
Let me get this straight.

15
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,845
I was the one who invited Gu Nanxi
to dine here today.

16
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,165
-She's going all out.
-That's right.

17
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,445
I wanted to thank Gu Nanxi

18
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:57,205
because he saved me from being framed.

19
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,485
By the way, Xinya,

20
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:01,725
I really want to thank you.

21
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:06,925
Burgundy wine from 1978 is the best.

22
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,045
You should drink a lot.

23
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:13,845
But it's a pity that
you don't know how to appreciate it.

24
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:17,765
You're right. 1978 is a great year.

25
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,325
Too bad that it's too old
and causes instability.

26
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:23,245
If it was up to me,
I would choose the one from 2005.

27
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:26,045
Wines from that year
are very rich in flavor.

28
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,925
They are highly valued
among all vintage wines.

29
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:30,445
With their strong density
and great structure,

30
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:33,685
the wines are of the best quality
in recent years.

31
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:36,085
How did you know about this?

32
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:38,925
I was just bluffing.

33
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:41,365
I don't usually drink on normal days.

34
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,165
You're good at memorizing.

35
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,485
Since you're so knowledgeable,

36
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,885
you should drink more then.

37
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,845
Chen Qingqing, do you know how to drink?

38
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,205
Don't waste it.

39
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:56,725
It's none of your business.

40
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:58,765
Qingqing doesn't really drink.

41
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:00,605
I'll drink for her.

42
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:06,605
Qingqing, you're so almighty.

43
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,485
Even Gu Nanxi
wants to be your white knight.

44
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:10,965
Feng.

45
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,085
You need to drink for me.

46
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:31,645
Cheers! Let's drink.

47
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,405
Here.

48
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:51,645
Drink two more glasses.

49
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:55,565
I'm telling all of you.

50
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,445
I'm not drunk.

51
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,685
I can still drink.

52
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,325
It's late.

53
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,445
Let's go home.

54
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:09,165
Nanxi.

55
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:10,645
My driver is here.

56
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:13,205
Why don't I send all of you home?

57
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:14,565
Xinya.

58
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,365
That's not convenient for you.

59
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:17,765
I'll take care of Situ Feng.

60
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:18,765
You can go home first.

61
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:21,165
All right.

62
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:24,285
Bye.

63
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:34,365
If he couldn't drink,
he shouldn't have drunk so much.

64
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,085
Gu Nanxi, I'll go home too.

65
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,445
Look, Qingqing.

66
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,125
I have something that I haven't told you.

67
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,245
What is it?

68
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:47,245
Actually, Situ Feng was the one who helped

69
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:48,765
find the surveillance footage.

70
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,125
Really?

71
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:58,845
It's already late.

72
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,205
You should go home.

73
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:01,565
I'll take care of him.

74
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:03,845
Gu Nanxi.

75
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:05,765
Thanks for telling me.

76
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:09,405
-I'll go home first. See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

77
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:19,125
Situ Feng.

78
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:20,525
Situ Feng.

79
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:22,605
Hey.

80
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,405
Where's Qingqing?

81
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:31,965
She went back to school.

82
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:34,965
School?

83
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:36,645
I'll go back to school too.

84
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,485
Hang on, I'll send you.

85
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,805
-There's no need.
-Be careful.

86
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:43,525
Slow down.

87
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,125
It's already so late.
Shouldn't you go home?

88
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:01,445
Why did you come here instead?

89
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:10,485
Gu Nanxi! I demand a duel!

90
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,405
You're already drunk.

91
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:13,805
Yet, you want a duel.

92
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:17,725
Cut the crap! Come at me.

93
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:19,965
Let's have a duel then.

94
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:21,325
I'm not afraid of you.

95
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,205
Come on.

96
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:06,685
Let's do it again.

97
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:18,685
What's wrong with you?

98
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:20,685
You're so fierce today.

99
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:25,205
I always told you not to act cool
during the match.

100
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:26,685
You never listened.

101
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:29,365
Your performance today was awesome.

102
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:31,885
Hey.

103
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,645
Hey! Are you asleep?

104
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:37,965
Where is he?

105
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,564
Chen Qingqing!

106
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,965
Chen Qingqing!

107
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:53,685
Chen Qingqing!

108
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,605
Chen Qingqing! Come out!

109
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:00,765
Situ Feng.

110
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:04,925
Hello, everyone.

111
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,405
Did anyone see Qingqing?

112
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:09,445
-No.
-No.

113
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,125
Who is it?

114
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:13,645
It must be a love confession.

115
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:14,805
Let's go and take a look.

116
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:23,925
That scared me.

117
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:26,685
Who is it?

118
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:29,205
-Is he confessing?
-Am I dreaming?

119
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:30,205
Isn't that Situ Feng?

120
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:32,245
-Why is it not working?
-What is he doing?

121
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:35,645
All right.

122
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:37,325
Chen Qingqing!

123
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:39,085
It's that Chen Qingqing again.

124
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:40,165
Chen Qingqing!

125
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,805
Chen Qingqing!

126
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:45,645
Go to him.

127
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,165
Chen Qingqing!

128
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:50,085
Come over here!

129
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,285
Do you want to die, Situ Feng?

130
00:09:57,365 --> 00:10:00,245
Why did you come here
to scream at me at this hour?

131
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:03,405
Chen Qingqing.

132
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:04,645
I'm telling you.

133
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:06,045
Lower down your voice.

134
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,405
Don't let others know that I'm here!

135
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:12,965
Lower your voice.

136
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:17,125
Situ Feng.

137
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,445
Can you cut it out?
What do you want to say?

138
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:21,605
If you're not saying anything,
I'm leaving.

139
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:22,805
Chen Qingqing!

140
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,845
Wait up! I have a question to ask you.

141
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:27,605
What is it?

142
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:29,965
Chen Qingqing!

143
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,205
What's your relationship with them?

144
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,925
Them? Who are you talking about?

145
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:39,005
You have Hua Munian and Gu Nanxi.

146
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,845
That was for my errands service business.

147
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:45,405
They can help my store
and help me earn money.

148
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:46,805
Money?

149
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:48,725
I have a lot of money.

150
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,285
Look at this.

151
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:51,365
I'll give you my wallet.

152
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:52,325
Hang on.

153
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,805
Here. Five yuan, one yuan

154
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,205
and five mao.

155
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,845
I have coins too.

156
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,125
Three of them.

157
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:00,605
Situ Feng.

158
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:02,485
Can you cut it out?

159
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:05,245
Chen Qingqing.

160
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,245
Don't talk to them anymore, okay?

161
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:11,485
You're mine.

162
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,205
Situ Feng is going to kiss her.

163
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,005
Situ Feng.

164
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:30,765
Situ Feng.

165
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:32,805
How did he disappear so quickly?

166
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,685
-Gu Nanxi.
-Turns out, he was here.

167
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:35,845
He fell asleep.

168
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:38,445
Be careful.

169
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:41,245
He came to find you at this hour.

170
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,165
Did he have anything important
to tell you?

171
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,165
No.

172
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,005
It's nothing. He didn't say anything.

173
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,245
Bring him back quickly.

174
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:50,565
All right, have a good rest.

175
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:53,005
Let's go, Situ Feng.

176
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,245
It's this way.

177
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:57,205
Goodness.

178
00:11:58,525 --> 00:11:59,365
Wake up.

179
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:01,485
Wake up.

180
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:03,485
My tooth hurts.

181
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:12,885
I'm sorry, everyone.

182
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,445
I'm sorry, everyone.

183
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:15,845
Sorry for disturbing you.

184
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:16,805
Let's go to sleep.

185
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:19,125
Let's go to sleep.

186
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,405
Dismiss!

187
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:28,405
What's wrong?

188
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:29,765
Fangfang.

189
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:31,565
Didn't you hear it?

190
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:33,765
Everyone is talking

191
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:35,645
about what happened last night.

192
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,005
Look at them.

193
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:40,925
They are mimicking him.

194
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,205
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

195
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,245
Situ Feng is here.

196
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:52,285
He's here.

197
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:05,965
Qingqing, I'm going
to hand in my assignment.

198
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:07,845
Fangfang.

199
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:51,885
If you want to study,
you should clear your mind.

200
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,285
See? You're holding it upside down.

201
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,725
As for you, you're going
to tear up the paper.

202
00:13:57,365 --> 00:13:59,045
Are you thinking about breakfast?

203
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:01,645
Hurry up.

204
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,005
Study after you finish it.

205
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,445
Thank you.

206
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,805
I'll leave you two to it.

207
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:12,245
I'm going first.

208
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,325
Why are you looking for me?

209
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,805
Take a look at it.

210
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,565
You're really something.

211
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:36,485
What is it?

212
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:37,765
PITIFUL ASSISTANT WAS YELLED AT

213
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,445
This...

214
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:42,605
What do they mean by "pitiful assistant"?

215
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:43,965
Why am I pitiful?

216
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,765
Shouldn't they interpret this

217
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,325
as a love confession in the dorm?

218
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,165
I know you two don't like each other.

219
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:54,685
But can both of you
quarrel at the right place?

220
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:56,605
You fought in the middle of the night.

221
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,485
-But your appearance--
-What about it?

222
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,205
Nothing, it's great.

223
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:01,405
There won't be any gossip.

224
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:06,365
The press has been doubting
your identity as the assistant recently.

225
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:09,645
Plus, do you know what they will write
about the picture from last night?

226
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:12,245
But that's not what happened.

227
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,445
At this rate, we might
as well put on a whole show.

228
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,405
Situ Feng has a press conference tomorrow.

229
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:18,885
The press will be there.

230
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,325
You'll go with him.

231
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:25,725
Show them that both of you
are having a harmonious friendship.

232
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,285
Everything will be fine
after I send them some news.

233
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:29,565
Hang on.

234
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:33,085
Are you asking me
to be his assistant for real?

235
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,245
What else then?

236
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,605
My little master.

237
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,445
I know you want to focus
on producing music.

238
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:46,365
You don't want to know
about the business side.

239
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,565
But if we don't do any business...

240
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:50,165
If we don't do movies or commercials,

241
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:52,525
where can we get the money
to promote your music?

242
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:56,165
Do you know how much loss
the agency has suffered

243
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:58,605
because you suddenly wanted to cancel
the release of "Breath"?

244
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,405
The boss is really unhappy now.

245
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,405
He took back the funds for promotion.

246
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,885
I used my own money to promote your music.

247
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:08,085
Don't you believe me?

248
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:09,085
Look at this.

249
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,605
All of my credit cards are maxed out.

250
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:14,765
If it wasn't for the money
I loaned from the 9FBank app,

251
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:17,845
I would have exploded as well,
just like my credit card.

252
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:21,565
All right, I understand.

253
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:23,405
I'll do it, okay?

254
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:25,045
Tell me. What is it that you want?

255
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:29,285
The movie tomorrow
is directed by the famous Wang Jingwei.

256
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:33,565
Plus, Chen Qingqing is willing
to cooperate and be your assistant.

257
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:36,125
What? Chen Qingqing is coming too?

258
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,005
Don't worry, I'll be there tomorrow.

259
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:40,405
As long as you cooperate
with your deskmate,

260
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:42,325
I guarantee that nothing will happen.

261
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,605
All right, I'll go.

262
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:45,845
I'll go, okay?

263
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:49,685
Qingqing, you're here.

264
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:53,165
When we reach there,
you should focus on acting.

265
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,245
You just stay by his side.

266
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:59,205
If you see the press, both of you
should act nice to each other.

267
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,485
Leave the rest to me.

268
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:04,325
Hello? Yes, sir.

269
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:07,125
But I'm going with Situ Feng.

270
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:10,244
All right, I'll come back now.

271
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,885
-Daniel.
-Yes?

272
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:15,765
Are you leaving?

273
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:18,045
There's a problem at the office.
I need to deal with it.

274
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,885
What about us, Daniel?

275
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:23,405
As long as you don't fight,
you will be fine.

276
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,525
Remember my advice.

277
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,724
Maintain your smile
when you see the press.

278
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,045
Be humble when you meet the director.

279
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,205
Thanks for today, Qingqing.

280
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:34,765
See. The boss is calling again.

281
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,485
Hello? Yes, sir.

282
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,005
Situ Feng.

283
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:06,405
Can you hear me?

284
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:08,805
I can't.

285
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:16,085
Why did you come to my dorm that night?

286
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:17,925
You said that I'm yours.

287
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,965
That night, I wanted to say
that you're my assistant.

288
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:25,325
Don't create any trouble and embarrass me.

289
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:30,605
You came to my dorm at that hour
just to tell me that?

290
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:32,325
That's right.

291
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:34,085
What did you think I wanted to tell you?

292
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:35,485
Nothing.

293
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,845
I didn't think anything.

294
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,285
What should I say later?

295
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:48,965
You should just say anything you please.

296
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:53,245
How do you feel working
with Mr. Wang for the first time?

297
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,245
It's an honor to work with Mr. Wang.

298
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,485
I'll take this opportunity
to learn from him.

299
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,525
There's a rumor
that you bully your assistant.

300
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,605
Regarding the accusation,
what do you have to say?

301
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:06,725
Hello, fellow reporters.

302
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:09,125
I'm Situ Feng's assistant.

303
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,445
I'm Chen Qingqing.

304
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,165
Do I look like I'm being bullied?

305
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:15,765
I'm very close
with His Highness in real life.

306
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:16,885
It's the truth.

307
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:18,085
Am I right, Your Highness?

308
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:20,285
Yes, we're close.

309
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:22,165
So please stand aside, everyone.

310
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,885
-Please move aside.
-You can't take photos.

311
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:26,525
Please come here.

312
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:29,285
Mr. Wang.

313
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,925
Situ Feng is here.

314
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:34,085
Hello, Mr. Wang.
It's a pleasure to work with you.

315
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:36,405
-Hello, young talent.
-Thank you, Mr. Wang.

316
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:37,565
This is my co-director, Li.

317
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,125
He'll explain to you later.

318
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:41,525
After his explanation,
you'll have to wait.

319
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:42,765
That's all.

320
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:43,805
-All right.
-Okay.

321
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,205
Your scenes will be filmed later.
You can wait at the side.

322
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:50,005
-I'll call you when it's time, okay?
-Okay.

323
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:51,725
-Please come with me.
-Okay.

324
00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:54,765
This is your script. Please go through it.

325
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:04,125
-Do you want me to read it?
-You should understand it too.

326
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:17,965
Situ Feng. When will it be our turn?

327
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:20,445
I think we have to wait for a while.

328
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:27,685
Excuse me, Mr. Li.

329
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:29,965
I'm Situ Feng's assistant.

330
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,965
I want to ask you something.
When will it be our turn?

331
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:35,565
Take a look. There's a delay.

332
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:36,845
Both of you still have to wait.

333
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,405
Aren't you playing us for fools?

334
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:42,965
So what about it?

335
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:46,325
What I meant to say is

336
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:50,085
there's no heater here.
Everyone's suffering.

337
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,365
Everyone's working
in the same environment.

338
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:54,125
Wear thicker clothes if you're cold.

339
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,205
Qingqing.

340
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,125
Don't be angry.

341
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:03,165
It seems like it'll be a while
before our turn.

342
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,285
Here, wear my jacket.

343
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,645
Don't catch a cold.

344
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:10,005
If not, the press will say
that I'm torturing my assistant.

345
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:11,285
Aren't you cold?

346
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:13,565
Me? I'm fine.

347
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:35,805
It's your turn, Situ Feng.

348
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:39,245
You were supposed to talk
by the swimming pool, right?

349
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:41,405
-Yes.
-There's an extra scene.

350
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:43,125
You'll have to swim.

351
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:44,605
What?

352
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:45,965
Is there a problem?

353
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:48,045
You didn't say that I had to swim.

354
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:51,005
Plus, I'm not that good at swimming.

355
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,565
Can you find a substitute?

356
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,565
We're going to start filming now.
Where can I find a substitute for you?

357
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:57,525
Hurry up and prepare.

358
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:58,965
The whole world is waiting for you.

359
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:02,045
Situ Feng.

360
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:03,365
Is it our turn now?

361
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:06,285
What's wrong with you?

362
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:09,925
There's an extra scene.

363
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:11,765
I need to swim.

364
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:12,725
Swim?

365
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,525
Can you really not swim?

366
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:27,245
If the sponsors
didn't insist on hiring him,

367
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:30,765
do you think Mr. Wang
would use a useless idol like him?

368
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:31,885
I'm telling you.

369
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:35,165
He's acting up just because
he has some fans.

370
00:22:35,965 --> 00:22:39,525
Let's show him who's boss
on behalf of Mr. Wang.

371
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,485
For this scene,

372
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:43,805
both of you will stand here.

373
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:46,445
After Bao finishes her lines,
she'll push you into the water.

374
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:48,165
All right, ready.

375
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:52,405
Three, two, one. Action!

376
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:54,805
I really don't understand.
Why are you so angry?

377
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:55,725
Neither do I.

378
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:58,965
Even though my name means "precious,"
why does nobody treasure me?

379
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:01,925
Great. Cut!

380
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:09,245
Situ Feng.

381
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:10,965
Come up.

382
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:15,125
Thank you.

383
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:17,325
Hurry.

384
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:20,125
How are you?

385
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:21,525
Was the water too cold?

386
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:22,645
It was great.

387
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:24,565
Sir, there was a mistake.

388
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:25,965
A mistake?

389
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,445
Let's do it again.

390
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:32,845
Situ Feng.

391
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,805
They're doing it on purpose.

392
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:37,285
Qingqing, don't create any trouble.

393
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:41,445
Situ Feng.

394
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:45,645
You don't look like you can't swim.

395
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,965
Are you afraid of the water?

396
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:50,445
Mind your own business.

397
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:02,885
Mr. Wang.

398
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,805
-Mr. Wang.
-What's the matter?

399
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:05,725
Excuse me.

400
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:08,525
Can I be Situ Feng's substitute?

401
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:09,565
You?

402
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:13,405
Sure.

403
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,605
We'll zoom out.

404
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:16,845
Are you okay with it?

405
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:17,885
Thank you, sir.

406
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:19,445
Let's continue after eating.

407
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:23,325
I've already informed the director.
I'll be your substitute.

408
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:25,365
What did you say?

409
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:26,645
I'll be your substitute.

410
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:28,005
Aren't you afraid of water?

411
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:30,485
I just learned how to swim,
so I'll replace you.

412
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:33,085
Chen Qingqing, have you gone mad?

413
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:35,045
I don't need a girl as a substitute.

414
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,445
The director has agreed to it.

415
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:40,325
There's nothing you can do.

416
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:42,565
Everyone, get ready.

417
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:54,445
Three, two, one. Action.

418
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,365
Why does nobody treasure me?

419
00:24:59,285 --> 00:25:00,125
Let's do it again.

420
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:01,605
Why does nobody treasure me?

421
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:06,445
Let's do it again.

422
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:19,645
Okay, this is perfect.

423
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:25,525
Qingqing.

424
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,285
Situ Feng.

425
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:29,965
Don't come here.

426
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:32,405
I don't want to see you.

427
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,125
I'll help you.

428
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:35,525
I'm fine.

429
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:37,165
Pass me the towel.

430
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:38,925
My makeup is ruined.

431
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:41,285
What should I do now?

432
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,325
Qingqing.

433
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:43,965
Are you crying?

434
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,085
I'm fine.

435
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:57,725
Hey, beautiful lady. Where are you going?

436
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:58,845
What's this?

437
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:03,125
What's wrong? Don't leave.
Where are you going?

438
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,565
Let's have fun.

439
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,765
Come, let's play.

440
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:09,805
Hey! Stop it.

441
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:13,805
Who are you?

442
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:17,005
I'm Lin Yiyang.

443
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:21,805
Run.

444
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,125
Are you okay?

445
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:29,525
Why are you here?

446
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:31,205
I'm about to ask you.

447
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:32,405
Why are you here?

448
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:34,965
I work here.

449
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:37,925
-This is my family's restaurant.
-What?

450
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:40,205
Go home.

451
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:48,285
Hey.

452
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,765
I'll take you home.

453
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:22,565
This is my house.

454
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:24,245
I'm leaving then.

455
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,965
Baby, you're home.

456
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:31,325
"Baby"?

457
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,485
Who is this?

458
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:34,565
He's my classmate.

459
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:35,925
He gave me a ride home.

460
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:37,445
This is my dad.

461
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:38,885
He likes to call me "Baby."

462
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:40,205
Hello, sir.

463
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,165
Hello.

464
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:43,925
Baby's classmate.

465
00:27:44,485 --> 00:27:45,925
Thank you for giving her a ride home.

466
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,645
It's time for dinner.

467
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,005
Come inside and eat.

468
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:51,645
It's okay. He's busy.

469
00:27:51,725 --> 00:27:53,245
How can you treat a guest like this?

470
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:55,325
Since you're here, don't be shy.

471
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:56,885
Come.

472
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:01,005
That's right. Come.

473
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:07,445
Let's eat.

474
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:10,285
Don't be shy.

475
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:11,725
Dig in.

476
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:13,325
Here, dig in.

477
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:14,285
Thank you, ma'am.

478
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,085
Baby.

479
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:21,765
Why aren't you eating?

480
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:24,685
Mom cooked all your favorite dishes today.

481
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,725
Aren't these your favorite too?

482
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:27,645
Just eat.

483
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,125
What are you so excited about?

484
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,365
Have some water.

485
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,005
-Drink up.
-Have a drink.

486
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:40,485
Okay.

487
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:44,165
Okay.

488
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:45,765
All right.

489
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:48,885
Our baby

490
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:52,805
has always been clumsy.

491
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:56,045
Thank goodness

492
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,725
she has a friend like you
to take care of her.

493
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:05,285
Hey, why aren't you eating?

494
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:07,765
Do you not like the food?

495
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:09,325
It's not that.

496
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:11,405
When you're home,

497
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:13,885
what dishes do your dad
and mom cook for you?

498
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:15,925
I'll make it for you next time.

499
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:19,485
They aren't at home most of the time.

500
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:21,885
Dig in then.

501
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:23,125
Here, dig in.

502
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:36,125
Hey.

503
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:38,645
Why did you ask me to come here
early in the morning?

504
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:40,085
Don't ask so much.

505
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:42,565
You suddenly left
after yesterday's filming.

506
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:43,525
Qingqing.

507
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:45,685
Are you really okay?

508
00:29:46,805 --> 00:29:47,645
I'm fine.

509
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:48,885
Well...

510
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:50,605
Are you not angry anymore?

511
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:52,445
When did I get angry?

512
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:58,765
You are weird today.

513
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,965
Could it be...

514
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:03,685
What?

515
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:05,725
What do you want to say?

516
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,885
Don't dillydally.

517
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,165
-Let me take you somewhere.
-Where?

518
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:10,765
Cut the crap.

519
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:12,125
Follow me.

520
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,325
I can't believe such a place
exists in our school.

521
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:32,285
I know.

522
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:38,845
Is it for me?

523
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:39,925
Yes.

524
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:42,605
Thank you.

525
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:44,885
What is it called?

526
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:46,605
Its name is the same as yours.

527
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:47,805
It's called Qingqing.

528
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:50,965
It's called Qingqing too?

529
00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:52,445
Yes.

530
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:53,445
Do you know why?

531
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,605
It's because it's ugly like you too.

532
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:04,165
How did you find this place?

533
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:06,565
I discovered it accidentally.

534
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:08,725
It was abandoned long ago.

535
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:10,285
Nobody came at all.

536
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:12,365
I needed a place to rest

537
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,405
so I cleaned up this place.

538
00:31:15,965 --> 00:31:17,765
You're quite romantic.

539
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:20,645
Qingqing.

540
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:24,445
This is the first time
I brought someone here.

541
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,405
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

542
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:30,165
Am I the first person

543
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:31,685
just because

544
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,845
you're thankful
that I became your assistant?

545
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,525
If I do it a few more times,

546
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:41,965
will you really fall in love with me?

547
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:46,285
Fall in love with you? It's better for me
to fall in love with the plants.

548
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,605
Today is His Highness's album release day.

549
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,725
Didn't you go to buy his album?
Why do you look like this?

550
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:03,845
I've already bought them.

551
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:07,565
But I discovered something odd.

552
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:08,485
What is it?

553
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:10,965
Look at the new album's song list.

554
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:12,525
"Breath" isn't here.

555
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:15,205
I thought it was hidden earlier.

556
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:18,245
But I listened to the entire album.

557
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:20,125
The song is not there.

558
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,845
It's not on the album.

559
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:25,485
I thought His Highness
wanted to try a new genre.

560
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,485
He even filmed a music video
for this song.

561
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:29,085
Right, I heard that

562
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:32,365
the agency went to all the trouble
to release this song.

563
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:33,725
Why isn't it on the album?

564
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:36,245
Did the agency stop him from releasing it?

565
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,485
It's possible.

566
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:39,765
I found it odd.

567
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:41,325
The agency only wants to earn money.

568
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:43,525
Why would they let
His Highness easily change his style?

569
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:48,325
We can't let all the hard work
of His Highness go to waste.

570
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:51,045
Yes, we must protect our idol!

571
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:58,765
All right, I hacked into their computer.

572
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:02,125
Did you find "Breath"?

573
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:04,485
Hurry, download it.

574
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:05,925
DOWNLOAD COMPLETE

575
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:14,645
If I'm not mistaken,

576
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:17,085
this is a man's jacket.

577
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:20,005
The candidate list for the school's play
has been announced.

578
00:33:20,485 --> 00:33:22,525
Qingqing, look. You made the cut.

579
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:24,885
Do you think you can be the main actress?

580
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,645
Feng.

581
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:39,805
-What?
-What's wrong?

582
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,125
Why do you look so serious?

583
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:43,005
Nothing, it's just the agency.

584
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,525
