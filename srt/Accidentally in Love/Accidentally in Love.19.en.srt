A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,285
EPISODE 19

3
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:03,525
FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY
NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED

4
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:22,165
Feng, you did a great job.

5
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:23,645
I told you that you could do it.

6
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,565
You're right.

7
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:28,205
His Highness went all out
for this commercial shoot.

8
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:30,445
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

9
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:31,805
Keep up the good work.

10
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,765
You have a bright future ahead of you.

11
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:35,045
Ms. Wang, I'll see you out.

12
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:43,365
Situ Feng.

13
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:44,965
You were amazing.

14
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,965
How did you manage to conquer
your fear of water in such a short time?

15
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:52,005
JINCHENG

16
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:15,645
You said that you were going
to have a chat with me,

17
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:18,245
but you started to doze off
the minute you got here.

18
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:22,845
Don't get me started.

19
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:26,885
You told me on the phone
that you were really sick.

20
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,125
I hurried back to Jincheng
that very night,

21
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:32,525
only to find out
that you caught a small cold.

22
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:36,405
And now,
you wouldn't even let me sleep in.

23
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,845
That's because I missed you so much.

24
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,405
You haven't given me a call

25
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,205
since I last saw you in Yuncheng.

26
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,165
Have you been spending all your time

27
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:54,445
with your deskmate,

28
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:58,165
Situ Feng?

29
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,725
Is that why you've neglected me?

30
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:02,285
Grandpa, what are you talking about?

31
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,365
We're just classmates.

32
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:07,685
Besides,

33
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:11,445
how did you know we share a desk?

34
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:13,805
Did you ask someone to investigate him?

35
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:16,605
That's not necessary.

36
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,805
He's just a singer, isn't he?

37
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:21,084
You did investigate him.

38
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:24,925
All right.

39
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,925
I'm here to keep you company now.

40
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:30,285
I've already asked for a leave.

41
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:31,885
I will spend the entire week

42
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:35,205
with you wholeheartedly.

43
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:36,445
-Really?
-Yes.

44
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:39,445
This makes me happy.

45
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:48,565
Grandpa.

46
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:50,845
Now, can you tell me

47
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,445
the story of my mom and dad?

48
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:00,765
Back then,

49
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,685
your mom went to Yuncheng
to pursue her studies.

50
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:10,125
She came home with your dad
right after she graduated.

51
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,125
She wanted to marry him.

52
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,645
Come to think of it, you and your mom

53
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:19,045
have the exact same temper.

54
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:24,245
She was my only daughter.

55
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,285
How could I let her marry
a teacher from a small town?

56
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,925
I tried to talk her out of it,
but she wouldn't listen.

57
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,525
She moved to Yuncheng with your dad

58
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,325
and they got married.

59
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:40,605
Then, she gave birth to you.

60
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,045
What happened later?

61
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:47,765
A few years later,

62
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,965
your parents went on a trip with you.

63
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:53,525
They had an accident.

64
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,525
Your mom

65
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:00,005
died on the spot.

66
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:03,365
Your dad fell off a cliff

67
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:07,165
and went missing.

68
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,765
I rushed to Yuncheng to pick you up.

69
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:14,765
You were still so young.

70
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,045
You had no idea what had happened.

71
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,365
You were skipping around

72
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,685
and asking for your mom and dad.

73
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:26,325
A few years after I took you in,

74
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:27,525
I received the news

75
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:31,365
that your dad's corpse has been found.

76
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:33,285
Grandpa.

77
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,845
Why didn't you tell me the truth

78
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:39,925
all these years?

79
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:42,485
In the past, I really believed

80
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:48,005
that your dad was to blame for the tragedy

81
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,965
because he took your mom away from me.

82
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,005
I held a grudge against him.

83
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:57,765
So I didn't want to talk about it.

84
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,245
But come to think of it,

85
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:06,045
I was too selfish.

86
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:11,445
You had the right to know the truth.

87
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:16,605
Qingqing.

88
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:20,045
You're not blaming me, are you?

89
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:26,645
Grandpa.

90
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:30,805
You're my grandpa.

91
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:33,405
You're the only family I have left.

92
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:36,765
How could I blame you?

93
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:41,605
Qingqing.

94
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:46,005
You're my only granddaughter.

95
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:50,205
I'm happy. as long as you're happy.

96
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:53,045
I've thought it through.

97
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:57,325
I won't force you
to marry Jingyang anymore.

98
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:00,085
Really?

99
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:01,485
Yes.

100
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:03,885
But you must remember.

101
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,485
Although I'm not going
to force you to marry Jingyang,

102
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:08,485
it doesn't mean
that you can do whatever you want.

103
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:12,605
My future grandson-in-law

104
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,285
must be compatible with our Chen Family

105
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,005
and with you.

106
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:29,165
Hello?

107
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:32,325
What?

108
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:33,645
Tell me again.

109
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:34,725
I said,

110
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:37,205
I'm now at Jincheng airport.

111
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,405
No way, Situ Feng.

112
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:45,405
It's so early.
You should be home sleeping.

113
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:47,285
What the hell are you doing here?

114
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,005
I took the earliest flight to come here.

115
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:51,645
Qingqing, give me your address.
I'll go find you.

116
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:52,805
No!

117
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,485
I mean...

118
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,405
Hold on a second.

119
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:01,165
Grandpa, Situ Feng is here.
What should I do?

120
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:02,205
Grandpa.

121
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:09,085
Hello, Situ Feng?

122
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:11,365
I'm telling you.

123
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:14,325
My grandpa is very mean.

124
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:15,685
He's really mean.

125
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:16,965
Besides,

126
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:21,125
my family is not very well off.

127
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:24,285
I don't want you to see me now.

128
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:27,365
Grandpa.

129
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:29,605
Hello?

130
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,645
Are you Situ Feng?

131
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,565
Are you Qingqing's deskmate in Yuncheng?

132
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,685
Hello, Mr. Chen.

133
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:38,725
All right, then.

134
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,365
Our address is Canglan Village, Beijiao.

135
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,925
Come and we'll meet you here.

136
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:46,725
All right.

137
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:52,085
Qingqing, why do you look so scared?

138
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:53,565
Grandpa.

139
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:55,725
What should we do now?

140
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,485
He came all the way here.

141
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,725
And what did you say just now?

142
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:02,805
Canglan Village?
Where in the world is that?

143
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,045
Don't worry.

144
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:07,205
Just follow my plans.

145
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:11,205
You can take a good look at
Situ Feng's true colors.

146
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:13,605
Follow me.

147
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:33,845
Hello, Qingqing.

148
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:36,205
Why haven't I arrived yet?

149
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,645
I've already driven
more than ten kilometers.

150
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:41,445
Keep going?

151
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:44,445
Okay, I see.

152
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:51,405
CANGLAN VILLAGE

153
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,725
STOP

154
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,325
Situ Feng!

155
00:10:58,725 --> 00:10:59,765
Chen Qingqing.

156
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:07,565
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

157
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:10,125
Are you taking me home with this?

158
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,165
What's wrong with it?

159
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:15,445
I'm a public figure after all.

160
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,805
I don't think this is a good idea.

161
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,245
I don't see anything wrong with it.

162
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,045
You're in the mountains.

163
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,925
You're lucky to even have this.

164
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:25,285
-Are you looking down on this?
-I'm not.

165
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:28,165
It's just that it seems like an antique.

166
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,525
I'm afraid that it might fall apart
if I sit on it.

167
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:31,965
You have a good eye.

168
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:33,725
This is indeed an antique.

169
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:37,405
My great-grandpa passed it down to me.

170
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:39,365
-Your great-grandpa?
-That's right.

171
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:43,245
Well...

172
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,685
Come on. Hop in.

173
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,165
-Pretty boy.
-No.

174
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,125
Let me do it.

175
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:51,925
-Do you know how to ride this?
-I think so.

176
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:52,965
Go ahead.

177
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,045
Be careful.

178
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:55,285
Hold on to it.

179
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:58,765
Let's go.

180
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,245
-Which direction?
-That way.

181
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,085
Turn around.

182
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,285
This must be embarrassing
for a top star like you.

183
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:20,725
This is so fun.

184
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:24,045
-Keep it up, Situ Feng.
-I can ride this forever.

185
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:30,525
You can do it.

186
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:32,885
You can do it.

187
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:36,725
Way to go.

188
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:39,525
We'll be there after that corner.

189
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,645
Go, Situ Feng!

190
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,045
Go, Situ Feng!

191
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:53,445
Go!

192
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:55,645
-Go, Situ Feng!
-Chen Qingqing.

193
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:56,565
Chen Qingqing.

194
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:59,885
This antique is seriously falling apart.

195
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,325
What should we do then?

196
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:03,925
How about this?

197
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:07,205
Why don't you push from behind
while I pedal?

198
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:10,765
-Let's do this. Get off.
-All right.

199
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:12,845
Be careful.

200
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,205
Give me a hand.

201
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:16,045
Come here.

202
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,285
-Be careful.
-Okay.

203
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:22,725
Let's do it.

204
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:24,005
-Let's go. One.
-One.

205
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:25,045
-Two, three.
-Two, three.

206
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:26,965
-Go!
-Go!

207
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,205
Go!

208
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,925
I didn't expect that one day,

209
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:43,405
I would be pushing a cart
in the mountains.

210
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:45,125
Situ Feng, I forgot to ask you.

211
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:49,365
Why did you come
to Jincheng all of a sudden?

212
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,205
You left without a word.

213
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:56,965
I was worried about you
so I decided to pay you a visit.

214
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:02,805
Let's go.

215
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:07,205
Slow down.

216
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:15,565
Okay, we're here.

217
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:16,845
Stop.

218
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,205
I'm tired.

219
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:29,685
You must be really exhausted.

220
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:31,725
I'm all right.

221
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:36,445
Chen Qingqing.

222
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:37,405
Where's your house?

223
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:38,325
-My house?
-Yes.

224
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,285
Which one did Grandpa tell me?

225
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,565
It's probably...

226
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,285
It's probably in the front.

227
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,445
-That's right.
-Chen Qingqing.

228
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:01,445
Isn't it your house?

229
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:03,405
-Yes.
-How come you don't recognize it?

230
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,965
Of course it's my house.

231
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:06,485
I know. It's right ahead.

232
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:07,765
Take a look.

233
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,445
There's a flag with "Chen" written on it.

234
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:11,525
-Do you see it?
-Yes.

235
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:12,445
-I told you.
-Yes.

236
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:14,005
Come on. It's up ahead.

237
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,045
Let's go.

238
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,245
That's right.

239
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:24,645
This must be it.

240
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:29,565
What's the matter?

241
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:31,885
Qingqing.

242
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:33,725
Is this livable?

243
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:38,925
Although it's quite shabby,

244
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:41,965
it's still livable for people.

245
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:44,005
Why? Do you hate it?

246
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,005
No, I don't.

247
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,005
Hurry up and go in.

248
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:49,805
My grandpa is waiting for you in there.

249
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,205
Let's go.

250
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,605
Grandpa.

251
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,125
Situ Feng, this is my grandpa.

252
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:11,645
Nice to meet you, Mr. Chen.

253
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:21,685
Young man, you're here just in time.

254
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:26,245
What my grandpa meant is,
you came at the right time.

255
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,045
It fell down the minute you walked in.

256
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,125
-Did you feel its passion?
-I did.

257
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,405
You did, didn't you?

258
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:35,605
Grandpa.

259
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:38,445
What in the world are you doing?
Who are you trying to torture?

260
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:39,925
Stay out of this.

261
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:43,285
I want to see what kind of person he is.

262
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:45,525
Gosh.

263
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:48,165
This beam

264
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:52,405
is our family heirloom.

265
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:54,205
Your family heirloom?

266
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:59,725
Hundreds of years ago,
our family was at great risk.

267
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,805
Your great-great-grandpa risked his life

268
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:07,325
to go deep into a forest and bring back

269
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:09,885
this wood of Hainan plum-yew.

270
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:14,645
It protected our family for generations

271
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:16,204
from evil, sicknesses and disasters.

272
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,724
It was the lifeline of our family.

273
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,685
This is not an exaggeration.

274
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:24,645
But the minute this lad showed up,

275
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:27,645
it just fell down.

276
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:29,725
Grandpa.

277
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:32,485
Mr. Chen.

278
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:35,045
Qingqing, don't worry.

279
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:37,045
I will fix it.

280
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,405
Young man.

281
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,365
Can you keep your word?

282
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:42,645
Yes.

283
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:43,685
All right.

284
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,565
Situ Feng, be careful.

285
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:57,165
I will. It will be all right.

286
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:01,725
Grandpa.

287
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:04,005
Come on.

288
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:07,085
He came all the way from Yuncheng.

289
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,605
You should let him get some rest first.

290
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:12,885
Young people are full of energy.

291
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,525
They don't need to rest.

292
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:15,725
Am I right, young man?

293
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:17,245
Yes.

294
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,525
What's wrong?

295
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:22,965
It's nothing.

296
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,085
Did you hammer your finger?

297
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,085
No, I didn't.

298
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:26,765
-Be careful.
-Okay.

299
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:27,965
I'm fine.

300
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,205
It's nothing.

301
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,365
You feel sorry for him already?

302
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,525
Grandpa.

303
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:36,365
Don't push it.

304
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,365
I know what I'm doing.

305
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,285
-Situ Feng, take it slow.
-Okay.

306
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:50,245
-Hello?
-Hello, Qingqing. It's Fangfang.

307
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:51,245
Fangfang.

308
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,405
I got discharged and I'm back in college.

309
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:56,085
I heard that you took one week leave
to go back to Jincheng.

310
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:57,365
Are you all right?

311
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,765
My grandpa was ill.

312
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,285
So I came back to pay him a visit.

313
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,325
I'm glad that you're all right.

314
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:06,285
Did you just say
that Situ Feng is also there?

315
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,605
It's a long story.

316
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:13,765
I will tell you everything
when I get back.

317
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:15,485
By the way, Fangfang,

318
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,845
you have to take good care of yourself

319
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,125
while I'm away. Do you hear me?

320
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:22,045
I will. Bye.

321
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:23,685
That's all. Bye.

322
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:29,765
Zhang Fangfang, you're finally back.

323
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:32,205
Is your errands service still open?

324
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,565
I'm sorry. We've closed it.

325
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:36,765
What a shame.

326
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:39,045
I'm going to the cafeteria to get lunch.

327
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,685
Why don't I get something for you too?

328
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:41,725
Really?

329
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:43,725
It's a token of appreciation
for my old clients.

330
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,645
-Thank you, Fangfang.
-Thank you, Fangfang.

331
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,925
Thank you.

332
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,165
Give it to me.

333
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,725
I thought that you hated me.
Why are you helping me?

334
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:12,245
I don't want your wound

335
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:14,165
to open up again
by carrying these heavy things.

336
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:15,605
Don't worry.

337
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:16,765
I won't pester you

338
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:18,925
and ask you to be responsible for it.

339
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:38,765
-Mr. Chen, I've secured the beam.
-Yes.

340
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,485
You can live here without any worries.

341
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:41,765
Grandpa, step aside.

342
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:43,485
Hurry and take a sip.

343
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:45,085
Thank you.

344
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:46,245
Did you really fix it?

345
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:47,565
Yes.

346
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,205
You must be exhausted.

347
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,325
Mr. Chen.

348
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:54,725
You did all the hard work.

349
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:56,725
Why don't you take a sip first?

350
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,005
No, you first.

351
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,805
My grandpa didn't do anything.

352
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,165
He just stood there
and ordered you around.

353
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:04,965
Come on. Drink some water.

354
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:09,485
Young man, if you're conceited
about completing a small task,

355
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,245
you won't have
any great accomplishments in the future.

356
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,125
It's getting late. Let's go farming.

357
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:17,645
Qingqing, stay home

358
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:19,525
and make us lunch.

359
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,645
Qingqing, do you know how to cook?

360
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,405
-Qingqing is quite a cook.
-I...

361
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,725
Tell me. What is your favorite dish?

362
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:33,605
-She will make it for you.
-It's all right, Mr. Chen.

363
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:35,405
I can eat anything.

364
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:37,485
All right. Let's go.

365
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:41,245
Stay home and cook.

366
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:43,605
Be careful.

367
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:45,565
Qingqing, I'll be back to help you
in a minute.

368
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,045
Help me?

369
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:53,605
I think that you can't even help yourself.

370
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,965
We're going to start digging.

371
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:08,645
Mr. Chen.

372
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:11,485
I don't know how.

373
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,005
Are you telling me

374
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,485
that you want to quit?

375
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:17,285
No.

376
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:18,725
That's not what I meant.

377
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:20,245
Do you want to learn?

378
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:22,405
I'll teach you.

379
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:23,765
Yes.

380
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:30,245
One.

381
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:31,645
Two.

382
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:33,845
Three.

383
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:37,885
One.

384
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:39,845
Two.

385
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:20,525
Mr. Chen.

386
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:22,325
I did it.

387
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,685
I conquered this land.

388
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,765
You only conquered a small piece of land.

389
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:36,445
Mr. Chen.

390
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:38,685
I want to learn something harder.

391
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,765
-Is that really what you want?
-Yes.

392
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:57,205
Do you want to learn something
even harder?

393
00:23:57,285 --> 00:23:58,685
Yes.

394
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,085
Mr. Chen, it's okay.

395
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:05,805
-It's all right, Mr. Chen.
-Listen to me.

396
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:07,325
-It's okay.
-Take your time and learn.

397
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,445
You'll definitely ace it.

398
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,925
-Mr. Chen, no--
-Don’t worry. I'll teach you.

399
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:13,245
Here.

400
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:16,405
Manure the field
with our heirloom fertilizer.

401
00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:18,405
Sure, no problem.

402
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,005
Mr. Chen.

403
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:28,765
This fertilizer smells good.

404
00:24:30,645 --> 00:24:32,485
It has got the smell of fresh grass.

405
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:34,565
No wonder it's a family heirloom.

406
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:35,605
Of course.

407
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:37,645
It grew up eating fresh grass.

408
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:39,085
Its feces smell especially good.

409
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:42,245
-Feces?
-That's right.

410
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,365
-Whose feces?
-Its feces.

411
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:08,845
How are you doing, young man?

412
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:09,885
Are you feeling better?

413
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:11,725
Yes, I am.

414
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,845
I think that you're quite talented.

415
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,085
No. You taught me well.

416
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:23,525
I hear that you're a celebrity.

417
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,405
You're willing to come
to this impoverished place.

418
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,485
That's admirable.

419
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:31,005
Don't say that, Mr. Chen.

420
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:34,885
I honestly think

421
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:37,685
that this is a nice place.

422
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:42,805
No wonder Qingqing is always so cheerful.

423
00:25:44,205 --> 00:25:46,525
Growing up in a simple
and modest place like this

424
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,565
must have been a very happy experience.

425
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:56,765
Hey.

426
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:57,805
Look, Mr. Chen.

427
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,405
Qingqing has finished cooking.

428
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:01,245
It's about time.

429
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:04,165
Mr. Chen.

430
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:06,005
Is your house on fire?

431
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,325
No way.

432
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:08,485
Qingqing!

433
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:11,125
-Qingqing.
-Qingqing.

434
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:12,285
Qingqing, you...

435
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:14,005
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

436
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:15,765
-Grandpa, you're back.
-Yes.

437
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:17,205
I've made dinner.

438
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,445
-You've made dinner?
-Yes.

439
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:19,645
Qingqing.

440
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,085
What happened to your face?

441
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:22,765
What's wrong with my face?

442
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,125
You look like a kitten.

443
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:26,125
My face is so black.

444
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:30,805
I'm all right. I was cooking a fish.

445
00:26:30,885 --> 00:26:32,445
When I put the fish in the pan,

446
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:34,925
the fish started jumping.

447
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:37,005
It looked really painful.

448
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:38,965
So, I added some oil.

449
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:42,005
But after I added the oil,
it jumped even harder.

450
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:43,605
There was a lot of smoke.

451
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,725
I didn't know what to do.

452
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:47,445
I immediately poured some water into it.

453
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:50,845
And the fish just jumped out of the pan
and hit my face and body.

454
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,165
It made a mess.

455
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:53,685
Did you burn your face?

456
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:56,245
-I'm okay. It was hard to make a fire.
-Qingqing.

457
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,525
Why are you here?

458
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:00,965
How could you say that?

459
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:03,885
You didn't tell me you came back.
Am I still your best friend?

460
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:07,125
Lan, you came at the right time.

461
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,085
Come on. Let's eat together.

462
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:10,245
Sure.

463
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:11,805
Lan?

464
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:18,765
-Lan.
-Yes?

465
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:20,245
Nalan Yiyi.

466
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:21,845
What are you and my grandpa plotting?

467
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,245
Qingqing, I missed you so much.

468
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:27,925
Don't blame me.

469
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,685
Your grandpa asked me to come here.

470
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:31,205
Now, I'm the village beauty, Lan.

471
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:32,565
Don't blow it.

472
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:33,925
Who's this young man over here?

473
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:37,285
Hello, I'm Situ Feng.

474
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,485
I'm Qingqing's classmate.

475
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,245
I'm Lan, Qingqing's best friend.

476
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:43,085
I know you.

477
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,485
I love your songs, Feng.

478
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:47,805
Let's go eat.

479
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:49,405
All right. Let's go.

480
00:27:58,405 --> 00:27:59,245
Qingqing.

481
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:00,485
What did you make?

482
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:02,845
Take a look.

483
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:08,725
Fried chocolate bananas.

484
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,045
And this is steamed perch.

485
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,845
Pumpkin and black fungus congee.

486
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:16,925
You'll be amazed by this one.

487
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:19,365
Healthy water beetles soup.

488
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:26,645
I'm sorry.

489
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,085
That's all the ingredients
we've got right now.

490
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,045
Please bear with me.

491
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:38,445
Although these dishes don't look great,

492
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:42,005
they're Qingqing's favorites.

493
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:44,285
Do you know why?

494
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,365
-Why?
-Why?

495
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:49,605
Take this braised perch for example.

496
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:52,525
It's steamed perch.

497
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,525
-Steamed perch.
-That's right.

498
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:55,725
It has got quite a story.

499
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:58,525
We used to be really poor.
We didn't have money to buy meat.

500
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:01,245
We had to go fishing
if we wanted to eat fish.

501
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,365
Qingqing had a tough life.

502
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:05,085
She followed me from dawn until dusk.

503
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:08,045
We went through a lot of ups and downs.

504
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,805
That's why we treasure our food.

505
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:12,245
For example, this water beetle soup.

506
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:14,445
We didn't have money to buy meat.

507
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:16,205
When it was raining outside,

508
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,405
Qingqing and I would go out

509
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:20,965
to catch water beetles
and snails from ditches.

510
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:23,005
Look at this one. Look at its leg muscles.

511
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:24,045
Doesn't it look plump?

512
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,005
-Look, isn't it plump?
-Yes, it is.

513
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,365
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

514
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:33,845
I didn't know

515
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:36,245
that you had a tough past.

516
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:38,445
It must have been difficult.

517
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:42,245
It was all right.

518
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:45,645
Feng, you just came back from farming.

519
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:46,685
You must be hungry.

520
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:48,245
Here.

521
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:50,325
Go ahead and eat.

522
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:54,885
Young people should eat a lot.

523
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:56,645
Here, have a piece of fish.

524
00:29:58,885 --> 00:29:59,725
Here.

525
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:01,645
Steamed perch.

526
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:02,645
Take it slow.

527
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:04,565
-Take it slow.
-Thank you, Mr. Chen.

528
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,805
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

529
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:09,005
You're an elder.

530
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:10,845
I should serve you a bowl.

531
00:30:11,165 --> 00:30:12,125
Here.

532
00:30:12,205 --> 00:30:13,445
Try this.

533
00:30:13,885 --> 00:30:15,165
Pumpkin and black fungus congee.

534
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:20,365
Come on. Try it.

535
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:22,365
All right.

536
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,485
Lan.

537
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,285
Let me get some for you too.

538
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:26,485
Here.

539
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:31,605
Thank you.

540
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:34,085
Grandpa, since you're an elder,

541
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:35,725
you should take the first bite.

542
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:40,045
The guest should take the first bite.

543
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:42,045
That's right.

544
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:43,685
Feng, you should try it first.

545
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:46,565
Then...

546
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,165
I will be the first to take a bite.

547
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:13,685
How does it taste?

548
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,125
It's quite good.

549
00:31:27,765 --> 00:31:28,805
It's just...

550
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,125
It's just a bit overcooked.

551
00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:34,805
It's all right, Feng.

552
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:36,285
If the dishes are not to your taste,

553
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:37,685
let's have some soup.

554
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:39,445
That's right.

555
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,685
That's right. Water beetle soup
is good for you.

556
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:45,565
This soup is nutritious.

557
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,365
You must drink more.

558
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:49,765
Feng?

559
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:51,965
You two seem so intimate.

560
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:55,085
In my opinion,

561
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,285
Feng and Lan...

562
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:01,205
He's talented. She's beautiful.
They match each other perfectly.

563
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,285
-Don't you think so?
-Yes.

564
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:05,565
I feel the same way too.

565
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:15,165
That's good.

566
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:22,245
Lan, eat a little more.

567
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,285
Thank you.

568
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:29,765
It's delicious.

569
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,285
Have some too.

570
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:40,365
Feng and Lan.

571
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,965
Go and hang this bedsheet.

572
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:44,045
-Okay.
-Okay.

573
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:50,445
Let's go.

574
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:52,605
Come on.

575
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:53,645
I can do it by myself.

576
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,325
Did you like today's dishes?

577
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,005
Grandpa.

578
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:19,125
Grandpa.

579
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:23,525
What are you and Nalan Yiyi
conspiring against me?

580
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:26,285
Why are you so concerned?

581
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:29,525
Are you afraid
that he would elope with her?

582
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:31,565
Sit down.

583
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:33,125
Have some tea with me.

584
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:46,325
Here.

585
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:00,005
Grandpa.

586
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,765
Situ Feng is my best friend.

587
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,285
You've already given him a hard time.

588
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:08,525
What's the purpose
of putting on that show just now?

589
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,085
Your friend?

590
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,244
Does he still want to be your friend

591
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:16,324
after seeing the ugly

592
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:17,925
and poor side of you?

593
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:19,125
Grandpa.

594
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,244
How could you ridicule
your own granddaughter?

595
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:23,965
Besides,

596
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:26,965
I believe that Situ Feng

597
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:29,045
is not such a superficial person.

598
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:31,844
If this young lad

599
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,925
can't even overcome this challenge,

600
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,244
he doesn't qualify as your friend.

601
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,284
I will do it.

602
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:53,244
That's not necessary.

603
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,204
I can do it on my own.

604
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:57,405
Don't be so polite.

605
00:34:58,005 --> 00:34:59,045
You're the guest.

606
00:34:59,485 --> 00:35:00,965
I should show hospitality as the host.

607
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:14,045
I'm polite to you simply
because you're Qingqing's best friend.

608
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,965
I don't want to put her
in a difficult position.

609
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:18,685
Actually I--

610
00:35:21,845 --> 00:35:22,685
Goodness.

611
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:27,125
Get up.

612
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:29,485
Chen Qingqing.

613
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,525
Hey, Qingqing.
Don't tell me that you came to Korea?

614
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:44,485
I hope that I could always
keep you company.

615
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:47,605
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

616
00:35:48,085 --> 00:35:50,005
Even if no one likes me,

617
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:52,005
-I don't care.
-I like you.

618
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:55,005
Situ Feng has done so much for me,

619
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,085
yet I've been lying
to him this whole time.

620
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:58,285
Qingchen.

621
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:02,165
The granddaughter of Chen Xiaotian,
the wealthiest man in Jincheng.

622
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:05,165
Chen Qingqing, if Situ Feng finds out

623
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:06,925
that you've been lying to him,

624
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:08,685
what will happen?

625
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,365
I have the answer now.

626
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,005
