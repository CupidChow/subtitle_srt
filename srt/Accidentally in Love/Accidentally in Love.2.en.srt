A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:59,165
EPISODE 2

3
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,365
Excuse me, please help me.

4
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:04,525
Let me use you. Thanks.

5
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:06,285
The young master went that way!

6
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:07,965
I need to use you!

7
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,085
You can't make deals on such things.

8
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,085
Stop moving. I'm going to kiss you.

9
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:34,805
That was just an accident.

10
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,285
I won't pursue the matter on my side.

11
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:40,845
But you can't say anything.

12
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:47,805
Do you want my autograph

13
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:50,045
or do you really want my autograph?

14
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:02,965
If you want a picture,

15
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:06,805
I'm afraid I won't be able to do so today.

16
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:14,125
Do you know that it was my...

17
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,325
Hey.

18
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,245
You're that famous idol.

19
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,365
Your Highness, right?

20
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:28,485
So,

21
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,405
can you let go now?

22
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:34,885
Someone took my bag.

23
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,685
You've got your ways, right?

24
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:39,165
If you promise to help me find my bag,

25
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:40,885
I'll let this whole thing pass.

26
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:43,645
What does that have to do with me?

27
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,725
I'm so unlucky!

28
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:04,685
I have no money and I'm so hungry.

29
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,445
I'm being chased all over the city.

30
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:08,605
And now,

31
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:13,365
this good-for-nothing jerk
stole my first kiss!

32
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:14,765
My first kiss!

33
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:16,565
Stop crying.

34
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:18,005
I'll do it, okay?

35
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:19,765
Fine, I'll believe you.

36
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:21,964
You...

37
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:23,964
What?

38
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:25,964
You already promised me.

39
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,365
How could you lie to me?

40
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:29,285
I didn't lie.

41
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:30,685
Look.

42
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,565
This bag isn't mine.

43
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:34,245
I tried calling that person,

44
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:36,645
but nobody is answering.

45
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:37,685
See?

46
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,045
This phone isn't mine.

47
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,245
Isn't that Gu Nanxi's phone?

48
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:49,325
It's ringing.

49
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:51,885
Since Dad wants me to attend
his wedding so much,

50
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:54,005
I'll give him a big gift.

51
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,445
Hello?

52
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,085
This isn't your phone, right?

53
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:58,765
What?

54
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,325
You're not going to give the phone back?

55
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,925
Okay. I know where it is.

56
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:07,725
Okay.

57
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:10,205
So?

58
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:13,725
The guy is pretty furious.

59
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,205
So I think you shouldn't go.

60
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,125
Why don't you go with me?

61
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:20,725
You're a superstar, right?

62
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,485
-Yes.
-They will listen to you.

63
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:23,645
I'm sure.

64
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:25,045
Please.

65
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:28,205
All right. If that's the case,

66
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:30,365
I will reluctantly go with you.

67
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:32,125
Thanks.

68
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:50,805
It's him. He's the one.

69
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:53,925
Wait, don't say anything.

70
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:55,285
Her bag.

71
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:56,525
You took it, right?

72
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,205
Yes.

73
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,845
And?

74
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,965
Think carefully.

75
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,245
Don't act rashly.

76
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:05,805
So...

77
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:07,565
What is it that you want?

78
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,645
Look at you, all dressed like a gentleman.

79
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:12,045
I didn't expect you to be a snob.

80
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:16,045
You can disregard me,
but you can't disrespect him, right?

81
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:19,445
He's the one-and-only,
keeper of the female fans' hearts,

82
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:20,565
Your Highness, Situ Feng.

83
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:23,285
Do you know how scary his fans can be?

84
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,525
They will start a witch hunt
for you online.

85
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:28,965
And you'll be beaten to a pulp
on the street like a rat.

86
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:30,765
How about it? Am I right?

87
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:34,205
Yes.

88
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:37,405
So I have no choice, but to return
the bag, right?

89
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:38,365
Of course.

90
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:39,565
Here.

91
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:45,245
Get lost if you want to save your ass.

92
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,965
Count yourself lucky!

93
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,685
You dare mess with me?

94
00:06:57,605 --> 00:06:58,445
Thank you.

95
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,405
Hey!

96
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:03,565
That's my bag!

97
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,445
It wasn't easy getting this bag.

98
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,045
I can't just let you have it.

99
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:09,805
What do you want?

100
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:11,405
Do as I say.

101
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:14,205
What is it?

102
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,205
Go in and you will find out.

103
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:58,125
Hey.

104
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:07,645
Feng.

105
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:11,325
Who is this ugly girl?

106
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:13,365
Xinya, go back to your seat.

107
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:14,925
You'll know soon.

108
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,045
Hey.

109
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:21,965
Hey, what's going on?

110
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,125
You can eat all you want.

111
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:32,205
Please excuse me.

112
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:40,564
I thought you weren't coming.

113
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:45,164
Don't you feel bad for my mom?

114
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,725
This does not mean that I don't love her.

115
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:50,845
Your love sure is cheap.

116
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,285
Feng, what are you doing here?

117
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:57,285
I thought you couldn't come
because of your show.

118
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,525
It's my dad's big day.

119
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:01,685
I had to make time for him.

120
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:05,965
Besides, I have a big gift for you.

121
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:08,285
What is it?

122
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:11,565
I'm warning you.
You better not mess things up.

123
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:13,685
Don't worry.

124
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:17,285
I only came to give my blessings.

125
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:20,765
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

126
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:24,845
Mr. Situ Jie and Miss Li Lusi's wedding
is about to start.

127
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,405
First, how about we listen
to what the groom has to say to everyone.

128
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:29,965
Let's get him on stage.

129
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:41,005
Situ Feng.

130
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:44,885
Situ...

131
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,005
What's your name?

132
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:50,405
Chen Qingqing.

133
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:52,925
Hello.

134
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:56,245
Welcome to my engagement party.

135
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:00,765
Engagement party?

136
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:01,845
What's happening?

137
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:04,005
Isn't this Situ Jie's wedding?

138
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:05,165
Engagement?

139
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:06,405
Who's getting engaged?

140
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:08,845
This girl, Chen Qingqing,

141
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:11,365
is my fiancée.

142
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:14,245
Hey, Situ Feng. Are you crazy?

143
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,605
Did his fan sneak into the hall?

144
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:26,365
But he just called her his fiancée.

145
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,325
What's going on?

146
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:35,005
Situ Feng!

147
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:37,085
Are you crazy?

148
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:38,805
Who are you calling your fiancée?

149
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:39,765
This card

150
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,765
has unlimited credit.

151
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:45,885
The passcode is 233333.

152
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:49,405
Who...

153
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:50,645
Who is...

154
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:54,845
Who is your fiancée?

155
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,405
Me, of course.

156
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:01,605
Hello.

157
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:03,285
I'm Chen Qingqing.

158
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,445
Nice to meet you all.

159
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,325
What a happy day it is
for the Situ family.

160
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:19,765
Not only did the head of the family
find a beautiful bride,

161
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:23,125
the young master
has found his future partner too.

162
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:25,125
No. I'm sorry.

163
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,125
We shall now open the dance floor
for everyone.

164
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,885
We'll decide what to do next.

165
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:45,725
Feng, stop fooling around.

166
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:48,805
Who allowed you to get engaged?
Did I agree to that?

167
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,045
We are unrelated.

168
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:53,485
"Unrelated"?

169
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,725
Let me remind you that I'm your dad.

170
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:01,205
If you weren't my dad,
I wouldn't have come today.

171
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:06,565
Miss, you should listen to me.

172
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:08,565
It's not too late to step away.

173
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,925
Don't scare your daughter-in-law.

174
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,085
Come straight to me
if you've got a problem.

175
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,245
Shut up. I've heard enough nonsense.

176
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,285
There are too many people here.
We'll talk over there.

177
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:27,125
What do you want?

178
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,805
What do I want?

179
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:30,805
You know that very well.

180
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,365
Is that how you talk to your dad?

181
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:34,525
Like father, like son.

182
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:35,485
Damn you!

183
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:49,845
Who did that?

184
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:50,925
Gosh.

185
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:52,685
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:54,645
My hand slipped.

187
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,965
Maybe it's because you blended
into the background.

188
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,845
You obviously did that on purpose!

189
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:03,845
I don't give a damn how you
got Feng's attention.

190
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:07,085
I see crazy, clingy fans like you

191
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:08,765
all the time.

192
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:11,845
I see how it is now.

193
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,685
Well, let me tell you something.

194
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,725
Actually,

195
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:20,445
I'm not his fan at all.

196
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,125
Actually,

197
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:23,965
I am...

198
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,085
Mind your own business!

199
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,725
You're so rude!

200
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:36,685
You said you weren't his fan.

201
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,885
That means you want his money.

202
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:41,605
I'll buy you.

203
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,005
Is this enough?

204
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,245
Look.

205
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:06,405
This is how a lowlife acts.

206
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,205
They say one thing,

207
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,485
but the body can't help, but pick it up.

208
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,085
Take the money

209
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:19,005
and make yourself disappear
from Feng's side!

210
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:30,885
Excuse me.

211
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,165
May I have your attention?

212
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:33,765
Firstly,

213
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:36,565
I'd like to thank the lady here.

214
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:40,165
I just received a monetary gift from her

215
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,085
for my engagement to Feng.

216
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:44,165
So now,

217
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,565
I'm going to take this check

218
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:47,965
and return it back

219
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,125
as a thank you.

220
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:52,285
Thanks.

221
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:53,525
You...

222
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,445
-I'm sorry.
-Get her!

223
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,365
Don't let her leave!

224
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:09,005
Hurry!

225
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:11,245
-Get out of the way!
-Stop her!

226
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:14,925
-Who's that?
-Who?

227
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:21,925
Xinya, are you okay?

228
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,085
Are you hurt?

229
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:35,605
For the sake of the family,

230
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,645
let's each take a step back.

231
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:39,565
How exactly?

232
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:42,285
I'll cancel the wedding.

233
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,645
You cancel the engagement.

234
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:46,365
Okay.

235
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:48,285
Deal.

236
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,165
Chen Qingqing.

237
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:13,805
Have you lost your mind?

238
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,325
Why did you do what they told you to?

239
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,165
Now, look.

240
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,605
You lost your first kiss.

241
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,845
And look at the pathetic state you're in.

242
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:26,925
What should I do?

243
00:16:57,365 --> 00:17:00,565
What kind of a zipper is this?

244
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:21,925
I'm so sorry.

245
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:24,645
The door was slightly opened.

246
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:26,124
I didn't mean to barge in.

247
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:27,645
It's you?

248
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,205
I don't think we've met.

249
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,325
Are you Situ Feng's friend?

250
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:39,885
You know Situ Feng?

251
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:43,245
Yes. I'm his good friend.

252
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:44,925
My name is Gu Nanxi.

253
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,405
And you are?

254
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:52,045
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

255
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,285
Stop!

256
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,405
What is it?

257
00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,045
Wait.

258
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,205
Do me a favor.

259
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:03,365
What can I help you with?

260
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,805
I can't zip up the dress.

261
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,245
Can you help me out?

262
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:09,725
Thanks.

263
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:11,725
Thanks.

264
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:34,165
-Hurry up, please.
-Okay.

265
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:39,125
-It's done.
-Thanks.

266
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:46,085
-Sir.
-Yes?

267
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:47,845
Are you free?

268
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:50,805
Why are you still here?

269
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:54,685
Can I ask you something, miss?

270
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,285
Have I ever offended you before?

271
00:18:58,565 --> 00:18:59,565
No.

272
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:02,645
But right now, I hope that

273
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,325
you'll erase me

274
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:07,565
completely from your memory.

275
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,845
I hope we'll meet again.

276
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:46,965
Young Master.

277
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:55,685
Stop!

278
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,285
What happened today...

279
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:06,965
Does it make you happy?

280
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:10,325
I was only trying to protect the name
of the Situ family.

281
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:16,565
Your actions have totally
and utterly shamed the Situ family.

282
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:21,005
Our guests today were all the people
with high ranks in Yuncheng.

283
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:22,925
Who were you trying to impress?

284
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,725
Just because you're a celebrity,
doesn't mean you rule the world.

285
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:30,645
Did you think your Situ name
didn't play a part?

286
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:32,765
I achieved this on my own.

287
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,125
You achieved all that
because you're my son

288
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:37,445
and the support from the family.

289
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,845
I'd rather not have any of it then.

290
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:45,725
Stop right there!

291
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,965
I knew you wouldn't stay at home today.

292
00:20:56,765 --> 00:20:57,765
Did you argue again?

293
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:08,765
Let me.

294
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:28,325
What a show-off.

295
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,965
You're like the shrink in movies,

296
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,485
giving good advice
while hitting the bullseye.

297
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:36,645
What about a game?

298
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:38,245
Come on.

299
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:21,645
I'm not trying to nag.

300
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:25,645
But I really think you're too hung up
on the past.

301
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:27,965
It's like that with your parents.

302
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:30,845
And the same with your own stuff.

303
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:35,125
Right now, I can't do the things I like.

304
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,845
I can't sing the songs I want.

305
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:39,765
If not the past,

306
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:42,685
I'm not sure what I should hold on to.

307
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:45,845
Stop being so pessimistic.

308
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:49,685
Sometimes, something will happen

309
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:52,765
or you'll meet someone
that will change your mind completely.

310
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:56,965
Just like how I met a girl
in the changing room today.

311
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:01,685
I've never seen such a girl before.

312
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:04,765
Just one look and she's forever imprinted
in my mind.

313
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:07,965
You were looking at girls

314
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:09,725
in the changing room?

315
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:18,965
What I meant was,
you need to look forward.

316
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:22,045
Things will get better.

317
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:25,845
Here.

318
00:23:25,925 --> 00:23:26,885
Cheers.

319
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:51,325
This is the school where Dad and Mom
studied and fell in love.

320
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:53,205
I finally found you.

321
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:16,965
Looks like there's no way in.

322
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:21,005
But today is the last day of registration.

323
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:23,765
There's only one hour left before 12 noon.

324
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:25,845
It's my last chance to register.

325
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,405
What am I going to do?

326
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:05,525
-What's her name?
-I don't know.

327
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,645
You don't know where the first person
you kissed on screen is?

328
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:08,965
Situ Feng.

329
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:11,125
Your fiancée is there.
Why don't you look after her?

330
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:13,125
I don't know that person.

331
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:16,925
-You again?
-You again?

332
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:20,845
You tore it apart?

333
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:22,125
I'll make you pay!

334
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:24,925
That good-for-nothing jerk!

335
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,685
If I see him again,

336
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:30,205
I'm going to kick him all the way
to the moon.

337
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:33,765
Hello, I am your new deskmate.

338
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:35,405
I'm Chen Qingqing.

339
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:38,085
