00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:35,765
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,645
EPISODE 8

3
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,445
Situ Feng is so stingy.

4
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,085
Even the filming
of the music video is done at school.

5
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:12,805
What am I going to do
if someone recognizes me?

6
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:15,605
The female lead is here.

7
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,085
-Hello.
-Hello.

8
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:18,805
-Let's go to the dressing room.
-All right.

9
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,805
Daniel, the female lead is here.

10
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:24,125
-Qingchen, you're here.
-I'll leave her to you.

11
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:25,925
Where's Situ Feng?

12
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:28,125
What's going on?
Even the female lead is here.

13
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:29,725
Look at her, Mei.

14
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:32,925
This is the music video's main actress
who's perfect in terms of acting skills

15
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:33,965
-and appearances.
-Hello.

16
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,205
Come here, everyone.

17
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,645
Please get to know the female lead.

18
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,925
All of you must have synergy
to create a good music video.

19
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:39,845
Hello.

20
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:43,165
What's with the scarf?

21
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,605
It was raining when I was coming here.

22
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,485
It's for me to cover
my hair from the rain.

23
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,325
-I see.
-You can remove it now.

24
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:54,525
Take it off.

25
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:55,925
Take it off.

26
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:23,885
It's you.

27
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:27,165
Hello.

28
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:28,565
Nanxi.

29
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,245
Nanxi.

30
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:34,205
Xinya.

31
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:36,445
You two...

32
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:37,925
Do you know each other?

33
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,845
Well, we've met once.

34
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:42,485
Hello.

35
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,325
When did you arrive?

36
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:46,165
This is our female lead, Qingchen.

37
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:47,365
Isn't she great?

38
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,005
Hello.

39
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,045
-Hello.
-Situ Feng.

40
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:56,245
Excuse me.

41
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,645
I think I should fix my makeup.

42
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:00,565
Sure.

43
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,205
Please excuse me.

44
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,885
Well, let's go through the script, okay?

45
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,845
-Come, let's go through it.
-All right, let's go.

46
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:08,845
Let's go, Mei.

47
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,245
I'm the Head of Entertainment
for Ming De College Student Council.

48
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:17,204
I'm here to provide aid.

49
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,125
What's with this guy?

50
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,245
You...

51
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:29,845
What's the color of your lipstick?

52
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,205
It's gorgeous.

53
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:37,245
Why is everyone so polite to me recently?

54
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:38,685
Right here.

55
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:40,725
This is the storyboard
for today's music video.

56
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:42,045
All of you can take a look.

57
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:45,965
Qingchen.

58
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:49,605
After this, we have a piano scene.

59
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:52,125
You don't have to actually play it.

60
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:54,765
Qingchen.

61
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:58,045
If you don't know how to play it,
I can teach you.

62
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:01,245
You should at least know
the basics if you want to act.

63
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,125
Hey!

64
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:17,845
I think I never said that
I can't play the piano.

65
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:24,925
My goodness.

66
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,645
I can't believe that you're so good at it.

67
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:28,325
A German classic,

68
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,485
Brahms's "Hungarian Dances No. 5".

69
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,045
Situ Feng.

70
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:37,845
Why are you filming the music video
on my birthday?

71
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,125
I don't care.

72
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:41,485
You and Nanxi!

73
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,325
Both of you need to celebrate my birthday.

74
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,685
Xinya, why don't you rest at home?

75
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:49,565
After we finish our filming,
let's watch a movie together.

76
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,645
You must keep your promise then.

77
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:52,965
Of course.

78
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:53,965
-Bye.
-Bye.

79
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:03,645
I think you will definitely

80
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:05,605
be the first generation
of a well-rounded artist

81
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:07,485
if you join our agency now.

82
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:08,685
Nanxi.

83
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:09,725
What are you looking at?

84
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,885
You're so into her.

85
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,565
She's the girl
I met at the wedding last time.

86
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,245
There were so many girls back then.

87
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:19,965
Why are you interested in her?

88
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:24,125
No, I just find her interesting.

89
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:26,685
Interesting?

90
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,325
With the agency's resources,
we can make a film just for you.

91
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,805
She's a bit interesting.

92
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,565
Aren't you only interested in Qingqing?

93
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:36,925
No way!

94
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,885
How is that possible?

95
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:41,205
Even someone who is picking
her nose is prettier than her.

96
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:48,165
The director is here.
This is our director.

97
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:50,005
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

98
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:53,605
For this music video,
it's about a tormenting love.

99
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:56,765
Situ Feng and Qingchen
is a couple who just broke up.

100
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:59,285
Situ Feng, you're trying to make her stay.

101
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:02,005
The two of you will look at each other
right next to the piano.

102
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:05,245
But Qingchen shows a determined face.

103
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,685
Okay, you two should rehearse.

104
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:08,205
Get to know each other first.

105
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:11,325
Let's go over there.

106
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,365
Well, Qingchen.

107
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:33,405
This is your first filming, right?
You can ask me if you have any questions.

108
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:37,325
Do you have any questions?

109
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,245
No.

110
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:43,005
I just want to say.

111
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:46,645
All the tabloids mentioned that

112
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,044
you're a cold-hearted king.

113
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,405
But I can't believe that
you're quite friendly

114
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,325
towards girls in real life.

115
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:56,645
Actually, I don't really talk to girls.

116
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,405
It's just that...

117
00:08:58,485 --> 00:08:59,605
What is it?

118
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:02,205
It's nothing.

119
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:05,965
When we're filming,
you need to think about your sad memories

120
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,965
so that you'll feel down.

121
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,925
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

122
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:16,325
Did you notice that
Situ Feng's isn't as cold as usual?

123
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,245
I think I saw him smiling.

124
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:20,565
Am I dreaming?

125
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:22,245
No, you're right.

126
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,365
I noticed it too.

127
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:27,285
Three, two, one.

128
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:42,285
Situ Feng.

129
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,925
You were so mean to me
when I was Chen Qingqing.

130
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:51,005
Now that I look beautiful,
you're trying to make a move.

131
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,565
Go to hell!

132
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:56,685
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,325
Are you okay, Situ Feng?

134
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:01,445
I'm fine, sir.

135
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,245
All right, let's do it again.

136
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:10,285
I'm sorry, sir.

137
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:11,285
Let's do it again.

138
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,005
-That's all for now.
-I'm sorry.

139
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:27,485
Okay.

140
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:29,165
Let's take a break.

141
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:36,565
I was...

142
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:39,125
Why were you so careless just now?

143
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,085
You always put your foot below mine.

144
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,525
I'll get a glass of water for you.

145
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:47,125
Despicable!

146
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:49,645
You always forced me to get water for you.

147
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:54,565
I have a sensitive stomach.

148
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,525
I can't drink cold water.

149
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,605
All right, I'll get hot water for you.

150
00:10:58,685 --> 00:10:59,565
Sorry for the trouble.

151
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,685
Mr. Situ Feng.

152
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,125
Do you want me to burn my tongue?

153
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,365
I'll get a warm water then.

154
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:18,245
Thank you.

155
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,485
You don't look like a local.

156
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:38,005
I'm from Jincheng.

157
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:39,965
I just came here.

158
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,765
I believe you haven't had time
to tour around Yuncheng.

159
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:43,885
Yuncheng is really fun.

160
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,085
Really?

161
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,885
You'll know it when I bring you out.

162
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:50,125
You know my friend, Nanxi.

163
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:51,325
Don't you?

164
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:52,485
Cut! That's all for today!

165
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:54,685
Thanks for your hard work.

166
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,085
Thanks for your hard work.

167
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:03,205
I can't believe that
you can play the piano well.

168
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,725
I heard you're from another city.

169
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,685
If there's a chance, I'll show you around.

170
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,325
There's no need.

171
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:13,965
I'm just having a short layover
before continuing my travel.

172
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:15,925
I'll leave after some time.

173
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:18,205
-Actually--
-It's okay.

174
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:19,765
I got her contact number.

175
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,285
I'll add you on WeChat.

176
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,045
For courtesy, we'll show you around.

177
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:28,965
-Yes.
-Since you insist...

178
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:31,645
All right.

179
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:33,565
My goodness!

180
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:35,005
I don't know who leaked the news.

181
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:36,845
Your fans have gathered outside.

182
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,205
I don't think they'll leave
if they don't see you.

183
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:40,645
What should we do?

184
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:42,125
What can we do?

185
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,885
We promised to watch a movie with Xinya.

186
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,165
If your fans discover us, it'll be...

187
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:48,285
Why don't you leave

188
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,085
while wearing this outfit?

189
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,805
-What?
-Again?

190
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,485
Okay, I'll check the situation first.

191
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,845
You should change your clothes.

192
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:03,925
Right, Qingchen.

193
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:06,685
I already transferred your pay.
Please check your account.

194
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:07,605
That was fast.

195
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:09,285
-Yes.
-Didn't you say that

196
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:10,725
it will take some time?

197
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:12,645
It's my own money.

198
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,645
Yours?

199
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:14,565
That's right.

200
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,685
The entertainment industry is complicated.

201
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:20,725
Did you do this for another purpose?

202
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:22,285
Gosh, what are you saying?

203
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,885
I knew you need the money
so I wanted to help you.

204
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:27,965
Who knows when will
your payment be approved?

205
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:29,605
Take a look.

206
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,925
I borrowed money from 9FBank app.

207
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:34,405
Return the money to me
after your payment is approved.

208
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:35,685
I'll pay back the money then.

209
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,485
The interest is lower
than a credit card's.

210
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:38,765
Plus, the procedure is simple.

211
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,765
My kindness has gone to waste.
I shouldn't have helped you.

212
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:44,965
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

213
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:48,445
Today, we must see

214
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:51,005
the female lead of His Highness's
new music video.

215
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:54,645
That's right! We must judge
whether she's worthy or not.

216
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:55,685
You're right.

217
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,645
Could that be her?

218
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,485
It looks like her.

219
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:02,285
Her dress looks the same
from the fan club's morning news.

220
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:04,725
I guess she looks decent enough
not to embarrass His Highness.

221
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,085
She looks a bit strong.

222
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:11,925
Is she going
to do anything to His Highness?

223
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,125
She won't. Look at the man next to her.

224
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:16,765
They look so close.

225
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:17,925
I think it's her boyfriend.

226
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:18,965
Boyfriend?

227
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:21,285
-We don't have to worry then.
-We don't have to worry then.

228
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:30,285
Qingqing, thank you
for collecting the surgery fee.

229
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,525
But how did you get so much money?

230
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,445
I borrowed it from Situ Feng.

231
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,645
Didn't you say
that you're his fake assistant?

232
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,165
What happened?

233
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,085
Why would he lend you money?

234
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:43,765
You know that

235
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:47,045
Situ Feng is very warmhearted.

236
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,005
Plus, he earns so much money.

237
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,565
This much money is nothing to him.

238
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:55,325
But the money is life-saving to me.

239
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,205
I must thank him tomorrow.

240
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:58,685
That's not necessary, Fangfang.

241
00:14:58,765 --> 00:14:59,965
You know it too, don't you?

242
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:03,725
Situ Feng won't admit that
he has helped others.

243
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:04,645
Right?

244
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:20,805
Fangfang.

245
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:26,565
Aren't you the guy
who stole the microphone?

246
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:28,845
Dalei, it seems like she recognizes me.

247
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:31,925
In case she knows that we're from Class 4,
will she inform our teacher?

248
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,565
Will the school expel us?

249
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,165
You're so dumb!

250
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,085
If you don't tell her
that we're from Class 4,

251
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:39,245
how could she know
that we're from Class 4?

252
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:42,485
Right, don't you dare say
that our boss is from Class 3.

253
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:45,245
Right, I can't tell her
that our boss is from Class 3.

254
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:48,445
Hey, idiots!

255
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,885
We're from the same school.

256
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:53,445
Can't you do everything in secret?

257
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:54,845
Chen Qingqing.

258
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,805
Why are you so afraid?

259
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,965
I just wanted to ask you out.

260
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:02,045
You won't reject me, right?

261
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,285
Yiyang!

262
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:05,325
Why did you bring us here?

263
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:06,765
We don't have any grudges with you.

264
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:09,005
Why won't you let us go?

265
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,205
Who brought her here?

266
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:15,965
Look at her, sir.

267
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:18,765
She's Qingqing's best friend,
Zhang Fangfang.

268
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,325
It's like "Buy one, free one."
I took her in case you needed her.

269
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,365
"Buy one free one"?

270
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,085
Did I give you the permission?

271
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,365
Do you think this is McDonald's?

272
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:37,805
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:42,205
I just want to use both of you
to meet an old friend, Situ Feng.

274
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,605
You won't mind, right?

275
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:47,325
You took us here so that Situ Feng
comes and save us?

276
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:49,645
Yiyang, I'm telling you.

277
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,565
Don't dream about it! It's impossible!

278
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,965
Situ Feng is a playboy.

279
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,765
He doesn't have the time for us.

280
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:56,845
We'll see later

281
00:16:58,245 --> 00:16:59,565
whether he has the time or not.

282
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:15,805
Hello?

283
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:17,124
Situ Feng.

284
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:21,364
I heard you're close with your deskmate.

285
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:22,964
What do you want?

286
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,124
Qingqing is with me now.

287
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,925
She doesn't...

288
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:33,605
Look good.

289
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,005
What did you do to her?

290
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,005
Have you gone mad?

291
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,405
Let's have a chat

292
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,085
at Xiqiaotou Amusement Park.

293
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:43,605
If you don't come,

294
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:46,925
I can't guarantee Qingqing's safety.

295
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:50,245
You're dead if you touch
even a strand of her hair.

296
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:55,045
What's the matter?

297
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,365
Yiyang kidnapped Qingqing.

298
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:58,885
I'm coming with you!

299
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:04,205
Yiyang!

300
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:06,205
Hey, Yiyang!

301
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:08,285
Why are you doing this to Situ Feng?

302
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:11,565
Didn't you say that he won't come for you?

303
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,205
Cut the crap!

304
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:16,965
Nobody will get hurt if you cooperate.

305
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:32,645
I'm scared, Qingqing.

306
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,645
Don't be afraid, Fangfang.

307
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,125
Don't worry, I'm here.

308
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:38,485
Nothing will happen to us.

309
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:40,685
If they hurt us,

310
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,725
I won't let him go even if I'm dead.

311
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:47,165
Dalei, why don't we let them go?

312
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:49,965
Did you hear what she said?
She won't let us go even if she's dead.

313
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,405
Can you two cut it out?

314
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:56,205
You can either let us go

315
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:59,685
or operate this machine for us to enjoy.

316
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,085
All right. You want to play, right?

317
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:04,005
I'll let you two enjoy it.

318
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:08,605
Let me check your safety belts.

319
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:12,685
Let me tell you something.
Safety belts aren't safe.

320
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:14,485
When I was a child,

321
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:16,365
originally, I had an IQ of 250.

322
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,765
After that, while I was on a bus--

323
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,885
Let me go!

324
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,605
I'll let you fully enjoy it.

325
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:34,525
Hello?

326
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:37,765
Dalei! Don't mess with it!

327
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,885
Stop it right now!

328
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,085
Stop it!

329
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:46,205
All right, wait for me!

330
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,765
Ye Bei!

331
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:54,005
Dalei!

332
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:56,285
Hang on, I'll save you now.

333
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:57,765
Hurry!

334
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:14,965
You...

335
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:16,845
That's too dangerous!

336
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:17,765
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:18,805
Let's go.

338
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:22,805
WORK IN PROGRESS

339
00:20:24,565 --> 00:20:25,445
Hang on.

340
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:26,925
Let's go in.

341
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:54,125
Where's Qingqing?

342
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:58,845
Your Highness.

343
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,365
Why are you so nervous?

344
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,765
Are you so worried about your girlfriend?

345
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,045
Yiyang.

346
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:07,085
Qingqing isn't my girlfriend.

347
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:08,125
Let her go.

348
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:10,565
Don't hurt the innocent.

349
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,325
If there's any problem, come at me.

350
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:13,805
Innocent?

351
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:16,285
Isn't Xinyu innocent as well?

352
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:18,405
For knowing a killer like you.

353
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,405
Yiyang!

354
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:21,365
It wasn't Situ Feng's fault.

355
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:22,805
Shut up, Gu Nanxi!

356
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:25,805
You're a goody-two-shoes
who acts nice to everyone.

357
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,085
-Are you getting used to being a dog--
-Yiyang!

358
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:30,205
I'll admit that it was my fault.

359
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:31,725
Don't drag others into this mess.

360
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:33,845
All right. You'll admit it, right?

361
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:36,205
Yet, you continue to be an idol.

362
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,565
You're still the descendant
of Situ family!

363
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,245
How can you say that you admit it?

364
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:44,205
You even used Xinyu to write a song.
Don't think that I don't know about it!

365
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,245
Let me tell you.

366
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,405
As long as I'm alive,

367
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:52,005
don't think of escaping
from the sins you have committed.

368
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:53,845
What do you want to do?

369
00:21:58,645 --> 00:21:59,925
Don't ever sing "Breath" again.

370
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:06,565
Xinyu's death was my fault.

371
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,845
I'll always owe her my entire life.

372
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,925
Yiyang, let me make it clear for you.

373
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:16,045
I will never owe you!

374
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:17,965
Qingqing doesn't owe you too!

375
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:23,725
Because of Xinyu,
you can't live like nothing has happened.

376
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:27,125
You keep on mentioning Qingqing.
Do you deserve that?

377
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,125
Stop it, Yiyang!

378
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:35,125
What's the point of hurting yourself
and Situ Feng?

379
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:37,525
None of you can live your lives normally.

380
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,805
Do you have a conscience?

381
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:42,485
He caused Xinyu's death!

382
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:44,045
How can I let him go?

383
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,445
It's Xinyu!

384
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:47,525
-It was just an accident!
-Get out of the way!

385
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:51,605
Yiyang!

386
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,005
Let go of him!

387
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:14,125
Situ Feng!

388
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:15,245
Get off of him!

389
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:24,485
Sir, Qingqing ran away.

390
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:26,085
-What?
-I'm sorry, sir! I'm sorry!

391
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:29,085
-Chase after her!
-But she went into Hauntedland.

392
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:30,565
I'm scared.

393
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:34,445
Are you afraid of me?

394
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,805
Yes, but I'm more afraid of Hauntedland.

395
00:23:37,445 --> 00:23:38,285
How useless!

396
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:40,605
Let's find her.

397
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:43,725
Situ Feng!

398
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:47,165
I'm warning you.

399
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:51,005
What happened today can happen again.

400
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:04,005
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

401
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:05,245
I'm scared.

402
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,525
Don't worry, Fangfang. Stay with me.

403
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,365
We'll be fine.

404
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:33,125
Fangfang, I think
there's an exit in front.

405
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:45,765
Qingqing!

406
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:47,205
Qingqing!

407
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:48,605
Where are you?

408
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,845
I'm scared.

409
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:53,325
Here.

410
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,445
Nanxi, go to that side.
I'll go to this side.

411
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:57,485
Let's meet at the exit.

412
00:24:57,565 --> 00:24:58,685
All right.

413
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:01,805
Qingqing!

414
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,005
Qingqing!

415
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,365
Qingqing!

416
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,325
WORK IN PROGRESS

417
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:37,085
What a heroic act.

418
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:39,645
Why weren't you this brave back then?

419
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:42,205
-Yiyang, get out of the way.
-Where do you think you are?

420
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:44,525
Is this your house?
You can't leave as you please.

421
00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:46,085
What do you want?

422
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:49,485
For Lan Xinyu,
you dragged an outsider into this mess.

423
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,645
It's pointless after all.

424
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:54,085
It's because she has
a relationship with you.

425
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:58,205
I can let her go today.

426
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,125
But

427
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,685
you must do what you promised.

428
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:04,965
Okay, I promise you.

429
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:20,725
Who is it?

430
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:21,805
It's me.

431
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:24,165
Yiyang?

432
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:28,205
What's the matter?

433
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:30,965
I sprained my ankle.

434
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:34,045
Give me your hand.

435
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:37,725
Don't waste time.
I'll bring you out of here.

436
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:41,285
Hang in there.

437
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:51,045
Get on the motorcycle.

438
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:03,885
You can put your arms around me.

439
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:30,285
Hello? Nanxi. I've saved Qingqing.

440
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:31,845
Wait for us outside.

441
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:35,845
This guy, Yiyang...

442
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:37,565
Is his brain flooded with powder?

443
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,765
Qingqing!

444
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:50,725
Qingqing!

445
00:27:58,405 --> 00:27:59,485
Chen Qingqing.

446
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:02,005
You were awake just now, weren't you?

447
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:04,765
Chen Qingqing!

448
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,045
Situ Feng?

449
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:09,325
Where is this place?

450
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:10,965
A Ferris wheel?

451
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:14,485
Wasn't I at Hauntedland just now?

452
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:16,445
Why am I here, Situ Feng?

453
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:18,485
Your acting is too much.

454
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,005
Let me take a look, Situ Feng.

455
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,245
What happened to your face?

456
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:29,005
I'm fine. How are you feeling?

457
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:31,245
I'm fine.

458
00:28:31,685 --> 00:28:33,285
It has nothing to do with you anyway.

459
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:34,605
Let me take a look.

460
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,565
Thank goodness you didn't lie to me.

461
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:43,165
Don't you know that
you're being rude right now?

462
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:46,365
Do you know that it's rude to talk to me
because you're so short?

463
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:55,885
Come over here.

464
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:57,405
What do you want?

465
00:28:58,205 --> 00:28:59,165
What's wrong?

466
00:28:59,245 --> 00:29:00,965
Are you that great
just because you're tall?

467
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:03,565
Can you simply squeeze
my face just because you're tall?

468
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:05,245
Stop fooling around.

469
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,365
Do you still want to take advantage of me?

470
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,685
No one was taking advantage of you!

471
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:17,325
Qingqing.

472
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,165
I told you not to touch me.

473
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:21,085
-What's wrong?
-It's my fault for falling down.

474
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:22,085
Mind your own business!

475
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:23,925
Let me take a look. Don't move.

476
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:25,845
Get up first.

477
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:27,365
Can you get up?

478
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,125
Did you sprain your ankle?

479
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:33,365
Why are you so careless?

480
00:29:33,445 --> 00:29:35,445
-Be gentle.
-Let me check.

481
00:29:36,605 --> 00:29:37,885
You're always so careless.

482
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:38,805
So sloppy.

483
00:29:42,885 --> 00:29:43,805
It hurts.

484
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,165
Does it still hurt?

485
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,045
Does it feel better?

486
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:07,685
I drove all over Yuncheng

487
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:10,605
to find an unattractive person like you.

488
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:12,605
Are you saying that I'm ugly?

489
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,485
Hey, you're so rough.

490
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,325
How would I know that you're so weak?

491
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:17,965
You fainted because you were scared.

492
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:19,725
It wasn't because I was scared.

493
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:22,925
I fainted because I fell down.

494
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:28,045
So you're not a coward,
but you lack the sense of balance.

495
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:31,045
You're strong-willed,
but your body is weak.

496
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,685
Who are you calling weak?

497
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:34,565
You're doing it again.

498
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:36,365
I'm sorry.

499
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:40,445
Stop fooling around. I'll send you home.

500
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,205
It's swollen.

501
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,005
Can you still walk?

502
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:47,685
I can't.

503
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:49,845
I'll carry you then.

504
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:54,485
Get on me.

505
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:37,165
Will anyone still believe
the words of a liar?

506
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:39,605
I'll tell everyone about your evil deed.

507
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:45,445
Why is it locked?

508
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,605
Did you know Lan Xinyu?

509
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:49,525
Hey!

510
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:53,045
Don't meddle in other people's affairs,
especially in this matter!

511
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,925
I don't want to release this song.

512
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:57,045
I'll bear the consequences myself.

513
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,405
You look so pretty today, Qingchen.

514
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:00,405
Yes, we're friends.

515
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,845
So are you only friends
with beautiful girls?

516
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:05,565
Who is Qingqing to you then?

517
00:32:06,405 --> 00:32:08,205
