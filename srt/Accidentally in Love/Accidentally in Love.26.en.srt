A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:58,685
EPISODE 26

3
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:01,045
Qingqing.

4
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,045
I am really sick this time.

5
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,205
My health is getting worse.

6
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,285
Please don't say that, Grandpa.

7
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:10,645
You're recovering well.

8
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:15,285
I know my own body.

9
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:17,525
It's a fact that I'm getting old.

10
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:21,085
I've been working
on our family's business my whole life

11
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:24,285
and I've got such a capable granddaughter.

12
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:25,965
To me,

13
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:29,765
I have no more regrets.

14
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:32,925
Grandpa.

15
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:38,445
Mom and Dad left me so soon.

16
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:41,365
You were the one
who has always been there for me.

17
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:43,365
I think

18
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:45,405
you're the best grandpa

19
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,485
in the whole wide world.

20
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:49,645
In my world,

21
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:53,165
you're the most talented man.

22
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:58,765
But this man is old now.

23
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,005
You're not old.

24
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,765
Not at all.

25
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:04,245
Qingqing.

26
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:06,485
Listen to me carefully.

27
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,005
I have something to ask you.

28
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:15,365
Will you be willing to take over
our family business?

29
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:21,485
Grandpa.

30
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,805
Please give me some time
to think about it.

31
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:27,405
Okay?

32
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:29,205
All right.

33
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:33,045
I hope you'd be able to find
your true goal in life.

34
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,525
Thank you, Grandpa.

35
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,045
The doctor said

36
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:10,685
he didn't observe
anything that's out of the ordinary.

37
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:12,845
We can soon discharge her
from the hospital.

38
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,165
Lanting.

39
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,565
Is there a reason why
you want to talk to me at this hour?

40
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:33,165
I've more or less heard
about what happened between you guys.

41
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:39,805
First, it was Xinyu then it was Xinya.

42
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,445
It feels like the Lan family owed you
from their past lives.

43
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:48,205
I...

44
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:50,965
I really didn't expect it.

45
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:52,765
I thought

46
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:56,165
she was just being childish.

47
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,965
She thinks that I must have liked her

48
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,445
because we grew up together.

49
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,805
You don't have to tell me that.

50
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,965
I know it's probably hard for you too.

51
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:09,965
But Xinya...

52
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:13,685
Can you guarantee that it's
not going to happen again?

53
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:17,125
Lanting, are you saying that

54
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:20,205
because someone likes me,
I can't be in a relationship at all?

55
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:22,765
Or that I should date someone
I have no feelings for?

56
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:24,525
This is not the same case
as being an idol.

57
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:26,325
There are plenty of fans who like you.

58
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,365
But as for Xinya...

59
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:31,885
She's now committing suicide for you.

60
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:35,005
Are you going to watch her die?

61
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,405
Of course not.

62
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,845
But, I--

63
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:42,445
Xinya is the only daughter left
in her family now.

64
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,965
Are you awake, Xinya?

65
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,485
Lanting.

66
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:01,925
I feel horrible.

67
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,245
Silly girl.

68
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:05,845
Why did you do this to yourself?

69
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,045
I have no idea why.

70
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:11,165
Ever since Chen Qingqing appeared,

71
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:14,605
Feng has been ignoring me.

72
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:19,365
Perhaps I should just disappear for good.

73
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,685
At least, I won't be a burden.

74
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,245
Never say that.

75
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,845
It's wrong of Situ Feng to ignore you,
whether for Xinyu

76
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:28,485
or for you, or for me.

77
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:30,765
But to hurt yourself like this...

78
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:32,525
What if something terrible
really happened?

79
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,045
Aren't you indirectly
helping Chen Qingqing to succeed?

80
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:40,925
What else can I do?

81
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:45,845
That day,

82
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:48,005
he told everyone that

83
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:52,445
Chen Qingqing is his girlfriend.

84
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,965
He didn't consider my feelings at all.

85
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,925
I haven't been around for quite a while.

86
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:05,365
I never expected Situ Feng
to have changed so much.

87
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:08,165
I really should die.

88
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,525
Stop being silly, do you want
to go through it again?

89
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,165
Let me think of a solution for you.

90
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,285
What else can we do?

91
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,365
No matter how deep their love is,

92
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,325
but if they can't see each other,

93
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:28,565
their feelings will definitely fade.

94
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,525
Just get ready to become Situ Feng's wife.

95
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,165
Gosh.

96
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:46,445
Situ Feng.

97
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,205
What's that smell?

98
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:52,845
Smell?

99
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,645
It smells rotten.

100
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,085
How many days have you gone
without washing up?

101
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,725
And your dark circles make you look like
the panda in Kung Fu Panda.

102
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:00,805
Quickly lower your head.

103
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,605
I don't want your fans
to see you like this.

104
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:05,005
Please wash up
once we're back in the office

105
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,405
and change your outfit.

106
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,645
Perhaps you will need
a facial appointment,

107
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:11,885
a beauty treatment,

108
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,085
a massage

109
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:14,205
and a manicure.

110
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,165
Maybe not a manicure.

111
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:17,325
Goodness, my dear Situ Feng.

112
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:21,245
Your latest album
will be released very soon now.

113
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,045
The agency has planned out your schedule.

114
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,685
Do you know how...

115
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:25,685
Are you listening?

116
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:27,965
Hey.

117
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:28,885
Daniel.

118
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,205
If a girl needs you to take care of her,

119
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:34,684
would you take on the responsibility

120
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,525
and give up your true love?

121
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:41,085
Actually, there's something

122
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:43,645
I didn't want to tell anyone.

123
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,804
When I was 17 years old,

124
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,445
during winter,

125
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,685
it was freezing cold.

126
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,165
That year, I...

127
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,245
I was just about to start reminiscing.

128
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:00,845
How could you just ignore me like that?

129
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,125
Damn, you're no fun at all.

130
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:05,125
Goodness, that year's winter

131
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:06,765
was indeed freezing cold.

132
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,405
Hello? Lanting.

133
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:23,365
Situ Feng, come to the hospital now.
Something happened to Xinya.

134
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:25,525
What? I'll head there now.

135
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:33,405
What happened to her?

136
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:38,245
Feng.

137
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:41,605
Without you in my life,
everything would be meaningless to me.

138
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:43,845
I've loved you for all these years,

139
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,125
but you didn't love me in return.

140
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,685
I have decided to leave this world.

141
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:51,925
Xinya pulled out her tube today.

142
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,565
Fortunately, I was there and noticed it.

143
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:55,645
Otherwise, I can't imagine
what would've happened.

144
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:56,685
Situ Feng.

145
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,885
I don't care what's going on
with you and Chen Qingqing.

146
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:02,285
All I know is you've only known her

147
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:03,565
for a short time.

148
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,965
But Xinyu and Xinya
grew up together with you.

149
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:10,205
You can't do this to them.

150
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:15,125
Xinya, please stay with us.

151
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:17,805
Mrs. Lan, please be patient.

152
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:19,685
The doctors are doing their best.

153
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:21,125
Let's remain hopeful.

154
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:28,805
Mrs. Lan.

155
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,125
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:39,765
Doctor.

157
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:41,965
Doctor, how is my daughter?

158
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:43,885
She's all right.

159
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,285
The patient can be transferred
into a general ward later.

160
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,925
-What a relief.
-Although the patient is still in a coma,

161
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:51,285
if nothing goes wrong,

162
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,645
she should regain consciousness
within half a day.

163
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:54,805
Thank you, doctor.

164
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,765
-She's all right.
-Please keep in mind that

165
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:01,805
after she wakes up it is best
not to provoke her mental state.

166
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:06,325
Feng.

167
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:07,885
Yes, Mrs. Lan?

168
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:12,885
I've never blamed you
about what happened to Xinyu.

169
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,165
We all know that

170
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:17,285
it was an accident.

171
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,485
But we can't afford to lose Xinya too.

172
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:23,885
Please, I beg you.

173
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:26,725
I'm begging you, please help us.

174
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,405
Xinya's dad is already worried sick.

175
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:35,165
I couldn't even bring myself to tell him
about what happened today.

176
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,005
Mrs. Lan.

177
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,165
About Xinya--

178
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:42,445
Don't you worry about it.

179
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:45,045
Feng will take care of it.

180
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,965
In the past, he promised us that
he will look after Xinya.

181
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,645
And take care of her in this life.

182
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,365
"This life"?

183
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:55,565
Feng.

184
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,925
Do you mean that

185
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,165
you have the intention to marry Xinya?

186
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,285
Mrs. Lan.

187
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,325
-I--
-Feng.

188
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:06,605
Are you trying
to let history repeat itself?

189
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,405
Do you want the same thing
to happen twice?

190
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:14,445
What were you trying to say, Feng?

191
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,445
It was nothing, Mrs. Lan.

192
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,965
Feng hasn't proposed to Xinya yet.

193
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:23,325
What should we do if Xinya disagrees?

194
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:38,605
How is he?

195
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:40,085
Let's talk over there.

196
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,125
I'll be honest. It doesn't look too good.

197
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:49,125
Even though we managed
to control his condition,

198
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:52,045
Mr. Chen is 70 years old.

199
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,725
The intensity and pressure from his job

200
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:58,405
was enough to affect someone much younger.

201
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:00,405
I should get going.

202
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,405
Given Mr. Chen's age,

203
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:13,165
it's going to be tough for him to manage

204
00:13:13,245 --> 00:13:14,645
such a large family business.

205
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:15,765
Especially...

206
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,365
Especially what?

207
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,845
Especially ever since
you ran away from home.

208
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,685
Mr. Chen has aged so much
during this period.

209
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:26,805
Although Mr. Chen talks
like you need him more,

210
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:30,165
the truth is,

211
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:32,485
he needs you more.

212
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:39,445
Grandpa, how are you feeling?

213
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,165
How has the mergers

214
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:44,125
and acquisitions plans
for the hotels been going?

215
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:48,365
Mr. Chen, the news
that you've fallen ill has spread.

216
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:51,165
Everyone has been trying
to take advantage of the situation.

217
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,165
The proposals were not in our favor.

218
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,365
We're on a bidding war now.

219
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:00,245
Grandpa.

220
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,045
Lie down, Grandpa.

221
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:04,765
I need to take care of this.

222
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,245
I have to solve our current issue.

223
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:09,805
Grandpa.

224
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:12,925
About the contract,
please let me take care of it.

225
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:14,405
You need to rest.

226
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:17,125
Don't worry about it anymore.

227
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:21,805
Let's go.

228
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:18,485
Are you there?

229
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:31,125
-Hey?
-Hello?

230
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:35,085
How is Lan Xinya now?

231
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,285
She is still rather

232
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:38,965
emotionally unstable now.

233
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,645
I'm looking after her at the hospital now.

234
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:43,325
How manipulative.

235
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:46,885
Chen Qingqing.

236
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,325
Can you not say that?

237
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:51,085
A person who tried to kill herself

238
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:52,805
because of love...

239
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,565
Don't you think she needs to be counseled?

240
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:56,285
How would you help her?

241
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:58,245
Cheng Qingqing.

242
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:02,005
So you're talking to me at this hour
just to tell me

243
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:03,925
how pitiful your little Lan Xinya is?

244
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:08,445
-I know now.
-Can we just calm down and talk?

245
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,085
Do you know a lot of things
are happening to me too?

246
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,045
You're supposed to be my boyfriend,

247
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,005
but you're always by her side
instead of mine.

248
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:17,885
So many days have passed.

249
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,725
Were you even concerned about me?

250
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,965
Were you concerned about my grandpa?

251
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:25,565
Were you concerned at all
if I'm still returning to Yuncheng?

252
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:29,445
What if

253
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,885
I can't come back to Yuncheng?

254
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:34,725
What will you do?

255
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,525
Chen Qingqing.

256
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,525
If us being together

257
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:44,565
means that people around us
will get hurt...

258
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:50,725
Perhaps...

259
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:55,165
We shouldn't be together
in the first place.

260
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:02,045
It seems like you didn't want me
to come back at all.

261
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:06,845
As you wish.

262
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:10,285
Goodbye, Situ Feng.

263
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:44,205
Feng.

264
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,245
Xinya.

265
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:47,325
How are you feeling?

266
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,405
Feng.

267
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:50,885
Slowly.

268
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:53,125
Are you feeling better?

269
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:00,405
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

270
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,125
There, there.

271
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:09,285
I'm here.

272
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,165
Will you stay with me

273
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:15,605
and never leave me again?

274
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:17,125
Will you?

275
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:20,445
Yes.

276
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:22,165
But you have to promise me

277
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:25,365
that you will never hurt yourself again.

278
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:32,845
As long as you stay with me,

279
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:35,805
I will promise you anything.

280
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:38,925
Okay.

281
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,005
How about the other promise you made?
Will you commit to it?

282
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:48,605
Yes.

283
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:52,085
I'm so happy.

284
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,445
How unexpected.

285
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,485
The heir of the Chen Family,
the most prestigious

286
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:06,845
out of the four great families
in Jincheng,

287
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:09,485
is someone's mistress.

288
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:13,445
Chen Qingqing, get lost.

289
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:15,285
Hurry up and get lost!

290
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,845
Get out of Situ Feng's sight!

291
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:26,045
What's wrong, Chen Qingqing?

292
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:29,685
In the end, Feng chose me.

293
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:33,925
I will be married to him
and become his wife.

294
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:46,365
These bunch of good-for-nothing people...

295
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:48,565
Why are they bothering me in my dreams?

296
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,525
I am sorry.

297
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:09,085
No matter what I do, people will get hurt.

298
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:11,805
I didn't want to do this.

299
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,525
But I have no choice.

300
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:14,805
I am sorry.

301
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,325
You're my son.

302
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:47,045
Don't easily admit defeat.

303
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,685
I could have made

304
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,525
a mistake.

305
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,805
I have faith in you.

306
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:59,725
Just like how I believed in you

307
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,485
when you pursued music without my consent.

308
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,045
I have my regrets.

309
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:08,165
Ever since your mom passed away,

310
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,445
I haven't been good
with all my responsibilities as a dad.

311
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:13,885
I've always made decisions on my own

312
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,685
and failed to take your feelings
into consideration.

313
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,445
I can understand

314
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,405
if you hate me.

315
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:24,765
Growing up,

316
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:28,965
I thought you were just a playful kid.

317
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:32,405
I ignored your hard work.
I made things difficult for you

318
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:35,805
and went against your wish.

319
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,005
But the truth is--

320
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:39,165
The truth is

321
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:41,525
you were only putting up a front.

322
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:45,805
Deep down, you have
always cared about my career.

323
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:50,565
When Qingqing came to visit the other day,
she told me about it.

324
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:52,965
When she accidentally entered your room,

325
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:57,525
she saw the room was filled
with news about me and my albums.

326
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:04,605
Thanks for being honest with me, my son.

327
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:07,165
I am proud of you.

328
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:10,565
Dad.

329
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,765
I've never resented you.

330
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:16,965
I was only afraid

331
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:19,445
that you didn't care about me.

332
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:27,525
I'm sorry, son.

333
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:34,605
You're all grown up.

334
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:38,485
You're capable of
taking charge of your own life

335
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,565
and be a man who takes responsibility.

336
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:43,085
Starting today,

337
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:45,405
I will not control your life anymore.

338
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:47,245
No matter what you do,

339
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:49,125
I will fully support you.

340
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:57,045
Thank you,

341
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:00,325
Dad.

342
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:16,285
Young Master, it's time to go.

343
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:17,445
The car is here.

344
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:18,765
Whenever you're ready.

345
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:21,285
Okay.

346
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:26,565
Situ Feng!

347
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:27,525
Stop right there.

348
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:29,765
You go ahead.

349
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:33,485
I need to go.

350
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:35,645
Stop.

351
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:39,445
What the hell is this?

352
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:41,965
What do you mean I need to sign
a non-disclosure agreement?

353
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,045
How could you do this to Qingqing?

354
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:49,125
ENGAGEMENT PARTY: SITU FENG, LAN XINYA

355
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:54,925
I hope you'll come.

356
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:56,645
Situ Feng.

357
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,845
You'd better explain this to me right now.

358
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:00,405
Or I'm not letting you go anywhere!

359
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,925
I'm going to be engaged to Xinya.

360
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:06,925
This is your invitation
to attend our engagement party.

361
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:09,205
Are you kidding me?

362
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:13,205
Everyone knows
that you don't even like Xinya.

363
00:24:13,765 --> 00:24:15,285
Do you think it was easy for me?

364
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:17,765
Yes.

365
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:19,765
I don't have feelings for Xinya,

366
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:22,965
but I can't just let her hurt herself
over and over again.

367
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:24,885
What do you mean?

368
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:31,245
A few days ago,

369
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:34,725
Xinya committed suicide again.

370
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:38,925
It took the entire night

371
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:41,325
for the doctors to revive her.

372
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:46,045
I...

373
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:49,125
I'm really scared.

374
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:53,165
I was blamed for Xinyu's life.

375
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:58,645
I can't afford to let anything bad
happen to Xinya too.

376
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:18,365
Is he your fiancé?

377
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:20,205
You two look great together.

378
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,885
It was just a fling.

379
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:23,885
I've already made up my mind.

380
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:25,605
Chen Qingqing and I...

381
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:27,965
It's over...

382
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:30,805
Look, she's asking all the fans

383
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:31,805
to do this.

384
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:34,165
What? This is insane.

385
00:25:34,245 --> 00:25:36,485
We must not fail this mission.
We shall only succeed.

386
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:38,005
Once you're engaged,

387
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:40,245
no matter what Chen Qingqing does,

388
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:42,885
Situ Feng won't be able to back out.

389
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:47,325
By that time,
Situ Feng will be yours forever.

390
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:51,285
