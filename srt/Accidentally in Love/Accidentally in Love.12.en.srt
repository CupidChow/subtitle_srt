A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:59,485
EPISODE 12

3
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:00,965
Go on!

4
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:02,365
Situ Feng!

5
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:13,204
What's going on?

6
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,125
Sorry, it was an accident.

7
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,285
"Accident"?

8
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,805
How can there be so many accidents?

9
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:22,125
Hey, Lin Yiyang!

10
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:27,525
Some fans hacked the agency's computers,
so the music video got leaked.

11
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,205
-I just found out too.
-Situ Feng, can you please

12
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,925
come up with a better excuse next time?

13
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,405
Are you taking me for a fool?

14
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,485
Lin Yiyang!

15
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:36,085
You've known me for so long.

16
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:38,165
You should know me by now.

17
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,805
It's because I know you too well.

18
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:45,245
So everything you do makes me really sick.

19
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,165
Okay.

20
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:47,925
I assure you

21
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:51,525
that I, Situ Feng won't sing
that song again.

22
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:55,685
I don't want to hear any more
of your promises, Situ Feng.

23
00:02:57,365 --> 00:03:00,085
I thought you wouldn't sing that song
for the sake of Qingqing.

24
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:01,805
Look at what happened.

25
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:03,565
You're two-faced.

26
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,165
Okay.

27
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,285
I'm not buying any more of your promises.

28
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:10,885
You're out of chances.

29
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:14,005
Don't blame me for being mean to you.

30
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:25,125
Situ Feng.

31
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:27,325
Did you make a deal with Yiyang

32
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,605
not to sing "Breath"
because he kidnapped me?

33
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,005
Is he using me to threaten you?

34
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:34,605
It's nothing.

35
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:36,365
Just let it be.

36
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:39,445
-But I just heard him say--
-Shall we rehearse?

37
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,005
Sir.

38
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:22,805
He's drinking so much.

39
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,045
Is he okay?

40
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:25,844
He's often like that.

41
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,525
He drinks until he passes out every day.

42
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:29,125
And he ordered us to leave him alone.

43
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:30,445
-But he--
-Don't worry.

44
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,325
He'll leave once he's sober.

45
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:39,685
Li Yiyang.

46
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:43,525
Yiyang.

47
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:44,885
Are you okay?

48
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:53,805
Xinyu.

49
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:54,925
Don't go.

50
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:57,405
Xinyu.

51
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,085
I feel terrible.

52
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,685
HAVE SOME PORRIDGE. TOO MUCH
ALCOHOL IS BAD FOR YOU - FANGFANG

53
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,965
You've got to be there this afternoon,
or I'll be nervous.

54
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:13,925
And I assure you, you'll see
the world's most handsome beast...

55
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:14,965
Situ Feng is not here.

56
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:17,725
Is this yours?

57
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,045
Thanks.

58
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,405
Do you and Yiyang don't have
enough clothes to wear?

59
00:06:30,045 --> 00:06:31,765
Why do you have to exchange them so often?

60
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,365
Aren't you supposed to go
to the meeting for the play?

61
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:37,325
Hurry.

62
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:44,565
You and Lin Yiyang...

63
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:47,565
You're going to be late, Qingqing.

64
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:50,685
Students.

65
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:54,165
Without sacrifice, you won't succeed.

66
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:57,205
The road uphill is the toughest of all.

67
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:58,925
And you all

68
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,525
have passed it through without a hitch.

69
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:03,365
Today,

70
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:06,365
as long as you have total faith
in yourselves

71
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:09,725
to bring out the very best
of your abilities,

72
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,845
you'll surely make this play a success.

73
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:14,205
Did I make myself clear?

74
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:15,125
-Yes!
-Yes!

75
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:16,045
Good.

76
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:18,965
The event is in a few hours.

77
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:22,005
Let's seize the moment
to do the last rehearsal.

78
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:41,165
Xinya.

79
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,165
Look.

80
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:46,285
That bitch Qingqing is about
to take Feng away from you.

81
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,845
Baby, I'm here to check on you.

82
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:58,365
Munian, you're here!

83
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,565
The setup is really nice.

84
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:02,845
Not bad, right?

85
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:03,845
Situ Feng.

86
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,805
I heard you will be wearing
women's clothing.

87
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,365
You guys are so creative!

88
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,685
-Really--
-Qingqing.

89
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:10,685
I have a problem.

90
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,645
What problem?

91
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:14,565
The moves.

92
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,685
What's wrong with your moves? That's...

93
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:18,845
Qingqing.

94
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:24,125
Why don't we rehearse together?

95
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:26,925
Sure.

96
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,645
-Kill the beast!
-Kill the beast!

97
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,685
Take whatever booty you can find.

98
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:33,005
But remember,

99
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:35,965
the beast is mine!

100
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:38,005
-Kill the beast!
-Kill the beast!

101
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:42,645
Gaston, no!

102
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:46,924
Belle!

103
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:50,405
What's the matter, Beast?

104
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,325
Are you in love with her?

105
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:56,685
Don't you know how ugly you are?

106
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:59,005
How can she possibly like you?

107
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:00,365
Die, Beast!

108
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,165
Feng is mine!

109
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:11,925
Your emotions aren't bad,

110
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:14,125
but those aren't the lines. Do it again.

111
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:19,805
I heard that Situ Feng took the
female lead in Beauty and the Beast

112
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:21,485
and Chen Qingqing took the male.

113
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:24,245
-Hurry, let's go and see!
-Let's check it out!

114
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:29,325
Yes, finally.

115
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:34,325
It's so crowded.

116
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:35,605
Yeah.

117
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:38,245
Ms. Chen.

118
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,565
Good job.

119
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:42,085
We should hold more events like this.

120
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,805
Little Town

121
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,485
is a small, quiet town.

122
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,925
Every day, just like
the days before today,

123
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,405
the dawn rises in Little Town.

124
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:10,485
Every morning, we all say...

125
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:13,325
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

126
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:15,885
Look.

127
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:18,205
And this is what the baker sent us.

128
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:21,165
Wheat bread.

129
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:25,405
Ever since we moved here,

130
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,245
Little Town hardly changed.

131
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:33,925
Mr. Jean.

132
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:35,645
Good morning.

133
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,405
Good morning, Belle.

134
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:40,045
Did you lose something again?

135
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:42,165
I believe I have.

136
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:45,285
Don't you think this pose looks familiar?

137
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,845
-Where have I seen it?
-Where have I seen it?

138
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:48,765
Yeah.

139
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,325
I want to return a book.

140
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:52,445
-Look at that.
-It's about two lovers

141
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:53,845
in the beautiful Verona.

142
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:01,765
Qingqing.

143
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:03,165
You're up next.

144
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:04,845
In your final act,

145
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:06,285
do your best.

146
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:08,805
-Go for it.
-I will.

147
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,805
Go.

148
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:13,685
Chen Qingqing.

149
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:16,485
You've got to make the audience

150
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,405
see your talent!

151
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,445
-What the--
-Why did you drink my alcohol?

152
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:42,445
Alcohol?

153
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,045
This isn't a prop?

154
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,525
Yeah, this alcohol is for props.

155
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:46,965
Alcohol for props?

156
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:48,565
Stop drinking it.

157
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:51,645
If this is alcohol, what is this?

158
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:56,605
No one makes slick and quick moves
Like Gaston does

159
00:11:56,685 --> 00:12:00,325
No one shines in the midsummer
Like Gaston does

160
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:03,685
You make me tremble
When I stand beside you

161
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:08,725
-Oh, my, Gaston is so perfect!
-Oh, my, Gaston is so perfect!

162
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,125
Kill the beast!

163
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:13,485
Remember.

164
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:16,405
Take whatever booty you can find.

165
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,245
But the Beast is mine!

166
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:20,605
Oh, no!

167
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:21,605
We're under attack!

168
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,085
Hurry, warn the Master!

169
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:24,405
Full force!

170
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:26,045
-We're not afraid of anything!
-We're not afraid of anything!

171
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,845
-We'll fight them to the end!
-We'll fight them to the end!

172
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:30,525
Master, the castle is under attack!

173
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,085
Just let them come.

174
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,965
I don't care.

175
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:43,565
Hello, there.

176
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:44,725
Beast.

177
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,205
I'm Gaston.

178
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:47,965
Belle sent me.

179
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:52,765
Are you in love with her?

180
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:55,125
Did you honestly think

181
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,965
that she'll love you?

182
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:02,885
No, Gaston!

183
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:04,165
Don't hurt him!

184
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:05,565
Belle!

185
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,845
When we return to the village,
you will marry me.

186
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,485
And that beast's head

187
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:16,005
will hang on our wall.

188
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:20,685
I beg you, Beast.

189
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:21,765
Please let me go!

190
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,005
I'll do anything.

191
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,685
-Please.
-Get out.

192
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,485
Get out of my castle!

193
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:45,405
Belle.

194
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,405
Are you all right?

195
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:47,965
You came back.

196
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:50,285
I told you,

197
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:51,725
I'll be back.

198
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,325
I'm afraid

199
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:55,005
it's my turn to leave.

200
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:56,725
No!

201
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:58,245
You're going to be fine.

202
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:02,125
But...

203
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,925
At least I got

204
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:07,965
to see you again

205
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:10,925
for one last time.

206
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,205
No.

207
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,085
After what we went through,
we're finally together.

208
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,005
You're going to be fine.

209
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,125
I love you.

210
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,085
I love you too.

211
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:33,845
Qingqing.

212
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:35,045
The show is over.

213
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:39,965
Did you drink?

214
00:15:59,565 --> 00:16:01,365
-Fangfang.
-You're awake.

215
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:08,685
How did I get here?

216
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:10,525
You were drunk during the play.

217
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:11,525
You just woke up.

218
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,725
How could I have missed

219
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:17,205
the applause and cheers of the audience?

220
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:19,365
Who told you to drink?

221
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:23,205
What time is it?

222
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:24,565
It's four o'clock. Why?

223
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:27,005
Isn't it that witch's class now?

224
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,045
We're too late now.

225
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,805
Ms. Chen took a sick leave,
so she asked us to have our own revision.

226
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:31,845
Is she sick?

227
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,285
She said she was worn out.

228
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:35,845
Perhaps from all the rehearsals.

229
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:38,525
Is she seriously ill?

230
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,125
Shall we go see her?

231
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:41,485
We just went there.

232
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,525
It's not that serious.

233
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,085
That's good.

234
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,085
If you're still worried,
you can drop by at her place.

235
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:51,205
Good point.

236
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:58,485
NO. 2, SPRING GARDEN, BACK STREET

237
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:05,525
Ms. Chen.

238
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:09,925
Chen Qingqing.

239
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,324
Ms. Chen.

240
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:13,484
I'm here to visit you.

241
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,444
Come in.

242
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:15,724
Thank you.

243
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:20,925
Ms. Chen.

244
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:24,805
You shouldn't overwork like that
after this.

245
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,724
Your health is the most important thing.

246
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,244
I'm just slightly ill.

247
00:17:28,324 --> 00:17:30,364
As long as the play went smoothly,

248
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:32,485
I felt really pleased.

249
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:33,965
It was all thanks to you.

250
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,405
If it wasn't for your supervision,

251
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,045
we wouldn't have been able to pull it off.

252
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,125
Actually, for all this while, we've all

253
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,645
misunderstood you.

254
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,165
It's okay.

255
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,925
There's no need to blame yourself.

256
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:52,085
I just hope that I could see

257
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:53,885
each and every one of you improve.

258
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:56,445
And for this performance,

259
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,965
each and every one of you did a great job.

260
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,285
I'll get you some fruits.

261
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:02,845
No, it's okay.

262
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:04,365
You should get some rest.

263
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,045
It's okay, I'll be fine.

264
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,845
-It'll take just a minute.
-Okay.

265
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,365
Chen Qingqing.

266
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:48,085
What's wrong?

267
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:51,005
Do you know them?

268
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:56,965
Actually...

269
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,085
Actually, Xiao Jingnan

270
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:04,685
is my dad.

271
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,965
What about Chen Youyou?

272
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,125
Chen Youyou

273
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:14,965
is my mom.

274
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,245
Qingqing.

275
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:21,605
You really turned out to be

276
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,525
exactly like Youyou.

277
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:28,005
No wonder when I heard you play the piano,

278
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:29,765
I had

279
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:32,725
a strong sense of déjà vu.

280
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:36,405
This is who I am, more or less.

281
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,445
By the way, I'm Chen Xiao.

282
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,765
I look forward to working with you.

283
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:41,725
Hey.

284
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:44,325
Newcomers should tell us
their vital stats, right?

285
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:48,845
-Vital stats!
-Vital stats!

286
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:50,005
What's going on here?

287
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:53,405
I could hear your commotion from outside.

288
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:56,845
Don't bully our new friend.

289
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:58,965
I brought you some drinks today.

290
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:01,005
Come take them, they are for everyone.

291
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:02,565
-All right!
-All right!

292
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:05,645
For you.

293
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,245
What's your name?

294
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:08,565
Chen Xiao.

295
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:10,085
My name is Chen too.

296
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,445
I'm Chen Youyou.

297
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:12,485
Hello.

298
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,725
It's so good to know you,
my little sister.

299
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,005
Guys.

300
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:18,805
From now on,

301
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,965
Chen Xiao is now my little sister.

302
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,005
Whoever bullies her

303
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:26,685
is going to get it from me, okay?

304
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,845
My mom was so domineering.

305
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:34,205
Come to think of it,

306
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,765
the first time I saw you,

307
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:37,525
you looked kind of familiar.

308
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:41,285
Your mom was like a hero.

309
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:42,925
Ever since I got to know her,

310
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,445
she has been helping me, caring for me

311
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:47,125
and a lot more.

312
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:49,845
She may not remember,

313
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:51,405
but I will always remember.

314
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:56,165
By the way, how are your parents?

315
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,405
My mom passed away many years ago.

316
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,445
And I don't know where my dad is.

317
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:05,485
I came to this school

318
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:09,645
just to find out more about my parents.

319
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:11,245
They're...

320
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,365
Ms. Chen.

321
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,085
They're...

322
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,765
It's been almost 20 years.

323
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:28,765
I've not kept in touch with them.

324
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:34,045
Ms. Chen.

325
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,405
Can you tell me

326
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:38,805
what my dad was like?

327
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:40,685
Because every time

328
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,645
I asked my grandpa,

329
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:45,965
he'd always flip out.

330
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:48,965
He always said that my dad
abandoned my mom.

331
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,205
Then he never came back to see me.

332
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:55,725
Is my dad really that bad?

333
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,845
Did he really love my mom?

334
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:00,885
Jingnan is not a bad person.

335
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:03,445
And the person he loved the most

336
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,285
was Youyou.

337
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,085
He loved Mom the most?

338
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,685
Just a moment, Qingqing.
I need to show you something.

339
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:28,205
This photo was taken

340
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,885
when your parents first met.

341
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:39,605
Youyou, why are you so calm?

342
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:41,685
Your dance partner stood you up.

343
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:43,165
What are you going to do?

344
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:45,005
It's okay.

345
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:46,525
I'll just have to forfeit.

346
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:48,125
You can't pull out like that.

347
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:51,165
You're really great at dancing.
Wouldn't it be a waste to forfeit?

348
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:52,525
Then what should I do?

349
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,805
I think we'll just have

350
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:58,085
to join the audience after this.

351
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,165
Youyou, look.

352
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:04,125
That guy over there dressed up so weirdly.

353
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:09,565
He's walking toward us.

354
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:11,365
Do you know him, Youyou?

355
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:12,845
I don't.

356
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,685
Hello, are you Miss Chen Youyou?

357
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,205
I'm so sorry that my friend
is giving you such a hard time.

358
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:20,765
But he had something urgent
to attend to today,

359
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:21,845
so I'll take his place.

360
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,085
I'm Xiao Jingnan.

361
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:27,645
Hello.

362
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:30,925
Can you dance?

363
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:32,805
Just a little bit.

364
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:35,085
It's still early before the dance.

365
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:36,485
Shall we practice?

366
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:38,845
Sure.

367
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:40,365
I'll get going.

368
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:44,485
-Let's try.
-Okay.

369
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:51,965
Sorry.

370
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:54,645
Sorry.

371
00:24:01,685 --> 00:24:03,685
Sorry. I'm so sorry!

372
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:05,205
I can't really dance.

373
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,125
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

374
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:09,045
I just stepped on your foot.

375
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:13,045
Why don't we take a break?

376
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,325
Sure.

377
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:21,925
Youyou.

378
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:23,285
Can I call you this?

379
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,405
We're in the same grade, right?

380
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,325
I see that you're a bit nervous.

381
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,325
I don't know why either.

382
00:24:30,645 --> 00:24:33,725
Perhaps it's because the dance
is about to start soon.

383
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,405
So I'll get a little bit nervous.

384
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:38,805
Although I can't dance,

385
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:40,085
but I think

386
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:41,805
dancing doesn't matter so much.

387
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:43,525
What matters is that you enjoy the music.

388
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,285
You have to control the rhythm,

389
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:47,805
not let the rhythm control you.

390
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:52,805
Xiao Jingnan.

391
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:54,885
I didn't think you could comfort anyone,

392
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:56,565
but it's just the same.

393
00:24:58,285 --> 00:25:00,165
Are you still nervous?

394
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,165
I'm much better.

395
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:38,925
When I saw them dance, I was stunned.

396
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:42,765
I had a strong feeling
that I should keep watching.

397
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:45,285
As time slowly passed,

398
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,325
looking at them

399
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:49,765
was like gazing at happiness.

400
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:53,045
And then?

401
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:54,685
What happened next?

402
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:58,285
Then,

403
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:01,605
they danced by controlling the rhythm
like your dad said

404
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,925
and won the event as prom king and queen.

405
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:05,965
Really?

406
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:11,165
Xiao Jingnan joined the Student Council
just to be with Youyou.

407
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,805
Then he became the president.

408
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:19,645
Is it this picture?

409
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,405
Two people who really love each other

410
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:25,485
will surely outdo themselves
for one another.

411
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:32,805
Ms. Chen, do you know
what happened to my mom and dad

412
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,125
after graduation?

413
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:41,285
The last time I saw them

414
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:45,165
was when Xiao Jingnan proposed to Youyou.

415
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:03,925
Youyou.

416
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:06,005
Do you remember this song?

417
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:12,445
They played this during the dance
when we first met.

418
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:14,445
Time flies so fast.

419
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:16,325
We're about to graduate.

420
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:17,845
I remember

421
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:21,245
the first time we held hands.

422
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:24,765
I want to keep holding them.

423
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:29,285
The lecturers always said
that graduation means separation.

424
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:32,005
But I don't think so.

425
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:36,085
I think that graduation to us
can be another new beginning.

426
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,445
Youyou, will you marry me?

427
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,125
I will.

428
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:47,245
I will.

429
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,525
And then,

430
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:14,125
I heard that Xiao Jingnan and Youyou
went to work in Jincheng.

431
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:15,925
And then,

432
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:18,245
I went on with my life.

433
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:22,445
Studying, graduating
and looking for a job...

434
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:26,245
I slowly lost touch with them.

435
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:37,685
Qingqing, don't cry.

436
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:39,045
Ms. Chen.

437
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:42,365
Thank you so much.

438
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:47,125
Thank you for telling me so much
about them.

439
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,125
This is the first time
I heard anything about my parents.

440
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:55,405
I'm also happy to be their daughter.

441
00:28:55,965 --> 00:29:00,365
Qingqing, have you found any information
about your dad?

442
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:03,325
No.

443
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:05,965
Don't worry, Qingqing.

444
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:08,245
I'll definitely help you out.

445
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:11,965
I'm sure you'll hear from your dad soon.

446
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:16,685
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

447
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:23,925
Ms. Chen, it's getting late.

448
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:25,205
I should go back to school.

449
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,805
-But I need you to do me a favor.
-Sure.

450
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:31,765
I came to Yuncheng
without telling my grandpa.

451
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,725
So once I go back to school,

452
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:35,605
I still want to continue

453
00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:37,765
presenting myself like I've always been.

454
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:40,405
So you have to help me keep this secret.

455
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:41,885
Please, Ms. Chen?

456
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:43,205
Okay.

457
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,645
That won't be a problem.

458
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,285
I've got to go now, Ms. Chen.

459
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:52,565
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

460
00:29:58,725 --> 00:29:59,885
Let me send you out.

461
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:10,165
Like what Ms. Chen just said,

462
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:13,125
Mom and Dad loved each other.

463
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:18,565
Then why did Grandpa
say that Dad abandoned Mom?

464
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,005
Did he lie to me?

465
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,565
Then why did he have to lie?

466
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:37,925
Your phone, sir.

467
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:43,685
Hello?

468
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:44,885
Hello?

469
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:45,805
Grandpa.

470
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,085
Is that you, Qingqing?

471
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:56,005
How would I know if

472
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:57,885
I'm in love with somebody?

473
00:30:57,965 --> 00:30:59,125
Are you okay now?

474
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,325
I realized that

475
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:01,845
I can be myself in front of her.

476
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:04,325
It looks like this friend of yours

477
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,245
is more than just a friend.

478
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,005
So what if I'm not myself,

479
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:10,125
but I've turned into
a completely different person?

480
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:12,285
Chen Qingqing, what brings you here?

481
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:16,125
How could you just bring
any ordinary person here?

482
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:18,125
Miss, may I see your invitation?

483
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:20,485
We've hated each other since we first met.

484
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,325
And we still do.

485
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:24,005
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

486
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:25,925
Can I say what I like about you?

487
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:28,525
