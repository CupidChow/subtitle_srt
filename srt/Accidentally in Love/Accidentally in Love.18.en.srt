A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,445
EPISODE 18

3
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,605
Fangfang and Lin Yiyang
are staying in the same room.

4
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:04,325
So...

5
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,605
Are you sure that you want to go in?

6
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:07,725
Yes.

7
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:09,725
I have to apologize to Fangfang.

8
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:12,925
All right.

9
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:29,325
I came here to apologize to Fangfang.

10
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:30,845
I didn't come to visit you.

11
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,325
Don't flatter yourself.

12
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:34,725
Fangfang, I'm sorry.

13
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:36,925
It's all right, Situ Feng.

14
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:38,245
I should've been more careful.

15
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:40,205
It wasn't your fault.

16
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:44,845
How are you doing today?

17
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:45,925
I'm doing much better.

18
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:47,805
I don't care if you eat it or not.

19
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:52,685
I'm not hungry.

20
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,445
-Fangfang, do you want to have one?
-I will eat it later.

21
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,365
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

22
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,965
I want to go to the bathroom.

23
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:13,125
Can you give me a hand?

24
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,205
Lin Yiyang, no way.

25
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:18,205
She's a girl. It's inconvenient for her.

26
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:20,365
She didn't say anything.
Why are you so worked up?

27
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,765
-I--
-And I'm not going to the men's bathroom.

28
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,605
-I--
-Enough.

29
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,005
Stop quarreling.

30
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:28,925
Fangfang can't get any rest
if you don't stop.

31
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:30,525
I'll have to put her in another room.

32
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,005
Situ Feng.

33
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:34,445
Just help him get to the bathroom.

34
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:36,965
You can't let him hold it in.

35
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:38,845
Fine, I'll do it.

36
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:44,485
Hey, I'll help you.

37
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,165
-I have to answer this call.
-Go talk outside.

38
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,205
-I'll go with you.
-Okay.

39
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,045
Zhang Fangfang.

40
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:39,565
Actually,

41
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,565
you didn't have to save me.

42
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:43,605
Don't worry.

43
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,605
I didn't think much at the time.

44
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:47,165
I won't blackmail you.

45
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:49,245
I'm trying to say...

46
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,365
We're from two different worlds.

47
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,005
We...

48
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,645
We should stay away from each other.

49
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:06,485
I know.

50
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:09,965
Situ Feng, what's wrong?

51
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,485
Your expression tells me
that something is wrong.

52
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:16,245
Daniel told me that my agency
got an ocean commercial for me.

53
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:18,325
An ocean commercial?

54
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,085
No way.

55
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:22,205
You'll have to get into the water.

56
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,405
It's all right.

57
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,245
Daniel understands my situation.

58
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,765
He'll handle this matter for me.

59
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:32,845
That's good then.

60
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,965
Anyway, I'll leave them to you.
I have to go now.

61
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:37,965
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

62
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,045
-I'll get going now.
-Bye.

63
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,205
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

64
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:55,405
Although Lin Yiyang admitted his mistake,

65
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,245
you...

66
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,125
You should still be careful.

67
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:01,205
Do you hear me?

68
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:06,405
Is it because

69
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:10,365
that I'm a very important person to you?

70
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:19,485
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

71
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:21,325
How long haven't you washed your hair?

72
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,925
-It stinks.
-Go to hell, Situ Feng.

73
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:25,485
It doesn't stink.

74
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:26,645
It smells awful.

75
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:27,805
Cut it out.

76
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:29,125
Don't worry.

77
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:30,085
Did you forget?

78
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,765
I used to practice Taekwondo.

79
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:40,125
Anyway, you need

80
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:42,685
-to watch out.
-I will.

81
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:45,605
I have to answer this.

82
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:46,765
Hello, Daniel?

83
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:48,845
All right. I understand.

84
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:49,805
I'll go there now.

85
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,005
I'll have to go now.

86
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,285
All right.

87
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,805
Ms. Wang.

88
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:20,485
I don't think this commercial
is a good idea.

89
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,725
Situ Feng will probably be reluctant
to do it.

90
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:24,805
He will be reluctant?

91
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,245
If he's reluctant, can't you persuade him?

92
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:28,765
Tell me.

93
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:31,285
How would you like them
to modify the proposal?

94
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,245
It's best if we stay away from water.

95
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:37,605
Open your eyes and take a good look.

96
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:38,925
"Protect the Ocean."

97
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:41,485
-Yes.
-It's not an ocean if there's no water.

98
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:43,325
It would become "Protect the Desert."

99
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,485
-Yes, but you know--
-There's no but.

100
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:47,645
Situ Feng's career has thrived

101
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:50,725
under your care
over the last couple of years.

102
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:51,885
Yes.

103
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,285
But look at him now.

104
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:55,005
He can't do this.

105
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:56,285
He won't do that.

106
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:58,725
We spent so much money
on him to make him a star.

107
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:01,085
-He turned out to be so disobedient.
-That's not true.

108
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:03,445
Then, I should invest in someone
who's more obedient.

109
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:07,365
But Situ Feng's music career
has a lot of potentials.

110
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,405
-Commercial value is what matters now.
-Yes.

111
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:14,445
He can't even do a commercial.
How can he earn money for the agency?

112
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:17,765
A trainee complained to me today.

113
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,845
He said that we spent all our resources
on Situ Feng.

114
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:23,565
-They couldn't make a dime.
-That's not true, Ms. Wang.

115
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:24,965
Just give me an answer.

116
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:26,885
Is he going to do

117
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:29,525
this commercial or not?

118
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:30,845
This...

119
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:32,005
Ms.Wang, you...

120
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,005
This--

121
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,164
Ms. Wang.

122
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:36,684
I will do it.

123
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:38,885
Hey, Situ Feng.

124
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:42,605
Well, since Feng has agreed,

125
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:44,605
I'll be looking forward to it.

126
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,485
Feng, if you cooperate,

127
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:49,765
the company will treat you well.

128
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:16,525
Situ Feng.

129
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:19,405
Ms. Chen.

130
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:21,565
Please have a rest here.

131
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,165
Young Master is taking a shower now.

132
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:28,205
But you told me
that he was taking a shower an hour ago.

133
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:29,925
Is he not done?

134
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:30,845
Well...

135
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:32,405
How about this?

136
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:34,205
I will sit here and wait.

137
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:35,885
You can get back to your work.

138
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:38,605
-Okay.
-Thank you.

139
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:45,885
Situ Feng?

140
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:49,525
Situ Feng, I'm coming in.

141
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:54,685
Situ Feng!

142
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:57,285
Situ Feng.

143
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:00,005
Situ Feng, wake up.

144
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,525
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

145
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:04,725
What are you doing here?

146
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:07,685
I just wanted to check on you.

147
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:10,925
Didn't our maid tell you?

148
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,165
I was taking a shower.

149
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:14,085
She did.

150
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,645
Why did you still come in then?

151
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,165
Were you trying to peep at me?

152
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:18,965
Situ Feng.

153
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:20,765
You're overthinking.

154
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,285
Actually,

155
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:26,205
I was thinking

156
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,205
that I could overcome my fear of water.

157
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:31,965
Aren't you silly?

158
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,325
How could you overcome your fear of water

159
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,005
by submerging your head in the tub?

160
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:38,685
How did you know?

161
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:43,405
Your entire body is dry
except for your head.

162
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:44,805
Were you out of your mind?

163
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:46,205
Yes.

164
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,445
Hey, nonsense.

165
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,765
A smart man wouldn't have done that.

166
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,005
Why did you come here anyway?

167
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:59,005
First of all, I wanted to ask you
about the commercial issue.

168
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:01,405
Secondly, I wanted to thank you

169
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:03,405
for helping me get through

170
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:05,605
the most difficult time in my life.

171
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:09,405
Therefore, I wanted to see
if I could be of any help to you.

172
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:10,845
There's a saying that goes,

173
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:14,325
"A drop of water in need,
shall be returned with a spring indeed."

174
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,365
All right.

175
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:19,725
First of all, I boasted to my boss
that I could do the commercial.

176
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,205
I'll have to shoot underwater in a week.

177
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,685
Secondly, I'm sure
you can't be of any help to me.

178
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:28,165
-You should go home and go to bed.
-Who said so?

179
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:30,645
In this world,

180
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:34,125
there's nothing that I can't do.

181
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:36,165
But...

182
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,805
A week of preparation is too short.

183
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:42,805
Therefore,

184
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:45,845
don't bother about it.

185
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:47,125
Situ...

186
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,045
Situ Feng!

187
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,605
Situ Feng!

188
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:51,645
-Don't mess with me.
-Chen Qingqing.

189
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,725
Be careful.

190
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,565
It's okay if you get hurt.

191
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,485
But don't break my new toy.

192
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:00,565
What is this?

193
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:02,045
Can I take a look?

194
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,285
What is this?

195
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,045
Do you want to know?

196
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,925
Come on. Let me show you.

197
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,485
-Hurry up.
-What is it? Why are you so mysterious?

198
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,605
Welcome to Your Highness' concert.

199
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:35,725
Nights

200
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:38,805
City lights

201
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,485
People come and go

202
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:44,365
Like thousands of shining stars

203
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:49,605
Stars come and go

204
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:52,365
The future is a puzzle

205
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:56,245
The glare makes it hard to see

206
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:00,565
Day and night alternates
Time fleets like a white horse

207
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:05,205
-I stay there holding onto memories
-We shall remember

208
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,605
Those times

209
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:11,485
The tide recedes on the eve of sunrise

210
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:15,805
-Separated and say goodbye to the past
-Farewell

211
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:19,165
For all the wrongdoings

212
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:25,485
You sail through endless years

213
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:28,725
Time is like the surface of the sea

214
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:31,445
It reflects 1,001 nights

215
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:36,045
Those unchanged has changed

216
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:39,925
The fallen leaves after the run

217
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,765
The wind carries them to someone else

218
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:48,365
And they carry him forward

219
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:51,005
Hope is standing on the edge

220
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:53,845
It lights up day and night

221
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:59,165
It shines within my sight

222
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:02,565
When I get to the end of the story

223
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:05,325
I understand how fate has been right

224
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:10,325
It's all about staying by your side

225
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,285
Why are the lights off?

226
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,325
I think the power went out.

227
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,165
Situ Feng, you know what?

228
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,805
When you're on the stage,

229
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:25,125
you exude

230
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:27,685
a very special vibe.

231
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:33,205
It shows how devoted
and really passionate you are.

232
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:35,605
You seem to be
an entirely different person.

233
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,245
How did you do that?

234
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,165
When I sing,

235
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,565
I forget about everything else.

236
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,245
It's as if I entered another world.

237
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:48,885
A world where only music exists.

238
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:56,485
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

239
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:57,405
I've got an idea.

240
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,725
Let's work hard together
over the next week.

241
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,925
Let me help you.

242
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,525
I'll cure your fear of deep water.

243
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,925
Let's work together. What do you say?

244
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:14,925
All right.

245
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:41,245
I've got the tickets.

246
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:42,725
Let's go.

247
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,045
No, help me.

248
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,605
I can't do this. I really can't.

249
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:54,525
-No, I'm dying!
-Situ Feng.

250
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:55,845
I'm drowning.

251
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:58,005
Gosh, I'm sorry, everyone.

252
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,485
Hey, Situ Feng. Let's go over there.

253
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:08,925
Wait.

254
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:10,645
Give me a break.

255
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:13,925
You can take a break.
I'll check it out myself.

256
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,125
Hold on. Come back.

257
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:17,925
Chen Qingqing.

258
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,005
I'm serious.

259
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,725
Every time I start to think
that you're kind of cute,

260
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:27,205
you'll play pranks on me
to make me dislike you.

261
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:29,525
Situ Feng, let me remind you.

262
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:32,085
Don't forget
what you promised me last night.

263
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,525
A man who doesn't keep his word
is distasteful.

264
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:36,445
I--

265
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:40,845
You promised to listen to me
for the entire week last night.

266
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,245
If I tell you to go east,
you can't go west.

267
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:46,485
But still, you can't pull pranks on me.

268
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:50,965
I'm not pulling pranks on you.

269
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:56,925
I came up with a plan for you.

270
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:58,725
The movie just now

271
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:01,445
was only an appetizer
that was as mild as a drizzle.

272
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:06,964
Coming up next,
there's a storm waiting for you.

273
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:08,565
Come on.

274
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:09,525
Please.

275
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:14,604
Can we not talk about drizzle and storm?

276
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:15,765
I'm getting old.

277
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:17,844
My heart can't handle it.

278
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:23,925
Take a look.

279
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,364
What are you going to do again?

280
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:29,725
Let's do some exercises
since you're getting old.

281
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:31,165
Come on. Let's exercise.

282
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:36,045
-Where are you taking me?
-Just here.

283
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:37,165
Stand straight.

284
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,405
Are you ready?

285
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,805
One, two,

286
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:42,725
three!

287
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,885
I can do it!

288
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,485
I can do it!

289
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:47,885
I can do it!

290
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,925
I can do it!

291
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:54,685
I can do it!

292
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:58,805
I can do it!

293
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:04,365
Wow, Situ Feng.

294
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:07,165
Do you think that you're in the Olympics?

295
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,725
Aren't you a little overdressed?

296
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:10,885
Get set...

297
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:11,805
One.

298
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:13,805
Continue.

299
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,245
Two.

300
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:16,245
Continue.

301
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:19,165
Three!

302
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,325
3.1415926

303
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:24,205
56575859.

304
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:25,645
Situ Feng.

305
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,045
You can do it.

306
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:43,485
Let's give it another try, okay?

307
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:44,925
No, this is my limit.

308
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,125
This is my limit.

309
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:57,725
Situ Feng!

310
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,285
Rise and shine.

311
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,405
Why is it you again?

312
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:03,685
After going through training
in the last few days,

313
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:07,005
your mind and body
have been well-adjusted.

314
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:08,245
Therefore,

315
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:11,765
it's time to take our last step.

316
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,525
I don't want
to be the spokesperson anymore.

317
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,285
Get up.

318
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,645
Situ Feng.

319
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:23,725
Get up.

320
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:25,365
Wake up.

321
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:26,685
I'm going to say it again.

322
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:28,045
You can't give up.

323
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,285
Young Master, Ms. Chen--

324
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:32,085
Young Master, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

325
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:34,805
Chen Qingqing!

326
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,685
You've ruined my good reputation!

327
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:39,525
You've never had a good reputation.

328
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,885
That's not true.

329
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,565
Young Master, breakfast--

330
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:48,605
Situ Feng!

331
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:55,125
So where are we going today?

332
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:57,445
You'll find out soon.

333
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:00,445
By the way, where's your little stereo?

334
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,325
Why do you need it?

335
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:06,725
That's my secret weapon.

336
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:18,405
We've arrived.

337
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,485
Qingqing.

338
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:21,845
Where are we?

339
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:24,165
Take a guess.

340
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:27,525
The wind here
gives me a feeling of serenity.

341
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:31,965
Situ Feng, I'm going
to remove your eye cover now.

342
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,485
But don't open your eyes yet.

343
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:39,045
Don't open your eyes.

344
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:45,485
Situ Feng.

345
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,805
You can open your eyes now.

346
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:03,845
Situ Feng.

347
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:05,525
Don't be afraid.

348
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:07,085
Close your eyes.

349
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:08,565
Listen carefully.

350
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:14,165
Next,

351
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,365
let's welcome Situ Feng!

352
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,725
Actually, this place
is no different from any other places.

353
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:26,765
As long as there's music,

354
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:29,765
any place can be your stage.

355
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,685
Separated from dawn by the sea

356
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:42,285
Leave and say goodbye to the past

357
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:50,165
You sail through endless years

358
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,165
Look, Situ Feng.

359
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:56,205
There's nothing scary about the sea.

360
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,245
I believe in you.

361
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,925
I believe that you can do it.

362
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:06,005
The fallen leaves after the run

363
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,725
The wind carries them to someone else

364
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:13,645
And they carry him forward

365
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:16,205
Qingqing.

366
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:08,205
Qingqing, don't go.

367
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:09,565
I can't lose you.

368
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:15,005
Xinya.

369
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:16,885
Feng.

370
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:20,405
He was probably saying "kissing."

371
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:22,085
You meant kissing, right?

372
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:23,805
I know.

373
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:25,565
Let's talk when I get back to the office.

374
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,485
Oh, my God, you're finally awake.

375
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:29,845
Daniel, where's Chen Qingqing?

376
00:24:29,925 --> 00:24:31,365
Don't worry about Chen Qingqing.

377
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,725
Talk about yourself first. What happened?

378
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:36,085
We went to the sea.

379
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:39,405
There was an accident.

380
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,885
I fell into the water with Qingqing
and then...

381
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,565
I don't remember what happened afterward.

382
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:45,965
You should do things slowly.

383
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:47,765
How could you risk your life?

384
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:49,805
Fortunately, the doctor said

385
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:51,805
that you only suffered
from emotional distress.

386
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:52,845
You're physically all right.

387
00:24:53,485 --> 00:24:55,205
Daniel, where's Chen Qingqing?

388
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:57,245
Qingqing looked after you the whole night.

389
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:59,245
She got a call this morning
and left in a hurry.

390
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:02,365
By the way, look. She sent you a message.

391
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:05,325
Are you feeling better?

392
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:08,205
The moment you dived into the water,

393
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:10,445
I thought that you looked really cool.

394
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:12,005
I'm sorry

395
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:14,045
that I couldn't take care of you
until you recover.

396
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,525
My grandpa has fallen ill.

397
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:16,925
I have to go back to Jincheng.

398
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,805
I don't know when I will be back.

399
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,445
Good luck with your commercial.

400
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:23,285
Chen Qingqing.

401
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:27,365
-What are you going to do?
-I'm going to look for Qingqing.

402
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:28,685
You just woke up.

403
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:29,885
Situ Feng.

404
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,405
Can you not be so willful?

405
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:33,805
You're not going anywhere
except for the hospital today.

406
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:36,525
That's right.
You should take care of yourself first.

407
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:38,125
You can go anywhere you want later.

408
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:46,205
Xinya.

409
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:48,285
I'm sorry.

410
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:56,285
It's all right, Feng.

411
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,205
Get some rest.

412
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:00,205
I'm going to go now.

413
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:31,965
You and Chen Qingqing are friends.

414
00:26:32,405 --> 00:26:33,485
Why did you follow me?

415
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:36,125
Did you come here to make fun of me?

416
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:37,525
Are you satisfied now?

417
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:43,285
I just wanted to cheer you up.

418
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,085
You?

419
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:46,685
Forget it.

420
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:48,405
What is it?

421
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:50,165
What's wrong with me?

422
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:54,165
I don't want to argue with you.

423
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:57,445
Can you just turn into a ball? Roll out!

424
00:26:58,645 --> 00:26:59,525
Lan Xinya.

425
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,325
Don't cross the line.

426
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:04,005
I'm a man. How can I roll on the floor?

427
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,205
Lan Xinya, what have you done to me?

428
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,365
Why did I really listen to you and roll?

429
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:21,085
Can you be even more childish?

430
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:23,445
I can't stop.

431
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:27,485
Xinyu.

432
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,285
In the past years,

433
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:32,565
coming here

434
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:35,565
frightened me the most.

435
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:36,885
LAN XINYU

436
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:38,165
I was afraid to see you.

437
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:41,325
But you always showed up in my dreams.

438
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,005
Xinyu.

439
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:57,765
In my heart,

440
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:00,965
you were the kindest,

441
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:02,325
the most beautiful,

442
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:04,045
and at the same time,

443
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,845
I thought of you
as my dearest elder sister.

444
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,365
This will never change.

445
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:12,885
I finally understand now.

446
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:18,365
I wouldn't let you go

447
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,045
because

448
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,485
I was too stubborn.

449
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:29,125
I didn't want to forget
the painful memory.

450
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:35,005
I think

451
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:38,005
that I can finally let you go now.

452
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:40,605
I know

453
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:44,565
that you would want me
to focus on my life,

454
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,405
sing the songs I want to sing

455
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:51,365
and love the person who I want to love.

456
00:28:53,685 --> 00:28:54,805
Xinyu.

457
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,085
Goodbye.

458
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,125
Don't disappoint me.

459
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:56,685
It's my pleasure working with you.

460
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:08,045
I thought that you hated me.
Why are you helping me?

461
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,125
-What?
-Qingqing,

462
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:10,765
give me your address. I'll go find you.

463
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:12,805
Our address is Canglan Village, Beijiao.

464
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:14,085
Come and we'll meet you here.

465
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:15,325
STOP

466
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:17,525
-Situ Feng!
-Where's your house?

467
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:18,605
-My house?
-Yes.

468
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,285
Grandpa, you're back. I've made dinner.

469
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:24,005
-You've made dinner?
-Yes.

470
00:30:26,765 --> 00:30:28,845
I'm Lan, Qingqing's best friend.

471
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:31,445
I love your songs, Feng.

472
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:32,565
Feng and Lan.

473
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:35,045
Go and hang this bedsheet.

474
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:39,965
