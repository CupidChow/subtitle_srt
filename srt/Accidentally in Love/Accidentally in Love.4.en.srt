A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:58,765
EPISODE 4

3
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:04,485
Today, we have a new student in our class.

4
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:09,125
Chen Qingqing.

5
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:12,325
Only the seat in the last row
is not taken.

6
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:13,965
You can sit over there.

7
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,325
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,765
Hello, I am your new deskmate.

9
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:33,805
I'm Chen Qingqing.

10
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:37,565
Situ Feng.

11
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:40,765
I don't care who you are
outside of school,

12
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:43,405
you must be friendly
to your classmates here.

13
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,205
Situ Feng.

14
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,485
The new semester has started.
Let's begin the class.

15
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:09,925
Please open your textbooks.

16
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:20,125
-What is she doing?
-What?

17
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:21,845
Is she crazy?

18
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,165
Ma'am, I'm ready. We can start now.

19
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:32,965
Chen Qingqing.

20
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,325
What are you doing?

21
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,405
Go back immediately!

22
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:45,645
Don't laugh!

23
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:48,485
I'll write a few questions for you to do.

24
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:00,845
After being home tutored
for so many years,

25
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:04,725
I finally know how it feels like
to study at college.

26
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:41,805
Do you think
if you pretend not to know me,

27
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:43,805
I would let it go?

28
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,525
I've given you the money.

29
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:51,165
What else do you want?

30
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,885
What about you? You even followed me here.

31
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,285
And you said you weren't my fan?

32
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,045
Hey, Situ Feng.

33
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,285
You are shameless.

34
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,645
I followed you?

35
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:06,165
Do you know

36
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,725
how unfortunate it was for me to meet you?

37
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:11,045
Do you know how much
I've suffered because of you?

38
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,085
I didn't know they would take
a photo of us and post it online.

39
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:17,365
This thing is over.

40
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:19,205
And...

41
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,525
do not mention it again,

42
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:26,525
or it will only get more complicated.

43
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:35,405
Do you think this is something

44
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,565
I could let go so easily?

45
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:45,925
Chen Qingqing, Situ Feng.

46
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,045
Stand up, the two of you.

47
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:57,085
On the first day of school,
you disrupted the classroom.

48
00:05:57,405 --> 00:06:00,125
As a punishment,
you two will clean the classroom today.

49
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:02,365
The class is dismissed.

50
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,285
Stand up.

51
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:06,685
Goodbye.

52
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:09,645
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

53
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:30,565
When will Your Highness
release another album?

54
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,325
-We like you so much.
-We like you so much.

55
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:36,765
Were the things I learned
as a child useful?

56
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,205
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes!

57
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,765
Mr. Jin Taiyong, please teach me!

58
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:44,885
An ultimate move to win.

59
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,525
Front leg kick followed by
a 360-degree single leg whirlwind kick.

60
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,925
If you asked me a minute ago,

61
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:53,485
I would say they were useless.

62
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,565
But now,

63
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:58,805
I'll tell you,

64
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,845
they are very useful.

65
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:13,845
Excuse me, everyone, please move aside.

66
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:27,445
Chen Qingqing.

67
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,245
We can talk if you want.

68
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:34,165
Situ Feng.

69
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:35,605
Nice to meet you.

70
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:37,845
I would appreciate your advice.

71
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:00,725
Thank you.

72
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,525
That's her, the strange transfer student.

73
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:18,205
Let's go. Where did she come from?

74
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:29,165
That's her.
I don't know what trick she used

75
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:31,125
that she got to be Situ Feng's deskmate.

76
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:33,245
She's Situ Feng's stalker.

77
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,164
I heard she'd do anything
to get his attention.

78
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,284
She even kissed Situ Feng.

79
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,645
I'll say it one more time.

80
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,005
I'm not Situ Feng's stalker.

81
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,684
Aren't you his stalker?

82
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,725
I heard you told everyone
that you were his fiancée.

83
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:46,684
Hey, can you get your facts straight?

84
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,525
It was Situ Feng who begged me
to be his fiancée.

85
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,965
See, she said she is his fiancée herself.

86
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:54,885
Shameless.

87
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:56,965
-Who did you call shameless?
-You're shameless.

88
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:58,045
They don't really mean it.

89
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,125
-Let's go. We need to clean the classroom.
-Psycho.

90
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,165
So defensive.

91
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:03,365
That Situ Feng!

92
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,965
The teacher said clearly that
we should clean the classroom together.

93
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,325
But he got away.

94
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:10,445
What kind of person is he?

95
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:13,205
He really thinks he's as a superstar.

96
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:14,925
Then what does it make me?

97
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:18,285
Qingqing, you'd better keep a low profile
and stay out of trouble.

98
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:20,485
And remember what I told you,

99
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,245
-do not--
-Do not mess with Situ Feng.

100
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:25,725
Do you think I want to do that?

101
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:29,765
I don't want to have anything to do
with that jerk.

102
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:31,765
That's good.

103
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:35,325
And don't go against Miss Chen Xiao.

104
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:38,085
I didn't.

105
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:40,685
I'm serious.

106
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:43,965
Chen Xiao, known as the Old Witch,

107
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:46,045
has a reputation of being cold-blooded
and heartless.

108
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:50,685
Rumor has it that many years ago,
a student talked back to her in class.

109
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:52,925
And on the very same day,

110
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:54,805
he disappeared.

111
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,205
No one has ever seen him again.

112
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:02,285
That's horrible.

113
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:06,125
Anyway, we should focus on our studies.

114
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,805
Don't mess with the wrong people.

115
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:09,125
Okay.

116
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,925
You should clean the blackboard first.

117
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:18,085
Okay.

118
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:28,965
Jerk!

119
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:31,325
That big jerk!

120
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:34,245
-Leaving me here alone--
-Chen Qingqing.

121
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,205
What?

122
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:39,045
Situ Feng didn't feel well,

123
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:40,925
so he went to the infirmary.

124
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,405
Give me that eraser.

125
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:45,645
You should mop the floor.

126
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,565
You still have a little conscience left.

127
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,045
-Well, Chen Qingqing...
-What?

128
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:58,045
The day at the wedding,
I didn't mean to lie to you.

129
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,605
I didn't know that Situ Feng...

130
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:03,045
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:04,845
It's okay.

132
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,285
I won't hold a grudge against you.

133
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:12,725
Hello? Hello, who's this?

134
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:14,925
A delivery for me?

135
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:16,685
What kind of delivery service is this?

136
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,805
Why do I have to come to the rooftop?

137
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:26,885
What a coincidence.

138
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,325
You two have even become deskmates.

139
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:31,925
But based on the way you look,
I don't think I have to worry.

140
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:35,165
-There won't be any rumors about you two.
-Hey, who the hell are you?

141
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:36,965
I'm Situ Feng's manager.
What are you doing?

142
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:38,525
For heaven's sake.

143
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:41,885
-Did you call your manager here
-You...

144
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,885
-to make me pay for the medical expenses?
-No...

145
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:46,445
Let me be clear. There's no way I'd pay!

146
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,125
Hey.

147
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,725
Do not assume everyone
is as bad as you are.

148
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,525
Are you trying to blame me?

149
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,445
Who brought me to your dad's wedding?

150
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:58,605
Who told everyone that I was your fiancée?

151
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,885
Who kissed me twice against my will?

152
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:02,445
Twice!

153
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,245
There are so many people out there.

154
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:09,805
Fine, I've given you the money.

155
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,445
And I've also helped you find your bag.

156
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:12,965
What else do you want from me?

157
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:16,845
Don't talk
as if you were the victim, okay?

158
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:18,245
Look at me.

159
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:21,365
I am the victim here.

160
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:27,605
No one has dared to hit me before.

161
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:29,605
You are the first one.

162
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:30,725
Fine.

163
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:32,205
Let me tell you this.

164
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:34,725
From now on,

165
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:37,605
I will hit you more often.

166
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,525
That's enough, stop fighting.

167
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:42,925
Take a look, did you post this?

168
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:44,805
What is it?

169
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:46,765
SITU FENG'S FIANCÉE
APPEARED IN MING DE COLLEGE

170
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:49,845
Who took such an ugly photo of me?

171
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:50,885
Who?

172
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:52,885
Who took it?

173
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:54,645
That's not the point.

174
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:56,485
Anyway, it's great
that you didn't post it.

175
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:00,725
I called you here today
to put an end to the rumors about you two.

176
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:03,045
If the media or fans ask about it,

177
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:07,365
I want you to say
that you are Situ Feng's assistant.

178
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:08,965
-Assistant?
-Assistant?

179
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:09,925
Yes.

180
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:12,485
Are you kidding me?

181
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,805
Hey, you don't want to? That's great.

182
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:17,045
I don't want you to be my assistant too.

183
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:21,245
I don't want to have anything to do
with a jerk like you.

184
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,245
If you weren't a woman,

185
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:25,405
-I would have--
-What would you do?

186
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:27,965
I know what happened at the wedding.

187
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:29,925
He's young and ignorant. Don't mind him.

188
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,365
Please accept this.

189
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,445
What's this? Is it a check?

190
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:37,045
This is a VIP ticket
to Situ Feng's concert.

191
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:39,325
-Concert?
-Yes.

192
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:41,685
Why would I want to go to his concert?

193
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:44,365
This...

194
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:45,885
Could you afford a VIP ticket?

195
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,165
It is worth 10,000 yuan.

196
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,565
Well, don't make rash decisions.

197
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:50,725
This is my business card.

198
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,565
Call me after you think about it
thoroughly.

199
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,325
Call me.

200
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:56,685
Situ Feng.

201
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:59,205
Aren't you afraid that your image
will be ruined?

202
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,325
Well, let me tell you this.

203
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,525
From now on,

204
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:06,605
I will be your archenemy.

205
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:11,205
I will spare no effort
to talk bad about you everywhere.

206
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:18,565
Hey.

207
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,125
This girl is a pain in the neck.

208
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:24,045
How many times have I told you?

209
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:27,645
Don't put on a cold face every day.
People will be offended, okay?

210
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:31,165
Although, nobody will believe
the story about this fiancée of yours.

211
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,325
I have told you many times,

212
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,085
you must keep a good relationship
with your classmates. You are...

213
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:38,485
Can you let me finish before you leave?
Can't you respect me a little?

214
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:40,285
Do you have to be like this every time?

215
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,285
Let's go have dinner.

216
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:47,405
I have something to do.

217
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:50,005
What do you want to eat?
I'll get it for you.

218
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:51,965
There's no need.
I'll eat before I come back.

219
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:52,885
I'm leaving, bye.

220
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:56,685
Bye.

221
00:14:58,085 --> 00:14:58,925
Hello, ma'am.

222
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:01,365
I want Boston lobster pasta.

223
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,285
I want my lobster shelled.

224
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,525
For my fruits,
I want Hokkaido Yubari melon.

225
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,285
And A bottle of the 1990 Romanee-Conti.

226
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,325
Thank you.

227
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,605
Chen Qingqing.

228
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,485
I don't think they serve those
in the canteen.

229
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:19,325
Aren't these the most basic things?

230
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,685
Then what do we have here?

231
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:25,885
We have mantis shrimps, noodles with
soybean paste, cantaloupe and grape juice.

232
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:32,725
The school is so big.

233
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,085
Where can I find information
about my dad?

234
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:39,885
Chen Qingqing, can I sit here?

235
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:41,685
It's you.

236
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:43,205
Yes, I am Xiaobi.

237
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:46,285
This is Xiaosi, Xiaoyi
and that's the class president.

238
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,205
You just transferred
to a new school today,

239
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,245
don't you feel lonely?

240
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,325
It's all right.

241
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:54,365
You dare go against the old witch
on your first day.

242
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,605
Are you really a fan of Situ Feng?

243
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:58,845
I heard you claimed to be
Situ Feng's fiancée.

244
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,765
There are too many rumors going around.
Which one of it is true?

245
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,085
Do you really want to know?

246
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,005
-Yes.
-Yes.

247
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:09,885
These are all confidential information.

248
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:12,845
You must trade it
with the information you have.

249
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:14,765
Not to brag,

250
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:17,605
but there are only a few things
in this school that we don't know.

251
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,605
Go ahead and ask.

252
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:23,005
If I want to know the information
of a Ming De graduate, who should I ask?

253
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:26,885
I remember the graduation information
of all previous students

254
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,645
are in the Student Council's office.

255
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:31,885
Then can you take me there? Now.

256
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:34,485
The Student Council's office
is not open to anyone.

257
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:37,085
Yes and you're not a sophomore,

258
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,005
they won't let you join them.

259
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:41,525
I see.

260
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:44,205
Is there another way?

261
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:45,165
Another way?

262
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:46,085
There is one.

263
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:48,445
Gu Nanxi is the current president
of the Student Council.

264
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,245
You can try and ask him.

265
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:54,405
Although he seems to be
very nice to everyone,

266
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:56,405
he does everything by the book.

267
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:59,085
Is that so?

268
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:00,805
I see.

269
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,285
Okay, we've told you everything we know.

270
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:07,405
Now, can you tell us
what is your relationship with Situ Feng?

271
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:11,444
Situ Feng is...

272
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:25,005
Come closer.

273
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:26,604
Let me tell you,

274
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:30,165
Situ Feng is a very careless man.

275
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:31,124
You know what?

276
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,245
How could he be--

277
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:34,925
Also...

278
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,045
Chen Qingqing.

279
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:01,125
You broke into
the Student Council's office

280
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:04,445
and sabotaged school property
in the first week of school.

281
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:06,405
-It's just a lame painting? So--
-Lame?

282
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,445
This was painted by the art master,
Burton Goldman.

283
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,645
He personally painted this
for our first chancellor.

284
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:17,845
It's the most memorable piece of art
in Ming De College.

285
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,085
Sir.

286
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:25,645
How much do you think I should pay for it?

287
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,005
How about 100,000 yuan?

288
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:29,365
What? 100,000 yuan?

289
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:31,445
-I--
-It's famous, you know.

290
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:34,045
If I don't pay...

291
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:35,445
what will happen?

292
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,725
If you don't pay?

293
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:38,125
Let me see.

294
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:42,285
Breaking into a forbidden area,
sabotaging school property

295
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:43,885
and refusing to pay...

296
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:45,925
-You'll be expelled.
-Sir!

297
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:46,925
I'll pay.

298
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:48,845
I'll pay.

299
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:52,605
Can you give me some time?

300
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,565
Fine.

301
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:55,925
I'll give you a week.

302
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:57,565
Go.

303
00:20:58,965 --> 00:20:59,805
Our chancellor...

304
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,165
This is bad.

305
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,405
It's 100,000 yuan?

306
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:14,325
Where can I get that much money?

307
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:18,725
Do I

308
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:22,005
really have to be

309
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:23,565
a fake assistant to Situ Feng?

310
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,685
Chen Qingqing, are you losing your mind?

311
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:29,045
How can you do that?

312
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:33,365
But what should I do?

313
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:40,965
Hey, Fangfang.

314
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:45,525
Hello? Qingqing.

315
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,885
Hello? Fangfang.

316
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,325
Where are you going?

317
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:50,205
I'm going to the library.

318
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,645
I'll come back later.

319
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,525
It's not appropriate
to make phone calls here.

320
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,725
I'm going to hang up now.

321
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:56,085
Okay.

322
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:00,445
What is she hiding?

323
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:13,485
Fangfang?

324
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,565
Qingqing?

325
00:22:15,405 --> 00:22:16,325
Why are you here?

326
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:18,765
No, why are you here?
And why are you dressed like this?

327
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,725
I see you've been sneaking around
these days.

328
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:24,405
I don't know why you go out.

329
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:26,845
I was worried about you
so I followed you today.

330
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,405
Don't worry, I'm fine.

331
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:29,845
Really?

332
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:34,325
So all this time,
you've been working here?

333
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:38,405
Actually, I came to Ming De College
on a scholarship.

334
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:40,725
It only covers my tuition and other fees.

335
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:42,925
So I have to earn money
to pay for everything else.

336
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:43,965
I see.

337
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:46,245
Fangfang, you should have told me--

338
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,405
Are you enjoying your chat?

339
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:49,765
You didn't even hear
the customer calling you.

340
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:54,885
I paid you to work,
not to have some kind of free party.

341
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,125
I'll deduct your pay.

342
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:59,245
Ma'am, you've deducted
almost all of my pay this month.

343
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:00,725
There won't be anything left for me.

344
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:06,205
Then go bring out the coffee right now,
or I won't pay you a penny.

345
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,485
Okay, I'll go.

346
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:10,805
Qingqing, I have to go back to work.

347
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:11,925
You can take a rest here.

348
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:14,005
Fangfang, don't work here anymore.

349
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:15,285
Let's make money together.

350
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,205
Making money is not that easy.

351
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:22,805
Trust me, with my brain,
making money is as easy as that.

352
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:24,925
Fangfang, don't hesitate.

353
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:28,725
You go in right now and say goodbye
to that vicious woman.

354
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:30,445
Tell her, "I quit!"

355
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:34,725
Fangfang, hurry up and go.

356
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:35,965
Go.

357
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:36,925
You can do it.

358
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:48,285
Gu Nanxi.

359
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:50,885
Don't act like you are so perfect.

360
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:53,325
You are only an illegitimate child.

361
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:54,925
You have no inheritance right.

362
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:58,325
Don't get me wrong. I didn't mean that.

363
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:02,925
As a member of the Gu family,
I just want to do my duty.

364
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:06,845
You and your mom should lay low.

365
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:11,565
I can kick you and your mom out
anytime I want.

366
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,245
Goodness.

367
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,725
Darling, here you are.

368
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,405
I've been looking for you everywhere.

369
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:20,765
Chen Qingqing.

370
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:22,525
Why are you here?

371
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:23,605
Me?

372
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:25,685
I came to look for you, obviously.

373
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,725
Hey, who is this?

374
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:31,925
He is my cousin, Gu Donglin.

375
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:34,165
Your cousin? I see.

376
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:36,325
Donglin.

377
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:41,485
I really want to thank you
for taking care of my Nanxi.

378
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,805
There's not much coffee left in your cup.

379
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:45,965
Let me fill it up for you.

380
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:52,045
I'm sorry.

381
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,765
I'm so sorry, Donglin.

382
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:56,365
You see, I normally don't do
things like this.

383
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:57,405
But it doesn't matter.

384
00:24:57,485 --> 00:25:00,365
I don't think you wanted
to drink it anyway.

385
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:03,165
You don't get to decide what I want.

386
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,525
Listen, Gu Nanxi.

387
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:08,325
I'm leaving now.
I'll talk to you next time.

388
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:10,245
Bye, Donglin.

389
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,085
Sorry, Gu Nanxi.

390
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:19,085
I happened to hear you two talk
from over there.

391
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:20,645
I couldn't stand him, so I came here.

392
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,365
I hope you could keep it a secret
from others.

393
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:30,325
If you need help in the future,
you can come to me.

394
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,405
I will do whatever I can.

395
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,085
You can help me now.

396
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:36,365
I want to join the Student Council.

397
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,565
-You want to join the Student Council?
-Yes.

398
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,005
But recruitment is already over.

399
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:46,725
I think there must be
something you can do.

400
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:48,125
Mr. Gu.

401
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:49,565
All right.

402
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:50,885
Let me ask you a question first.

403
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:53,285
Why do you want to join
the Student Council?

404
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:54,645
Because...

405
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:58,765
Because I'm looking for another way

406
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,045
to learn new things,

407
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,165
to train myself,

408
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:03,125
to make myself more serious

409
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:06,925
and more dedicated to my studies
so that I could be a useful member

410
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:08,925
of the society.

411
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,165
In that case,

412
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:13,805
I'll talk to the head of the departments.

413
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,165
I'm leaving now.

414
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:18,045
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

415
00:26:18,685 --> 00:26:19,605
See you at school.

416
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:20,765
See you, Mr. Gu.

417
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,205
Bye, Mr. Gu.

418
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:29,965
Qingqing.

419
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:31,965
-Fangfang.
-Wasn't that Gu Nanxi?

420
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:33,445
Yes.

421
00:26:33,645 --> 00:26:34,685
What did he say to you?

422
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:36,205
Nothing much.

423
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:38,565
I told him that I wanted to join
the Student Council.

424
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:40,725
-You want to join the Student Council?
-Yes.

425
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:42,125
Don't worry about that, Fangfang.

426
00:26:42,205 --> 00:26:46,365
We should start our money-making
plan right now.

427
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:48,085
What are we going to do?

428
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,285
Well...

429
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:54,765
You will find out tomorrow.

430
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:08,805
Today is the first day of business
for Qingqing's Errands Service.

431
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:10,565
This is for you.

432
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:12,245
Chen Qingqing.

433
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:13,645
Just give it up already.

434
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:14,725
SEAT FOR RENT - HIS HIGHNESS

435
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,365
Don't you have enough money already?

436
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:19,125
Your errands service
should stop right now!

437
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,565
Why are you doing this?

438
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:23,285
Once you signed up to be my assistant,
if you breach the contract,

439
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:26,365
you'll need to compensate me more
than that painting is going to cost you.

440
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,845
Hey, you spilled the water!

441
00:27:27,925 --> 00:27:29,365
Do you want me to push you into the pool?

442
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:31,005
You can joke about anything else,
but this.

443
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:32,045
Situ Feng, you...

444
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:35,085
Help!

445
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:38,005
