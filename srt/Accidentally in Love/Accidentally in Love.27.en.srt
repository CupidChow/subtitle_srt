A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,525
EPISODE 27

3
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,565
Hello, dear audience.

4
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:04,685
Welcome to Situ Feng's
global press conference

5
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:06,485
for his upcoming new album.

6
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:09,604
Let's now give a warm welcome
to His Highness.

7
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:10,764
Welcome.

8
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:17,565
-His Highness.
-His Highness.

9
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:20,045
-His Highness.
-His Highness.

10
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,405
SITU FENG'S 2018 NEW ALBUM
BREAK THROUGH PRESS CONFERENCE

11
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:23,405
Thank you, everyone.

12
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:26,285
All right. Situ Feng is here today

13
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:27,885
to give us the details

14
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,125
of his newest album Break Through.

15
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:32,165
I would like to ask Your Highness.

16
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:34,565
What kind of journey did you go through

17
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:36,245
during the making of this album?

18
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:39,645
All right.

19
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:43,205
The name of the album is Break Through.

20
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:46,245
As its name implies, Break Through means
to overcome an obstacle.

21
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:47,965
When I was producing this album,

22
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,605
I wanted to make a breakthrough

23
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:53,685
in both the genres and interpretations
of the songs.

24
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,165
When I was writing the songs...

25
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:59,885
Why does His Highness
look so haggard today?

26
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:00,965
I thought so too.

27
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:03,605
-I think he's wearing a lot of makeup.
-I also continued to...

28
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,525
His voice is also a bit hoarse.

29
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,045
He's perhaps exhausted
from promoting his new album.

30
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:11,805
Making music is hard work nowadays.

31
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:14,925
-I hope that he'd be all right.
-There are also elements in the palace.

32
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,685
As we all know, the cover of this album

33
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,405
is a collaboration between Situ Feng

34
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:25,805
and his number one fan, Chen Qingqing,
who's also known as Hebiancao.

35
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,565
The design of the cover

36
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,165
the lyrics page

37
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,885
and also this handshake voucher

38
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:35,005
are all very original and unique.

39
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:39,365
That's right.

40
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:43,125
We've made a bold attempt on this album.

41
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:47,605
Every album comes
with an exclusive handshake voucher.

42
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:50,205
With this voucher, you'll be able
to attend my meet-and-greet

43
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,805
and shake my hand for five seconds.

44
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:55,445
Not only does it sound
like a great deal to me,

45
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,445
but at the same time,

46
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,325
it's also quite an original idea.

47
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,845
I would like to ask Your Highness.

48
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:04,485
What was it like collaborating
with Chen Qingqing?

49
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:11,085
I...

50
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,325
Chen Qingqing and I...

51
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:19,445
-Come here.
-Xinya...

52
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:20,404
I'll get going now.

53
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,045
You can't do this to them.

54
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,645
-Be my girlfriend.
-Take care of me forever.

55
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,404
-I'll miss you.
-I'm so happy.

56
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:29,205
EXCLUSIVE HANDSHAKE WITH HIS HIGHNESS

57
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:30,925
What's going on?

58
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,005
His Highness looks strange.

59
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,805
Holy Mary Mother of God,
please protect His Highness.

60
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:39,285
SITU FENG'S 2018 NEW ALBUM
BREAK THROUGH PRESS CONFERENCE

61
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,005
I had a great time...

62
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:52,645
working with her.

63
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,165
All right, everyone.

64
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:58,645
This is the end
of today's press conference.

65
00:04:58,725 --> 00:04:59,925
Thank you for coming.

66
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:02,405
And please show your support

67
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:04,965
for Situ Feng's newest album.

68
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,485
Thank you, everyone.

69
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:12,525
Ms. Lan, which gown do you like?

70
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,845
I like a couple of them.

71
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:17,165
But I feel that they all lack something.

72
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,405
I will try this one and that one.

73
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,285
And that one. Please help me to try it on.

74
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,805
Sure, right away.

75
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:32,525
Lanting, why don't I postpone
the wedding for a few days?

76
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,045
So I'll have time to design my gown.

77
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,045
Silly. Don't you understand?

78
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,085
Chen Qingqing will be back
after Situ Feng finishes his work.

79
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:41,565
Will he choose you then?

80
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:42,805
It will be hard to say.

81
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:47,205
You should tie the knot
as soon as possible.

82
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,285
Pick your wedding gown.

83
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:51,125
You'll hold an engagement ceremony
in a few days.

84
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,885
Once you're engaged,

85
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:55,365
no matter what Chen Qingqing does,

86
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,805
Situ Feng won't be able to back out.

87
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:02,405
By that time,
Situ Feng will be yours forever.

88
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:07,405
Baby, what are you doing here?

89
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:08,445
Hua Munian?

90
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:10,525
Why are you here?

91
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,725
I'm here to ask some brands
for sponsorships.

92
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:14,765
We're destined to meet.

93
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:18,805
-That's right.
-It seems that you're in a good mood.

94
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:20,765
Why are you checking out wedding gowns?

95
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,165
I'm going to--

96
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,285
I'm in a good mood.

97
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:26,525
I can shop whatever I want.

98
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:27,965
I'll leave you two alone.

99
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:33,685
You're doing the right thing.

100
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:35,565
Take the long view.

101
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,685
Don't give up on everything else
for one Situ Feng.

102
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:42,245
Don't do anything silly again.

103
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:43,165
Let's go.

104
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,645
I'm also in a good mood.
Let's shop together. It's my treat.

105
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:47,445
I'm busy now.

106
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:48,725
I can't accompany you.

107
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:50,565
Why are you busy?

108
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:53,165
Why do I need to tell you?

109
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:55,565
Tell me.

110
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,005
Miss, the gowns
that you've chosen are ready now.

111
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,565
You can try them on anytime you want.

112
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:02,165
Is he your fiancé?

113
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:03,605
You two look great together.

114
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:04,925
Of course not.

115
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:07,645
Fiancé?

116
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:08,805
What's going on?

117
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:10,485
I'll tell you.

118
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:13,245
Feng and I are going to get engaged.

119
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:16,085
We'll be holding
the engagement ceremony in a few days.

120
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,725
Since you've found out,

121
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:21,965
you're invited.

122
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,405
ENGAGEMENT PARTY: SITU FENG, LAN XINYA

123
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,885
What?

124
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:28,885
Isn't Chen Qingqing
the one who Situ Feng likes?

125
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:32,165
It was just a fling.

126
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:33,325
He has agreed to marry me.

127
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,205
This proves that he's been in love
with me all along.

128
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:36,725
Lan Xinya, are you insane?

129
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,285
I want to go home now.

130
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,405
Lanting, let's go.

131
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:49,125
Please stop provoking her, all right?

132
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:11,365
Hello, Qingqing.

133
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:12,565
Hello, Gu Nanxi.

134
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:14,765
Do you know where Situ Feng is?

135
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:18,045
I called him several times.
But he didn't pick up my calls.

136
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:19,645
He...

137
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,445
I'm not sure.

138
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,085
He probably didn't bring
his phone with him.

139
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,685
Can you look for him for me?

140
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:28,365
I'm worried about him.

141
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:29,685
Don't worry.

142
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:31,285
I will go look for him now.

143
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:33,205
Thank you.

144
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,405
Feng.

145
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:01,245
You look so handsome.

146
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:03,445
Don't you think
that we look great together

147
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:04,725
when we stand side by side?

148
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,285
You two have great taste.

149
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,965
This wedding gown suits you well.
You two are perfect for each other.

150
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,005
Of course.

151
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:14,365
But I prefer the other one.

152
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,005
Feng, give me a second.

153
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:19,405
-I'll go and try that one again.
-Okay.

154
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:26,005
-Hello?
-Hello?

155
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:28,285
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:31,725
You don't have to apologize.

157
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,645
I overreacted last time.

158
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:39,085
I should be the one apologizing to you.

159
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,165
No.

160
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:42,765
I've already made up my mind.

161
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:45,645
And this decision

162
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,805
might hurt you.

163
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,165
That's why I said

164
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:55,725
sorry.

165
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,645
What decision have you made?

166
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:00,085
I...

167
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:06,085
I can't put Xinya in danger again.

168
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,485
We're going to get engaged.

169
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:11,965
It's over...

170
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,165
Between us.

171
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:26,085
-Situ Feng.
-I'm sorry.

172
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:27,805
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:29,485
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,165
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:36,405
Stop apologizing to me.

176
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,285
If you keep apologizing,

177
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:42,965
it means...

178
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,445
It means that you're not mature enough.

179
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:54,605
You've made your decision,

180
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,845
so...

181
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:00,485
So you should be responsible

182
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:03,445
for the one you love.

183
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:08,125
Qingqing.

184
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:11,765
I don't know what to say anymore.

185
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,845
Just say goodbye then.

186
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:22,205
Usually,

187
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,925
that's how people end a phone call.

188
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,245
Isn't it?

189
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:32,685
Goodbye.

190
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:36,725
Goodbye.

191
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:54,645
Xinya, I'm here. Where are you?

192
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:56,685
See you later.

193
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,845
Feng, are you all right?

194
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,485
You should get some rest.

195
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,085
Otherwise, you won't look great
on the day of the ceremony.

196
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,525
Nanxi, you're here.

197
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:27,565
Xinya.

198
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,765
I need to go back to school
to get something.

199
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:32,725
I'll wear this suit.

200
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:34,925
I'll ask the driver to take you home.

201
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:36,645
Okay.

202
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,485
Nanxi, why don't you
accompany Feng to school?

203
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:42,405
Sure.

204
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:45,845
That's not necessary.

205
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:12,765
Excuse me, please help me.

206
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:14,925
Let me use you. Thanks.

207
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,125
The young master went that way!

208
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:23,445
I need to use you!

209
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:32,085
Do you know that it was my...

210
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,765
Hey, why are you bringing me here?

211
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,805
To play basketball?

212
00:14:58,045 --> 00:14:59,205
You could do it like that?

213
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,805
Get out of my way!

214
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:27,245
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

215
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:29,405
Can I say what I like about you?

216
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:31,845
You don't have secrets.

217
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:33,125
You...

218
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:36,205
Are you saying that you like me?

219
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,405
-Situ Feng, put me down!
-Look.

220
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:46,165
We found this kitten together.

221
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,325
We're the mom and dad.

222
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:49,765
I'm the dad. You're the mom.

223
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:51,125
Of course it'll take my surname.

224
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:53,005
Am I right, Kitty Chen?

225
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,485
That's right.

226
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:56,845
-Hey.
-Yes?

227
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:58,285
Why are you the dad?

228
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,085
Because I'm domineering.

229
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,485
I can't believe such a place
exists in our school.

230
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:24,805
Is it for me?

231
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:25,885
Yes.

232
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:28,565
Thank you.

233
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:30,085
What is it called?

234
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:31,725
Its name is the same as yours.

235
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:32,965
It's called Qingqing.

236
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:36,245
It's called Qingqing too?

237
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:14,405
Grandpa, why did you come downstairs?

238
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,045
Qingqing.

239
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,964
This is the first time I'm feeling scared.

240
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:22,685
Grandpa.

241
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:24,364
Don't worry.

242
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:29,324
I've already decided
to stay and manage our family business.

243
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:33,245
This is not what I'm afraid of.

244
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:37,405
I tried to raise you

245
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:38,925
to be a replica of me.

246
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:40,965
But you ran away.

247
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:44,005
You started to live independently.

248
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:48,005
You've lived your own life.

249
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,805
I've finally realized

250
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:54,245
that I was wrong.

251
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,645
I shouldn't have imposed

252
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,365
my dreams on you.

253
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:02,885
But Grandpa,

254
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:05,245
right now,

255
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:08,605
I don't have a good excuse

256
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:10,765
to run away again.

257
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,925
A good excuse?

258
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:17,205
It's probably the most boring excuse

259
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:19,685
that people use when making a decision.

260
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,765
After all these years,

261
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:28,205
if I could go back in time
and deal with your mom again,

262
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:31,765
guess what I would do?

263
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:34,125
I think

264
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:37,005
that you would try everything you could

265
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,085
to stop her from leaving.

266
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:41,565
That way,

267
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,565
Mom would have avoided the accident.

268
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:46,525
No.

269
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:48,725
I would encourage her,

270
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:50,605
trust her

271
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:53,885
and be proud of her

272
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:56,725
for being courageous.

273
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:05,965
God

274
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:08,845
has finally given me

275
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,765
a second chance.

276
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,205
Hey, breaking news!

277
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:31,445
Look, she's asking all the fans

278
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,925
to do this.

279
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,605
What? This is insane.

280
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:38,045
That's impossible.

281
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:42,165
If we join hands,
there's nothing impossible in the world.

282
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:44,325
Although we only have three days,

283
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,925
we must not fail this mission.
We shall only succeed.

284
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:48,245
-Roger that.
-That's right.

285
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:49,725
There's no way I'm going to miss out

286
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,325
on such an important moment.

287
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,445
His Highness' business is my business.

288
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,445
Use my credit cards.

289
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:57,525
Let's get to work.

290
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:09,445
Miss.

291
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:12,565
You've maxed out all your cards.

292
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,285
No way.

293
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,565
Are you sure that there's nothing wrong
with your laptop?

294
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:20,485
Come on.

295
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:24,525
How could this happen
at this life or death moment?

296
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:26,525
I need to think of another way.

297
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,645
How can I get more money?

298
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:33,885
Miss, didn't you mention something

299
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,205
about borrowing money from some card?

300
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:38,605
That's right. Gosh.

301
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,485
How could I forget about it?

302
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:43,165
I can use the 9Fbank application.

303
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:45,805
I've just wired 150,000 yuan. Try again.

304
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:46,965
-Hurry up.
-Over here.

305
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:52,405
It's working.

306
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,325
We're gathered here today

307
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,445
in the sight of God

308
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,565
to witness the engagement of Mr. Situ Feng

309
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:52,085
and Miss Lan Xinya.

310
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:54,965
Do you, Miss Lan Xinya, take this man,

311
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:56,845
Mr. Situ Feng, to be your fiancé?

312
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:00,605
I do.

313
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,285
Do you, Mr. Situ Feng, take this woman,

314
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,165
Miss Lan Xinya, to be your fiancée?

315
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,685
Mr. Situ Feng, do you?

316
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:13,565
I...

317
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,405
I object!

318
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:25,645
Chen Qingqing?

319
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,325
What is she doing here?

320
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:37,965
Chen Qingqing.

321
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,565
How dare you interrupt
my engagement ceremony?

322
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:41,765
Who do you think you are?

323
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:45,845
I came here today
to officially introduce myself.

324
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:47,885
Nice to meet you.

325
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:49,965
My name is Chen Qingqing.

326
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:51,845
I am

327
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:54,285
your "fiancée."

328
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:57,765
I'm your classmate.

329
00:22:58,325 --> 00:22:59,445
I'm your assistant.

330
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:01,765
I'm the female lead in your music video.

331
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:04,245
I'm also your business partner.

332
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,325
And you...

333
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:09,605
You're mine.

334
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:12,925
What is he to you?

335
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:15,885
Why didn't you finish your sentence?

336
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,365
I'm done talking.

337
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:18,765
You're a psychopath.

338
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:21,645
Qingqing.

339
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:24,125
Saying sorry to you is useless,

340
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:28,125
-but I--
-You don't have to say anything.

341
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:30,005
I didn't come here

342
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,605
to kidnap the groom.

343
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:34,005
There's one thing that I need to do.

344
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:35,285
I will leave afterwards.

345
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:41,765
This is the handshake voucher
from your new album.

346
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:44,485
I designed this voucher.

347
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:45,805
It says that

348
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,485
I can shake your hand for five seconds

349
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,605
with this voucher.

350
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:52,725
Nice to meet you,

351
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:54,405
Situ Feng.

352
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:57,405
Chen Qingqing, don't change the topic.

353
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,605
How could you take this voucher seriously?

354
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,125
Five seconds have passed.

355
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:19,245
Let go of his hand!

356
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,525
I don't only have one voucher.

357
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:22,685
I've got two, three

358
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,165
and many more.

359
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,845
Let him go!

360
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,365
Situ Feng.

361
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:01,725
You must keep your word.

362
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:06,765
Chen Qingqing.

363
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,965
I won't let go of you this time.

364
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,685
Xinya.

365
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:18,805
I'm sorry.

366
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:20,965
The person I love

367
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:23,245
is Chen Qingqing.

368
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:26,725
I can't keep lying to myself,

369
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:30,725
to you and to everyone else.

370
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:35,685
This ceremony

371
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:38,045
is called off.

372
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,285
Feng!

373
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:47,925
Feng!

374
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:52,365
Feng!

375
00:25:56,165 --> 00:25:57,685
Feng!

376
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:22,765
You have to fight for what you truly want.

377
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:27,285
Release Chen Qingqing's information
to the paparazzi.

378
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:29,085
Hey!

379
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:31,165
Hey, what are you doing?

380
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:33,525
Isn't this Zhang Fangfang?

381
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:36,405
I heard that you're dating Lin Yiyang.

382
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:37,685
You're a pervert.

383
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:40,205
Lin Yiyang is dating you just for fun.

384
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:44,565
Have we all just become lovesick?

385
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,885
His Highness has a girlfriend.

386
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:49,565
Do you know how much money I spent
to settle this matter?

387
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:52,765
