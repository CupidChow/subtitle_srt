00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:35,765
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:58,765
EPISODE 21

3
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:19,285
Hebiancao,did you see the latest news
about His Highness?

4
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:20,885
-I just saw it.
-Oh, my God.

5
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:23,445
How unlucky. How did it happen?

6
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:26,925
I MIGHT STOP SUPPORTING HIM.
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE DID STEAL THE SONG.

7
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:29,645
Calm down, let's see
what his agency has to say.

8
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,765
Please believe in His Highness.

9
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:36,605
IDOL SINGER ACCUSED OF PLAGIARISM.
VIDEO LEAKED.

10
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,445
The time this video was taken

11
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:44,485
seems to be two days
after Situ Feng sang this song for me

12
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,645
so he couldn't have copied the song.

13
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,645
Who's behind all this?

14
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:49,965
A competitor?

15
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,485
Or...

16
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:54,605
Hebiancao, what do you think?
Will you stop supporting him?

17
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,365
It's a set up.

18
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:58,525
My close friend told me

19
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:00,565
she personally heard His Highness
sang this song before.

20
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,565
Even before the video was uploaded.

21
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:03,605
Really?

22
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:05,245
Absolutely.

23
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,725
Something fishy is going on here.

24
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,365
FAN E: LATEST NEWS FLASH

25
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:10,685
PLAGIARIZED SINGER IS A FORMER INTERN
OF SITU FENG'S AGENCY

26
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:12,205
FAN F: SO DRAMATIC, WHO COPIED WHO?

27
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:14,005
COULD THE EX TRAINEE BE
SITU FENG'S GHOST WRITER?

28
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:17,365
Hebiancao,should we investigate?

29
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:22,605
That's for sure!

30
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,965
Don't worry, let's support His Highness
together.

31
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:34,005
Wounds are smoothened by memories

32
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,685
Thank you for being here--

33
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,325
This is absurd.

34
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:40,125
There's no way to prevent a thief
who lives under your roof.

35
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:44,485
Mei, check the surveillance camera
to see if Zhou Zhi

36
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,285
has stolen this song demo
from our company.

37
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:47,405
Okay.

38
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:54,005
Daniel, those comments by netizens
don't bother me.

39
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,365
People who trust me will have faith in me.

40
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:59,845
But will this issue affect
my latest album's release?

41
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,285
Don't be so naive.

42
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:04,205
The agency produces albums for profit.

43
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,885
With such a bad reputation,
who would purchase your album?

44
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,605
Yet you're thinking...

45
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:11,365
What makes you think
we can release this album now?

46
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:13,885
Right, you have that commercial event
this afternoon.

47
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:14,845
Remember to attend it.

48
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,325
-Commercial event?
-Yes.

49
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:19,964
It's 15 yuan.

50
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:21,605
Glow sticks, anyone? For 15 yuan.

51
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,725
Miss, do you want to buy a glow stick?

52
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,565
There will be performances
by singers inside.

53
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:28,165
Sir,

54
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,485
-do you have Situ Feng's glow sticks?
-Situ Feng?

55
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:32,805
Wasn't he accused of plagiarism?

56
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:34,845
I didn't think he would still come today.

57
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:36,605
I don't have his glow sticks.

58
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:39,245
All right, I'll look around then.

59
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,805
There's no need to.

60
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:43,045
I'm the only stall here
selling glow sticks.

61
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,325
Just pick one.

62
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:47,525
Okay, sir.

63
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:48,645
I will take these two.

64
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:51,845
Thank you, everyone
for coming to our event today.

65
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,845
Let's now welcome

66
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,645
-the idol singer, Situ Feng.
-Excuse me.

67
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:57,885
-perform an opening song for us.
-Excuse me, thanks.

68
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,685
I heard he was accused of plagiarism.

69
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,285
Excuse me.

70
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:28,525
Nights

71
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:31,765
-City lights
-Thank you.

72
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:34,205
-People come and go
-Excuse me.

73
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:37,365
Like thousands of shining stars

74
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,725
-Excuse me.
-Stars

75
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,125
Come and go

76
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:45,085
The future is a puzzle

77
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,765
The glare makes it hard to see

78
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,285
Situ Feng!

79
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:54,165
Day and night alternates
Time fleets like a white horse

80
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:57,925
-I stay there holding onto memories
-We shall remember

81
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:01,005
Those times

82
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:05,405
Separated from dawn by the sea

83
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:08,525
-Leave and say goodbye to the past
-Farewell

84
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:12,605
For all wrongdoings

85
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:18,485
You sail through endless years

86
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,005
Time is like the surface of the sea

87
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:24,165
It reflects 1,001 nights

88
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:29,245
Those unchanged has changed

89
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:32,805
The fallen leaves after the run

90
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:35,445
The wind carries them to someone else

91
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:40,885
-And they carry him forward
-Situ Feng!

92
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:44,005
Hope is standing on the edge

93
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:46,805
It lights up day and night

94
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:52,085
It shines within my sight

95
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:55,125
When I get to the end of the story

96
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,965
I understand how fate has been right

97
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:01,565
-It's all about staying by your side
-Situ Feng!

98
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:04,845
We will support you!

99
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:05,845
FENG

100
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:10,245
-Go away.
-Get lost.

101
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:11,445
For God's sake.

102
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:12,805
Go away.

103
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,725
You did well.

104
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:22,245
Right, the person who was holding
that interesting banner

105
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,805
might be a new supporter.

106
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:31,725
Dad, I'm home.

107
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:34,605
Hang on.

108
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:41,245
You're always
causing unnecessary troubles,

109
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:43,485
damaging our family's reputation.

110
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:45,445
What kind of agency are you with?

111
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,405
Did they find you an investigator
or a lawyer?

112
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,045
Dad.

113
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,045
Don't worry.

114
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,965
I can solve it myself.

115
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:01,405
That's good.

116
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:03,205
If there's nothing else,

117
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,445
I'm going up to rest now.

118
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,845
You should too.

119
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:23,165
CHEN QINGQING

120
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:25,325
Come in.

121
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:27,165
Situ Feng.

122
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,245
Gu Nanxi, why are you here?

123
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:30,965
I brought someone here with me.

124
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,405
Is it Chen Qingqing?

125
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,605
Feng.

126
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:35,645
It's me.

127
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:37,564
Xinya?

128
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,284
Why are you here?

129
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:42,485
I brought your favorite snacks.

130
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:45,804
Thanks.

131
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:46,765
Feng.

132
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,725
Don't worry about what the media
wrote about you.

133
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:50,085
They are all nonsense.

134
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:52,685
Who do they think they are,
writing those comments?

135
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,085
It's full of rubbish.

136
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:57,525
So, is it true that the other singer
used to be from your agency?

137
00:08:58,645 --> 00:08:59,525
Yes,

138
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:01,885
but he left after his contract
was terminated.

139
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:05,205
He could be holding on to grudges
and did this on purpose.

140
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:09,685
Has your agency found any evidence
against him yet?

141
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,525
Not at the moment.

142
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,685
Don't be too worried.

143
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,445
The situation will eventually get better.

144
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:21,605
Who knows for sure?

145
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,805
My latest album
is now stuck without progress.

146
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:28,525
That could be a problem.

147
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:49,405
Hebiancao, are you there?

148
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:51,485
I think we found something.

149
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:54,205
I am here. What did you find?

150
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:56,725
We were researching online
for the entire day today

151
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,325
and found something worth looking into.

152
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,765
We found the first negative commenter.

153
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,005
This person seems odd.

154
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,805
Under all of Situ Feng's songs,

155
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:04,885
he left a similar comment

156
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:06,525
accusing His Highness of plagiarism.

157
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:08,085
He works like a bot!

158
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,485
Anyone found his IP address?

159
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:14,205
I did and it gets more interesting here.

160
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:16,165
Lei tried to locate this IP address.

161
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:19,285
It seems to come from an internet cafe
near Ming De College.

162
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,645
That's good, I am just around the corner.

163
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:23,845
I will have a look tomorrow.

164
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:25,125
Will update you guys then.

165
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:27,965
All right! We'll keep looking too
for His Highness, keep it up!

166
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:37,285
Can you respond to Situ Feng's
plagiarism claims?

167
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:38,685
As Situ Feng's manager,

168
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:42,285
I will bet my entire career that
he never plagiarized anyone's songs

169
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,445
this case is obviously a set up.

170
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:46,565
We're still investigating the matter.

171
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:50,045
A press conference will be held
three days later for more clarity.

172
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,845
Of course, we'd like to show everyone
how talented Situ Feng really is.

173
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:55,365
His new song will be

174
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:57,565
officially released in three days as well.

175
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:00,165
This latest song will be heavily promoted.

176
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,885
How was it? I did well, didn't I?

177
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:04,805
Three days?

178
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:06,805
A brand new song?

179
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:09,005
Daniel, did I give you my permission?

180
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,005
Gosh.

181
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,405
The agency has been urging me
and the media is pestering me.

182
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:13,405
What can I do?

183
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:14,805
I'm running out of ideas too!

184
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,205
Gu Nanxi, it's me.

185
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:27,645
I just found some clues
to Situ Feng's case.

186
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,845
It lies in the internet cafe
near our college.

187
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,845
Can you come with me?

188
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,245
Okay, see you later. Bye.

189
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,965
-Hello?
-Hey.

190
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:06,765
What a beautiful day. It's almost over.

191
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:09,325
Have you written your new song yet?

192
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:12,605
I have no inspirations at all

193
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,485
I can't come up with anything.

194
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,805
What? Nothing yet?

195
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,805
I promised the entire world yesterday

196
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:21,965
with such confidence

197
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,285
that we'd release a new song
in three days.

198
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:27,245
But this is how it is.

199
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:29,405
I have no inspirations at all.

200
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:31,205
Could it be you're being too picky?

201
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,965
Why don't you take reference
from your old music pieces,

202
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,205
edit them a little.

203
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,725
Nobody has heard them before anyway.

204
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:39,645
They can't be used at all, all right?

205
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:42,965
Plus, if I don't like the songs,

206
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,605
my fans will not like them too.

207
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:47,725
Okay, it's my fault
for being superficial, all right?

208
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:49,765
We have two more days left.

209
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,765
You should concentrate on the new song.

210
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:53,125
Leave the rest to me.

211
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,565
Don't stress yourself over it, okay?

212
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,445
Okay, I'm hanging up.

213
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:17,245
-Police.
-Police.

214
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:22,565
We suspect a bank robber
has entered your internet cafe.

215
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:23,805
He's running away from us.

216
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,165
No.

217
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:28,245
A bank robber?
No one here would do such a thing.

218
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:29,245
Calm down.

219
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,805
We're just trying to find out

220
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:33,245
who was here on the night
of the 12th of last month.

221
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,845
Wait a second.

222
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:36,765
Here it is.

223
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:39,685
Sir, ma'am, look.

224
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:42,125
This is the list of customers
for last month.

225
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,045
Everything should be there.

226
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,085
-What?
-No!

227
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:45,885
I confirm that everything is there.

228
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,005
-Zhao Dalei.
-Sir.

229
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:54,325
Everything went well.

230
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:56,965
Situ Feng is done this time.

231
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,885
Our boss is really too smart.

232
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:03,085
I bet Situ Feng will not be able
to create a new song in three days.

233
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:04,605
No.

234
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:07,045
Now, there are only two days left.

235
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,845
Even if he did,
the quality is going to suck.

236
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:11,845
We can carry on talking bad about him.

237
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:14,645
Dalei, you're getting smarter these days.

238
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:16,165
That's because I learn from the best.

239
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,365
Lin Yiyang.

240
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:19,965
I knew you were the one who did it.

241
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:22,125
Qingqing, don't act rashly.

242
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:24,845
Lin Yiyang, why did you do it?

243
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:26,805
What are you two talking about?

244
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:28,805
Why doesn't it make sense to me?

245
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:30,325
Stop pretending, Zhao Dalei.

246
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:31,965
We've already found out

247
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,725
you were the one
who started those comments.

248
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:34,925
Really?

249
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:36,885
So what?

250
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,005
It's true that Situ Feng
plagiarized the song.

251
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,685
We're just stating the fact.

252
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:42,645
Is that true?

253
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,925
Coming from someone like you who doesn't
even read the entertainment news,

254
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:48,725
how could you have known?

255
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:53,205
You guys must have been the ones
who gave Zhou Zhi that music sheet

256
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:55,205
then instructed him
to use that stolen piece

257
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,805
to create a similar song
then uploaded it online in advance

258
00:14:57,885 --> 00:14:59,725
to accuse Situ Feng of plagiarism.

259
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:07,445
What a wonderful analysis.

260
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:10,005
I almost thought you were Detective Conan.

261
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:14,965
But even if you were right,
do you have any evidence

262
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,845
to prove it was us
who took the music sheet?

263
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:22,765
If you've got no evidence,
hurry up and go back home.

264
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:25,365
No evidence, no talk.

265
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:26,725
Lin Yiyang.

266
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,885
Do you have any idea
how upsetting this could be for Situ Feng?

267
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:33,005
We all grew up together.

268
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:34,965
Let me be clear.

269
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:38,085
Ever since that incident happened,
we're no longer brothers nor friends.

270
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:40,285
I'm going to do everything
to make him miserable.

271
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,965
Stop me if you can.

272
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,765
Stop it, Lin Yiyang!

273
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,045
Are you okay?

274
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,565
I'm fine. Let's go.

275
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,205
Listen up, Lin Yiyang.

276
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:50,645
I will find the evidence!

277
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:58,205
-What? Lin Yiyang did it?
-Yes.

278
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:01,365
I got it. I will hire more people
and get to the bottom of this.

279
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:02,485
By the way, Daniel.

280
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,525
How is Situ Feng doing?

281
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,685
He's not doing well.

282
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,285
How come?

283
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:12,805
I'm not sure.

284
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:16,005
But given his talents,
I'm sure he will come up with something.

285
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:17,525
Let's leave it here.

286
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,445
Once I have more information
about Lin Yiyang,

287
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:20,685
I will contact you.

288
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:27,045
-Mei.
-Yes?

289
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,765
Get me the profiles of employees
with high turnover probabilities.

290
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,925
We need to search for them
in the surveillance videos.

291
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,565
Before our press conference,

292
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,045
I have to find that person
who took the music sheet.

293
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:39,725
-Now.
-I'll be on it right away.

294
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:47,605
Why are we here?

295
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:51,205
This is where Zhou Zhi lives.
I'm going to see him.

296
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:52,325
Don't be foolish.

297
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,685
We have no evidence to confront him.

298
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,685
Do you want to help out or not?
If you're not, you can leave now.

299
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:01,405
Leave? Hey, wait for me.

300
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,645
Are you Zhou Zhi?

301
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:09,805
Who are you?

302
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:12,964
Let's be frank, were you the one
who set Feng up?

303
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:14,844
Have you not figured out the situation?

304
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:17,084
He was the one who copied me.

305
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:18,444
Stop spouting nonsense.

306
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:19,724
Still trying to pretend?

307
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,565
Was it because of money?

308
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:26,925
Here's my card.

309
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:30,045
You can take it,

310
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:32,245
but you'll have
to tell everyone the truth.

311
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:33,605
Xinya, don't do this.

312
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:38,045
Did Situ Feng send the two of you
to bribe me?

313
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:39,525
No.

314
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:40,925
We didn't mean to do that.

315
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,685
So what if it's a bribe?

316
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:44,925
Why? Is this not enough for you?

317
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,485
I didn't expect Situ Feng to be
this kind of person.

318
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:50,765
Manipulating people to get what he wants.

319
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:52,405
Don't you dare speak like that about Feng!

320
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:56,965
I've recorded

321
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,645
what you said.

322
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:00,605
Situ Feng's reputation

323
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,165
will be ruined.

324
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,325
Let's go.

325
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:12,885
I can't...

326
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:15,525
Are you okay?

327
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:17,085
I'm okay.

328
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:18,845
You?

329
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:20,285
I'm fine.

330
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,285
Thanks for what happened earlier.

331
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:25,565
Don't mention it.

332
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,565
I'm not letting anyone bully my Queen Lan.

333
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,965
But what's going to happen to Feng?

334
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,125
Come on.

335
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,485
Don't worry.

336
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:38,405
Given his talents, I'm sure he will
be able to come up with a new song.

337
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,085
I hope so.

338
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:43,605
Cheers!

339
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:52,165
Lin Yiyang.

340
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,045
How dare you?

341
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:56,565
Did you forget about
what happened at the park?

342
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,045
Qingqing told me everything.

343
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,885
Were you behind Situ Feng's case?

344
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:02,965
So what if I was?

345
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,045
Haven't I told you?

346
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,285
-I've got nothing to do with you.
-Don't get me wrong.

347
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,325
I'm not trying to get close to you.

348
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,885
I'm just telling you as a regular student.

349
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:13,845
You're not an evil person to begin with,

350
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,045
so before things get worse,

351
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,245
you should stop now.

352
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:18,245
Stop now?

353
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:22,005
Why don't you tell us
how should we stop it?

354
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:23,765
Go turn yourselves in.

355
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,325
Admit that you took the music sheet.

356
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:26,805
Be sincere about it.

357
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:32,325
Oh, my God, this is hilarious.

358
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:35,365
What's so hilarious about it?

359
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:37,805
What is in that brain of yours?

360
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,685
That was so fucking naive.
Do you hear yourself?

361
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,325
Why don't you

362
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:48,965
consider dating our boss
as one of his girlfriends?

363
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:50,245
Enough.

364
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:53,125
Let's go.

365
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:59,125
You should think
about that suggestion of mine.

366
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,365
-Good day, sir.
-Good day, sir.

367
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,365
Where's Feng?

368
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,565
Young Master has been staying
in his room for two days.

369
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,085
He hasn't eaten much.

370
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:18,965
Could it because of stress?

371
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:34,645
Dad.

372
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,725
What brought you here?

373
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:42,645
I saw the news.

374
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:44,925
What's wrong? No ideas yet?

375
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:47,685
Yes.

376
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,085
No ideas yet.

377
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:53,205
Come with me. Let's play some games.

378
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:05,525
Hey, son.

379
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,125
Is that all you've got?

380
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:09,005
Again.

381
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:15,485
Again!

382
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:28,805
Dad!

383
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:32,285
Little rascal, you're pretty good
at playing games.

384
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:43,525
It's been a while
since we played like this.

385
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:48,485
You're right, Dad.
We haven't played in a while.

386
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:50,205
You're still good at it.

387
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:56,445
You resemble your mom so much.

388
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,485
Simple but committed.

389
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,405
Once she sets a goal,

390
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,165
she will achieve it no matter the cost.

391
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:13,365
Perhaps it's time for me to give up.

392
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:15,965
This doesn't sound like you.

393
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:19,165
Tomorrow is my due date.

394
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,485
So far,

395
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:23,525
I have written nothing.

396
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,005
Have you done your best?

397
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:28,005
Have you

398
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:30,765
given all that you've got, do or die

399
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,485
to protect what you love deeply?

400
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,405
What I love deeply?

401
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:41,925
As human beings,

402
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:44,525
there are two ways to live our lives.

403
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,885
One way is to live like the grass.

404
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:51,485
Constantly being showered by the sun,

405
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:54,445
but they will never grow.

406
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:58,885
Another is to live like a tree.

407
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:03,885
As long as you're a seed,

408
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,045
you can survive anywhere with soil.

409
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,485
You'd be able to absorb nutrients
from the soil and grow.

410
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:14,045
You're talented, I won't deny that.

411
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:16,565
To become a tree,

412
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:20,085
there are going to be obstacles.

413
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:24,645
If you can pull through all hardships,
you'll become a real man.

414
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:32,485
I have faith in you

415
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,725
because you're my son.

416
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:39,565
Okay, go write your song.

417
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:43,485
Wait.

418
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:45,845
I have something for you.

419
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:46,925
Something for me?

420
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,365
You should never
let someone who likes you down.

421
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:52,205
Someone who likes me?

422
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:53,845
When I came back earlier,

423
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,525
I met a girl outside.

424
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:59,085
She was the one who created a scene
at the wedding ceremony.

425
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:07,885
Have we met before?

426
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:10,365
Hello, sir.

427
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:11,685
No.

428
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:14,565
We haven't met before.

429
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:16,365
What happened to your neck?

430
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:20,925
I might have sprained my neck
while sleeping last night.

431
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:22,445
Well, sir...

432
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:23,565
This...

433
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,805
This is for Situ Feng.

434
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:28,925
Would you pass it to him, please?
Thank you very much.

435
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:30,725
Dad.

436
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:32,525
Did you give her a hard time?

437
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,765
What are you talking about?

438
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:35,605
Am I such a petty person?

439
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:37,245
Thanks, Dad.

440
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,245
Situ Feng,

441
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:47,885
I hope you'd be able to smile
through this difficult period.

442
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:50,685
No matter what happens,
we will support you.

443
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:53,645
I drew this myself.

444
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,485
It is as rare as you can get.

445
00:25:20,245 --> 00:25:22,885
If anything goes wrong
with the press conference,

446
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,205
all of you can stop coming to work!

447
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:25,485
Where is Situ Feng?

448
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,445
I can't reach him at all.

449
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:30,325
Are you Lin Yiyang?

450
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,845
Who the hell are you?

451
00:25:34,085 --> 00:25:36,125
Ye Bei, what's wrong?

452
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:37,125
Cheers!

453
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:39,765
Let's drink to our heart's content.

454
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:43,685
-Nanxi, I--
-Right, I--

455
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,325
Be careful.

456
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:49,125
I'll call a cab for you.

457
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,925
