A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:58,565
EPISODE 3

3
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:03,525
This is the school where Dad and Mom
studied and fell in love.

4
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,325
I finally found you.

5
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:22,605
Sir.

6
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,805
-I'm getting off work.
-I came to pay the tuition fee.

7
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:33,885
Okay, let me take a photo of you.

8
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:34,805
Okay.

9
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:43,245
Sit properly.

10
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:44,925
Raise your head.

11
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,365
Don't smile.

12
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:11,125
Sir, I'd like to ask you something.

13
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:13,645
Who's the man in the portrait?

14
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,645
That is Mr. Xiao Jingnan.

15
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,205
He's an honorary alumnus
of our school.

16
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:20,405
He used to be
the president of the Student Council

17
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:22,565
and has made great contributions
to the school.

18
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:27,325
Sir, is Mr. Xiao teaching at this school?

19
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:28,245
No.

20
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:30,125
He left school after graduation.

21
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,605
Do you know where he went?

22
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:32,525
I don't know.

23
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,405
Why are you asking about this?

24
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:35,845
Nothing.

25
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:39,485
Okay, here is your student ID
and your admission information.

26
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:41,885
Classes start tomorrow.

27
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:43,805
You can go to the dormitory, unpack

28
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:46,085
and familiarize yourself with the campus.

29
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:47,445
-Okay.
-Off you go.

30
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:48,685
-Bye, sir.
-Bye.

31
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:51,485
NAME: CHEN QINGQING

32
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,125
What happened, my little devil?

33
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:02,285
What do you mean what happened?

34
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,805
When did you get a fiancée?

35
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,325
Jiujing News, Yuncheng Evening News

36
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:07,725
and all kinds of social media

37
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,885
are keeping a close eye
on your personal life.

38
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:12,485
In our contract, we said you were an idol
with positive influence.

39
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:14,725
Do you know what that means?
Is it important that you can sing?

40
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,325
-Yes.
-No.

41
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:17,845
Is it important that you can act?

42
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,925
-Yes.
-No.

43
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,204
Is it important
that you're not in a relationship?

44
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:22,485
Is it?

45
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:23,885
Yes!

46
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:27,965
You must not allow any female creature
to get ten meters near you.

47
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,845
You must be detached.

48
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:31,005
You must be lovable.

49
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,805
Your fans will have the impulse
to nurture you the moment they see you.

50
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:36,325
They will say, "Poor thing,

51
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:37,685
I must spend money on you, baby."

52
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,565
That means there can't be any rumors
about you being in a relationship.

53
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:42,485
Can you stop creating trouble,
my little devil?

54
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,805
See? Even the paparazzi is calling me.

55
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:50,005
I don't know how they are
going to blackmail us.

56
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,325
Mr. Li.

57
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:55,565
-Hello.
-Hi.

58
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,565
Yes, we haven't been in touch
for quite some time.

59
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:00,325
My line of work keeps me busy.

60
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:03,205
Many celebrities are making news recently,
even your Situ Feng.

61
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:04,685
I have received some photos here.

62
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:07,165
But I have some questions
that I want to confirm with you first

63
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,285
before I publish it.

64
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,485
No problem.

65
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:11,925
If you have any questions,
you should talk to me immediately.

66
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:12,845
Please.

67
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:13,925
Then I'll be straight.

68
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,565
In the photos,
Situ Feng is kissing a girl.

69
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:20,205
That girl is too ugly
to be Situ Feng's girlfriend or fiancée.

70
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:22,205
I just want to know
if there is an inside story.

71
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,565
Who is this girl?

72
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:25,125
Is she one of Situ Feng's crazy fans?

73
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,365
That girl is a new assistant
in our agency.

74
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:29,605
This is a misunderstanding.

75
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:32,525
-A misunderstanding.
-You're too good to your assistants.

76
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,365
How about you give me
an exclusive interview?

77
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:37,165
I want to interview your assistant.
She must really want to be famous.

78
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,125
No problem. I'll arrange it.

79
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,845
Okay, thank you.

80
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,125
Okay, bye.

81
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:52,605
This...

82
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:57,245
Situ Feng,
from which garbage dump did she come from?

83
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:00,005
I was worried about the rumors earlier.

84
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,925
Now, it seems completely unnecessary.

85
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:03,725
It's impossible for you two
to be together.

86
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:05,245
Gosh.

87
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:06,245
What a relief.

88
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,925
Well, let's get our story lined up.

89
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:10,565
Just say she's your fan.

90
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,285
What's her name?

91
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:19,125
Chen...

92
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:23,605
Chen Zuipao?

93
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:24,645
Chen Zuipao?

94
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:25,565
Is that a real name?

95
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:27,565
I can't remember.

96
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:29,565
Where is she now?

97
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:34,845
-I don't know.
-You don't know where the first person

98
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,205
you kissed on screen is?

99
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:41,765
Come in, please.

100
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:53,645
I just transferred here this semester.

101
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:54,925
My name is Chen Qingqing.

102
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:56,725
Hello, my name is Zhang Fangfang.

103
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:58,445
The superintendent
has already informed me.

104
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,965
You can call me Qingqing.

105
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,205
May I call you Fangfang?

106
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:03,165
Sure.

107
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:05,085
Nice to meet you.

108
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,325
This dormitory is great.

109
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:18,925
Qingqing.

110
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,445
Did you just bring this one bag with you?

111
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,365
Yes.

112
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:24,765
How will you go to bed
if you don't have a bedsheet?

113
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:28,965
I thought the school would prepare one.

114
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:30,885
No, they won't.

115
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,445
Shall I take you to buy them later?

116
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:34,765
-That would be great.
-Okay.

117
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,125
Then you should rest first.

118
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,085
Okay.

119
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,205
-Fangfang.
-Qingqing.

120
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:51,405
What did you buy?

121
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:52,725
I bought a lot.

122
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,405
A drinking cup, toothpaste,
toothbrush and slippers.

123
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:57,325
Look.

124
00:07:57,925 --> 00:07:58,885
I bought them

125
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:01,005
following "The Must-have List
for the New Semester."

126
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:03,845
By the way, Fangfang.

127
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:06,325
Do you know where are

128
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:08,325
the shelves for cameras and computers?

129
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,365
-The computer shelf?
-Yes.

130
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,005
That is the library.

131
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,285
-This one?
-Right.

132
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:21,205
That is our dormitory building.

133
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,405
That's where we go to classes.

134
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,405
-It's so beautiful.
-Right?

135
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:47,405
So handsome!

136
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:53,365
Fangfang, is there
something interesting there?

137
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,285
Let's go take a look.

138
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:56,765
-We'd better not get involved.
-What's wrong?

139
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:00,525
Listen, there are three popular guys
in our school.

140
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:04,645
Be careful when you talk about them.

141
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:06,125
The first one

142
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,805
is the gentleman, Gu Nanxi,

143
00:09:07,885 --> 00:09:10,485
who was elected as the president
of the Student Council unanimously.

144
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:13,725
As a good student who has won many awards,
he has lots of admirers.

145
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:16,765
He's not only good in his academics,
he's also good in sports.

146
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:19,485
He dominates the basketball court
and the grades list.

147
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,405
His killer move is his smile.

148
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:26,085
No matter how strong his opponents are,

149
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,765
as long as they are hit by his smile,

150
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:30,285
they will feel powerless
and be disarmed instantly.

151
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:37,245
The second one

152
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:40,285
is the school bully,
known as the devil of Ming De,

153
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:41,765
Lin Yiyang.

154
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:45,845
Rumor has it that he is shallow, vulgar
and capable of anything.

155
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,085
Anyway, all the students
are afraid of him.

156
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:53,045
Remember to never look into his eyes
for more than three seconds,

157
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:54,485
or...

158
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:00,965
No!

159
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:02,925
No!

160
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:09,325
And the last one

161
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:11,365
is the number one popular guy
in the school,

162
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,845
an idol with countless fans.

163
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:19,965
So handsome.

164
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,565
Situ Feng?

165
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:33,885
Qingqing, do you know him?

166
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:35,485
Are you his fan too?

167
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:36,885
No way!

168
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:39,765
That good-for-nothing jerk!

169
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:41,085
Jerk?

170
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:04,445
Fangfang.

171
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,085
Make a guess.

172
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:08,165
Do you think I can hit that jerk

173
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:11,085
with this potato chip?

174
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:14,205
Qingqing, please do not mess
with Situ Feng.

175
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:15,885
He has so many fans in school.

176
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:18,685
You just transferred here.
Don't you want to stay here?

177
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,685
Fangfang, is that Lin Yiyang?

178
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:41,845
Yes, let's get out of here.

179
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:44,925
Situ Feng.

180
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:51,165
Your fiancée is there.
Why don't you look after her?

181
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,885
-Fiancée?
-Fiancée?

182
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:56,845
I saw it on the internet yesterday
that he was kissed by someone.

183
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,525
But the woman...

184
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,645
-No way.
-No way.

185
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,245
Is that the woman who kissed him?

186
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,965
-No way.
-No way.

187
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:11,925
I don't have a fiancée.

188
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,325
I don't know that person.

189
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:25,925
Don't mind him.

190
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,685
Don't mind him, Qingqing. Let's go.

191
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:35,445
I'm furious.

192
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,445
-You again?
-You again?

193
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:46,565
You are really obsessive.

194
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:49,165
You even chased him to school.

195
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:51,405
What will you do this time
to harass Situ Feng?

196
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,005
-It's none of your business.
-Who the hell are you?

197
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,685
How dare you speak to Xinya like that?

198
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,965
Do you know that we are
the Goddess members?

199
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:00,565
The Goddess?

200
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:06,165
A group of women
who are beautiful, rich and powerful

201
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,965
in Ming De College.

202
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:11,965
Our lives are simply unimaginable to you.

203
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:15,365
Rich?

204
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:16,885
Beautiful?

205
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:21,005
Your faces seem to disagree with you.

206
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:21,925
You...

207
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:23,165
What did you say?

208
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,245
You stained Xinya's clothes.

209
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,525
Qingqing, can you wipe it off?

210
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,085
Civilians are civilians.

211
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,165
Do you know how expensive this dress is?

212
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,445
Wipe it off?

213
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:34,205
Right.

214
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:39,445
I know you are the kind of person
Situ Feng hates the most.

215
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,245
Xinya, don't waste your time
talking to her.

216
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:42,965
Make her pay for your clothes.

217
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:47,645
Well, why don't I take you to the bathroom
and clean it for you?

218
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:50,325
How can I wear the clothes
that you touched?

219
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,365
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:56,445 --> 00:14:00,605
It's hard for a civilian
to control our emotions.

221
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,205
How much is the cost
of your clothes in total?

222
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,085
Anyway, it's the first day
of the new semester.

223
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:06,405
You should wear new clothes.

224
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:08,645
Consider it as my gift to you.

225
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,165
Or charity.

226
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:11,645
You're rude!

227
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:13,205
What's going on?

228
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,685
This girl doesn't belong here.

229
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,685
I don't know how she got into our school.

230
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,485
I'm a student of this school.

231
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:19,965
She really is.

232
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:20,925
Aren't you a liar?

233
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:24,565
How could you afford
the tuition fee for our school?

234
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:28,485
Miss, do you have
the student ID of our school?

235
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,565
I do. Fangfang, help me hold it.

236
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:35,165
Where is my student ID?

237
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,565
-Did you leave it in the dorm?
-I guess so.

238
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,085
-I'll get it for you.
-Thank you.

239
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:42,605
Zhang Fangfang,
you'd better stay out of this.

240
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,405
Sir, it poses a great threat
to our personal safety

241
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,845
to let outsiders get into the school.

242
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,405
It's a very serious security failure.

243
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:56,085
I will retain the right
to complain to the security office.

244
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:57,405
I'm sorry, Ms. Lan.

245
00:14:57,485 --> 00:14:58,805
I'll take her away now.

246
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:03,845
I'm really a student of this school.

247
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:10,605
I want to sue!

248
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:14,245
I want to sue the society
for judging people by their looks!

249
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,765
Qingqing, I went back to the dormitory
to get your student ID,

250
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,565
but it was taken away
by the Goddess member.

251
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,205
It's the Goddess again.

252
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:26,045
And I went to find the school lecturers

253
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:27,885
but they were not there.

254
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:30,325
I can only get a temporary student ID
for you tomorrow.

255
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,525
Thank you, Fangfang.

256
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:39,685
You are my first friend in this city.

257
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:41,845
So what are you going to do today?

258
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:43,765
What else can I do?

259
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:46,765
I can only look around
the surrounding neighborhood.

260
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,005
Is there any interesting place
I can go to?

261
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:50,685
Would you like to join me?

262
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:51,725
Wait a minute.

263
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,525
Yes?

264
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:56,925
Okay, I'm on my way.

265
00:15:57,965 --> 00:15:59,725
Qingqing, there is an emergency.
I have to go.

266
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,205
I'll call you later.

267
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,605
Hello? Have you had dinner, Grandpa?

268
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,365
So you still care whether
your grandpa has had dinner or not.

269
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:33,365
I thought you had forgotten me.

270
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:37,405
How could I forget my grandpa
who's so handsome and wise,

271
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:40,805
majestic and powerful?

272
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:42,085
That's enough.

273
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:46,085
At least let me know
where you are right now

274
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,485
or I will be worried.

275
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:51,045
Okay, I'll tell you.

276
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,565
I'm in Yuncheng.

277
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:54,805
Do you think I will believe that?

278
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:56,365
I'm telling you the truth.

279
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:57,645
I'm not going back.

280
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,205
-Bye.
-Don't think I can't find you if you--

281
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,085
No one will send me food,

282
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,405
I'll have to look for food
every day myself.

283
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:10,604
It's so tiring.

284
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:16,844
Qingqing already knew

285
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:18,885
that I sent people to find her
in Yuncheng.

286
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:20,844
She must have already left.

287
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:25,525
Send more people to look for her
in the surrounding cities.

288
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,765
She shouldn't have gone far.

289
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,285
Yes, sir.

290
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:36,525
FENG CAFE

291
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:40,925
Miss, excuse me,
do you accept credit card?

292
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,045
No, we only accept cash.

293
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,405
There's an ATM over there.

294
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:52,845
PLEASE ENTER YOUR PASSWORD

295
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:54,365
YOUR BALANCE IS 100 YUAN

296
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:00,245
Miss, I'm back.

297
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:01,965
-Here.
-Thank you.

298
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:06,325
"His Highness's favorite food?"

299
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,285
How much influence does this guy have?

300
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:14,885
Never mind.

301
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:16,445
We won't see each other again anyway.

302
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:17,925
Miss.

303
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:20,405
I want this one.

304
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:35,245
Miss, bill please.

305
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:36,285
Okay.

306
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,085
It's 120 yuan.

307
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:39,445
-It's 120 yuan?
-Yes.

308
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,165
Miss.

309
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,805
I only have 100 yuan.

310
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,285
I'm 20 yuan short.

311
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:50,925
Can I owe you for now?

312
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,045
The boss is coming.

313
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:53,925
I'm coming.

314
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:07,725
IOU AGREEMENT

315
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:13,445
Miss.

316
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:15,925
I have already written you
an IOU Agreement.

317
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:24,485
You...

318
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:27,725
Who told you to use this?

319
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:30,685
This is Situ Feng's limited edition
poster that I collected.

320
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,645
You ripped it apart.

321
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:33,685
Look.

322
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:37,125
Half of His Highness's face is gone.

323
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:38,885
I'm sorry, miss.

324
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,405
Do you know

325
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,805
she reserved all the front row seats

326
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,805
to get this poster?

327
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:53,365
It has his autograph on it.

328
00:19:53,445 --> 00:19:55,285
And the sweat of his hands!

329
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:58,125
You tore it apart?

330
00:19:58,205 --> 00:19:59,885
Who the hell are you?

331
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,045
Then I'll pay.

332
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,005
I'll pay you back.

333
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:06,085
Do you think money can solve everything?

334
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:09,045
I'll make you pay!

335
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:20,845
I want you to apologize to His Highness.

336
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:22,925
What's so great about Situ Feng?

337
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:25,525
He's just a little bit handsome.

338
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:28,045
"A little bit handsome"?

339
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,525
When did you go blind?

340
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,845
We've all seen
his efforts and developments.

341
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:35,805
His singing, his dancing, even his smile

342
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:37,405
would light up our whole world.

343
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,685
Five, six, seven, eight.

344
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,205
HIS HIGHNESS IS THE BEST

345
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:47,965
-Wow.
-Wow.

346
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,085
His Highness is on
the cover of Bourgeoisie.

347
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:53,445
I bought 100 copies this time

348
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,165
and asked my relatives and friends
to buy it too

349
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:57,845
to pump up the sales.

350
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:05,565
Didn't you buy 20 VIP tickets
of His Highness's year-end tour last time?

351
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:07,965
How could you still have money
to buy so many magazines?

352
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:09,645
I'm jealous.

353
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,005
There's something you don't know.

354
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:14,805
-What is this?
-What is this?

355
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:18,165
This is the 9FBank app a friend
of mine recommended to me recently.

356
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,045
It's really convenient and easy to use.

357
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,365
Look, the credit limit

358
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:24,445
is up to 150,000 yuan.

359
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:26,125
So 20 tickets are nothing,

360
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,725
I can even afford 50 tickets.

361
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:32,245
His Highness's recent tour is for charity.

362
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,005
With every ticket sold, part of the money

363
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:37,045
will be donated to the unfortunate
children in the mountain area.

364
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,565
So I'd just consider it
as me doing charity.

365
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:44,645
To celebrate, let's order another one.

366
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:46,365
Hey!

367
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:48,925
Are you done?

368
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:50,805
It's about time you put me down.

369
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:53,005
You've gone too far.

370
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:55,805
Look, it's said on the internet

371
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:57,845
that there is a stalker
harassing His Highness.

372
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:58,845
-What?
-What?

373
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:05,005
"A crazy stalker of Situ Feng
was found in Ming De College?"

374
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:10,565
-You're the stalker!
-You're the stalker!

375
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:11,485
-Speak!
-Speak!

376
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,325
-What's your intention
-What's your intention

377
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:15,525
-coming to our fan cafe?
-coming to our fan cafe?

378
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:17,485
You won't talk?

379
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:19,005
Fine.

380
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,685
Unleash the punishment.

381
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:23,405
Hey!

382
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:24,725
What are you going to do?

383
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:30,005
In order to punish you,

384
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:31,165
today

385
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,325
you will have to wash 300 bowls
in this cafe.

386
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,805
Miss, what kind
of a weird punishment is that?

387
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,845
I have never washed any bowls in my life.

388
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:42,565
How long will it take for me
to wash 300 bowls?

389
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,525
If you don't want to wash the bowls,

390
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:46,685
then you have to tell me something.

391
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,165
What is it?

392
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:51,365
The kiss you had with Situ Feng.

393
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:54,765
I want to know all the details.

394
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,085
Is he a good kisser?

395
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,925
Are his lips soft?

396
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:03,205
What's the taste of his saliva?

397
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:05,485
Did your tongues--

398
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:06,405
Miss.

399
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:08,125
I'll wash the bowls.

400
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,645
I'll wash all the bowls, okay?

401
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:17,085
Since I was a kid,

402
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:20,125
I did everything
because someone forced me to.

403
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:22,325
But there wasn't a thing
I didn't finish perfectly.

404
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:25,565
Just some bowls...

405
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:28,685
How can they defeat me, Chen Qingqing?

406
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:32,325
Slow down.

407
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,365
They are very heavy.

408
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:49,405
It's okay, Qingqing.

409
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:52,085
You can cry when you feel sad.

410
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,005
-Fangfang.
-Yes?

411
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,125
Thank you for helping me.

412
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:15,525
You don't need to thank me.

413
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,285
Isn't that what friends are for?

414
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:20,925
It's probably because

415
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:25,085
I don't have any real friends growing up.

416
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,925
It's all because of that jerk, Situ Feng.

417
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:32,005
He deceived me and made me look like
a fool in front of so many people.

418
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:35,445
And then, he left me helpless.

419
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:37,965
I ended up washing bowls here
in the middle of the night.

420
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:40,205
If I see him again,

421
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:44,845
I'm going to kick him all the way
to the moon.

422
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:50,165
Actually, he's in our class.

423
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:03,445
Goodness, Fangfang.

424
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:07,525
Fangfang.

425
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:09,845
Qingqing, I got the student ID for you.

426
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:12,045
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

427
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:29,405
Class begins.

428
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:30,485
Stand up.

429
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,005
Good morning.

430
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:35,605
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning, ma'am.

431
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:37,005
Sit down.

432
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,965
Today, we have a new student in our class.

433
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,165
Come in.

434
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:50,365
-Why don't you introduce myself?
-Okay.

435
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:51,645
Hello.

436
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:53,245
I am Chen Qingqing.

437
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:03,165
Be quiet.

438
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:06,565
Have you forgotten how to behave
in class after having a vacation?

439
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:08,085
Chen Qingqing.

440
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:11,965
Only the seat in the last row
is not taken.

441
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,165
You can sit over there.

442
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:14,405
Yes, ma'am.

443
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:32,885
Hello, I am your new deskmate.

444
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,525
I'm Chen Qingqing.

445
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,685
...I could let go so easily?

446
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:49,405
Situ Feng.

447
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:50,605
Nice to meet you.

448
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:52,485
I would appreciate your advice.

449
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:54,285
I want you to say

450
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:56,765
that you are Situ Feng's assistant.

451
00:26:57,405 --> 00:26:58,605
-Assistant?
-Assistant?

452
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:00,165
Chen Qingqing.

453
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:02,205
You broke into
the Student Council's office

454
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:04,525
and sabotaged school property
on the first week of school.

455
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:05,805
If I don't pay...

456
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,125
-You'll be expelled.
-Sir.

457
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:10,565
I can kick you and your mom out
anytime I want.

458
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:11,565
Goodness.

459
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:15,045
Darling, here you are.

460
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,165
I've been looking for you everywhere.

461
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:20,725
