00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:35,765
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,685
EPISODE 11

3
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,205
Ugly like me?

4
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:12,005
Don't you have anything nice to say to me?

5
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:24,885
Fangfang.

6
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,565
What are you looking at?

7
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:28,645
Fangfang.

8
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:39,885
Zhang Fangfang.

9
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,205
-What is it?
-What are you looking at?

10
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,605
Nothing.

11
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,205
If I'm not mistaken,

12
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:52,045
this is a man's jacket.

13
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:55,685
Come on, don't be shy. Just say it.

14
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:56,845
No, it's nothing.

15
00:02:58,165 --> 00:02:59,205
We have class tomorrow.

16
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,645
You should go to bed now.

17
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,205
Fangfang, you're blushing.

18
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,965
-Hey, Qingqing!
-Yes?

19
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:19,405
The bonsai I gave you yesterday,
don't water it too much.

20
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:22,165
Goodness.

21
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,885
You should take care of yourself first.

22
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:26,925
Can't you be a little nicer?

23
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:31,125
Sometimes, you're quite interesting.

24
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,885
You can do quite a lot.

25
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,045
Can you just stop pulling that scary face?

26
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:39,125
You're the scaredy-cat here, Feng.

27
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,325
When I'm a little nicer, you like me.

28
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:46,205
But when I'm a little rude,
you chicken out right away!

29
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:49,405
Hey, since when do I like you?

30
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,165
I mean

31
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:58,605
who gave you the idea to determine
what girls should be like?

32
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:00,685
If we want to define ourselves,

33
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:03,045
we've got to be modest and gentle
to everyone else.

34
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,965
What era are we in now?

35
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,925
Actually, that's not what I meant either.

36
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:09,725
You just need half
of Qingchen's qualities.

37
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:14,605
Let me ask you this.

38
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,685
Do you know what Qingchen is like?

39
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:21,365
I see that she has a special place
in your heart.

40
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,885
She's the lead actress of my music video.

41
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:27,285
Not only she's gorgeous and polite,

42
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:28,845
but she's also approachable.

43
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:31,685
You should get to know her
when you get the chance.

44
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:34,485
You've got a lot to learn from her
to improve yourself.

45
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,245
Right, Gu Nanxi?

46
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,245
Yes.

47
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:38,925
And she's beautiful.

48
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,405
Her fingers were dancing on the piano keys

49
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:45,485
just like fairies.

50
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:49,525
Musical fairies.

51
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:53,845
Hey! You two rich kids.

52
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:57,245
Now, I really want to buy a huge mirror

53
00:04:57,325 --> 00:05:00,485
so I can show you
what you really look like.

54
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,525
I want to ask the both of you.

55
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:09,045
Don't you notice anything strange

56
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,525
about this Qingchen?

57
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,605
She always shows up with a "bang"!

58
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,685
Right in front of you.

59
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:20,605
Then she goes "bang" again and disappears.

60
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,245
Comes without a shadow,
goes without a trace.

61
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:24,765
There's more.

62
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:30,085
Doesn't she always wear a very long dress

63
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:34,965
every time you meet her?

64
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:39,405
That's because she has no feet.

65
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:41,725
And no shadow.

66
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:45,565
Good point.

67
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:49,365
Every time I try to call her,
I couldn't get through.

68
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,085
And sometimes,
the number is out of service.

69
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:54,805
You'd only meet her

70
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:58,965
at a certain time and in a certain place.

71
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,165
Yet it's not so easy to see her.

72
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:09,485
Don't tell me

73
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,325
that you've been seeing a ghost?

74
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:16,725
Look over there!

75
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:49,125
Chen Qingqing, what are you up to?

76
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:17,765
Fangfang!

77
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:19,925
Why did I see you with Lin Yiyang?

78
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:20,845
No.

79
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,365
My clothes got ripped off.
Then he lent me his jacket.

80
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,885
I was just returning it.
There's nothing between us.

81
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:26,805
Is that so?

82
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,725
Listen, Fangfang.

83
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,565
You've got to stay away from Yiyang
if you don't need his help.

84
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,885
He's not what he seems to be.

85
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:36,725
Don't worry, I know that.

86
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,285
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

87
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,525
Fangfang, go back to the dorm.
I'll see you there in a minute.

88
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:45,605
Bye.

89
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:47,965
Hi, Ms. Chen.

90
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,965
-What is it?
-I want to ask you.

91
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,325
Is there a great alumnus in our school

92
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,965
that goes by the name of Xiao Jingnan?

93
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,445
Why do you ask?

94
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,525
It's like this.

95
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:02,685
The Students Council

96
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,285
is now sorting out the archives

97
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,205
of the school's most notable students.

98
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,405
So I'd like to get to learn more
and get to know him better.

99
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,965
He was indeed an excellent person.

100
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:12,925
Really?

101
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:14,725
Do you know him?

102
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,005
His data is at the College Archives.

103
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,445
If you want to know more,

104
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,765
you just have to go there.

105
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:22,325
Is there anything else?

106
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:23,485
No.

107
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:24,525
Thank you, ma'am.

108
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,164
May I have your attention, please?

109
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:37,765
The candidate list
for the school's play has been announced.

110
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:40,725
Come and see if you've made the cut
to share the stage with the stars!

111
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:42,564
Excuse me.

112
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:43,885
May I take a look?

113
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:48,164
"Instructed by Chen Xiao?" That means...

114
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:51,845
This is fantastic.

115
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:53,285
No way!

116
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,045
Even the witch can't keep her day job?

117
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,325
This is really weird.

118
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:01,565
Qingqing, look.

119
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:03,045
You made the cut.

120
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,645
I'm at the top of the list!

121
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,445
They really have good a taste.

122
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:09,405
This is the list of supporting actors.

123
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,125
The main cast is over there.

124
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,525
It's them again!

125
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:28,005
Do you think you can be the main actress?

126
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:31,085
-You'd be a laughing stock.
-Yeah.

127
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:33,805
This opportunity
is certainly made for Xinya.

128
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,925
You should just stick to being an extra.

129
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:36,885
Yeah.

130
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,325
You two take a good look at the list.

131
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:43,405
I don't know how many rungs
your names are below mine.

132
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,365
You didn't even make it as extras.

133
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:46,765
And as for you...

134
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,125
How do I put it?

135
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:52,445
I've never seen how well you act.

136
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,045
So you want to see

137
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,445
how well I strut my stuff on stage?

138
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:59,605
Then I'll just have to wait and see.

139
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:03,365
But you'd better not let me down!

140
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:05,845
Bring it on.

141
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:07,845
Bring it on.

142
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:16,885
What's wrong, Feng?

143
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:20,405
First of all,

144
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,965
congratulations for making the cut

145
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:25,365
into the Beauty and the Beast lineup.

146
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:28,485
In the next few hours,

147
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,165
I will conduct the drama class

148
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:31,845
on behalf of Ms. Wang.

149
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,045
And in two weeks,

150
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,805
we will have a performance.

151
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:42,365
Gu Nanxi, you managed to come up
with a good plan.

152
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,085
You shall be the director.

153
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,605
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,165
Next, we will assign your roles.

155
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:52,845
Your rehearsal begins now.

156
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,605
In this scene,
Belle trespasses the West Wing

157
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:56,845
and then she sees a rose.

158
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:57,965
The Beast drives her away.

159
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:01,005
CHIP, MRS POTTS, COGSWORTH, LUMIÈRE

160
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:05,405
Could it be that no one notices my talent?

161
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:08,005
I don't think
it's just a matter of talent.

162
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,285
COGSWORTH, LUMIÈRE

163
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:18,725
Feng.

164
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,605
This is my first stage play,
so I don't have any experience.

165
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:23,765
Can you give me some advice?

166
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,565
Well, Xinya, you're all good.

167
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,645
I believe in you.

168
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:33,645
All right.

169
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:34,805
Ready?

170
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:35,765
Action!

171
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,085
What are you doing?

172
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,005
Did you touch it?

173
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:49,525
I'm sorry!

174
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:50,525
Do you realize

175
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:52,965
that you could have damned us all?

176
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,885
But I didn't mean any harm.

177
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:57,845
Get out!

178
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,605
I'm sorry!

179
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:01,525
Get out of here.

180
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:04,965
Promise or no promise,

181
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:06,965
I can't stay here another minute!

182
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,885
Cut! Stop!

183
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:13,165
Nanxi, how did I do? Did I play it well?

184
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:14,285
Not...

185
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,685
Not too bad.

186
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:17,605
It's just that

187
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,325
you need to give your movements

188
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:22,045
a little restraint.

189
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,125
A little restraint?

190
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,525
Because you moved about so much.

191
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:26,645
We don't need that.

192
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:27,565
Got it?

193
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:30,885
Got it. A little restraint.

194
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,965
Okay, let's do it again.

195
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,005
All right.

196
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:40,445
Take two. Ready?

197
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:41,765
Action!

198
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:45,525
Did you touch it?

199
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,005
I'm sorry!

200
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:49,445
You could have damned us all!

201
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,845
But I didn't mean any harm!

202
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:54,125
Get out!

203
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:58,405
Promise or no promise,

204
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,645
I can't stay here another minute!

205
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:03,485
One more time!

206
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,165
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,485
I didn't mean any harm.

208
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:09,445
Get out of here.

209
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:14,685
-One more time!
-I didn't mean any harm.

210
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:15,685
Get out!

211
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:19,685
One more time!

212
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,045
I didn't mean any harm.

213
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:23,765
Get out!

214
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:28,645
Promise or no promise,

215
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,805
I can't stay here another minute!

216
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:56,765
Ms. Chen.

217
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,805
Can I be frank with you?

218
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:01,325
-Go ahead.
-I think that

219
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:04,405
if we want to improve the quality
of the play,

220
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:08,085
I think the role of Belle should go to

221
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:10,245
Situ Feng!

222
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:12,885
Qingqing.

223
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,885
You shouldn't joke around all the time.

224
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:17,765
Ms. Chen, I'm not joking at all.

225
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,205
Gu Nanxi can prove it.

226
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,285
Situ Feng's women's clothes

227
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:24,045
are really nice.

228
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:26,685
Yes, they are.

229
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,285
Gu Nanxi!

230
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,085
Are you both pulling a prank on me?

231
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,125
Goodness, seriously.

232
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:39,525
What I said is all true.

233
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:42,205
We're praising you,
so don't give me that look.

234
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:44,205
All right.

235
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,485
I want to tell you the truth too.

236
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,245
You're the best to play the Beast.

237
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:49,805
Who are you calling the Beast?

238
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:52,285
Look, your temper is much worse
than a beast.

239
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:56,125
Situ Feng, do you want me to send you
flying in the air with my spinning kick?

240
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,605
You dare?

241
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,125
Knock it off.

242
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,645
You're Belle

243
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:01,885
and you're the Beast.

244
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:04,285
-That'd be perfect.
-No!

245
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:05,885
At least, I gained something.

246
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:11,125
You both seem well-coordinated
when you were arguing.

247
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:14,685
So it'd be nice
for you to take these roles.

248
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:15,605
But Ms. Chen--

249
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:16,645
How about this?

250
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,125
Let's call a vote!

251
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,285
Hands up if you don't want Situ Feng
to play Belle!

252
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:22,445
Wait!

253
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:23,565
This is not fair.

254
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:24,845
No one put their hands up.

255
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:26,685
All right.

256
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,325
I've decided.

257
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:30,885
Qingqing will be the Beast

258
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:31,965
and Situ Feng,

259
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:33,805
you'll play Belle.

260
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,365
Hey, beauty.

261
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:38,725
As for Lumière,

262
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:41,725
Xinya will take the role.

263
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:42,685
Beauty.

264
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:43,805
Ms. Chen,

265
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,805
if we give Xinya a supporting role,
she won't accept it.

266
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:48,045
Ms. Chen,

267
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,925
Xinya doesn't think highly
of such petty roles.

268
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:52,645
How about you cast her as Gaston?

269
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:54,645
It's a lead role too.

270
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:55,725
Perhaps.

271
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:58,725
Sorry.

272
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,805
I was a little engrossed by it.

273
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,645
How did I do? A little better?

274
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:08,725
In this scene,
Belle trespasses the West Wing

275
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:10,285
and then she sees a rose.

276
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:11,565
The Beast drives her away.

277
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,045
They gave Qingqing the lead role.

278
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:19,125
What's got into that witch's eyes?

279
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:27,565
What are you doing?

280
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,365
Did you touch it?

281
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:31,565
No.

282
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,845
I didn't mean any harm.

283
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:34,885
Do you realize

284
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,045
that you could have damned us all?

285
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:39,965
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:43,885
Get out of here.

287
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:46,605
Get out!

288
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:51,925
Hey.

289
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:53,605
What's wrong?

290
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,645
Are you okay?

291
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,165
I'm fine.

292
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,725
Situ Feng, you're burning up.

293
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,565
Do you have a fever?

294
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:05,365
You'd better go get some rest.

295
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:06,765
Ms. Chen.

296
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:08,685
Situ Feng seems to have a fever.

297
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,165
Feng.

298
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,204
What happened to you?

299
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:18,165
His head is warm.

300
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,165
Hey, take him to the infirmary now.

301
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:21,165
Got it.

302
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:22,244
Take it easy now.

303
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:23,204
I'm going with him.

304
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:24,724
The rest should stay here.

305
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,525
You'll take his place.

306
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:28,725
-You'll act with Qingqing, okay?
-Okay.

307
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,285
Gu Nanxi.

308
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:40,725
Qingqing.

309
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:42,925
How's Situ Feng now?

310
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,525
He got a fever because of his cold.

311
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,845
He's resting at home now.

312
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,885
Maybe he caught a cold

313
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:52,405
when he fell into the pool
during his last photo shoot?

314
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:54,205
What?

315
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,205
-He fell into the water?
-Yes.

316
00:17:57,445 --> 00:17:58,765
Now I get it.

317
00:17:58,845 --> 00:17:59,885
What do you get?

318
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:02,405
Is he so afraid of water?

319
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:04,445
Yes.

320
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,765
You're kidding me, right?

321
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:07,765
He's such a big boy!

322
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:11,685
It looks like you're concerned about him.

323
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,325
Am I?

324
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,645
Of course, classmates have
to look out for each other.

325
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,805
We often ask about each other, right?

326
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,325
We often do that, right?

327
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:24,645
-Really?
-Yeah!

328
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:25,685
I care about you too.

329
00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:27,285
It's always like that.

330
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:28,605
It always is.

331
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,325
Qingqing, I heard Feng is sick.

332
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,405
Aren't you his assistant?

333
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:37,805
-Well, I--
-Can you help us

334
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:40,565
send our little kind regards to him?

335
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:42,645
-Me too!
-Me too!

336
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:43,565
Settle down!

337
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,565
One by one.

338
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:49,205
-Thank you!
-That's great!

339
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:53,965
Qingqing.

340
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:56,565
It looks like you can't leave your job
as his assistant.

341
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,725
Why do I have to do
something like this for them?

342
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:08,805
Hello.

343
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,485
Welcome to the Situ Residence.

344
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,285
And you are?

345
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:14,445
I'm Situ Feng's assistant.

346
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:16,685
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

347
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:24,965
Hello.

348
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:25,885
Hello.

349
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:30,725
Who are you?

350
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,405
Hello, sir.

351
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,685
I'm Situ Feng's assistant.

352
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,805
So you're Mei.

353
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,605
Yes, I'm Mei.

354
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:39,885
That's a lot you're carrying.

355
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:41,205
Carry them for her.

356
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,325
No. You really don't have to.

357
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,845
These are all from Feng's fans.

358
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:47,405
I have to bring them up myself.

359
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,365
Thank you, sir.

360
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:49,645
I'm going upstairs.

361
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,925
-Can you see where you're going?
-Yes, I can!

362
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,725
It looks like he's seriously ill.

363
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:26,005
Chen Qingqing!

364
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,005
What the hell?

365
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,085
I...

366
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:31,445
I was just helping you cover up.

367
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,685
You were drooling at my face!

368
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:34,165
What?

369
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:38,405
I'm not interested in some guy
who wears childish underwear!

370
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:39,485
Why you...

371
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:40,805
Don't tell anybody!

372
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:44,525
I'm doing some people a favor
by sending you these gifts.

373
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:45,845
They're here.

374
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:47,605
I'm leaving now.

375
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:48,885
Hey, Chen Qingqing!

376
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:49,885
What now?

377
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:51,565
Why are you drenched?

378
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:53,085
Did you get caught in the rain?

379
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,365
Yeah, it was raining.

380
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,845
It was raining heavily.

381
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:00,525
You better get changed,
or you'll catch a cold.

382
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:18,965
What are you looking at?

383
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:20,805
Nothing.

384
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:25,005
Those clothes should warm you up.

385
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:28,765
Feng.

386
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:31,565
Feng.

387
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:34,005
Lan Xinya.

388
00:22:34,245 --> 00:22:36,565
-What is she doing here?
-I don't know!

389
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:37,885
What should I do now?

390
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:39,725
-Hide!
-Feng!

391
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:42,285
No.

392
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,485
She could see you here.

393
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:44,925
Feng!

394
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:46,685
No.

395
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:48,245
That's much worse!

396
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,725
Then tell me where to hide!

397
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:50,805
I don't know!

398
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:53,845
Feng!

399
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:55,085
Xinya.

400
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:56,605
I was worried sick about you.

401
00:22:56,685 --> 00:22:57,845
Are you feeling better now?

402
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:59,125
A lot better.

403
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:00,925
I came right after class.

404
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,125
Let me see.

405
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,045
It looks like you're getting better.

406
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,085
But...

407
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:09,365
your complexion doesn't look normal.

408
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:10,605
It doesn't?

409
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:12,645
Never mind about that.

410
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,885
Today, I'll be taking good care of you.

411
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:15,925
Please, don't--

412
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:17,245
Come on in.

413
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,485
You, open the window to let in some air.

414
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:30,205
You three, make the room completely
clean with detergent.

415
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,965
The nurses are on standby for 24 hours

416
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:33,765
to monitor Feng's condition at all times.

417
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,165
Okay everyone, move it.

418
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,685
You, change Feng's blanket
to a slightly thinner one.

419
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:43,285
-See what's over here.
-No.

420
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:47,885
Put it down.

421
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:50,405
Feng!

422
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:51,925
Your blanket is so thick.

423
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,365
-Just change it.
-No, thanks.

424
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:57,045
The doctor said to use thick blankets when
you have a fever so you'll sweat it out.

425
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:00,485
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

426
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,605
Get him another blanket.

427
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,565
Here you go.

428
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:11,485
Allow me.

429
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:18,045
Gosh, Xinya.

430
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,685
Suddenly, I feel so hot.

431
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:20,805
Take off my blanket.

432
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:22,525
Hurry, take it off.

433
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:26,925
Xinya.

434
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:28,085
What is it, Feng?

435
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:30,245
You'd better get going.

436
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:31,485
I need to get enough rest.

437
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:32,805
Feng.

438
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:34,925
But today,

439
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:37,485
I asked the school for a leave

440
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:40,245
just to be here with you.

441
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:45,205
Xinya.

442
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:48,205
Well, you should go now.

443
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:50,205
I know your good intentions.

444
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:52,965
Well, then.

445
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:53,965
Feng.

446
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:55,205
Go get your rest.

447
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:57,685
Okay, don't touch anything.

448
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:58,725
You can go back.

449
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:05,405
Go.

450
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:07,405
Go.

451
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:10,765
-Well, Feng.
-Yes?

452
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:12,525
-If you'll excuse me.
-Sure.

453
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:16,565
Leave quickly.

454
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:25,885
Feng.

455
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:27,085
What now?

456
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:28,165
Don't forget to call me.

457
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:29,365
Yes, I will.

458
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:34,525
-Feng!
-Yes?

459
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:37,685
So you have that kind of hobby.

460
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:38,685
What?

461
00:25:43,485 --> 00:25:44,805
Xinya.

462
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:46,165
How do I look?

463
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:51,565
You look great!

464
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:54,565
-I'm going now.
-Yeah, bye.

465
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:01,365
Come out.

466
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,805
I was suffocating!

467
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:09,245
Situ Feng.

468
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:11,765
-How could you think of this idea?
-What else could I do?

469
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:18,645
Is that my phone?

470
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:20,445
It seems like it.

471
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:23,365
It's Gu Nanxi.

472
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:25,805
Hello? Gu Nanxi.

473
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:32,725
I'll go back to school now.

474
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:34,165
Bye.

475
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:35,325
What is it?

476
00:26:35,405 --> 00:26:37,925
The witch is calling for a rehearsal,

477
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:39,445
so I've got to go back to school.

478
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:40,925
A rehearsal, now?

479
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,605
-But it's so late.
-Hey.

480
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,685
Get well soon, okay?

481
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:44,605
Once you're better,

482
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:47,725
I'll wait for you to come back
and play on stage.

483
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:49,725
Hey, are you nuts?

484
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:55,965
I'm so tired.

485
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:57,245
We've been rehearsing all day.

486
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,965
That was completely inhumane.

487
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,005
Yeah.

488
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,685
This is clearly not her day job,
but she set her heart on it.

489
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:05,445
You know that witch is a workaholic.

490
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:06,405
Hey, you!

491
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:08,245
Are you done chatting?

492
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:10,325
Don't just sit there! Back to rehearsal!

493
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:13,405
Knock it off!

494
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:16,605
Come on.

495
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,525
I'll show you to your room.

496
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:20,845
My room?

497
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:22,485
But I thought...

498
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:25,405
Do you want to stay in the dungeon?

499
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:30,125
No one makes slick and quick moves
Like Gaston does

500
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:33,845
No one shines in the midsummer
Like Gaston does

501
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:36,965
You make me tremble
When I stand beside you

502
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:41,405
-Oh my, Gaston is so perfect!
-Oh my, Gaston is so perfect!

503
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:44,165
Stop!

504
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,805
You're such a nuisance.

505
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:51,005
Can you please rehearse somewhere else?

506
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:54,245
No one's slick as Gaston

507
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,045
No one's quick as Gaston

508
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,525
In a spitting match

509
00:27:57,605 --> 00:27:59,325
Nobody spits like Gaston

510
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:02,125
And I'm so good at spitting!

511
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:05,125
Cut it out, Xinya.

512
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:07,245
We'll move on to the next act.
You guys go rest.

513
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:08,605
-Not me--
-Come on.

514
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:09,645
Move it!

515
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:13,525
THE BEAST

516
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:19,925
Qingqing, let's do Act Six.

517
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:21,485
-The one with the piano.
-Okay.

518
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:23,685
They'll dub the music,
so you take it easy.

519
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:24,725
Go on.

520
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:27,405
I'll take it easy.

521
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:49,205
It's such a piece of cake,

522
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:51,645
yet she had to show off like that.

523
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:55,645
That silhouette...

524
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:57,725
Where have I seen it before?

525
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:47,925
Qingchen

526
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:49,365
is Chen Qingqing!

527
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:50,965
But why?

528
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:53,285
Why did you disguise yourself?

529
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:57,165
What are you trying to hide from us?

530
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:13,805
Thank you for seeing me
although you're sick.

531
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:16,605
No need to thank me.

532
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:18,445
We're best buddies.

533
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:25,045
You

534
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,685
are the only friend I have left.

535
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:32,165
Hey, Gu Nanxi.

536
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:34,245
Aren't you the good boy
who always goes to bed early?

537
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:35,725
Why are you up late now?

538
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:36,925
And you're sharing a cola!

539
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:38,285
What?

540
00:30:38,725 --> 00:30:41,605
Can't I just chat with you for a minute?

541
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:42,845
It looks like

542
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:45,045
you've got a lot on your mind.

543
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:47,605
Say it. I'll straighten it out.

544
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:49,045
Oh, come on!

545
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,485
I can really tell.

546
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:52,445
You like Qingchen, right?

547
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:55,285
Cut it out!

548
00:30:56,005 --> 00:30:58,325
You can't hide your thoughts from me.

549
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:00,325
So you like Chen Qingqing?

550
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:03,805
Hey, cut the crap.

551
00:31:03,885 --> 00:31:05,965
Who'd be unlucky enough to like her?

552
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:16,525
Hey, we have never fought at all, right?

553
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:18,005
What?

554
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,125
Do you want to fight?

555
00:31:19,205 --> 00:31:21,045
I mean,

556
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,045
if someday,

557
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,605
we end up fighting,

558
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:25,925
what would be the reason?

559
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:28,365
No matter what,
I'll never hurt my own friend.

560
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:30,725
Gu Nanxi.

561
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:33,045
What's up with you today?

562
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:37,325
Hold on, I need to get this.

563
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:41,725
-Hello?
-My little master.

564
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:43,725
I've got to tell you something,

565
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:45,565
but you've got to brace yourself.

566
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:47,045
What is it?

567
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,645
Someone hacked our computers.

568
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:50,325
They uploaded the video for "Breath."

569
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:52,125
What?

570
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:53,525
How did you get hacked?

571
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:55,765
I can only say that the fans are
going all crazy by now!

572
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:57,405
But don't you worry.

573
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:58,885
We haven't announced anything.

574
00:31:58,965 --> 00:32:00,045
And it hasn't spread far.

575
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,125
I hope it doesn't cause you trouble.

576
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:03,365
Okay.

577
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:04,765
I hope it's all good.

578
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:05,685
All right.

579
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:06,965
You may go back to rest now.

580
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:08,965
I'll be here to see
how the situation unfolds.

581
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:10,565
Okay, bye.

582
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:12,445
What's wrong?

583
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:13,925
Why do you look so serious?

584
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:16,805
Nothing, it's just the agency.

585
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:26,245
Hey.

586
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:29,365
It looks like you're all better.

587
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:31,605
A little game is all it takes!

588
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:33,325
You keep saying I'm so weak.

589
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:34,445
No, I didn't!

590
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:35,445
You're all okay now,

591
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:36,645
-shall we rehearse?
-Sure.

592
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:37,645
I've got it all down.

593
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:39,085
Come on.

594
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,125
Come on! I'll show you to your room.

595
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:46,125
My room?

596
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,285
Go on!

597
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:49,885
Situ Feng!

598
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,765
Don't blame me for being mean to you.

599
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:05,765
Is he using me to threaten you?

600
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:11,005
You and Lin Yiyang...

601
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:13,845
That bitch Qingqing is about
to take Feng away from you.

602
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:15,725
Feng is mine!

603
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:18,365
Are you in love with her?

604
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:21,125
I heard that Situ Feng took
the female lead in Beauty and the Beast.

605
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:25,085
This photo was taken

606
00:33:25,165 --> 00:33:27,925
when your parents first met.

607
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,245
Youyou, will you marry me?

608
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:31,925
I will.

609
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,365
