A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,685
EPISODE 30

3
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:04,445
Chen Qingqing.

4
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:09,805
Do not disturb my sleep.

5
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,605
Never mind. It's not a big deal anyway.

6
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:17,765
It's just something related to your dad.

7
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:18,725
I'm leaving.

8
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:20,485
What?

9
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,005
Come back here.

10
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:26,805
The library is holding an exhibition
of the school history.

11
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:28,845
Then, I found this.

12
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,125
-You might be interested.
-What is it?

13
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:36,925
Isn't this just a pencil?

14
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:45,205
"Xiao Jingnan"?

15
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,845
-This was my dad's pencil.
-Yes.

16
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:51,365
There's more.

17
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:01,565
SKETCH BY THE OUTSTANDING ALUMNUS,
XIAO JINGNAN

18
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:06,605
I think that you inherited
your drawing talent from your dad.

19
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:10,205
Don't you think

20
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:13,485
that this sketch has a magical power?

21
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:17,845
I feel like this is a sketch

22
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,805
made by a boy

23
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:22,965
with all his heart.

24
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:25,325
That's right.

25
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:27,365
Chen Qingqing.

26
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:29,165
I've got another secret to tell you.

27
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:32,845
I feel the same way whenever you draw me.

28
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,525
Don't flatter yourself.

29
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:44,485
Situ Feng, I've made up my mind.

30
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:47,885
-I want to make drawing as my new goal.
-All right.

31
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,885
Chen Qingqing, you can do it.

32
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,125
If you work hard,

33
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,645
you'll definitely become
an outstanding comic artist.

34
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:56,205
Go get it!

35
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,685
Situ Feng.

36
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:01,965
I've decided.

37
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:05,085
I'm going to start drawing from today.

38
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:06,845
I won't disturb you then.

39
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,205
-I'm going to go now.
-Okay.

40
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:19,165
Go, Chen Qingqing!

41
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,125
I can't think of anything.

42
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:32,445
The BL comics I drew in the past

43
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:34,885
were all improvisations.

44
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:38,005
Now, I have to draw a whole story.

45
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:42,885
I don't have any inspiration at all.

46
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:56,925
Lan Xinya.

47
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:02,525
You've been looking
at the sea for two days.

48
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:10,805
What's so interesting about the sea?

49
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,245
As the school hunk of Ming De College,

50
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:21,485
it's humiliating

51
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,885
that I have to fish for food every day.

52
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,765
I, Hua Munian, is a stylish man.

53
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:35,485
Why am I doing such a down-to-earth work?

54
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:44,245
Hua Munian.

55
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,325
If you could just man up a bit,

56
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:52,445
just a bit,

57
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:56,085
I wouldn't find you that annoying.

58
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:06,525
-Hua--
-Xinya--

59
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:23,485
Hua Munian, did you kiss me on purpose?

60
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:24,725
I didn't do it on purpose.

61
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,445
Or did I do it on purpose?

62
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:30,765
-Hua Munian, why are you so--
-So manly, right?

63
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:34,645
I think your kiss broke my spell.

64
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:38,485
The frog finally became a prince.

65
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,845
You're a female frog.

66
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:41,285
The tadpoles are looking for you.

67
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:42,685
Cut the crap.

68
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:57,165
A friend of mine owns
this comic publishing company.

69
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,005
You can go for an interview.

70
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,765
Start your career as an assistant.

71
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,245
You'll become a great comic artist
in the future.

72
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:11,965
-Are you Chen Qingqing?
-Nice to meet you.

73
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:13,045
Take a seat.

74
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:15,365
-Just call me Matthew.
-Nice to meet you.

75
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:16,845
I've seen your drawings.

76
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,325
I really like your drawing style.

77
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:19,725
-Really?
-Yes.

78
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,005
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

79
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:24,485
Our interns only have to work
in the morning.

80
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:26,645
Then, do a handover at noon.

81
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,685
Their daily task is
to draw anywhere they want.

82
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:29,805
It's quite easy.

83
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,845
Are you saying
that I can start working right now?

84
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,205
Yes, go inside.

85
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:37,405
Just find a comfortable place to sit down.

86
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:38,925
-Okay. Thank you.
-Go ahead.

87
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:40,085
All right.

88
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,805
-Excuse me.
-It's all right.

89
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:49,965
Hello.

90
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,805
Sorry to interrupt.

91
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:56,565
Hello, I'm the new intern, Chen Qingqing.

92
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:59,405
Nice to meet you.

93
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:02,205
Is this seat taken?

94
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,205
Why are you two so serious?

95
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:51,285
I've got news for you.
Don't get too worked up.

96
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,045
News? What is it?

97
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,685
A company in the States has heard
your new album. They loved it.

98
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:58,045
-They've decided to sign you.
-Really?

99
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:01,005
Are you selling me off?

100
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,245
No.

101
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,325
The agency will send you to the States.

102
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,605
You'll receive training
and be repositioned.

103
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,245
This is to open up opportunities

104
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,565
for cooperation with the record company
on the West Coast.

105
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:13,845
America loves your new album.

106
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:16,525
They'll probably hire
the most famous producer, Adam,

107
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:18,165
to produce your next album.

108
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:20,605
He has produced four Grammy artists.

109
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:22,405
You might be the next.

110
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:25,165
That's right. This is a rare opportunity.

111
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:27,365
Your dream is about to come true.

112
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,805
You don't look excited at all.

113
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:34,205
Be excited.

114
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:38,645
I have to go to the States then.

115
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:39,965
Of course.

116
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,205
You might not come back.

117
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:44,205
Mei and I will also move there.

118
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,445
We'll buy a mansion in Los Angeles.

119
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:49,405
We'll watch the sunset
and play basketball with Kobe every day.

120
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:53,045
What about Chen Qingqing?

121
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,445
She...

122
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:05,925
-She might go with you.
-That's right.

123
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:16,405
-Situ Feng.
-Qingqing.

124
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:23,845
Look, Situ Feng.

125
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:26,245
My first short comic has been published.

126
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,445
I'm even going to get paid.

127
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:30,845
You know what?
This gives me a sense of accomplishment.

128
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:32,285
I'm counting on your blessing.

129
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,205
I'll become a great comic artist.

130
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:37,725
Then, I will open my own studio.

131
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:38,965
What should I name it?

132
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,285
How about Hebiancao?

133
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,765
Help me out. What should I name my studio?

134
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,045
Name it after me.

135
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:49,965
No way.

136
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:53,365
Your fanatical fans are going to accuse me
of using your fame.

137
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:01,885
It seems like you're in a bad mood today.

138
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:03,405
I'm not.

139
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:06,645
Qingqing, I'm really happy now.

140
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:10,485
I believe that you'll become successful.

141
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:14,485
Thank you.

142
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:15,805
You know what?

143
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:20,045
This is the first time that I've felt
so accomplished in my life.

144
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:30,165
You haven't told her yet?

145
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:40,085
Not yet.

146
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:50,205
Then will you go?

147
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,205
I haven't decided yet.

148
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:00,365
But I think that it's a good opportunity.

149
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:09,845
Do you want Qingqing to go with you?

150
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,765
Qingqing has her own career.

151
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:23,045
I don't think that she'd want
to come with me.

152
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,485
Hold on.

153
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:36,325
If you leave, I will be all alone.

154
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:37,845
What am I going to do without you?

155
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:40,045
Knock it off.

156
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,645
I don't know what to do
about Chen Qingqing.

157
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:45,445
Please don't give me a hard time too.

158
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,445
You have to tell her sooner or later.

159
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:02,765
Or else you'll be lying to her.

160
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:06,645
Yes, I can't like people.

161
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:09,285
But has Chen Qingqing never lied to me?

162
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,925
Have you never lied to me?

163
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,045
-What are you talking about?
-Hurry.

164
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,005
He's here.

165
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:21,765
Your Highness, rumor says that
you're going to the States. Is that true?

166
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:23,845
Are you nervous about working
with great producers?

167
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:26,525
I haven't decided yet.

168
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,165
Please don't spread false rumors.

169
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,285
-What about your girlfriend, Qingqing?
-Come on. This is a college.

170
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:33,645
-You shouldn't be here. Stop asking.
-Please explain to us.

171
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,605
-Your Highness.
-Leave.

172
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:35,685
-Tell us.
-Leave now.

173
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,165
-Tell us.
-Your Highness.

174
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:38,245
Please leave now.

175
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:39,445
Let's go.

176
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:54,285
Qingqing, your latest work is amazing.
It's going viral on the internet.

177
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:55,845
Thank you.

178
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,085
I can't believe it was drawn by an intern.

179
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,205
You're so talented.
Your work is very appealing.

180
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:03,805
-Keep up the good work.
-Keep it up.

181
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:05,725
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

182
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,605
I've got good news for you.

183
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,245
It's totally unprecedented.

184
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:11,925
Since all of your previous work

185
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,765
have received great feedbacks
from the market,

186
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:17,645
the headquarters have decided
to transfer you to the office in Japan.

187
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,685
-Japan?
-Yes.

188
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,245
But I'm still in college.

189
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:25,445
It's all right.
There are many good schools in Japan.

190
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,005
Besides, you speak Japanese quite well.

191
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:28,765
You can continue
to pursue your studies there.

192
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,045
Look, Qingqing.

193
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:36,005
Many great artists started off in Japan.

194
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,805
You're just a step away from your dream.

195
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,925
Do you like this school?

196
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,725
I used to dislike it.

197
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,565
My life was like a math equation.

198
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,685
I had to take it step by step.

199
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:14,045
But after I met you...

200
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,125
What happened after you met me?

201
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:17,925
After I met you,

202
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,125
my life became a chemical equation.

203
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:22,045
I didn't know what to expect.

204
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,005
Of course. You were a bad student.

205
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:32,405
-There's something--
-There's something--

206
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,325
You go first.

207
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:41,205
My company wants me to go to Japan.

208
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:42,285
To travel?

209
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:45,085
No, to develop my career there.

210
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:48,165
I may have to transfer to a college there.

211
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,405
-Really?
-Yes.

212
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:52,445
Have you agreed?

213
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,125
Don't worry. I haven't.

214
00:15:58,765 --> 00:15:59,765
Because...

215
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:03,725
Because I want to stay with you.

216
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:08,365
I can draw comics anywhere.

217
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,925
I'm working on a long story now.

218
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,405
It'll be popular
after I finish drawing it.

219
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,165
I don't need to go to Japan.

220
00:16:18,405 --> 00:16:19,645
What were you going to tell me?

221
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:23,805
My agency wants me to go to the States.

222
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,205
A record company on the West Coast
wants to sign me.

223
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:29,965
They want me to debut in the States.

224
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:35,005
They want you to go to the States?

225
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:36,725
Or you want to go to the States?

226
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:39,925
I...

227
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,525
I'm still considering.

228
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:45,485
Still considering? What about me?

229
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:47,325
Why don't you come with me?

230
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,605
Is that your decision after consideration?

231
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,565
Have you considered my situation?

232
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:59,205
SITU FENG LEAVING HIS GIRLFRIEND
FOR THE STATES

233
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,405
His Highness, Situ Feng, admits
that he's leaving to the States

234
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:03,125
but didn't say a word
about his girlfriend.

235
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,405
How ironic.

236
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:13,244
I found out the news about my boyfriend
from the entertainment news.

237
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:16,565
-They made it up.
-Made it up?

238
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:18,124
When were you going to tell me?

239
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:19,724
When you've got your visa

240
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,964
or after you've gone to America?

241
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:24,124
But music is my dream.

242
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:25,645
I didn't say that I was going.

243
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:27,525
Can't you consider my career?

244
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:28,925
Consider your career?

245
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,844
Have you considered me?

246
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:52,845
Kitty Chen.

247
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,605
Why was I so mad?

248
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:01,285
He came over to tell you about it.

249
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:04,725
He was just a bit late.

250
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,605
Did you have to overreact?

251
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,045
But at that moment,

252
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:14,365
he sounded like he was going to leave.

253
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:16,285
He's leaving. Are you leaving too?

254
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:17,685
Come back.

255
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,005
You can't go.

256
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,085
Situ Feng is going to leave.

257
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:26,805
Let me stay in your heart

258
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:30,285
You affected me so deeply

259
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:33,565
I would give you my everything

260
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,005
No matter how it will end

261
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:37,365
The journey is sweet

262
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:40,485
Let me occupy your love

263
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:44,405
Never say no and hide it

264
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:47,205
I won't hesitate to kiss you

265
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:51,925
You'll be my exclusive sweetheart

266
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:07,805
Feng, your music is great.

267
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,645
You're a genius.

268
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:13,765
I hope that our collaboration
will conquer the world.

269
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:15,885
Thank you.

270
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:22,205
Okay. Why the three of you
leave the room first?

271
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:24,485
I'll go through the contract
with Adam again.

272
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,605
-Sure.
-Okay.

273
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,525
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

274
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:38,685
I heard that Adam never gives compliments.

275
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:40,445
Everything is going really well.

276
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:43,765
That's right, Situ Feng.
Have you made up your mind?

277
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:45,805
You will have to make a decision.

278
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:48,445
I...

279
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:51,045
Hold on.

280
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:53,565
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICEMAIL

281
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:54,685
I need to answer a call.

282
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:05,365
Situ Feng.

283
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:07,565
I've thought it through.

284
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:10,245
I shouldn't have thrown a fit at you.

285
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,525
It's your dream after all.

286
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:20,445
I'm perhaps just a passerby in your life.

287
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:23,565
If I care for you,

288
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:26,005
I should support you

289
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:27,965
in pursuing your dream.

290
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:30,925
When you're free,

291
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,485
remember to give me a call.

292
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:37,285
I'll always be here.

293
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:51,565
Ms. Wang said that you could come in.

294
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:52,965
-Okay.
-Okay.

295
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:55,885
Let's go.

296
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,445
So Mr. Situ?

297
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,845
Are you willing to come to the States?

298
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:14,525
I...

299
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:21,885
I'll go to the States.

300
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:45,205
When are you leaving?

301
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:50,005
The day after tomorrow.

302
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:52,965
The day after tomorrow?

303
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:54,445
So soon?

304
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:01,485
Will you come to see me off?

305
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,125
I have a math test on that day.

306
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:18,285
I don't think I can go.

307
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:23,405
But I'm leaving.

308
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:27,685
Aren't you going to see me off?

309
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:34,245
Situ Feng.

310
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,525
Situ Feng.

311
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,565
I don't want to see you off.

312
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:58,885
I just don't want to.

313
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:01,925
I won't be able to do it.

314
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,805
I can't bear to see you leave.

315
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:10,885
Let's say goodbye here.

316
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,125
Situ Feng.

317
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,445
Goodbye.

318
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,285
Everyone, take a look.

319
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:42,405
On the left side of the equal sign,

320
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,885
it's the law of cosine, isn't it?

321
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:47,805
What's on the right then?

322
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:51,325
It's the law of sine, right?

323
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:54,805
Why do we connect them with an equal sign?

324
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:58,005
All the sides are given, right? A and B...

325
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:05,045
Feng, your song "To Be Your Love..."

326
00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:06,965
It's really infectious.

327
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:11,245
Can you share with me
the concept of this creation?

328
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:18,445
I wrote this song

329
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:22,365
for the most important girl in my life.

330
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,365
I've never seen a girl

331
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:28,525
so versatile.

332
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:32,885
She's a math genius.

333
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,365
A champion in Taekwondo.

334
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:38,245
A musician.

335
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:40,365
A comic artist.

336
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:43,725
The female lead in my music video.

337
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:46,845
My number one fan.

338
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,045
FENG

339
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,125
To me, she's also the prettiest girl
on campus.

340
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:52,965
She's kind.

341
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:54,605
Courageous.

342
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,605
Has a strong sense of justice.

343
00:24:57,685 --> 00:24:58,525
Optimistic.

344
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,045
I'm affected

345
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,565
and encouraged

346
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:04,365
by her every move and every word.

347
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:07,685
I can do it.

348
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:10,525
I can do it.

349
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:14,925
I have already fallen deeply in love
with her before I realized it.

350
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:44,365
When I broke all the chains

351
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:46,725
and was about to be bold in love,

352
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:49,005
I found out

353
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:52,725
that we had to part again.

354
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:58,325
I'm so moved.

355
00:25:58,405 --> 00:26:00,485
It reminds me of my first love.

356
00:26:00,565 --> 00:26:02,885
I can't do this. I have to go find her.

357
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:05,605
I have a flight to catch.

358
00:26:06,485 --> 00:26:08,645
Adam, I'm sorry.

359
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:12,125
I made a decision
without following my heart.

360
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:15,845
I can't go to the States with you.

361
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:17,725
I'm sorry.

362
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:39,965
Where's Chen Qingqing?

363
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:42,125
She went to find you.

364
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,405
She said that she wanted
to give you chocolates.

365
00:28:52,725 --> 00:28:55,885
Lights touched your naughty curls

366
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:59,485
Lights kissed on your rosy cheeks

367
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:05,165
Lights quietly lit up
The freckles on your face

368
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,765
When you feel down

369
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:13,645
When you couldn't speak

370
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:16,885
How do I make you smile again?

371
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,925
Get your cuteness back

372
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:38,125
Turning through the alleys

373
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,925
Where we first met

374
00:29:40,005 --> 00:29:42,965
Those absurd moments

375
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:47,845
What is to be anticipated?

376
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:51,565
Let me stay in your heart

377
00:29:51,645 --> 00:29:54,845
You affected me so deeply

378
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:57,845
I would give you my everything

379
00:29:57,925 --> 00:30:00,565
No matter how it will end

380
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:01,805
The journey is sweet

381
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:05,645
Let me occupy your love

382
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:09,005
Never say no and hide it

383
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:11,725
I won't hesitate to kiss you

384
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:15,085
You'll be my exclusive sweetheart

385
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:47,685
Turning through the alleys

386
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,325
Where we first met

387
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:51,645
Those absurd moments

388
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:57,325
What is to be anticipated?

389
00:30:57,765 --> 00:31:01,005
Let me stay in your heart

390
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:04,885
You affected me so deeply

391
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:07,565
I would give you my everything

392
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:10,285
No matter how it will end

393
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:11,725
The journey is sweet

394
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:33,405
Qingqing, no matter what happens,

395
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,205
I'll never leave you.

396
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:41,845
I love you.

397
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:24,165
This is where my story will end.

398
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,765
It has sort of come to an end.

399
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,245
So what do I want to tell you?

400
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:30,885
I want to tell you,

401
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,805
that by running away,
I lost my protection,

402
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:36,405
I lost my loving family,

403
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,325
I lost the look that had accompanied me
the last 18 years.

404
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:40,805
I had enemies.

405
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:42,165
I ran into danger.

406
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:43,685
I made friends.

407
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:45,685
I found love.

408
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:50,125
I even found my true self.

409
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,805
I don't know
whether this story is a cliffhanger

410
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,445
or a comedy.

411
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:58,765
I can only say

412
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:01,445
that sometimes a story doesn't need
to have an ending.

413
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:05,245
It's the same for other people's stories.

414
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:09,285
You will only contradict yourself
if you want to define everything.

415
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:24,125
Lan Xinya is still a mean girl.

416
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:26,445
She said that she'd never
love another man.

417
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:29,405
But the truth is, Hua Munian
has already tamed her.

418
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:33,845
I don't know what happened on their trip.

419
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,525
Why did Hua Munian become
so manly all of a sudden?

420
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:46,325
Lin Yiyang has become really gentle

421
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,685
since he started to date Fangfang.

422
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:52,005
Is this your coffee?

423
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:54,725
Come on.

424
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:57,525
I'm sorry. That's just who he is.

425
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:08,165
How many times have I told you?

426
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:09,965
Don't throw other people's things away.

427
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:11,844
I can't help it.

428
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:15,965
I'm still not used to his change.

429
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:29,045
Gu Nanxi said
that he would never find true love again.

430
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:31,324
But he met someone

431
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,485
who made him feel

432
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:35,125
the effect of slow motion,

433
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:36,485
with a blower

434
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:39,405
and background music.

435
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:42,405
-Nalan Yiyi.
-Hi.

436
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:43,804
Why did you come to Yuncheng?

437
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:45,525
Mr. Chen asked me to pay you a visit.

438
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:47,644
So I decided to transfer
to Ming De College.

439
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:49,605
That's great. Sit down.

440
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:51,005
Let me introduce you.

441
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,885
-This is Gu Nanxi.
-Hi.

442
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:55,284
Situ Feng.

443
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,644
-You've already met him.
-Yes.

444
00:34:58,164 --> 00:34:59,365
Gu Nanxi.

445
00:34:59,684 --> 00:35:01,765
So is your English nickname Nancy?

446
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:10,885
Yiyi, since we seem to get along so well,

447
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:13,085
why don't I show you around the school?

448
00:35:13,165 --> 00:35:14,965
Sure, let's go.

449
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,085
Don't come home tonight.

450
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,165
Let me check on them.

451
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:26,245
As for Situ Feng and me,

452
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:29,045
a publisher is going to publish
my comic book.

453
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:32,085
Becoming a famous comic artist
is happening soon.

454
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:33,765
As for Situ Feng,

455
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,485
ever since he gave up going to the States,

456
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,165
his career has plummeted.

457
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:41,005
He completely depends on me now.

458
00:35:41,365 --> 00:35:44,565
And of course, we have our own kid.

459
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:48,085
He's a family man now.

460
00:35:48,405 --> 00:35:51,565
He stays home and takes care
of our kid every day.

461
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:53,445
HIS CAREER HAS PLUMMETED

462
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,245
Hey, what is this? This is ridiculous.

463
00:35:58,645 --> 00:36:00,765
"My career has plummeted"?

464
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:02,525
My fans have never left me. All right?

465
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:04,605
And about having a child,

466
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:06,925
you told me
that you didn't want a kid so soon.

467
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:08,765
Situ Feng.

468
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:11,925
I have to adapt our story
in order to cater to the market.

469
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,205
Adapt our story.

470
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:16,605
I have to make your life seem miserable.

471
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:19,805
Don't worry. Trust me.
You'll make a strong comeback.

472
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:21,525
I won't accept it.

473
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:24,085
Situ Feng.

474
00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:25,965
I can change it if you don't like it.

475
00:36:26,245 --> 00:36:27,405
I can change the story.

476
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,605
Something like someone
from your agency breaks your leg?

477
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:44,045
ACCIDENTALLY IN LOVE

478
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:49,725
THE END

479
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,605
