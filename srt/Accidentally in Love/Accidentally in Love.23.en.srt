A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,765
EPISODE 23

3
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,725
-I'm all right.
-Didn't you say you were good at drinking?

4
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,245
Was this what you called good at drinking?

5
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,205
Be careful.

6
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,205
I'll call a cab for you.

7
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:11,645
Hey. Be careful.

8
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,765
This seat has been reserved for Qingqing.

9
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:50,885
Is this yours?

10
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:55,445
I'm sorry.

11
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:08,525
Stop.

12
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:14,685
Sit down.

13
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,565
I said sit down.

14
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:49,765
Why are you crying?

15
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:52,765
It's nothing.

16
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:54,725
What can I do for you?

17
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:58,485
I want to study.

18
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:06,405
How do you do this?

19
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:08,045
YOUR DADDY IS HERE, FOOL. BAD.

20
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:17,644
About last time...

21
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,365
I am sorry.

22
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:33,925
Hello, Man. What's up?

23
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,765
Guess what I saw yesterday?

24
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:38,045
Gu Nanxi hugged Chen Qingqing.

25
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,205
What?

26
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,285
I'm still following them.

27
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:42,805
We're at the zoo.
I've already told Situ Feng.

28
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:46,045
Let's reveal Chen Qingqing's
true colors to the world.

29
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:47,885
Okay, I got it.

30
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:53,765
Hey, Lan Xinya.

31
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:56,045
Are you heading for revision now?
Let's go together.

32
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,845
Chen Qingqing and Gu Nanxi
are getting all intimate now.

33
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,605
I don't think I'm going to study.

34
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,405
I'm going to show Feng

35
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,525
that Chen Qingqing
doesn't deserve his love.

36
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:10,045
Wait for me.

37
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:13,645
Thanks for yesterday.

38
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:17,845
If it wasn't for you,
I would be on the news today.

39
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,605
"Young Lady Found Naked and Drunk
on the Streets."

40
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:23,885
Thanks, my friend.

41
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:27,405
Right, you said you had something
to tell me yesterday.

42
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:28,925
What was it?

43
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,885
Never mind, it's no big deal.

44
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,405
Come on.

45
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:37,325
You've already put up
with all my rambling yesterday.

46
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:40,605
Today is my turn.

47
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:42,165
Why don't you let me hear you out?

48
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:47,565
I'm afraid it's not going
to work out for me.

49
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:50,205
How would you know if you don't tell me?

50
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,285
If I were to tell you

51
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,165
the thing which has been bothering me

52
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:01,725
is that I like you,

53
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:05,845
what would you do?

54
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:13,525
Gu Nanxi.

55
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:15,965
Stop joking with me.

56
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:17,885
Do you think...

57
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:20,805
Do you think I'm still drunk?

58
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:23,845
I know

59
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,525
the person you like is Situ Feng.

60
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:30,525
After seeing so many things
happen between the two of you,

61
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:33,445
I've already let go.

62
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:38,445
It doesn't matter if you're Qingchen
or Chen Qingqing.

63
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:41,365
You're one of a kind to me

64
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,845
and you will soon become

65
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:48,405
my friend, Situ Feng's girlfriend.

66
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,285
Let's give each other a hug as friends.

67
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,565
Thank you, Gu Nanxi.

68
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:05,925
Was it true

69
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,405
what you just said?

70
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:13,045
You're actually Qingchen?

71
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:18,325
-Situ Feng, hear me out--
-You don't need to say anything.

72
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:24,045
Calm down, Situ Feng.

73
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,405
It's not what you think.

74
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:30,085
"Not what I think"?

75
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,685
Then what should I think?

76
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:34,845
All I saw was

77
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:37,125
my best friend

78
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,525
and the girl I love

79
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:44,365
treated me like a fool.

80
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:47,685
Tell me.

81
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:51,365
-How is it not what I think?
-Situ Feng.

82
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:53,405
-I didn't--
-Didn't what?

83
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:55,645
You didn't lie to me?

84
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,245
What should I call you?

85
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,365
Chen Qingqing or Miss Qingchen?

86
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,285
Were you ever honest with me?

87
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,285
Fine.

88
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:11,365
She's all yours.

89
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:16,765
Situ Feng, don't go. Listen to me.

90
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:18,565
I didn't mean to lie to you.

91
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,405
I went to look for Gu Nanxi yesterday

92
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:22,925
because I wanted to ask him

93
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:24,805
how should I tell you
about my true identity

94
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,565
so you won't be so angry as you are now.

95
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:29,725
So that's why you two ended up
hugging each other?

96
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:30,645
No.

97
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:38,564
-Situ Feng, let me explain.
-What is there to explain?

98
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,885
Do you mean it was just a casual hug?

99
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:45,325
That it was difficult for you

100
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,965
and even when everyone knew about it,

101
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:49,285
I was the only person
who was kept in the dark?

102
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,445
What are they quarreling about?

103
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:53,965
What true identity?

104
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:56,925
What do you think?

105
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:01,605
Chen Qingqing must have been
being a huge flirt and caused this.

106
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:04,765
Okay, let me explain it.

107
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:08,485
Gu Nanxi and I, we're just friends.

108
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:12,365
That hug you saw
was just a hug between friends.

109
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:15,485
Yes, I did lie to you

110
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:16,965
and I'm sorry about it.

111
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,965
But Situ Feng, I want to tell you

112
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:25,245
that you're the person I like

113
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:27,885
from the very beginning!

114
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,125
Hey.

115
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:34,645
Chen Qingqing.

116
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:41,685
Chen Qingqing, you're so shameless.

117
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:44,085
With all the evidence we have,

118
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,845
how could you carry on lying?

119
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:48,565
Think about it.

120
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:50,085
Ever since school started,

121
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:53,805
you've been involving yourself
with Feng and Nanxi.

122
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:56,925
Plus Hua Munian and Lin Yiyang too.

123
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:58,685
Are you playing a game?

124
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,165
Or are you collecting boyfriends?

125
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:02,605
Hey, my friendship with Qingqing
is as pure as the snow.

126
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,525
Shut up!

127
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:06,765
Hey, Situ Feng!

128
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,285
Chen Qingqing.

129
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:13,045
Feng has finally seen your true colors.

130
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:17,765
If you know the meaning of integrity,

131
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:20,005
please don't bother Feng anymore.

132
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,925
Qingqing, let's go back first.

133
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:36,205
Situ Feng needs time to calm down.

134
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,525
I will explain to him.

135
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,845
You're not completely sober
from yesterday.

136
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:42,405
I'll send you home.

137
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,845
It's okay.

138
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:49,645
I can go back on my own.

139
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:05,325
Qingqing, are you not feeling well?

140
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,405
You look tired.

141
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:12,685
Fangfang, I need to tell you a secret.

142
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:14,045
What's the secret?

143
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:16,525
Actually,

144
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:18,965
I'm Qingchen.

145
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:22,125
Qingchen is me.

146
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,565
What?

147
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,565
Are you really Qingchen?

148
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:37,725
My real name is Chen Qingqing.

149
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:42,045
I was trying to escape
from my grandpa's bodyguards.

150
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,965
That's why I switched my identity.

151
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,165
Fangfang, I lied to you.

152
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:51,445
Are you mad at me?

153
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,805
Silly girl, of course not.

154
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,565
Fangfang, what a relief!

155
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:03,405
Actually, I can understand it.

156
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,085
You must have your own reasons.

157
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:07,925
Thanks for understanding

158
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:13,885
but some might not take it well
like you, right?

159
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,125
Are you talking about Situ Feng?

160
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:22,445
Don't worry. He's so fond of you.

161
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:23,605
I'm sure he'll come around.

162
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,685
Fangfang, what are you talking about?

163
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,845
You think I didn't know
what's up with you and Lin Yiyang?

164
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:30,445
-We--
-The two of you

165
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:32,565
have been swapping outfits
all the time.

166
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:33,765
I've already seen it twice.

167
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:37,205
-What are you talking about, Qingqing?
-It's true, I saw it with my own eyes!

168
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:54,045
What's wrong, Chen Qingqing?

169
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:55,405
Why are you so quiet?

170
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:58,525
Don't you know how to greet someone?

171
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,925
If I see a decent human being,

172
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:05,805
I will greet her.

173
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:11,605
I didn't know you're capable

174
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,645
of being sarcastic.

175
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,245
Tomorrow is the exam.

176
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,845
If you have nothing else to say,
please don't waste my time.

177
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,805
Yes, our examinations
will be starting tomorrow.

178
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,845
Feng will be present as well.

179
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:27,205
I'm warning you.

180
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:28,765
Do not disturb him.

181
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:30,645
Do not talk to him.

182
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:32,205
Do not affect him during examinations.

183
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:36,045
I will talk to whoever I want to talk to.

184
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,405
Why should I listen to you?

185
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,325
You should because Situ Feng
and I grew up together

186
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,605
and he promised
to take care of me forever.

187
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:45,925
What?

188
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,365
Feng promised to take care of me forever.

189
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:54,605
It's not going to happen
between the two of you.

190
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:02,805
Lan Xinya, do you think
I will believe you?

191
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:08,365
It doesn't matter
if you believe me or not.

192
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:11,165
You're living in a different world
compared to Feng.

193
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:12,965
It's worlds apart.

194
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:17,085
Feng is a simple guy.

195
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:18,325
He's an affectionate person.

196
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,685
People like you
who likes to flirt with every guy...

197
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:25,965
I hope you'll quickly disappear
from my sight.

198
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:28,845
Lan Xinya.

199
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:31,525
Do yourself a favor. Keep your mouth shut.

200
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,285
Wasn't that the case?

201
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:36,845
First, it was Feng, then Gu Nanxi.

202
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:38,645
Two-timing in a relationship,

203
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:42,125
do you think it's charming?

204
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:44,205
Ugly people like to do strange things.

205
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:47,045
Listen up.

206
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,885
Feng is an only child.

207
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:52,045
He should date someone
from a compatible family.

208
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,485
A materialistic person like you,

209
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,165
I beg of you.

210
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:58,245
Just get lost already.

211
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,605
You know what?

212
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,525
You're right, I am materialistic.

213
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,005
That's why I approached Situ Feng.

214
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:12,565
How's that? Are you satisfied?

215
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,165
But...

216
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:18,805
It looks like Situ Feng
would rather fall for me,

217
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,645
someone who's materialistic

218
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:22,685
than to give a damn about you.

219
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,325
Doesn't it drive you crazy?

220
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:27,485
Last but not least,

221
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,885
Situ Feng is mine.

222
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:39,725
Since you've admitted to it,
I have nothing else to say.

223
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,045
Girls, let's go.

224
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,205
Situ Feng,

225
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,405
can we talk?

226
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:41,805
Talk about what?

227
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,325
Actually...

228
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:47,245
It was not my intention

229
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:50,965
to deceive you.

230
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:51,885
It was because--

231
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:53,125
You know what?

232
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:56,285
You're right, I am materialistic.

233
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,685
That's why I approached Situ Feng.

234
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,365
How's that? Are you satisfied?

235
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,405
But...

236
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:06,685
It looks like Situ Feng
would rather fall for me,

237
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:08,964
someone who's materialistic

238
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,844
than to give a damn about you.

239
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:12,324
Doesn't it drive you crazy?

240
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,204
Last but not least,

241
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:17,685
Situ Feng

242
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:19,964
is mine.

243
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:22,604
Situ Feng, don't listen to it.

244
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,844
I said those things because--

245
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:29,485
Chen Qingqing,
there's nothing else for us to talk about.

246
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:31,045
I gave you my heart

247
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:34,845
and you trampled on it.

248
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,165
You made me feel like I'm a joke.

249
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:55,645
That's why I approached Situ Feng.

250
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:58,085
How's that? Are you satisfied?

251
00:17:58,885 --> 00:17:59,725
But...

252
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,805
-What are you doing, Hua Munian?
-Get over here.

253
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,645
Gosh, you're hurting me.

254
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:12,725
You need to apologize
to Chen Qingqing now.

255
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:15,445
Apologize?

256
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,125
Why should I apologize to her?

257
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,445
She said everything herself.

258
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,525
I'm just letting people know about it.

259
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:24,965
If it wasn't for you,

260
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:27,445
would Chen Qingqing say those things?

261
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:31,405
I don't understand.

262
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:34,085
What is it about Chen Qingqing?

263
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,445
What did she do to all of you?

264
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:40,685
Why is everyone siding with her?

265
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:43,565
Why are you protecting her?

266
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:45,485
Because she's my friend!

267
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,525
I trust her!

268
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,005
Is that what you think of me?

269
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:56,045
Am I such a horrible person?

270
00:18:58,485 --> 00:18:59,565
I am horrible.

271
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,085
I did all the bad things.

272
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:04,325
Are you happy?

273
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:06,965
If she's your friend,

274
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,845
then what about me?

275
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:18,685
You're different, you're...

276
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:48,365
Situ Feng.

277
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:52,805
Gu Nanxi, let go of me!

278
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:58,565
Situ Feng, you're not a fool.

279
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,405
Don't believe everything you heard
on the recordings.

280
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:06,445
Why? Why shouldn't I believe it?

281
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:08,925
Should I believe you
and Chen Qingqing instead?

282
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:13,045
You're right, I'm a fool
who's not sure what to believe in.

283
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:14,925
We didn't lie to you.

284
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,125
Didn't lie to me?

285
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:17,845
Then tell me.

286
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:20,205
When did you find out that Chen Qingqing
was Qingchen?

287
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:24,045
You can't answer me, can you?

288
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:26,205
Let me guess.

289
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:29,485
Every time I tried to hook you up
with Qingchen,

290
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,045
I wonder what were you thinking?

291
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,365
Every time when I poured my heart out
for Chen Qingqing,

292
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,125
I wonder what were you thinking?

293
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:37,765
Gu Nanxi.

294
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:39,485
I thought you were my best friend!

295
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:44,445
You are my best friend!

296
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,565
You're not my friend!

297
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:55,965
Can you wake up, Situ Feng?

298
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,365
I said it's not what you think!

299
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,405
No wonder you used to ask me
if we would end up fighting.

300
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:04,205
So this was what you meant.

301
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:07,805
You were preparing yourself
for today, am I right?

302
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,045
I was a fool

303
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:13,525
because I believed in the two of you!

304
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:18,245
Situ Feng.

305
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,045
Do you still remember how we met?

306
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:27,245
I was eight years old
and a transfer student.

307
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,685
Everyone knew I was an illegitimate child.

308
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:33,285
No one wanted to play with me.

309
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,045
It was the saddest
and loneliest time of my life.

310
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,005
It was you

311
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,445
who came to talk to me first.

312
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:46,405
You were the first person
who wanted to play with me.

313
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:52,005
Ever since then, I've always

314
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,565
thought you as my best friend.

315
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,405
I admit.

316
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:01,445
I did fall for Qingchen,

317
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:04,885
but after I found out who she really was,

318
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:07,245
I decided to let go of my feelings

319
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:13,725
because I would never betray
my best friend!

320
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:18,805
Do you think everything Chen Qingqing
has done for you were all lies?

321
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:22,685
That's all I'm going to say.

322
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:24,925
You can think about the rest yourself.

323
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,605
EXAM RESULTS AND RANKING

324
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,165
Hey, how did you do?

325
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:41,765
-It was just average.
-Did you make it?

326
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:42,685
How did you do?

327
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:43,965
-Look, who's that?
-Me too.

328
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:47,125
Lin Yiyang? Isn't he the guy
who always failed his exams?

329
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,005
I can't believe he made it
into the top 100.

330
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:50,845
Could it have been a mistake?

331
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:00,685
What are you reading?

332
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:03,765
If you're able to score well
for your exams

333
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:05,165
and make it into top 100,

334
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:06,245
I will tell you.

335
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:10,685
Deal.

336
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:18,125
Lin Yiyang seems like a different person.

337
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,725
I heard before the exams started,

338
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:21,205
he studied at the library every day.

339
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:22,605
Are you sure?

340
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:41,045
Look, it's Lin Yiyang.

341
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:44,325
He used to look so fierce
and unapproachable.

342
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,045
I didn't know he was good looking.

343
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:47,845
Are you interested in him?

344
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:50,045
Of course not, a guy like him

345
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:52,325
is too much for me to handle.

346
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:54,845
It's better for me to look
from a distance.

347
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,805
It's good that you know your limits.

348
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:20,845
Hi, Hebiancao. I am Situ Feng's manager.

349
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:24,125
I would like to invite you to take part
in His Highness's next album packaging.

350
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:27,285
Your comic strips will be included
into the album.

351
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:28,285
Please let us know.

352
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:34,005
If Situ Feng finds out
about my third identity,

353
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:38,605
and finds out that I was the one
who drew those funny things about him...

354
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,285
Wouldn't he kill me?

355
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:44,805
What should I do?

356
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:51,245
That's odd. It was such a good offer.

357
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,645
Why hasn't she responded yet?

358
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,245
Were my messages not sent?

359
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:57,365
Maybe.

360
00:24:59,005 --> 00:24:59,845
Well...

361
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,525
Hey, we managed to solve the case.

362
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,045
Why are you still looking so gloomy?

363
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,205
This new album
is a top-quality production.

364
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:12,525
It contains comic strips
from your number one supporter

365
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:15,365
plus the handshake coupon.

366
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:17,285
It's going to become a hot topic

367
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,285
and it's definitely
going to become a huge hit.

368
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:20,245
That's right.

369
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:23,525
During my time, where could you
have found such a great deal?

370
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,725
All right.

371
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:26,605
Tell me about your plans.

372
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:30,925
Why don't you personally invite Hebiancao?

373
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:31,885
What?

374
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,365
Hi, Hebiancao.

375
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:46,765
I'm Situ Feng.

376
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,445
Thank you for your support.

377
00:25:48,645 --> 00:25:50,765
I hope to be working with you
on my new album.

378
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:53,125
Please let me know
when you've seen my video.

379
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:56,405
Situ Feng.

380
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,965
Why are you so persistent?

381
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:06,685
Why does it feel like a Cinderella story?

382
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:10,005
I haven't seen Hebiancao online
for several days.

383
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:11,085
If she heard about this

384
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:13,245
I'm sure she's going to be overjoyed.

385
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:15,725
Could it be that something happened?

386
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:16,685
I'm worried too.

387
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:18,205
I heard she once mentioned

388
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,765
that her college is in Yuncheng?

389
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,645
Lei, you can check her IP address.

390
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:24,525
Wow, these people.

391
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,845
Are they trying to drive me to the edge?

392
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:29,045
If I don't agree to work with Situ Feng,

393
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,205
they're probably going
to find out all of my secrets.

394
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:37,285
Whatever! We shall wait and see.

395
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:48,965
Qingqing, why are you up so early?

396
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:54,005
Fangfang, your happiness
is in your own hands.

397
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:57,245
Now, I'm going to create my own history.

398
00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:00,045
You have to work hard
to seize your own happiness.

399
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,165
Let's do it!

400
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:20,685
Are you Hebiancao?

401
00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:23,325
Your Highness!

402
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:25,365
He's our boss.

403
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:28,365
Do you think anyone can be his girlfriend?

404
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:31,845
Why did you jump on the bandwagon?
You're so silly.

405
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:36,165
Do you know there's a clock tower
in our college?

406
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:38,205
Legend has it that if you enter
the clock tower

407
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:40,205
and express your regrets sincerely,

408
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:43,485
the clock will turn anti-clockwise
if it is touched by your sincerity.

409
00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:44,725
You can talk?

410
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,605
