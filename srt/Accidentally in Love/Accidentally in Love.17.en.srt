A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:58,005
EPISODE 17

3
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:04,565
When I was little,

4
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:07,645
my mom gave me this guitar pick.

5
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:11,805
I turned it into a necklace,
hoping it'd bring me good luck.

6
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:13,405
Now, I'm giving it to you.

7
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,525
Thank you, Situ Feng.

8
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:19,125
I promise to cherish it for you.

9
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:25,445
Chen Qingqing!

10
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:28,605
Did you celebrate your birthday
with Feng last night?

11
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:29,605
So what if I did?

12
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:31,125
How many times have I warned you?

13
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,365
-Don't seduce Feng anymore!
-Hey, Xinya.

14
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,525
What are you doing?

15
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:36,165
Hey, what's going on?

16
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:37,965
What are you looking at me for?

17
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,085
Feng.

18
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:42,365
Why did you celebrate her birthday
without telling me?

19
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:43,565
Xinya.

20
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,365
Come on. Qingqing and I--

21
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,085
Stop defending her.

22
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:50,965
Chen Qingqing.

23
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,485
You're really, really, really annoying!

24
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:55,445
Xinya.

25
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:56,645
You've gone too far.

26
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:02,085
You didn't just say that.

27
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:10,085
Xinya.

28
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,365
Yiyang.

29
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:34,725
Xinya, what are you doing here?

30
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:38,085
I used to come here in the past
to watch you and Feng play basketball.

31
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:49,725
Here.

32
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,965
You still remember
that I liked to drink this?

33
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:56,325
Yes.

34
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:57,765
In glass bottles.

35
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:03,125
But someone
might've already forgotten about it.

36
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:08,965
Did someone bully you?

37
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,285
Do you think

38
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,245
Feng doesn't like me anymore?

39
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:18,725
That's not possible.

40
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:22,964
Then why does he act so indifferent
toward me?

41
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,245
I won the Miss Campus contest.

42
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,325
He had no intention to celebrate with me.

43
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,005
Instead, he was worried

44
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,645
about Chen Qingqing's birthday.

45
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:38,525
There's more.

46
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,725
He even scolded me
because of Chen Qingqing.

47
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,165
We grew up together.

48
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:52,685
But ever since Chen Qingqing showed up,

49
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:55,325
we've drifted apart.

50
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,765
I feel like I'm such a failure.

51
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:06,765
Come on, Xinya.

52
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:08,645
Stop crying.

53
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:28,325
-We need to get water.
-That's right.

54
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:29,525
Chen Qingqing!

55
00:05:30,405 --> 00:05:31,485
-Lin Yiyang.
-Lin Yiyang.

56
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:35,765
What do you want?

57
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,205
I'm warning you.

58
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,605
Stay away from Situ Feng from now on.

59
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,085
Hey.

60
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:43,685
Your words were rather confusing.

61
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:46,045
Why should I stay away from him?

62
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,685
Stop pretending, all right?

63
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,445
Everyone knows that you two are close.

64
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,845
Whatever goes on between us
is none of your business.

65
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:53,685
Xinya's business is my business.

66
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:55,565
I'm not going to let her get hurt.

67
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,165
It's about Lan Xinya again.

68
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:00,405
You guys are so annoying.

69
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:01,965
I'm not in the mood to deal with her.

70
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,485
Fangfang, let's go.

71
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:05,685
Hey, Lin Yiyang!

72
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,565
Stop it. This might just
be a misunderstanding.

73
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:08,925
This is none of your business.

74
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,245
Hey.

75
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:19,005
Isn't this Situ Feng's necklace?

76
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,125
Why is it with you?

77
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,365
Who says you can touch it?

78
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:25,805
Hey.

79
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,845
Qingqing!

80
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:30,605
Qingqing.

81
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:31,885
Qingqing.

82
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:35,485
-Are you all right?
-My neck.

83
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,365
Let's go to the infirmary.

84
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:47,645
Fangfang, the necklace.

85
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:54,885
Goodness.

86
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:59,405
Is it really that serious?

87
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,325
Do I need to wear this?

88
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:02,765
Don't touch it.

89
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:05,165
Just stay here and get some rest.
Don't worry.

90
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,805
I'm all right.

91
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,565
I'll be alive and kicking

92
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,965
after I get this damn thing off tomorrow.

93
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:15,365
How could you still be laughing
after what happened?

94
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:19,125
By the way, Fangfang,

95
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,605
you can't let Situ Feng know
about what happened.

96
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,925
More importantly,
you must not let him know

97
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,125
that this has something to do
with Lin Yiyang.

98
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:28,965
I'm scared that he might start a fight
with Lin Yiyang.

99
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,365
-We must keep it from him--
-Chen Qingqing.

100
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:35,365
What happened?

101
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:36,525
How did you get hurt?

102
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:37,685
It was an accident.

103
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:38,645
I fell.

104
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,805
Was it an accident? Look at you.

105
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,165
I really did fall.

106
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,125
Tell me. Was it Lin Yiyang?

107
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:47,685
No.

108
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,965
This has nothing to do with Lin Yiyang.

109
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:51,405
I see.

110
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:53,645
Hey, Situ Feng.

111
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:55,005
Situ Feng!

112
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:01,445
Ye Bei, look at this new equipment
that I got.

113
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,565
Dalei.

114
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:03,725
A petrol tank.

115
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:05,085
This is dangerous.

116
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,085
Look.

117
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,485
This is helium.

118
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:10,845
It will create a magical effect
when people inhale it.

119
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,485
What kind of magical effect?

120
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:19,325
If people inhale this gas,

121
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:21,765
their voice will sound especially funny.

122
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:24,685
And they will also feel drowsy.

123
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,805
Who knows what might happen

124
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,565
when people are fuzzy-headed?

125
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:39,284
Be quiet!

126
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:50,805
Lin Yiyang!

127
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:54,205
Lin Yiyang!

128
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,485
-Situ Feng, what are you doing here?
-Cut the crap.

129
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:01,525
Didn't I tell you?
Don't lay your hands on Chen Qingqing.

130
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:02,605
There's no need to reason

131
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:04,285
with someone like you.

132
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,365
Is that so?

133
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:07,245
I'm not going to reason with you either.

134
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:18,005
Dalei, Yiyang is fighting with Situ Feng.

135
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,685
Should we help him?

136
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:21,925
Yiyang is strong.

137
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:24,285
He will definitely
take him down right away.

138
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:38,405
Yiyang, I've got him.

139
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:39,725
Hurry up. He's all yours.

140
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:48,925
I'm the one you want.

141
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:02,565
Hey, Ye Bei, Dalei!

142
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:04,405
They must have done something wrong.

143
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:06,965
How could you say that in front of us?

144
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,285
Can't you speak Mandarin?
What the hell? Let's go.

145
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,645
Hey!

146
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:16,045
Stop fighting!

147
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,165
Lin Yiyang, knock it off.

148
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:20,725
Qingqing.

149
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:22,845
You shouldn't be here.
Your neck is injured.

150
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:23,885
I'm fine.

151
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,565
Situ Feng.

152
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:27,245
I'm teaching you a lesson
in front of Qingqing.

153
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:29,605
Lin Yiyang, you must apologize now.

154
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:33,005
Apologize? No way!

155
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,485
Qingqing, what's going on?

156
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,805
I have no idea.

157
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,965
I know.

158
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:44,005
That tank.

159
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,885
That tank is leaking.

160
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:47,925
It must contain helium.

161
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,085
That's why our voice changed.

162
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,285
Inhaling too much of it
will cause hypoxia.

163
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,565
That's right. What should we do?

164
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:56,765
Hey, Situ Feng!

165
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:21,565
Fangfang!

166
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:23,685
Fangfang!

167
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:24,885
Are you all right, Fangfang?

168
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:27,125
Situ Feng.

169
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,645
Don't just stand there. Give me a hand.

170
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:30,685
Fangfang.

171
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:33,125
Fangfang.

172
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,365
What are you waiting for?

173
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:35,925
Situ Feng!

174
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:37,845
Situ Feng!

175
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:42,925
Fangfang, hang in there.

176
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:53,885
Zhang Fangfang.

177
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:55,565
Why did you help me

178
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,405
that time?

179
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:08,085
Lin Yiyang.

180
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,605
Since you're awake,
would you like something to eat?

181
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:13,045
No.

182
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:14,885
Suit yourself.

183
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,205
Qingqing.

184
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,205
Did I wake you up?

185
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,245
It's all right.

186
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:24,765
What happened?

187
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:26,525
It's nothing serious.

188
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:27,725
You hurt your arm.

189
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:30,165
But don't worry.
The doctor has taken care of it.

190
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:31,405
All you need to do now

191
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,805
is to get lots of rest
and change the dressing frequently.

192
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,405
You will be fine in two days.

193
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:37,245
Let me help you get up.

194
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:39,685
I've bought you something to eat.

195
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:41,325
Eat slowly.

196
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:52,485
Don't ever do that again. It's dangerous.

197
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:55,805
Shouldn't someone show gratitude

198
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:58,125
to his lifesaver

199
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,125
since she's awake now?

200
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,005
Have some more.

201
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,245
Yiyang, are you all right?

202
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:17,045
I came here as soon as I heard
that you're in the hospital.

203
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:18,565
I'm fine. Don't worry.

204
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,205
Why are you two here?

205
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:27,005
Because we had to rescue Yiyang.

206
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:28,045
Why don’t you ask him?

207
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:29,485
Yiyang.

208
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,045
What happened?

209
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,285
It's hard to explain everything now.

210
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:35,605
Have some more.

211
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,445
Zhang Fangfang, did you do it on purpose?

212
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:41,485
Does she have a thing for you, Yiyang?

213
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:43,085
What are you talking about?

214
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:46,685
Lan Xinya, stop talking nonsense.

215
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:48,645
Believe it or not, I will throw you out.

216
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,405
Would you hurt yourself
in order to rescue someone?

217
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:55,285
Well, some poor people
like to extort money from others.

218
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:58,125
They find wealthy people
and blackmail them.

219
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,885
Just tell us how much money you want.

220
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,125
Stop being pretentious.

221
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:03,045
-Xinya.
-I'm not.

222
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,445
Lan Xinya, get out now!

223
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:07,365
Xinya.

224
00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:09,885
Let's go for a walk.

225
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:11,405
Give me a hand.

226
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:13,445
Hold on. I'll get a wheelchair.

227
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,325
Fangfang, just ignore her.

228
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:20,165
How did it go, Gu Nanxi?

229
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:23,605
Could you get in touch with him?

230
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,445
I've already called him several times.

231
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,085
I couldn't get hold of him.

232
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:29,285
What happened to Situ Feng today?

233
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:32,085
Did he merely get into a fight
with Lin Yiyang?

234
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,565
Yes. By the time I got there,

235
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:35,445
the two of them
had already started fighting.

236
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,685
Then, Fangfang got hurt.

237
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,205
I told him to give me a hand.

238
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:39,925
Later, I took Fangfang to the hospital.

239
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,565
I tried to contact him afterward,
but I couldn't reach him at all.

240
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:43,805
So I immediately called you.

241
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:47,045
When you were there,
did you notice anything unusual?

242
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,605
There was nothing unusual.

243
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:53,765
There was a lot of helium in the room.

244
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:56,485
If people breathe in too much helium,
they'll suffer from hypoxia.

245
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:58,845
-Hypoxia?
-Yes.

246
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,045
That's it.

247
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:02,925
What is it?

248
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:05,645
Gu Nanxi.

249
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:07,565
You know something, don't you?

250
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:08,525
Tell me.

251
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:12,325
Qingqing, we need to find Situ Feng
as soon as possible.

252
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:15,725
This isn't the first time he disappeared.

253
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:17,165
The last time he disappeared,

254
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:18,765
He was gone for three days.

255
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,645
We couldn't find him anywhere.

256
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:23,645
We didn't know what he went through.

257
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,845
He passed out as soon as he came back.

258
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,005
How could that happen?

259
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,405
Me, Situ Feng,

260
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:31,525
Lin Yiyang...

261
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:33,685
We were childhood friends.

262
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,645
At that time, we had another friend.

263
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,445
It was Lan Xinya's sister.

264
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,565
Her name was Lan Xinyu.

265
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:44,725
-Lan Xinyu?
-That's right.

266
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:48,125
Situ Feng and Lan Xinyu had an accident.

267
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,005
The two of them fell into the water.

268
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,645
Situ Feng was rescued,

269
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:56,165
but Xinyu wasn't.

270
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,525
Later, Situ Feng disappeared

271
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:01,525
from Xinyu's funeral.

272
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,205
-You said that he might have hypoxia?
-Yes.

273
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:06,925
The situation might be similar
to drowning.

274
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,445
It could have reminded him of the trauma.

275
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,645
Would he do something stupid?

276
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:15,645
We should go look for Situ Feng now.

277
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,205
Do you know where he might go?

278
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:20,405
-I don't know.
-You two grew up together.

279
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:22,845
Was there a place where you used to go
all the time?

280
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,605
Think about it really hard.

281
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:28,405
Situ Feng.

282
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,365
You have to be safe.

283
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:41,685
Situ Feng, give me a hand.

284
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,125
Qingqing, I...

285
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:02,845
Gu Nanxi.

286
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:04,765
-Let's go.
-Not just yet.

287
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:05,765
Hold on a second.

288
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:07,525
I've asked a friend to come help us.

289
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,805
It's better to be discreet
about this matter.

290
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:12,124
I called Hua Munian. He's very reliable.

291
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:14,005
Baby, I'm here.

292
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:16,005
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,685
I take back what I've said.

294
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,084
-Hey.
-Come here.

295
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,484
What's wrong with you?

296
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:24,364
Why did you bring
that troublemaker with you?

297
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,165
It's not my fault.

298
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,805
She was in the office when you called me.

299
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,285
She threatened to tell everyone.

300
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:32,685
-There was nothing I could do.
-What the hell?

301
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:36,205
Don't worry.

302
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:37,925
I didn't tell anyone.

303
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:39,685
Feng's business is my business.

304
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:41,485
I will definitely find him.

305
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:44,085
All right. Everyone has arrived.

306
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:45,725
Then I'll start distributing tasks.

307
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,485
Qingqing and I are a team.

308
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:49,485
Hua Munian, you'll pair up with Xinya.

309
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:52,285
Let's try to think of all the places
that Situ Feng might go

310
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:54,845
and notify each other
of the places that we've searched.

311
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:57,245
This will save us a lot of time.
Do you have any questions?

312
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,165
-No.
-No.

313
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:01,085
Gosh. It's rare that you two
can agree on something.

314
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,125
-We'll go first.
-Okay.

315
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,285
Qingqing, we should get going too.

316
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:20,245
Just relax.

317
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,365
We will look for him again later.

318
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:29,765
Did Situ Feng come here often in the past?

319
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:35,245
This is the only 24-hour coffee shop
in Yuncheng.

320
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:36,885
My sister liked to come here.

321
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:40,125
She introduced this place to Feng and me.

322
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:42,605
Later, Feng,

323
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,245
also took me here.

324
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,125
Situ Feng took you on a date here.

325
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,445
How romantic.

326
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:54,125
Xinya.

327
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:55,725
What's the matter? Don't scare me.

328
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,405
I know

329
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,125
that Feng took me here

330
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:04,005
out of the guilt he felt for my sister.

331
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:06,805
He wanted to take care of me
for my sister.

332
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:08,885
It wasn't love.

333
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:15,365
But I've gotten used
to being taken care of.

334
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:17,285
I can't let him go.

335
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:20,885
I want to be with him forever.

336
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:24,005
It doesn’t matter,

337
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:26,685
if he doesn’t like me.

338
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,605
Xinya, you...

339
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:36,285
Be good. Stop crying.

340
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,245
Hello?

341
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,925
We're in a coffee shop.

342
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:51,405
Where are you?

343
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,605
Not yet.

344
00:19:59,005 --> 00:19:59,925
Hua Munian.

345
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:02,885
Hurry and finish your drink.
We'll start looking for him again.

346
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:04,125
Roger that.

347
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:10,685
Qingqing.

348
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:13,245
You don't look well.

349
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,325
Should I take you to the hospital?

350
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:16,565
That's not necessary.

351
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:17,925
I'm fine.

352
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,285
Why don't I take you back to school?

353
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:25,845
All right.

354
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,325
Don't worry too much about Situ Feng.

355
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,405
I'll find him for you.

356
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,085
Situ Feng.

357
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:38,725
Where are you?

358
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:40,765
Are you all right?

359
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:44,565
Feng.

360
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:45,645
Come here.

361
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,285
I'll teach you how to play the piano.

362
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,405
Xinyu!

363
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:19,325
Where did you go?

364
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:35,925
Situ Feng.

365
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:37,805
Situ Feng.

366
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:42,565
You really are here.

367
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,285
Did you spend the night here?

368
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:54,245
Hey, Situ Feng.

369
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:57,965
You didn't answer my calls
or replied to my messages.

370
00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:59,965
Are you seriously going to ignore me?

371
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:01,005
If you ignore me,

372
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,245
I'm going to leave.

373
00:22:06,845 --> 00:22:07,725
Qingqing.

374
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:09,645
Don't go.

375
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:15,725
Then promise me.

376
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:17,765
Don't ever disappear again.

377
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:21,325
Why are your hands so cold?

378
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:30,525
Here. Drink some hot water.

379
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:42,925
Qingqing.

380
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,125
I didn't mean to do that.

381
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,045
Fangfang...

382
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:50,125
How is she?

383
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,325
She's in the hospital now.

384
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,965
She will have to stay there
for a couple of days.

385
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:58,885
Situ Feng.

386
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:03,405
When I called for you last night,

387
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:06,245
why did you run away?

388
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:08,045
I...

389
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:12,165
I...

390
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:15,205
I felt like...

391
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:18,125
I was drowning.

392
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:22,365
Then...

393
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:26,365
Then...

394
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,725
I...

395
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,085
I saw...

396
00:23:30,765 --> 00:23:31,685
I saw...

397
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:34,045
Lan Xinyu?

398
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,485
When we were looking for you today,

399
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,885
Gu Nanxi told me

400
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,085
about the last time you disappeared.

401
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:50,685
Last night,

402
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:53,765
I saw Xinyu.

403
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,165
I was so frightened.

404
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:04,045
I was the one who hurt her.

405
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,525
It was only an illusion.

406
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:07,725
You didn't hurt anyone.

407
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:08,965
It was an accident.

408
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,165
No, it wasn't.

409
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:13,045
If I didn't try to be a hero,

410
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:14,965
Xinyu

411
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:16,765
wouldn't have died.

412
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:24,845
Feng.

413
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:26,445
I'm a better driver than you.

414
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:27,725
I'll drive Xinyu home today.

415
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:30,685
Yiyang, you're being too subjective
about our driving skills.

416
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:32,325
Xinyu should be the one who decides.

417
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:33,965
I can't make a decision.

418
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:35,965
Why don't you two fight it out?

419
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:38,085
Whoever wins will drive Xinyu home.

420
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:40,805
-All right.
-I'll stay with you if I lose.

421
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:41,805
Sure.

422
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:42,725
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

423
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:49,765
I won!

424
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:51,605
Hey!

425
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:52,845
You played dirty!

426
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,645
Feng, aren't you driving a bit too fast?

427
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:09,245
It's all right.
There aren't many cars on the road.

428
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:03,245
Situ Feng.

429
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:06,485
It was an accident.

430
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:09,965
You didn't want that to happen either.

431
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:13,045
I believe that

432
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,925
Lan Xinyu is in heaven now

433
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:17,165
and would want you to live happily.

434
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:19,205
She cared so much about you.

435
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:22,325
She would only want

436
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:24,685
to leave you with good memories,

437
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:27,125
not nightmares.

438
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:32,005
Situ Feng.

439
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:33,445
You know what?

440
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:35,925
In my heart,

441
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:38,805
you're always a very brave person.

442
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,885
You always face difficulties with courage.

443
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:43,565
So,

444
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:46,445
stop blaming yourself.

445
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:55,565
Chen Qingqing.

446
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,565
Will you always stay by my side?

447
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:02,005
Will you never leave me?

448
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:07,885
I didn't mean to hurt Fangfang.

449
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:11,085
She's your best friend.

450
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:14,925
I'm scared.

451
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,645
I don't want to lose
the most important person to me again.

452
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:35,805
That scared the hell out of me.

453
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:38,725
I didn't know what it was.

454
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,725
It probably ran away.

455
00:27:42,885 --> 00:27:44,725
Thank God, it's gone.

456
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,005
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

457
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:51,525
This place has a lot of tillandsias.

458
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,725
So there are quite
a lot of spiders around.

459
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:55,925
Do you mind?

460
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,605
What's the meaning of tillandsia?

461
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:06,885
They are wild plants.

462
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:08,965
They don't have any meanings.

463
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:11,725
This kind of plant

464
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:15,845
who has broken free
from the constraint of soil

465
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:17,685
deserves a meaning.

466
00:28:18,885 --> 00:28:20,405
For example,

467
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:22,285
the pursuit of freedom.

468
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,605
-Freedom?
-Yes.

469
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:30,125
It fits you.

470
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:35,565
Freedom is wonderful.

471
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,005
We're from two different worlds.

472
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:12,765
We should stay away from each other.

473
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,485
What's wrong with me?

474
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:17,965
Can you just turn into a ball? Roll out!

475
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:19,925
I wouldn't let you go

476
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,405
because I was too stubborn.

477
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,605
He can't even do a commercial.
How can he earn money for the agency?

478
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,045
Ms. Wang.

479
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:29,405
I will do it.

480
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:31,445
You'll have to get into the water.

481
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:33,645
Situ Feng, wake up.

482
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:39,445
I can't lose you.

483
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,005
Qingqing!

484
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:44,005
