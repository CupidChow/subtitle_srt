00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:35,765
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:58,605
EPISODE 14

3
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,085
Chen Qingqing, what are you drawing?

4
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:35,485
Qingqing.

5
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:37,685
Look, there's meteor shower.

6
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:39,725
-Hey, Situ Feng!
-Hey.

7
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:51,005
Why are you drawing cartoons of me?

8
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:55,565
This was something I saw online,
drawn by one of your fans.

9
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:56,885
I‘m just copying her drawing.

10
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:59,445
I didn't mean to offend you.

11
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,485
These are drawings of people
not wearing clothes.

12
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:08,565
Is that me and Gu Nanxi?

13
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:10,125
What's that?

14
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,205
-Let me have a look.
-Get lost.

15
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:31,645
Hey!

16
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,245
Please stop looking.

17
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,285
Why?

18
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,805
The drawings on the few last pages

19
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,965
are mostly of how attentive
you are in class

20
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:43,485
and how great you are at maths.

21
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:47,005
Which are different qualities from
the idol image you're trying to portray.

22
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,405
Qingqing.

23
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,325
Come with me to my office.

24
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,204
Have a good chat.

25
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:29,965
Grandpa.

26
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:32,925
What brought you here?

27
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,045
Qingqing.

28
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:36,925
Look what have you turned into.

29
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:38,445
You've got to come home with me!

30
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,685
I don't want to go back with you.

31
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:44,005
There's a limit to being rebellious.

32
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,725
Look at yourself now.

33
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:48,085
You could've lived a comfortable life
as an heiress,

34
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:49,605
but yet you chose to stoop so low!

35
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,765
Grandpa, what do you mean
by stooping so low?

36
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:54,405
For these past few months,

37
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:56,605
although I'm not under your supervision

38
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:59,165
and I don't look as pretty as before,

39
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,085
but do you know

40
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:03,125
that this is the first time in my life

41
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,645
I was able to make my own decisions?

42
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:07,365
I am very happy now.

43
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,005
Don't lie.

44
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:13,365
You grew up under my protection.

45
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:17,965
Everything you did was planned by me.

46
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:22,125
Without me, you're going to hurt yourself.

47
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,365
Grandpa.

48
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:27,245
What you're saying now is hurting me.

49
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:30,925
Why can't I depend on myself
to live a good life?

50
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,125
By looking at how you look right now?

51
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,965
Those idol dramas
must have gotten into your head!

52
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,925
Look at yourself now.

53
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,525
You look like an ordinary girl!

54
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:44,365
You're never going to make it far in life.

55
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:48,805
Since that's what you think,
I'm going to prove you wrong.

56
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:50,565
How are you going to prove it?

57
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,205
MISS CAMPUS

58
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:02,405
Since you've brought it up,

59
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,565
I am going to use my current image

60
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:08,645
to win the Miss Campus contest
and prove you wrong.

61
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:11,045
-You'll be the winner?
-Yes.

62
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,685
If I become the winner for this contest,

63
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:16,725
you'll have to let me stay in Ming De.

64
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,085
Okay.

65
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:20,885
But what if you lose?

66
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,565
If I fail to win first place,

67
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,365
then I will follow your wish
and go back to Jincheng with you.

68
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,405
I accept your conditions.

69
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:33,845
But I hope that you will
keep your promise.

70
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:38,365
You'll never know who wins or loses.

71
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:52,045
Come here and take a look.

72
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,525
Ming De's Yearly
Miss Campus contest is here

73
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:56,565
and it's going to be beautifully amazing.

74
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:59,845
As for this year,
it's going to be a tough competition.

75
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:00,765
Hua Munian!

76
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,805
Sorry, excuse me.

77
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:03,725
Chen Qingqing.

78
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,365
Why are you here?

79
00:07:05,445 --> 00:07:07,885
I'm here to join the Miss Campus contest.

80
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:10,725
-Join Miss Campus contest?
-That's right.

81
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:12,245
Excuse me,

82
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:15,645
this is a campus beauty contest
not a campus Joker contest.

83
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:17,765
Although, I have to say
you do look quite comical,

84
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:19,165
but this is a search for beauty.

85
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,165
Beauty!

86
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:24,365
Are you only referring to external beauty?

87
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:25,485
How shallow.

88
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,245
What is beauty?

89
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:31,605
True beauty is
a form of beauty from within.

90
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,285
Rubbish.

91
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:36,645
Beauty is beauty.

92
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,125
Why are you spouting nonsense?

93
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:39,565
Do you see the dorms?

94
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:41,285
Isn't it over there?

95
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:42,645
Come closer.

96
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:44,365
You should go back and tidy up.

97
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,325
-This really doesn't suit you.
-Hua Munian!

98
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:49,325
Ugly ducklings can turn out
to be beautiful swans.

99
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:55,525
Never stop someone
who overestimates themselves.

100
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:59,525
As you might end up missing a touching

101
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,165
and inspirational story.

102
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:04,285
Ms. Lan, are you here
to support Chen Qingqing?

103
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,605
Now, people shouldn't forget

104
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:09,885
the reason ugly ducklings
can turn into beautiful swans

105
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:11,365
is because

106
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:13,965
they were swans to begin with.

107
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:23,285
You seem to be so interested in swans.

108
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:26,645
Don't tell me you're craving for swans?

109
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,045
Only a toad would crave for swans.

110
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,365
Hua Munian, give me the application form.

111
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:38,205
You're very clever.

112
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:47,645
What are they discussing?

113
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:49,885
They look so passionate.

114
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:52,125
If it's this time of the year,

115
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,765
I'm guessing the list
for the Miss Campus contestants are out.

116
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:57,045
How silly.

117
00:08:57,765 --> 00:08:59,045
Maybe you should take a look.

118
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,605
Aren't you looking for a girlfriend?

119
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:01,845
Very funny.

120
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:15,765
Someone from our class was selected.

121
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:18,245
This is our time to unite together
and support Chen Qingqing.

122
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:19,205
Class president,

123
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:22,245
our competitors aren't that strong,
but it's our own team member who is weak.

124
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:24,645
We can't let others look down on us.

125
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:25,845
Let's gather everyone

126
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:27,405
and cheer for Qingqing

127
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:28,845
-all the way.
-Yes.

128
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,445
-Chen Qingqing, we will support you.
-Chen Qingqing, we will support you.

129
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:43,045
-Qingqing is going to win it.
-Qingqing is going to win it.

130
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:44,965
Thank you.

131
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:45,885
Thanks, everyone.

132
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,965
Thanks for the support.

133
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,525
Situ Feng.

134
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,685
I will be participating in Miss Campus.

135
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:06,005
Could you write a song for me?

136
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:08,485
Why did you join the contest?

137
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,285
It doesn't suit you at all.

138
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:11,925
I won't allow it.

139
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:14,005
What makes you think you can stop me?

140
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,885
This competition is important to me.

141
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,045
Why are you always
drawing attention to yourself?

142
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:20,565
Others think that you're a joke.

143
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:21,765
Are you even aware of it?

144
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,805
Mr. Gu.

145
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:46,245
There's something

146
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:48,285
I would like to speak to you in private.

147
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:49,645
Okay.

148
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:51,245
Let's go.

149
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,685
Why are you playing with that
instead of darts?

150
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:11,925
Gu Nanxi.

151
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:13,325
I want to ask you something.

152
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,885
What did Chen Qingqing ask you just now?

153
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:21,885
She said

154
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,245
it was regarding the Miss Campus contest.

155
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:25,685
She asked for my help.

156
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:27,205
What?

157
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:29,325
Asked for your help?

158
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:31,845
Yes, why?

159
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,005
Nothing.

160
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,485
Well...

161
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:43,925
I was just thinking
that she's not that pretty.

162
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,765
That's what I meant.

163
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:50,085
It seems to me that
you're quite concerned about her.

164
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:52,325
Do I? I'm not concerned about her.

165
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:53,765
Not concerned at all.

166
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:10,965
No.

167
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:13,805
It should be this instead.

168
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:40,285
I like the combination
of these two instruments.

169
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,725
I should compose songs
using these in the future.

170
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:46,805
Then I'm afraid Chen Qingqing
might ask you for copyright fees.

171
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,485
She's the one who came up with this idea.

172
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:52,885
Plus, she's playing it for the contest.

173
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,685
-Chen Qingqing did this?
-Yes.

174
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:58,605
From an errand runner,

175
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,685
to scoring A for her studies,

176
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,565
to having such a talent...

177
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:04,965
She's like a box of chocolates.

178
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:08,725
You'll just never know what you'll get.

179
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:18,125
All right, just leave it here.
It's good here.

180
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:19,725
Let's just start now.

181
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:22,005
What a busybody.

182
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:26,965
Chen Qingqing, where are you going?

183
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:28,405
Aren't you going to practice?

184
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,285
I'm going to change my outfit

185
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:33,085
into something nice and sexy.

186
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:35,365
That is how the judges
will give me a higher score.

187
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:37,565
Don't you agree, Mr. Gu?

188
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:06,845
What are you looking at?

189
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:10,885
Nothing.

190
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,365
Oh, right, Situ Feng.
I just want to tell you in advance.

191
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,885
Even though I'm letting you
be our audience today,

192
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,405
you're not allowed to disturb us.

193
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:31,005
This Miss Campus contest
is extremely important to me.

194
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,085
Let's begin, Gu Nanxi.

195
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,725
Nanxi.

196
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:02,685
Xinya.

197
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:03,965
What brings you here?

198
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:05,965
Were you looking for me?

199
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:09,645
Our Student Council Secretariat
received a letter of complaint earlier.

200
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,245
Complaint?

201
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:12,765
What kind of complaint?

202
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:18,045
This complaint is about
the leader of the Student Council.

203
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,165
A complaint about me?

204
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:24,885
Come over here.

205
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:26,725
They're suspecting

206
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:29,325
your relationship with Chen Qingqing

207
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,285
since you're not only helping her
as one of the judges for the contest,

208
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,845
you're also performing along with her.

209
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:37,925
This is really unfair
to other contestants.

210
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:39,365
Well--

211
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,045
Lan Xinya.

212
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,685
Do you think I'm blind?

213
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,685
Most of these people who complained

214
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,805
are girls from your circle

215
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,805
or the girls from the Goddess club.

216
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,725
You're doing this on purpose!

217
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:59,805
That's only your wild guess.

218
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:01,765
Everything that's written on the letter

219
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:03,925
are in fact happening right now.

220
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:07,405
Plus, if the person
who complained about this

221
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:09,005
informs the school leaders,

222
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,245
you won't only get disqualified
from the contest,

223
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,525
Nanxi's title as
the Student Council President

224
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:17,525
might also be removed.

225
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:20,165
This is a piece of advice.
You should drop out of the contest now.

226
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,085
Stop making a nuisance
of yourself and others.

227
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,365
It might not be as serious as you think.

228
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,885
The rules for the Miss Campus contest
was approved by the principal.

229
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,245
But as a judge for the contest,

230
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:46,525
I shouldn't have
helped one of the contestants.

231
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,805
This is my fault.

232
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:48,845
Don't worry.

233
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,845
As long as you stop helping Chen Qingqing,

234
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,005
I believe the other students
will drop the matter.

235
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:55,925
Qingqing.

236
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,445
It's okay.

237
00:16:58,245 --> 00:17:00,445
I shouldn't have asked for your help
given your position.

238
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:02,525
The fact that you actually agreed...

239
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,565
I really appreciate it.

240
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,885
Actually, there's someone else

241
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,084
who knows how to play this song.

242
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:10,565
Someone else?

243
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:14,005
Nanxi, you might as well save your breath.

244
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:15,444
Don't you ever forget that

245
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,604
she's the one who almost
got you into trouble.

246
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:19,685
Let's go.

247
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:37,485
Why are you here?

248
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:44,485
I have something important to ask you.

249
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:48,045
I need to win first place
for the Miss Campus contest.

250
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,245
Otherwise,

251
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,365
you won't be able to see me anymore.

252
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:55,165
Why?

253
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,485
I can't tell you now.

254
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:02,925
How would you like me to help you?

255
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:04,845
Gu Nanxi told me that

256
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:06,245
besides himself,

257
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:09,925
there's another person who knows
how to play that song on the piano.

258
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,245
I'm guessing

259
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:13,125
the person he's referring to

260
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:14,525
is you.

261
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:17,165
I knew sooner or later,
you'd ask for my help,

262
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,645
but if I give in too easily,

263
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,525
wouldn't it hurt my pride?

264
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:24,685
This song,

265
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,845
I did play it once before.

266
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:30,885
But I'm not in a good mood now
and I don't feel like helping you.

267
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,045
You...

268
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:45,085
Shouldn't you at least ask me again?

269
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,725
HUA MUNIAN,
HEAD OF ENTERTAINMENT DEPARTMENT

270
00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:58,645
Show me your lips.

271
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:01,565
I knew this would be a great color on you.

272
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,285
Why am I so talented?

273
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,605
Has the standard
of the beauty contest dropped?

274
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:25,725
Seriously, with her looking like that,

275
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,845
I don't even know
how she managed to be selected.

276
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,165
Why are you guys complaining?

277
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:31,485
She can hear you.

278
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:34,365
If she ends up in the last place,
wouldn't it be good for us?

279
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:48,445
-Bye.
-Bye.

280
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:52,525
Xinya, you look so pretty today.

281
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:53,965
I agree. You're so pretty.

282
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,005
Thanks, guys.

283
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:58,365
You would probably win again this year.

284
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:13,165
Dear all department heads and teachers.

285
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,725
Dear all students and friends.

286
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,965
-Good evening to all of you.
-Good evening to all of you.

287
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:25,245
The Yearly Miss Campus contest
by Ming De College shall begin now.

288
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,205
There are two rounds to this contest.

289
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:28,125
In the first round,

290
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:30,725
each contestant will take turns
to show off their beauty

291
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:33,245
and answer questions given by the judges.

292
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,685
For the second round,

293
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:37,485
each contestant are
to show off their talents

294
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:39,525
in order to bedazzle the audience.

295
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,725
After these two rounds,

296
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,965
judges will judge
based on the contestant's performance

297
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:45,445
to pick out the winner
for Miss Campus tonight.

298
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,045
Without further ado,
let's begin the contest.

299
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,645
Let's welcome our contestants.

300
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:14,565
Chen Qingqing.

301
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:16,045
You have our support!

302
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:20,445
Keep going all the way!

303
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:23,005
Dear teachers and fellow students,

304
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:24,165
good evening.

305
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:25,845
Ming De College's Miss Campus contest

306
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,205
goes way back in history.

307
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:30,245
It has become one of Yuncheng's
well known cultural event.

308
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:32,645
If I emerge as the winner,

309
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,925
I will use this opportunity

310
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:35,565
-to help Ming De...
-What's wrong?

311
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:36,885
Thanks.

312
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:40,965
I wanted to look skinny,
I haven't eaten for two days.

313
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:43,885
Please hang on tight.

314
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:46,925
If you collapse now,
all your hard work will go to waste.

315
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:55,925
Sir.

316
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:58,685
Miss Qingqing is up next.

317
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:02,245
Mr. Chen.

318
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:05,565
It was such a last minute visit.
I couldn't attend to you properly.

319
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:08,085
I was just passing by on my business trip.

320
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:11,645
You came here just in time
for our Miss Campus contest.

321
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:14,085
-Knowing that you're visiting...
-Qingqing.

322
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:16,085
You're just as stubborn as your mom.

323
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:17,325
But this time,

324
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:20,085
I won't allow you
to make the same mistakes as her.

325
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:38,685
Chen Qingqing.

326
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,565
The judges will begin
to ask you various questions.

327
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:43,245
Are you ready?

328
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:44,565
I'm ready.

329
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:48,765
Chen Qingqing, I have a question for you.

330
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:50,325
Please go ahead.

331
00:22:50,405 --> 00:22:53,965
As you know,
Miss Campus is a beauty contest.

332
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:58,405
All of the contestants on stage
looks the part and are talented.

333
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,565
But when it comes to your appearance...

334
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:03,685
There's really nothing special about it.

335
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:07,845
May I ask what motivated you
to stand on this stage?

336
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:10,165
Don't you think your participation

337
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:12,525
is an insult to other contestants?

338
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:23,845
To the student who asked this question.
please mind your words.

339
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:27,125
Qingqing, you don't have
to answer this question.

340
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:28,525
It's all right.

341
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:32,365
Before I answer that question,

342
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:35,405
I'd like to ask the judges too.

343
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:38,365
What is your definition of beauty?

344
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:41,565
I hope everyone can think about it.

345
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:44,445
Based on your understanding,
what defines beauty?

346
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:46,485
For instance,

347
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:49,245
I just ate so much food backstage.

348
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,205
Because I know

349
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,205
in order to stand on stage

350
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,725
I need plenty of energy
to perform for everyone.

351
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:06,565
I am aware we have a dominant standard
for beauty in the society.

352
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,605
A mainstream standard

353
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:10,645
which categorizes us

354
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,805
based on how we were born.

355
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:16,245
Our height, our physical attributes
and our age and so on

356
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,045
to define us

357
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,805
and then tell us

358
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:21,525
that's all we are.

359
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:23,365
This is how you are as a person.

360
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:24,645
This is how you live your life.

361
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:30,205
We too have adopted the same standard
to define what beauty is to us.

362
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,605
But throughout the ages,

363
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:35,205
from East to West,

364
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:36,925
no written literature

365
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,805
has ever declared

366
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:41,405
that beauty is only skin deep.

367
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,125
Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.

368
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,605
That should define beauty.

369
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:48,245
A single strain of silver hair
on the head of a loving mom

370
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,645
should also define beauty.

371
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,965
Everything that touches your heart
should be defined as beauty.

372
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:56,605
Beauty shouldn't be differentiated
based on country or region

373
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:58,685
nor should it be ranked or based
on a fixed standard.

374
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:01,605
If someone does not fall into
the mainstream standard of beauty,

375
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:03,005
are they not beautiful at all?

376
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:06,605
Are they not worthy
to be complimented and to be loved?

377
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:08,445
Who said that?

378
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,005
Who set the rules?

379
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,085
And who has the right to judge so?

380
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:16,325
Chen Qingqing, you're changing the topic.

381
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:18,205
And you're creating a scene on stage.

382
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:20,325
Quite the opposite.

383
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:22,485
I'm a product of this stage

384
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:25,925
and when I'm standing on this stage

385
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:28,565
it proves that this contest

386
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:31,205
has brought possibilities
to diversify the standard of beauty.

387
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:33,165
And that's all from me.

388
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:34,405
Thank you.

389
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:50,205
-Well done.
-Well done.

390
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,885
-Good job.
-Good job.

391
00:26:00,965 --> 00:26:02,725
My fellow students.

392
00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:05,205
Don't get carried away by her speech!

393
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:23,925
Next, let's welcome Lan Xinya's

394
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:26,765
-violin performance.
-Goddess!

395
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:28,845
-Goddess!
-Goddess!

396
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,285
Goddess!

397
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:50,045
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

398
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:53,205
Next, let's welcome Chen Qingqing's

399
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,845
-performance.
-Yes!

400
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,605
You have my full support, Chen Qingqing!

401
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:04,965
QINGQING, YOU'RE THE BEST

402
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:06,445
You can do it.

403
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,885
A solo performance of the Zither.

404
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:36,725
Isn't it too simple?

405
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,725
Lan Xinya's performance seemed better.

406
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:14,285
I thought you said you're not
in the mood to help me out?

407
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:18,245
Well, I didn't want you
to embarrass yourself.

408
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,205
Oh, right.

409
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:23,925
Were you the first to applause just now?

410
00:29:24,845 --> 00:29:25,765
What?

411
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:26,725
Who knows?

412
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:31,445
But you look really good today.

413
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:34,925
You're already the winner
of Miss Campus to me.

414
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:37,925
My goodness.

415
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,245
Why is my heart beating so fast?

416
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:04,165
After a fierce competition earlier,

417
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:05,165
I am here to announce

418
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:08,445
the winner
of Ming De College's Miss Campus is...

419
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,485
Lan Xinya.

420
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:13,565
Sir.

421
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:15,045
As you instructed,

422
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:17,045
I've transferred the votes
to other students.

423
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:19,005
Miss Qingqing failed to be the winner.

424
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:22,405
I got it.

425
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,485
You can go now.

426
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:44,525
What are you doing?

427
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:47,245
Fangfang.

428
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:50,325
I'm leaving the college.

429
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:52,765
Is it because of the contest?

430
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:54,645
Talk to us if you don't feel good
about it.

431
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:56,565
It's not what you think.

432
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:58,405
What do you mean?

433
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:05,645
Qingqing.

434
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:08,645
Congratulations on your performance today.

435
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:09,925
It was splendid.

436
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,045
If your goal was to win Miss Campus,

437
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:14,205
you've actually already succeeded.

438
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,245
I will keep my promise.

439
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,285
You may continue to study
at Ming De College,

440
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:20,765
but you're not allowed
to expose your identity.

441
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,445
Once you're exposed, you must return home.

442
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:26,685
Fangfang, I'm not leaving anymore.

443
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,125
I won't have to leave you guys!

444
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:32,285
Aren't you happy that I'm staying here?

445
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:34,645
-Aren't you happy?
-That's awesome!

446
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:37,605
-I'm staying.
-Great!

447
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:47,925
"A music video series?"

448
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:50,605
The two of you look great together

449
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:53,805
and your chemistry has gotten better.

450
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:55,045
Hey.

451
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:57,005
Situ Feng came with someone really pretty.

452
00:32:57,085 --> 00:33:00,205
Chen Qingqing is gone,
but now Qingchen is here.

453
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:01,965
That's right, where's Chen Qingqing?

454
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:03,405
Give her a call.

455
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:05,445
Why isn't she picking up?

456
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,765
A college excursion is the best time
to confess to the person you like.

457
00:33:08,845 --> 00:33:10,805
-Okay, I promise.
-Okay.

458
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:13,325
We will be able to see the meteor shower
if we go up the hill.

459
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:16,365
Hey!

460
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:18,165
Qingchen!

461
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:20,285
