00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,725
EPISODE 22

3
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:01,525
Later in the afternoon today,

4
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:02,965
we shall be hearing from Situ Feng

5
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:05,165
in his press conference.

6
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:06,805
He will be performing a new song

7
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:10,805
as a rebuttal of his recent rumors
on plagiarism.

8
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:12,725
Will he be able to live up
to the expectation

9
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:14,525
and create an excellent song

10
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:16,565
within a short period of only three days?

11
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:20,565
Let us anticipate the outcome and see
how it is going to affect his career.

12
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:23,085
Please stay tuned.

13
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:24,765
Follow us for more updates.

14
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,605
Where is Situ Feng?

15
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:38,805
He's on his way.

16
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,885
I'll call him again.

17
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:44,005
Hello?

18
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,405
The line got disconnected.

19
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:48,965
What is this all about?

20
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:50,645
I've told you.

21
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:52,845
If anything goes wrong
with the press conference,

22
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:54,805
all of you can stop coming to work!

23
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:57,805
Of course nothing will go wrong.

24
00:02:58,365 --> 00:02:59,245
Damn it.

25
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:02,965
-Daniel.
-You're here.

26
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,325
Where is Situ Feng?

27
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:06,845
I can't reach him at all.

28
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:10,005
Why is this happening?

29
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:12,525
The press conference will commence
in a short while.

30
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:14,925
Situ Feng and his team, please get ready.

31
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,125
You wait here. Let's go.

32
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:28,805
Hello, everyone.

33
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,405
I'm Daniel and I'm Situ Feng's manager.

34
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:34,965
I would like to thank every one of you
who made it here.

35
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:40,565
As you know,
Situ Feng is such a devoted artist.

36
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,565
He has worked so hard for this new album.

37
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:45,965
Just for your information--

38
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,965
Daniel, can you stop
beating around the bush?

39
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,685
Where is Situ Feng?

40
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:53,245
That's right. Is it because he wasn't able
to produce a new song so he chickened out?

41
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:56,125
Doesn't this mean he is admitting
to the plagiarism rumors?

42
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,405
Please give us your honest response.

43
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,445
-Yes.
-Yes.

44
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:06,645
Calm down, everyone.

45
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,445
We will definitely...

46
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,565
Just, please calm down...

47
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:12,965
We will give you an honest response.

48
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:22,765
I knew Situ Feng wouldn't be able
to create a new song within three days.

49
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:25,165
Sir, we have to celebrate.

50
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,645
-Come.
-Let's make a toast.

51
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:31,165
-What is this?
-Exactly!

52
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:32,485
What kind of press conference is this?

53
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,885
Situ Feng, I have faith in you.

54
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:37,845
I believe you will come here
and prove everyone wrong.

55
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,885
-Can you explain what is happening?
-Who does he think he is?

56
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:19,245
I knew it. I knew Feng would appear.

57
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,285
I'm sorry, sir!

58
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,485
Hello, everyone.

59
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:35,005
Sorry to keep you waiting.

60
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:37,405
Today's press conference

61
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:40,925
is mainly being held for me
to clarify about the plagiarism rumors.

62
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:47,285
What I want to say is that
I did not plagiarize anyone's song.

63
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:52,005
As a musician and a songwriter,

64
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:56,365
it's an absolute shame
to plagiarize other people's songs.

65
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:59,565
Thus, I, Situ Feng

66
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:02,205
will swear on my name that

67
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:06,005
what is being accused of me is not true.

68
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,685
We're now still investigating the matter.

69
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,885
Thus, the main song of the album

70
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:12,685
shall be officially changed

71
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,445
to this new song that I've written

72
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,525
which I will be performing it live today.

73
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,885
I hope you will all like it.

74
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,365
-Go ahead.
-Hi.

75
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:33,485
I'm sure all of us are aware that
the main song of this album

76
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:36,765
will need to grab the listeners' attention
as soon as they hear it

77
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:40,245
and it shall determine
the quality of this album.

78
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,365
May I know, given the time limit

79
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,085
how did you manage to complete the song?

80
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:47,445
Or was this new song casually written?

81
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,205
Were you just trying to get done it with?

82
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,245
I hope you can listen to it
and judge for yourself.

83
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:02,565
Actually, before I came today,
I thought about giving up.

84
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,525
To give up clarifying for myself.

85
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,245
But I realized later that

86
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,645
this is something very precious to me

87
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,645
and no matter what the outcome is,

88
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,365
I have to try my best.

89
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:17,005
Hence, I came.

90
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:21,125
I'm here to prove my love for music.

91
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:25,325
This song, "To Be Your Love"

92
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,245
was written

93
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:33,165
for someone who has been
supporting me unconditionally.

94
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:36,805
Someone who's very important
and special to me.

95
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,525
I hope you will like this song.

96
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:57,485
Lights touched your naughty curls

97
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,885
Lights kissed on your rosy cheeks

98
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:06,125
Lights quietly lit up
The freckles on your face

99
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:11,325
When you feel down

100
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:14,965
When you couldn't speak

101
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:18,205
How do I make you smile again

102
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,525
Get your cuteness back

103
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:39,564
Turning through the alleys

104
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,164
Where we first met

105
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:44,765
Those absurd moments

106
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,205
What is to be anticipated?

107
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:53,045
Let me stay in your heart

108
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,165
You affected me so deeply

109
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:59,645
I would give you my everything

110
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:02,085
No matter how it will end

111
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:03,565
The journey is sweet

112
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:07,085
Let me occupy your love

113
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:10,525
Never say no and hide it

114
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:13,445
I won't hesitate to kiss you

115
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:18,085
You'll be my exclusive sweetheart

116
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:30,805
Thank you.

117
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:41,925
-Sir, please wait.
-Sir...

118
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,765
Hang on, everyone.

119
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:00,085
-Daniel, I'll leave this to you.
-No problem, see you then.

120
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,605
You may ask your questions to me.

121
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,045
What did you say?

122
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:08,645
The culprit has been found?

123
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:10,805
Lin Yiyang was the culprit?

124
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,725
What is the official date
of release for the new album?

125
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:13,645
It'll be soon.

126
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:18,325
All my dear media representatives,

127
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:21,645
there's an update that the real culprit
of this case has been caught.

128
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,765
We can now confirm it was all a setup
from the start.

129
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,605
Are you Lin Yiyang?

130
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,605
Who the hell are you?

131
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:35,165
We're supporters of His Highness.

132
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,485
You were the one
who started the rumors, right?

133
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:43,245
Aren't you leaving?

134
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:44,365
Go.

135
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:46,205
Take care!

136
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,365
Hurry.

137
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,205
-Now!
-Let's get him!

138
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:51,325
-Let's get him!
-Let's get him!

139
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,205
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

140
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,165
Thanks for your gift yesterday.

141
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:08,685
I thought you were going to ignore me.

142
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:11,165
Did you like it?

143
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:12,765
Of course.

144
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:14,645
Well...

145
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:17,125
How are you going to repay me?

146
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,085
That new song was written for you.

147
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:24,165
It was great. I loved it.

148
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:25,645
Thank you.

149
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,285
I should be the one thanking you.

150
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,685
If it weren't for you,

151
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,765
I wouldn't have made it through
that quickly.

152
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,925
Ye Bei, what's wrong?

153
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,445
Situ Feng, your fans are crazy!

154
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,525
Where's Lin Yiyang?

155
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,605
He is stuck back there!

156
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:21,445
Qingqing, wait for me here.

157
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,605
Be careful, Situ Feng.

158
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,325
-Punch him!
-Kill him!

159
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:31,045
-Punch him!
-Kill him!

160
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:32,925
-Punch him!
-Carry on!

161
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,965
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

162
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:50,365
-Carry on, guys!
-Kill him.

163
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:53,765
Punch harder!

164
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,405
We will punch you if we see you again.

165
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,765
You'd better watch out!

166
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:12,165
Why are you here?

167
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:17,685
Are you okay?

168
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:22,405
Yes, I'm still alive.

169
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:27,085
Have you forgotten?
I'm good with being attacked by people.

170
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:33,965
Why did you help me?

171
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:38,885
Because I can't just watch
you get beaten up.

172
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:45,565
Don't you know?

173
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:49,285
I was behind everything.

174
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:56,565
Yes, but I should thank you instead.

175
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:01,045
Having gone through the whole incident
made me grow as a person.

176
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:10,645
I did horrible things to you.

177
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,605
Why are you still being nice to me?

178
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:24,645
Because...

179
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,605
we're friends.

180
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:04,005
One, two, three, four, five, six!

181
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:05,805
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

182
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:07,405
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.

183
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:12,925
Good morning!

184
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,805
Today is the day my errands service

185
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:18,405
resume its business.

186
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:19,765
Morning call!

187
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,925
Good morning, everyone.

188
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,605
Good morning.

189
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:29,165
Hello, sir.

190
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:34,005
Hello, good morning, sir.

191
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:38,405
Listen to Qingqing

192
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:42,325
Wake up, wake up

193
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:46,565
What's wrong with everyone today?

194
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,965
What's up with these early morning calls?

195
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,725
It's the weekend.

196
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,525
Why should I wake up so early?

197
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,445
Whatever.

198
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:58,485
I'm going back to sleep
for ten more minutes.

199
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:01,965
Qingqing, are you going back to sleep?

200
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,685
Fangfang, where are you going?

201
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:07,725
The library.

202
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,205
We have to go right now.

203
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:14,205
Fangfang, slow down.

204
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:22,885
Get over here.

205
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:24,845
What's wrong with everyone?

206
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:28,005
What did I miss?
Why are they walking like zombies?

207
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,725
Qingqing, it's two more weeks
to the finals.

208
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,845
The major finals
before our semester break starts.

209
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,325
Our major finals?

210
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,565
But isn't this a little too much?

211
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:39,725
Everyone has to queue up
to enter the library.

212
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:42,485
Let's go, shall we?

213
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:43,565
Okay.

214
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,685
Fangfang.

215
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,364
So many books?

216
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,565
Our college's examinations are tough.

217
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:30,285
They're difficult and strict.
It's worse than hell.

218
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,485
Although some students here
are from really affluent families,

219
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,765
but everyone will be treated equally
during finals.

220
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:38,645
If they failed to score well
for the exams,

221
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,125
the college will put up a notice.

222
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:42,805
Put up a notice?

223
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,125
Once they are listed in the notice,

224
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:46,645
it'll be difficult

225
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,645
for them to apply for scholarships

226
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,725
or good universities in the future.

227
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,805
Ming De is well known
for its academic achievements.

228
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,045
There's going to be strong competitions.

229
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,605
-I'm going to look for a book.
-Okay.

230
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:24,925
Qingqing, why are you here?

231
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,205
It's the finals week.

232
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:29,325
Fangfang brought me here to study.
What about you?

233
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:31,725
I'm here to study
the topics for our finals.

234
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,285
-Topics?
-Yes.

235
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,165
It's our college's regulations.
If we pick a national level topic,

236
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:38,525
there are going to be bonus points.

237
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:43,365
You're worthy of your title, Mr. Gu.

238
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:46,885
Qingqing,
do you want to have dinner together?

239
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:47,805
Sure.

240
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:51,605
I have something to discuss with you too.

241
00:18:51,685 --> 00:18:53,205
I'll see you tonight.

242
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:54,325
-See you later.
-See you.

243
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:58,485
Right.

244
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:00,685
Let me tell you this.

245
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:03,125
Even if you get those bonus points,

246
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:06,005
I'm going to do better than you
in the finals.

247
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,245
Situ Feng.

248
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:15,685
Your fan club's representative came.

249
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,725
These are all gifts for you.

250
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:20,005
-It's so hard to remember.
-Look, your favorite chocolate.

251
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:23,765
I'm going to the library.

252
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,805
-Where?
-The library.

253
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,885
I'm going to study. Don't stop me.

254
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:30,205
Where did he say he was going?

255
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:31,525
The library?

256
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:33,965
Talk about when pigs fly!

257
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,285
I want to straighten up.

258
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:46,325
Sir, are you leaving us?

259
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,765
Sir, I admit I was careless
in handling Situ Feng's case,

260
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:52,205
but please don't leave us.

261
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:54,085
What I meant was

262
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:57,685
I want to live a normal life now
and stop causing troubles for myself.

263
00:19:58,765 --> 00:19:59,845
As for the two of you,

264
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:03,205
you're always going to be my good friends.

265
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,125
I knew it.

266
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,765
Three heads are better than one.
He would never leave us.

267
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:07,805
Yes!

268
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:15,965
I'm leaving now.

269
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,325
Sir, where are you going?

270
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:27,645
The library.

271
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:34,045
Where the hell is Qingqing?

272
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:20,245
C is the answer.

273
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:27,005
Thanks.

274
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:30,085
How much did you score
for the monthly test?

275
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,565
It wasn't bad, I guess.

276
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:34,445
An average of 60 marks.

277
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:38,565
I scored 142 marks for my English test.

278
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:43,325
How about Math?

279
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,085
I failed.

280
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:49,885
What was your score?

281
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:54,845
It was 15.

282
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,445
How about this?

283
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:04,245
I will teach you Math like Einstein.
You can teach me English.

284
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:07,765
Wasn't Einstein an inventor?

285
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:11,005
Was he?

286
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:15,405
I thought Thomas Edison was an inventor?

287
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:22,205
-It's DaVinci!
-It's DaVinci!

288
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:25,445
-He was the one.
-Yes.

289
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:28,885
What do you feel like eating?

290
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:33,045
If I tell you what I want to eat,
would you buy them for me?

291
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:37,525
Of course, as long as
it can be found in Yuncheng.

292
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:39,845
But if it can't be found in Yuncheng,

293
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:42,405
I would take the plane.

294
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,045
I was joking.

295
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,045
Let me think.

296
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,645
I feel like having street food.

297
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:53,685
-Street food?
-Yes.

298
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:55,685
Don't you know?

299
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:59,285
There are stalls selling beer,
skewers and baked eggplants.

300
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:02,765
Well, now that's a problem.

301
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,965
I've never eaten those before.

302
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:08,285
What's the fun to be always eating
at fancy restaurants?

303
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:11,445
The real hidden gems are on the streets.

304
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,165
We should go and experience it ourselves.

305
00:23:13,245 --> 00:23:14,285
Shall we go?

306
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:15,485
Of course.

307
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:16,845
Let's go.

308
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:18,645
Why don't we take the car?

309
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,085
Why drive? Let's walk.

310
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:22,645
This is how you can fully experience

311
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:25,165
-living as an ordinary citizen.
-Okay.

312
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:28,125
This place looks really nice.

313
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:29,045
I think so too.

314
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:39,165
Thank you.

315
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,245
Come. Cheers!

316
00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:04,565
-Nanxi, I...
-Right, I...

317
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,325
-You first.
-You first.

318
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:10,685
No, you first.

319
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:11,925
Ladies first.

320
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:15,805
It's about Situ Feng.

321
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:21,685
What is it about him?

322
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:23,965
Like what you said to me,

323
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:27,645
Situ Feng has sacrificed a lot for me.

324
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,205
Hence,

325
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:31,965
I want to be serious
about our relationship.

326
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:34,205
I want to tell him

327
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:35,965
that I like him.

328
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:38,805
But...

329
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:42,325
-But what?
-Goodness.

330
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,485
But...

331
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:46,885
he still doesn't know

332
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:49,805
that I am Qingchen.

333
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,445
Are you serious? You haven't told him yet?

334
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,445
I am serious, Gu Nanxi.

335
00:24:56,525 --> 00:25:00,445
I couldn't find a suitable time
to tell him.

336
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:03,845
You should have told him by now.

337
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,805
What should I do?

338
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:09,965
Should I just keep it a secret forever?

339
00:25:13,005 --> 00:25:18,485
Chen Qingqing, Situ Feng
is a very direct and sincere person.

340
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,965
If he finds out that his friends
hasn't been truthful to him,

341
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:23,285
he's going to be mad.

342
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:27,445
But I think,
he will eventually understand.

343
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:30,245
So, if you really want
to take your relationship seriously,

344
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:32,565
you should be honest with him.

345
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:35,845
I already knew about it,
but I haven't told him yet.

346
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,885
If things go wrong later,

347
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:39,845
we'll have to carry the burden together.

348
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,325
Thank you so much.

349
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:42,805
Why are you thanking me?

350
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:44,525
Cheer up.

351
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:46,485
This is not the Chen Qingqing I know.

352
00:25:46,565 --> 00:25:50,245
That's right, I'm a fearless witch!

353
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:53,005
Sir, I'd like half a dozen
bottles of beer!

354
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,445
It's examination period.

355
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:56,645
So what?

356
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:59,045
I've never failed my exams before!

357
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,805
I'm so glad to have you as my friend.

358
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:04,085
Let's drink to our heart's content.

359
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:09,645
Can you still drink?

360
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:11,325
Of course.

361
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:14,125
-I'm all right.
-Didn't you say you were good at drinking?

362
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:16,925
Was this what you called good at drinking?

363
00:26:17,885 --> 00:26:18,765
Be careful.

364
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:20,645
I'll call a cab for you.

365
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:23,485
Hey.

366
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:24,965
Be careful.

367
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:34,685
I'm going to show Feng

368
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:37,965
that Chen Qingqing
doesn't deserve his love.

369
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:40,965
Gu Nanxi.
I thought you were my best friend!

370
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:43,165
My best friend

371
00:26:44,165 --> 00:26:45,645
and the girl I love

372
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:48,085
treated me like a fool.

373
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:50,325
It hurts!

374
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:51,925
Is that what you think of me?

375
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,765
Am I such a horrible person?

376
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:57,045
Situ Feng, can we talk?

377
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,485
You know what?

378
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:03,005
You're right, I am materialistic.
That's why I approached Situ Feng.

379
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,565
