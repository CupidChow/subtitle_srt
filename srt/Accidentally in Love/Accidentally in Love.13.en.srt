A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:58,325
EPISODE 13

3
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:04,725
Your phone, sir.

4
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:06,965
Hello?

5
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:08,645
Is that you, Qingqing?

6
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:10,085
Grandpa.

7
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,085
I miss you.

8
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,565
I thought you went away for a while
because you were upset.

9
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:18,725
I didn't think you'd be gone for months.

10
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:21,565
Qingqing, listen to me.

11
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:23,685
If you come back,

12
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,445
I will do anything for you.

13
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:26,885
Then please,

14
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:28,925
in the name of my mom,

15
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,205
tell me the truth.

16
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:37,685
Have you been lying to me
about Mom and Dad?

17
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,885
I had to hide some things from you

18
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,685
for your own good.

19
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:44,685
I was so--

20
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:48,885
What did Qingqing find out
that she'd ask something like this?

21
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:52,365
She must have gone
to her parents' college after all.

22
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,605
You were alone with that witch
for so long.

23
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:59,085
Weren't you scared?

24
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:00,765
You mean, Ms. Chen?

25
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:02,965
-Ms. Chen?
-Yeah.

26
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,965
You're now calling her Ms. Chen
behind her back?

27
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,325
Did she plant a bug on you?

28
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:13,045
Fangfang, this time,
I really got to know Ms. Chen.

29
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,045
She's a good person.

30
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:17,885
Did she cast a spell on you?

31
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:21,765
Qingqing, it's my day off tomorrow.

32
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:22,965
Do you want to hang out?

33
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:28,445
No. Tomorrow, I have
a date with a mysterious person.

34
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,125
-A mysterious person?
-Yeah.

35
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,565
Is it Situ Feng?

36
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:36,245
The both of you were so in character
during the play.

37
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:38,125
The more you acted,
the more real it seemed.

38
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:40,725
-You kissed like real lovers--
-Knock it off, Fangfang!

39
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:42,445
Gosh!

40
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:46,445
I see that you're getting even more...

41
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:47,845
What?

42
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:48,805
Gossipy.

43
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:50,445
Come here.

44
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,045
I need to ask you something.

45
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,045
Sit.

46
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:55,005
I want to ask you.

47
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:58,645
What's really going on between you
and Lin Yiyang?

48
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:01,085
Don't tell me you like him.

49
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,605
But he used to kidnap us, Fangfang.

50
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:06,005
No!

51
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:09,325
I just think that sometimes,
he's pretending.

52
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:10,925
It makes me curious.

53
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:14,685
Someone in this dormitory

54
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:16,845
has fallen in love.

55
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,285
Cut it out!

56
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:20,365
Like I said, about you and Situ Feng,

57
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:23,205
you were so into it
when you were on stage.

58
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:24,964
Your relationship developed so fast.

59
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:26,605
Cut the crap already.

60
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,565
He's just one of the good-looks club.

61
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,885
I look down on him, he surrenders to me.

62
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:34,965
There's already so much hatred between us.
There's no way for us to like each other.

63
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:37,045
That's not necessarily the case.

64
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,525
I remember an author once said,

65
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:41,245
"If we judge love,

66
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,485
by the majority of its results,
it resembles hatred

67
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,965
more than friendship."

68
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:47,645
Then the author was just fooling around.

69
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:50,365
But then again,
I want to ask you something.

70
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,525
How would I know

71
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:57,045
if I'm in love with somebody?

72
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,165
I've never talked about love,
but as they say in the books,

73
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,285
"When you can completely

74
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:05,365
be your own self in front of someone,

75
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:07,325
that means you're in love with him."

76
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,365
So what if I'm not myself,

77
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,565
but I've turned into
a completely different person?

78
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,605
Maybe you aren't
a completely different person,

79
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,285
but you've discovered your true self.

80
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,525
Fangfang, no one could've thought of that.

81
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,885
You could wipe out all the so-called
love experts on Weibo!

82
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:28,325
You're brilliant!

83
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,525
I want to ask you too.

84
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:31,765
Have you ever thought of

85
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,565
what kind of guy do you like?

86
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:37,005
I like...

87
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:44,165
By the way,

88
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,365
my grandma's birthday is in a few days.

89
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,045
Can you come and help me
carry the gifts tomorrow?

90
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,285
Okay.

91
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:53,445
I've been doing the same thing every year.
Why are you even asking?

92
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:55,245
I asked

93
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:58,445
simply to remind you
that another year has passed,

94
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,965
and I still don't have a girlfriend.

95
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:03,205
You're a good guy.
There will be someone for you.

96
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,245
Don't give up.

97
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:07,925
I heard that the whole campus

98
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:10,925
is asking me about my sexual orientation.

99
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,925
Of course.

100
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:15,525
You're warm, you're hygienic

101
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,565
and you don't have bad habits.

102
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:20,565
No one would believe it
if you said you were straight.

103
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:23,285
If they doubt your sexual orientation,

104
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:24,685
who do they think you're with?

105
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,405
Gu Nanxi.

106
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:34,405
You should keep looking for a girlfriend.

107
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,325
Why are you always sticking with me?

108
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:37,725
Don't tell me...

109
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,725
Do you really like me?

110
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:42,725
I don't have freckles
and I don't have curly hair.

111
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:44,365
I don't go around baring my fangs

112
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,285
and I don't speak with a thundering voice.

113
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,285
How am I supposed

114
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,005
to attract you, Your Highness?

115
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:53,485
Get out.

116
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:57,485
You can make a date with Qingchen.

117
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:08,365
I've tried so many times, but I couldn't.

118
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:09,445
So I gave up.

119
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,565
Why is that?

120
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,205
Beats me.

121
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:15,885
I'm so done talking to you about love.

122
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:17,765
I'll come with you tomorrow.

123
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:24,245
That place was really huge and lively.

124
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:26,085
Next thing you know, when he dropped by,

125
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,805
we have already finished our meal.

126
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:29,365
Your dad was left eating by himself.

127
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:30,285
Really?

128
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:31,245
Really.

129
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,005
Ms. Chen.

130
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,645
I really want to thank you

131
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:39,045
for being able to tell me so much
about my parents today.

132
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:43,445
Qingqing, shall we meet up again
next time?

133
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,365
Sure. You should hurry back now.

134
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:46,525
I'll pay the bills.

135
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:47,685
Okay, I've got to go.

136
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:01,605
Hey, Nanxi.

137
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,685
Isn't that Qingchen?

138
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,085
We just ran into her like this.

139
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:06,605
Come on, let's go there.

140
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:07,885
-No.
-Come on.

141
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,885
-Forget it.
-Come on.

142
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,285
Hey, Qingchen.

143
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,005
What a coincidence.

144
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:18,725
It sure is.

145
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:20,085
What brings you here?

146
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,005
Do you mind?

147
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:23,445
No, I don't.

148
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,125
Qingchen.

149
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,485
Are you busy after this?

150
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:28,725
Yes.

151
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,845
How about a little chit-chat?

152
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,325
It won't take up too much of your time.

153
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:37,725
Don't bother her.

154
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,445
Miss Qingchen, I'm sorry to bother you.

155
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,164
Situ Feng is going through

156
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:44,525
some sort of love-hate relationship
with a girl on campus.

157
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:47,804
So he's a little outgoing
and not quite like himself.

158
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:49,565
Hey, Gu Nanxi!

159
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:50,725
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,405
I want to go buy some gifts.

161
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:54,885
You guys should have a chat.
I've got to go.

162
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:56,525
Hey, Gu Nanxi.

163
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:03,725
Never mind.

164
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:04,725
Well...

165
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:05,685
My friend...

166
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:09,325
-He's a really nice guy.
-Yeah, I can tell.

167
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:10,285
They call you

168
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,565
"Your Coldhearted Highness."

169
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:16,565
But, you don't look as cold as they say.

170
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:18,805
Do you think so?

171
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:20,085
Yeah.

172
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,485
By the way,

173
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,165
Gu Nanxi just said

174
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,565
you have a love-hate relationship
with someone.

175
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,285
Who's that someone?

176
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,045
A crazy friend of mine.

177
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:32,885
But,

178
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,725
I realized that

179
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,245
I can be myself in front of her

180
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,245
more comfortably than before.

181
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:41,005
"When you can completely

182
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:43,205
be your own self in front of someone,

183
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,005
that means you're in love with him."

184
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:50,685
It looks like this friend of yours

185
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,765
is more than just a friend.

186
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:56,605
Yeah.

187
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:01,045
She is more than just a friend to me.

188
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:02,725
She's...

189
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:05,525
my best friend.

190
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,325
You should meet her sometime.

191
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:10,085
You've got to teach her
to be more ladylike.

192
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,565
Even so, it's nothing, really.

193
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,205
I think you should

194
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:18,965
get to know each other.

195
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:22,645
I see that your behavior
is a bit similar to hers.

196
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,005
I find that odd.

197
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:30,685
If you'll excuse me,
I have something to attend to.

198
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:32,765
Say goodbye to Nanxi for me. Bye.

199
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:37,645
Nanxi is...

200
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:44,725
That was close!

201
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:48,325
It makes me uncomfortable every time
I make up as Qingchen.

202
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,565
Then I met Situ Feng
and I don't know how to talk to him.

203
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,645
But then again, Qingchen is the real me.

204
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:00,645
Why should I be angry
when he's stepping on Qingqing?

205
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:02,245
Gosh.

206
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:06,165
Chen Qingqing,
you've got a split personality!

207
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:28,925
Hey.

208
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,725
Qingqing, what a coincidence.

209
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,125
What are you doing here?

210
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:35,965
Weren't you having coffee just now?

211
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:40,205
Hey, how did you know that?

212
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:45,245
Look, there's a coffee mark
at the side of your mouth.

213
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,245
Not only you can't control your limbs,

214
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,845
you can't use your brain either!

215
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,525
Tell me, what are you doing here?

216
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,525
Doing some shopping.

217
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:53,445
And you?

218
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:57,405
I'm here to look for a part-time job.

219
00:11:58,045 --> 00:11:59,565
Have you found one?

220
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:01,845
It's hard to get one here.

221
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,565
Chen Qingqing, don't you earn enough
from being my assistant?

222
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,725
Besides, if anyone catches you,
you'll embarrass me.

223
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:07,725
All right.

224
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:09,605
What a bother.

225
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,685
We can't help you get a part-time job.

226
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,805
But we can help you
save on your travel expenses.

227
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:14,925
Let's go.

228
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:23,965
-Qingqing!
-Yes?

229
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:26,805
-I heard you're from Jincheng.
-Yes.

230
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:29,685
We haven't properly
introduced you to Yuncheng.

231
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:32,245
We should come out
and enjoy ourselves more often.

232
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:37,925
Don't you know,
ever since I came to this college,

233
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:40,325
I kept running into sixes and sevens
without fail.

234
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:42,285
So I have no time to relax.

235
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:44,725
But my grandma's birthday is coming up.

236
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,485
Would you like to join me?

237
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:47,965
Yeah.

238
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,805
You've got to relax sometimes.

239
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,405
Can I bring Fangfang along?

240
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,805
Of course, you can.

241
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:02,565
Qingqing, do you have an evening dress?

242
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:04,205
Maybe I can buy you one.

243
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,365
Oh, no, thank you.

244
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:06,925
I hate that stuff.

245
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:08,045
Look at you.

246
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:10,725
I simply can't put up with you.

247
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,525
If I put on an evening dress,

248
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:14,205
you're going to freak out!

249
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:16,765
Step on it.

250
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:23,645
May you lead a life full of joy,
live long and smile always!

251
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:24,565
Thank you.

252
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:26,085
Sure.

253
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:30,725
Grandma.

254
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:32,325
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

255
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:36,005
Mom and I would like to wish you
to be always healthy and cheerful.

256
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:41,285
This piece of jade represents good luck.

257
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,285
It'd be good for you to put it on.

258
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,725
This is for you, Grandma.

259
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:46,365
-Good one.
-Happy birthday, Mother.

260
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:47,445
Thank you.

261
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,165
It's a jade bracelet.

262
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,525
It doesn't look that great.

263
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:54,405
Grandma, look at what I got you here.

264
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:56,165
A five-carat diamond necklace.

265
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:59,165
I wish you longevity, Grandma.

266
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:01,245
Here you go, Grandma.

267
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:02,245
Good boy.

268
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,645
As long as you gave them to me,

269
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:06,285
that would keep me happy.

270
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,965
Well, Grandma, please excuse us.

271
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:12,725
Take care.

272
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,085
Grandma.

273
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,885
I have something to attend to.
Rest well. I'll take my leave.

274
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:24,405
Let me get you a drink.

275
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:31,405
Every year, you've been doing nothing,
but boot-licking.

276
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,845
Don't forget who you really are.

277
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:35,845
You don't have the Gu family blood

278
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,405
and you will never have.

279
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:38,605
Gu Donglin.

280
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,445
Don't you forget,

281
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,445
Gu Nanxi is still taking care
of your gambling debt.

282
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:46,285
If it wasn't for him,
you'd be hacked to death.

283
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:50,725
Besides, you should be grateful for not
bringing your family to shame.

284
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,725
Situ Feng,

285
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:53,885
you shut up!

286
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,925
I didn't let you in here
to spew crap on us.

287
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:59,325
Besides, what right do you have
to meddle in our family affairs?

288
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:01,285
Donglin.

289
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:03,885
It's Grandma's birthday today. Cut it out.

290
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:06,765
Don't worry.

291
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:11,685
Qingqing.

292
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,045
This is my first time
to a party like this.

293
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:15,805
What should I do?

294
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:18,165
Fangfang, when the time comes,

295
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:19,445
you just have to follow me.

296
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,605
I've been to so many parties like this.

297
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,645
You won't make a mistake if you follow me.

298
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:27,885
Chen Qingqing.

299
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:29,965
What are you doing here?

300
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,685
Why are you stealing my lines?

301
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,405
What are you here for? Business?

302
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:39,085
It seems the rich kids around here
don't need any of your errands service.

303
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,365
If that's the case, you still owe me money

304
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:48,165
for my errands service.

305
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:50,845
Don't be so full of yourself.

306
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:52,925
Sooner or later, you're going to get it.

307
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:53,925
Really?

308
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:56,685
As a matter of fact,
every time it turns out

309
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,485
that you're the one
who always going to get it first.

310
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:01,245
Lan Xinya.

311
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:05,645
All the dirty tricks you pulled on me
only made me stronger.

312
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,765
Just think about it.

313
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:10,405
Hey.

314
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,525
You look great in that dress.

315
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,445
Really?

316
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,485
It's much better than the kid's clothes.

317
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:20,165
You don't say.

318
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,165
No one's elegance
reflects her inner beauty

319
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:25,165
more than your darling Xinya's.

320
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,365
Yeah.

321
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,485
Xinya's also pretty today.

322
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:32,005
Sorry, I'm late.

323
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:38,045
Lanting.

324
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,965
Ting, you're here.

325
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:40,925
Lanting.

326
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:42,485
I miss you so much.

327
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:43,885
Lanting.

328
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:45,445
Why are you back?

329
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,405
I thought you weren't coming back
from abroad.

330
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:50,085
Of course I should be here
for Mrs. Gu's birthday.

331
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:51,485
Lanting.

332
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:52,685
Let me introduce to you.

333
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,725
This is Chen Qingqing.

334
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:56,245
And this is Zhang Fangfang.

335
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:59,045
They are all my good friends
from Ming De College.

336
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,245
Good friends?

337
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,125
-Hello.
-Hello.

338
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:05,845
So you are Chen Qingqing?

339
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:06,964
Yes, I am.

340
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:08,244
Do you know me?

341
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:09,765
Qingqing.

342
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:10,805
This is Lanting.

343
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,045
She's a childhood friend of ours.

344
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:14,885
She's older than us by just two years,

345
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:17,525
but doesn't she have a great aura?

346
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,444
Lanting.

347
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,204
She's wearing the same clothes as you are.

348
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:26,645
Wearing the same clothes is nothing.

349
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:28,525
I just won't wear this next time.

350
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:31,045
But the other person should be careful.

351
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,365
Qingqing.

352
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:42,245
That Yang Lanting.

353
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:44,205
Why is she so eccentric?

354
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:46,805
What do you mean?

355
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:49,765
Who knows?

356
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:51,685
Don't you see?

357
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:55,405
Every girl who grew up with Situ Feng

358
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,165
are all the same.

359
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:00,765
Maybe they're all infected
by that cold snap of his.

360
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:05,325
Anyway, you've got to be careful here.

361
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:06,925
Don't worry, Fangfang.

362
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,325
Chen Qingqing is never afraid of anybody.

363
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:12,005
The only thing I fear is myself.

364
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,805
-I've got to use the bathroom.
-Okay.

365
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:27,645
Lanting, your dress.

366
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:32,845
Chen Qingqing.

367
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,445
It's you again!

368
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:38,245
I get it.

369
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:43,565
It's because you're wearing
the exact same dress with Lanting!

370
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,085
You didn't look good,

371
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,805
so you spilled it on purpose.

372
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:47,845
I didn't.

373
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:49,165
What?

374
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:50,445
You're not going to admit it?

375
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,085
I told you to be careful around her.

376
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:55,125
What's going on?

377
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:56,765
Qingqing.

378
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:58,325
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

379
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:00,485
What's going on?

380
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,725
What happened?

381
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:04,885
Who did this?

382
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,205
She did!

383
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,365
Chen Qingqing.

384
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,765
Chen Qingqing,
apologize to Yang Lanting now.

385
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,685
Why should I apologize to her?

386
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:17,045
Did anyone see me spill juice on her?

387
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,965
It's obvious that she ran into it herself!

388
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,525
She's the one who's supposed
to apologize to me.

389
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:22,445
I didn't!

390
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:24,165
What an ugly attention seeker.

391
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,165
Lan Xinya!

392
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:30,725
How could you just bring
any ordinary person here?

393
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,805
Gu Donglin, you'd better watch your mouth.

394
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:36,285
Situ Feng.

395
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:40,685
Didn't I tell you not to stick your nose
into our family affairs?

396
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:41,805
Hey, can't you just be

397
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:43,765
-a little more reasonable?
-Shut your mouth.

398
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,525
-Guard!
-Young Master.

399
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,885
Who is this? Who let her in?

400
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:51,445
Miss, may I see your invitation?

401
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:57,245
You dared to come without an invitation.

402
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:58,965
Don't you have any shame?

403
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,365
Donglin.

404
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:01,405
Cut it out.

405
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:02,645
They're all my good friends.

406
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:07,005
Stop. They may be your friends,
but they're not mine.

407
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:08,205
Gu Donglin.

408
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:10,685
Since this is how you treat our guests,

409
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:12,685
we're not keeping you company anymore.

410
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:15,005
Sorry, Gu Nanxi.

411
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:19,725
Bring them back here!
They haven't apologized to Lanting.

412
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:20,645
Yes, sir.

413
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:26,325
Do you believe that
I didn't spill it on Lanting?

414
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:28,565
-I do.
-No way!

415
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,565
You don't believe me.

416
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:34,045
I believe you.

417
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:35,965
I don't have to think.

418
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,125
Qingqing.

419
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:45,005
What's the matter?

420
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:48,205
Something got into my eye.

421
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,365
Don't move. Let me see.

422
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:52,725
It's okay. I'll deal with it--

423
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:53,885
I said, don't move.

424
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:54,885
Let me see.

425
00:20:58,965 --> 00:20:59,925
I think I see it.

426
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:02,965
Are you okay now?

427
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:05,925
Yes.

428
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:11,845
I...

429
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:13,845
Where did I leave Fangfang?

430
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:15,685
Chen Qingqing.

431
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:17,925
Can't you stop getting flustered
all the time?

432
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:19,645
Sorry, I'm always like this.

433
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:21,965
Can you lend me your phone for a minute?

434
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:24,845
Thank you.

435
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:30,485
Hello, Fangfang.

436
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:32,485
I'm so sorry.

437
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:34,725
I just had a situation just now.

438
00:21:34,805 --> 00:21:36,365
So I had to run out first.

439
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:38,605
Can you return to the dorm yourself?

440
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:40,045
I know you're the best.

441
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,365
Wait for me there.

442
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:43,485
Bye.

443
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:48,125
How about you?
Are you going back to your dorm?

444
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:49,285
Where else should I go?

445
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,885
Let's go. Let me show you something.

446
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:54,485
Where are we going?

447
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,365
You'll see once you're there.

448
00:21:58,005 --> 00:21:59,325
You're leaving me in suspense.

449
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:00,445
Come on!

450
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:03,165
Walk slowly. I'm wearing high heels.

451
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:14,765
Hey, why are you bringing me here?

452
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,405
To play basketball?

453
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:19,085
But you're so bad at basketball.

454
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:20,205
What are we doing here?

455
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,525
-Did you say I'm bad at basketball?
-Yeah.

456
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:23,965
The last time Nanxi played with me,

457
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,445
you didn't see the look on his face.

458
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:27,005
It was like he ate shit or something.

459
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:30,365
Because you play like shit, Situ Feng.

460
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:34,845
Do you want to bet?

461
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,485
As you wish.

462
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:49,565
Have you played basketball before?

463
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:50,925
No.

464
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,965
A girl's arms may be a little shorter.

465
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,925
So you've got to throw a little harder.

466
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:04,085
Situ Feng, I'm sorry. Is your face okay?

467
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:06,805
Why did you tell me to throw so hard?

468
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:09,165
My face is important to me, you know?

469
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:12,525
I'm sorry.

470
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:15,805
I said "girls."

471
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:18,365
Can't a brute like you restrain yourself
a little?

472
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:26,925
Watch and learn.

473
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:29,365
To score three points,

474
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,085
even when you hang in the air,

475
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:33,365
make sure your wrist angle
and your movements are perfect.

476
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:46,645
You mean, you can miss on purpose?

477
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,565
It went in!

478
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:16,725
Situ Feng, that was brilliant!
You really got it in!

479
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,285
What's the point of that?

480
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:20,205
I can only score at times like this.

481
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:22,765
I can't score like this
in front of everyone else.

482
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,245
You care so much about your image.
Why are you doing that?

483
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:33,765
You'll show everyone your true beauty
when you let go of yourself.

484
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:36,085
No, I won't!

485
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:39,285
They call me the Kaede Rukawa
of Ming De College.

486
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:41,605
Step aside, let me have a shot.

487
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:44,605
Throw it over there, a little lower.

488
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:48,205
One, two.

489
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,725
You could do it like that?

490
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:57,685
Are you the one-of-a-kind player
we've been looking for?

491
00:24:58,245 --> 00:24:59,085
All right.

492
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:03,165
You can be our own Sakuragi Hanamichi.

493
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:06,685
I'm a genius!

494
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:09,405
Get out of my way!

495
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:17,485
Throw it!

496
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:27,565
One more time!

497
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:48,485
Situ Feng.

498
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:50,685
Are you asleep?

499
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:52,085
No.

500
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:56,685
Are you tired?

501
00:25:58,645 --> 00:25:59,765
What do you mean?

502
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:01,845
I mean,

503
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:05,405
I can see that you know
how to play basketball,

504
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,245
but you're not doing it well.

505
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:11,685
When you're a star,
you have to disguise yourself.

506
00:26:12,285 --> 00:26:13,525
It must have been hard.

507
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:14,925
Right?

508
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,725
I didn't choose to do this.

509
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:22,485
Because I don't want sympathy.

510
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,645
I'd rather you hate me

511
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:26,245
than to have pity on me.

512
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:28,765
And you hate me too.

513
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:31,205
We've hated each other since we first met.

514
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,285
And we still do.

515
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:40,165
Why don't we talk about what we don't like
about each other?

516
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,325
-Okay.
-You first.

517
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:44,845
You're too frank.

518
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:46,005
You pretend to be cool.

519
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,285
Your clothes are too colorful.

520
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:50,885
Your clothes are too tight
and you're not even muscular.

521
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,325
I'm not muscular?

522
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:54,005
Have you ever seen me

523
00:26:54,645 --> 00:26:56,525
-do martial arts?
-You don't do martial arts.

524
00:26:57,605 --> 00:26:58,565
I don't believe it.

525
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:03,485
Is this how you flirt?

526
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:05,365
It's so fake.

527
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,605
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

528
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,045
Can I say what I like about you?

529
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:13,365
You don't have secrets.

530
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,085
You're so lucky.

531
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:18,565
Look at performing artists like us.

532
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:22,205
We're bound to contracts
and hounded by paparazzi.

533
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:25,405
Even if you want to let go of the past,

534
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:28,365
they'd bring it up over and over again.

535
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:33,725
Qingqing.

536
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:36,005
I'm so envious of you.

537
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:38,645
How do you know I don't have secrets?

538
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:43,605
You have a big mouth.
You'd even leak secrets to the CIA.

539
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:55,245
You...

540
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:58,685
Are you saying that you like me?

541
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:00,245
Don't think too much about it.

542
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:02,205
Look at the context, all right?

543
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:04,685
What I meant by "like" is,

544
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:06,805
what I admire, what I appreciate

545
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,085
and what I envy about you.

546
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:10,685
You're so good at languages,

547
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:13,045
but why isn't your math as good?

548
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:15,525
You're a retard.

549
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:30,605
Hey. Situ Feng.

550
00:28:31,365 --> 00:28:33,005
Did you hear that?

551
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:40,685
It must be a mouse.

552
00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:41,765
What?

553
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:43,725
A mouse?

554
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:46,165
Situ Feng, you've got to protect me!

555
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:47,925
But how?

556
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:52,165
Why do I always end up like this
every time I'm with you?

557
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,125
I hate this!

558
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:54,485
There's a mouse around here.

559
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:56,685
You hate it? Let's go find it.

560
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:01,085
Situ Feng, put me down!

561
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:02,045
Look.

562
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,565
Hurry, look.

563
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,525
It's not a mouse.

564
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,685
It's a kitten.

565
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:25,325
I like cats so much!

566
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,485
Why do you like cats?

567
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:38,125
Don't you have the ability
to think logically?

568
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,125
I hate mice.

569
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:41,685
Cats catch mice.

570
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:43,485
So I like cats.

571
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:45,005
Right?

572
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:46,845
Little kitty.

573
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:49,365
I want to take you home and keep you.

574
00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:50,645
Okay?

575
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:54,325
Don't you want to give it a name?

576
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:55,925
A name?

577
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:57,125
Okay.

578
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:58,805
How about

579
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:01,365
I call you Kitty Chen?

580
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:02,565
-You like it?
-Hey.

581
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:05,445
Why is it a Chen, not a Situ like me?

582
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:08,485
Can't you see my surname
is much more epic?

583
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:09,965
Epic?

584
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:11,565
Are you kidding me?

585
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:14,365
We found this kitten together.

586
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:16,285
We're the mom and dad.

587
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:18,165
I'm the dad. You're the mom.

588
00:30:18,245 --> 00:30:19,565
Of course it'll take my surname.

589
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:21,405
Am I right, Kitty Chen?

590
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:23,165
That's right.

591
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:25,045
-Hey.
-Yes?

592
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:26,325
Why are you the dad?

593
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:29,485
Because I'm domineering.

594
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:31,685
Enough about that.

595
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:34,085
We should at least give it a nickname.

596
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,405
That would be...

597
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:38,845
Situ's Stupid Dog!

598
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:40,685
Hey.

599
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:57,965
Chen Qingqing, what are you drawing?

600
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,485
-Ming De's Yearly Miss Campus--
-Excuse me!

601
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:02,845
Why are you here?

602
00:31:02,925 --> 00:31:05,285
I'm here to join the Miss Campus contest.

603
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,765
Our Student Council Secretariat
received a letter of complaint earlier.

604
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:12,245
You're doing this on purpose!

605
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:17,125
I have something important to ask you.

606
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:20,725
May I ask what motivated you
to stand on this stage?

607
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:23,605
Based on your understanding,
what defines beauty?

608
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:26,525
The winner
of Ming De College's Miss Campus is...

609
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:30,685
