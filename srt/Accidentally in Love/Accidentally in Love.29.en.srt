A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:58,645
EPISODE 29

3
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:15,845
Chen Qingqing.

4
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:19,285
You have been too arrogant lately.

5
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:21,365
What do you expect me to do?

6
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:24,045
Return to your normal self.

7
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:27,565
Lay low in the college for three months.

8
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,365
Three months after three months.

9
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,045
Then three months after three months.

10
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:36,285
It has been almost a year, sir.

11
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:40,805
Now, all I want

12
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:43,165
is to be beautiful.

13
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:52,605
You were already beautiful.

14
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:54,525
Gosh.

15
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:58,925
But this is how I really look.

16
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,925
Are you jealous?

17
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:06,165
I'm jealous? Are you kidding?

18
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:07,685
Me? Jealous?

19
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:10,605
I've seen countless beautiful girls.
Way more than you've seen.

20
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:14,525
Plus, who dares to even think
about my girlfriend?

21
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,445
You are jealous.

22
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,365
-You are.
-I'm not.

23
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:23,925
-You are.
-I'm not.

24
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,485
-I'm not jealous.
-Look at you!

25
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:27,845
You're obviously jealous, Situ Feng.

26
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:31,445
All right then.

27
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:34,605
I'll change my appearance

28
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:36,725
according to what you like, okay?

29
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:37,885
You said it.

30
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,685
Hey, why won't you help me?

31
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,965
Hua Munian, are you leaving for good?

32
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:11,205
Baby, we finally got our leave of absence
approved for this trip.

33
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,805
Of course I'd have to bring
every important thing with me.

34
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:17,404
There are clothes, shoes
enough for us to change outfits every day.

35
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:18,605
And you won't have to worry.

36
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:20,644
I've blocked
all our mutual friends online.

37
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:21,925
No one would know about this.

38
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,685
You're the only person who can see it.

39
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:24,885
Why don't you block me too?

40
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:25,805
Why?

41
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:27,245
Because I've already blocked you.

42
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,845
I don't want to see
your online feeds anyway.

43
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,605
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

44
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,245
Can't you be concern about your friend?

45
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:35,165
Even if you don't think of me
as your friend,

46
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:36,485
I'm still your college mate.

47
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:37,805
Can't you show a little concern?

48
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:41,245
All you think about all day is Situ Feng.
You can end up crazy, you know?

49
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:47,165
I'm sorry, Xinya.

50
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:49,085
I didn't mean that.

51
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:50,965
You're right.

52
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,485
During this period,

53
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,725
I did too many stupid things.

54
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:59,285
For someone who doesn't even love me,

55
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,525
I've forgotten what really matters.

56
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,285
Just like how he has always been around,

57
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:12,325
but I have been oblivious
about his presence.

58
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:15,805
It's time for me to keep him company now.

59
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:18,125
Actually, it's not a big deal.

60
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,565
He's not really a dog.

61
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:22,685
You don't have to keep him company.

62
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,605
Hua Munian, don't tell me
you've forgotten about Teddy?

63
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:36,765
What I meant was

64
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,445
he behaves like a person.

65
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,925
He knows when you're feeling down,
so he will keep you company.

66
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,445
You don't have to keep him company.

67
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:48,365
What a load of rubbish.

68
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:51,765
There you go, Teddy.

69
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:58,525
We should go.

70
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,925
They must think that I look terrible.

71
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:31,405
They probably think I'm not good
enough for you and giving me funny looks.

72
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,885
This won't do, I need to go back.

73
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:35,685
Don't. They probably like your outfit.

74
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:37,605
Come here.

75
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:40,125
Tell me. Why did you look at me like that?

76
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,125
I was just very impressed
of your appearance.

77
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,725
You must've been exceptionally talented

78
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:45,845
to be able to date
such a good looking fellow.

79
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:47,565
You...

80
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:51,005
What's so funny?

81
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:52,285
I hate it.

82
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,925
I barely had the chance
to look pretty for the past few days.

83
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:58,565
Now, I'm back to square one and have
to put up with people's judgments.

84
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,125
Okay, what do you want to do then?

85
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,605
Situ Feng, can you stop being so nervous?

86
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:30,005
I'm an idol, okay?

87
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:32,485
What if people recognized me?

88
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:35,205
Oh, please, stop finding excuses
for yourself.

89
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:37,125
Look around you.

90
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,245
Who's staring at us?

91
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:43,285
See, no one cares.

92
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:46,925
-But why?
-Because you're in disguise now.

93
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:49,965
You look just like
any other ordinary person.

94
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,565
Nobody is going to notice
that you're Situ Feng.

95
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:55,285
You can drop your idol identity now.

96
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:58,205
Look, hey!

97
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,485
Nobody cares at all.

98
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,045
See?

99
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:04,965
It' true!

100
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:06,485
Doesn't this feel absolutely amazing?

101
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:07,925
Why don't we dance?

102
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:08,845
Sure.

103
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,885
One, two, three, go.

104
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:30,885
I feel like I could dance. Let's go.

105
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,044
Number seven and eight. Here.

106
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:49,405
It's starting.

107
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,925
Are these people crazy?

108
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:23,685
This is not the right movie to be kissing.

109
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:27,845
I agree.

110
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:30,045
I wonder how can they do it?

111
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:36,685
If any of the horror scenes

112
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,285
give you the creeps later on,

113
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,605
you can come to me.

114
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:41,565
I will protect you.

115
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,525
Stop looking at us.
Sorry, please ignore us.

116
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,645
The movie was all right.

117
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,565
You were the real horror.

118
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:22,725
I'm so sorry about it.

119
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,605
But that horror movie was really scary.

120
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,925
All right, come over here.

121
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:36,045
-Do I look good?
-Yes.

122
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,485
-Am I perfect?
-Perfect.

123
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,205
Hey, Qingqing.

124
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:42,165
What should we do later?

125
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,245
Whatever you want is fine.

126
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:45,685
What do you want to do?

127
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:46,925
What do I want to do?

128
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,685
How about the claw machine?

129
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:50,125
-All right.
-Let's go play.

130
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,045
Okay.

131
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,525
It's Spongebob Squarepants.

132
00:10:57,645 --> 00:10:58,645
Move to the back a little.

133
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:00,245
Like this?

134
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:02,285
Shift to the side a little.

135
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,845
-I'm going to get it this time.
-Okay.

136
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:12,685
-Okay.
-Let me get you.

137
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,325
-Now.
-Now.

138
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:17,365
Okay.

139
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,845
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

140
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:30,965
Qingqing, cover for me.

141
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:32,405
Why?

142
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:33,645
You'll find out soon.

143
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:42,245
Hey, Situ Feng!

144
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:43,325
Situ Feng!

145
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,245
There are people around.

146
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:46,845
I've got it.

147
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:49,485
Look what I've got.

148
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:50,965
Situ Feng.

149
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:53,965
You're so rowdy, but cute.

150
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,485
But I wanted Spongebob Squarepants.

151
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:02,885
Psyduck is ugly and looks a lot like you.

152
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:11,165
But now you are just like me.

153
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:14,645
-Someone's here.
-Someone's here.

154
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:15,565
Let's run.

155
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,765
-That one looks more interesting.
-I want this.

156
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:23,965
Let's see.

157
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,965
-This cap--
-No, you should wear it.

158
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:29,485
It looks good on you.

159
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,005
The pink one is not bad too.

160
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,645
I don't feel like wearing a cap.

161
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:33,845
Then I'm not wearing one too.

162
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,005
Is it nice?

163
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,005
It's awful.

164
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:38,325
Let me pick one for you.

165
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:39,965
Here, let me help you.

166
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:43,805
Do I look good?

167
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,485
Then it must have been the opposite!
I'm not wearing it.

168
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:48,965
-But--
-We're not taking it, thanks!

169
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,565
Let's go.

170
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:59,645
-Do you want some sweets?
-They look good.

171
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:01,965
Go on, have your pick.

172
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:03,405
I like this one. Kiwi.

173
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:04,805
-Okay.
-This one.

174
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,525
You have one too.

175
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:07,845
I'll have this, thanks.

176
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:09,325
Candied haw.

177
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,005
Lovely flowers.

178
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:15,645
What?

179
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:22,805
It's leaking.

180
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,285
Is it nice?

181
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:25,805
I look awful!

182
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,245
Why does my face look so bloated?

183
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:28,525
Give it to me, I'll delete it.

184
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,525
-Give it to me!
-No!

185
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:31,445
Rascal!

186
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,725
Come and get it.

187
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,085
Give it to me!

188
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:45,725
I can't feel my face anymore.

189
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:48,245
Me too. I can't wait for this to end.

190
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:49,365
Thank you.

191
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:57,365
I have done what you ordered,
Young Master.

192
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:01,125
This is smart of you.

193
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:04,085
This couple would not be able
to handle all the negative comments.

194
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,005
Damn it!

195
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:08,165
Do not refer to them
as a couple in front of me.

196
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,645
Of course, Young Master.

197
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:13,085
-That bastard and that bitch--
-What's your problem?

198
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:15,245
Why are you calling Qingqing a bitch?

199
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:18,965
-Then, bastard and that girl.
-Shut your mouth!

200
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:26,205
But netizens will talk
about Chen Qingqing too.

201
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,485
Young Master, do you--

202
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:29,725
I'm trying to drive a wedge between them.

203
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:31,205
Just wait and see.

204
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,525
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

205
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:41,205
You're so comfortable like a lazy couch.

206
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:42,725
Of course.

207
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:53,645
What are you doing?

208
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,285
Open your mouth, take a bite.

209
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:56,845
My agency forbids me to eat chocolate.

210
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,645
No, you have to eat it.

211
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,085
You have to eat more.

212
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:06,245
This way, it'll fill up your bony edges.

213
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:07,965
You're too skinny now.

214
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,325
I have to fatten you up.

215
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:12,925
Then it'll become even
more comfortable to cuddle with you.

216
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:16,125
Open your mouth.

217
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,165
Situ Feng.

218
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:30,445
So this is where you
and Gu Nanxi's secret base is?

219
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,245
This is a first for me.

220
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:36,445
What are you talking about?
This is my secret base.

221
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:38,925
He only comes here to hang out
with me once in a while.

222
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,845
Did Gu Nanxi and you

223
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,405
watch the stars and hugged like this too?

224
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,525
What nonsense are you talking about?

225
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:50,005
Why would two straight guys
hug each other and watch the stars?

226
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:55,925
I wonder where is Gu Nanxi now?

227
00:15:58,205 --> 00:15:59,405
Him?

228
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,605
He went to run some errands.

229
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:08,725
Situ Feng.

230
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:10,765
Situ Feng.

231
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:15,085
You owe me a girlfriend in my next life.

232
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:19,285
Wait, next life?

233
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:20,965
Why should I wait until the next life?

234
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:26,805
Gu Nanxi, I pity you.

235
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:29,845
I don't think you'll ever meet a girl

236
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:32,685
who looks like she came out
from a romantic music video ever again.

237
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:50,045
Then, what if he's on the way back now?

238
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:55,765
If he sees us hugging together like this,
it'd be so awkward.

239
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:58,325
Gosh. He won't.

240
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,125
He has too many errands to run.

241
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:03,285
It'll probably take him the entire night.

242
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:14,645
Your phone.

243
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,565
-Hello?
-Situ Feng.

244
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:20,765
-Yes.
-About your relationship,

245
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:22,765
I don't think you should be
totally open about it.

246
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,244
Your haters are growing.

247
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:25,844
Haters?

248
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,124
-What haters?
-Chen Qingqing's haters.

249
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,205
Check your Weibo.

250
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:31,285
All right.

251
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:33,445
What is it about?

252
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:34,765
Daniel asked me to check out Weibo.

253
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:50,405
"New love interest, Chen Qingqing

254
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,645
used her beauty to woo Situ Feng"?

255
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:56,885
What is this?

256
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:59,405
Situ Feng was the one
who confessed to me first.

257
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,685
Well, this is a good point
worth considering.

258
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,405
Of course, what I'm saying is,

259
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,165
we shouldn't care about it too much.

260
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:10,485
As a public figure,
this is an idol's life.

261
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:11,845
Easy for you to say!

262
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,565
They are not blabbering about you.

263
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:27,765
Chen Qingqing is both pretty and talented.

264
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:32,165
There's no reason for her

265
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:36,245
to rely on Situ Feng

266
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:39,245
like that.

267
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,405
HATER: LIES! PROOF?

268
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,205
You want proof? I will show you proof!

269
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:47,405
How are you going to prove it?

270
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,645
I'm going to show the world,

271
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:53,085
in the realm of Chen Qingqing,

272
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:55,165
I am a queen.

273
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,005
Your realm?

274
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,685
I, Chen Qingqing

275
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:09,765
am a heaven-born genius.

276
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:12,965
There's nothing I can't do.

277
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:17,685
Plus, I'm also an expert

278
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:21,165
in Taekwondo.

279
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:30,085
Good morning, everyone.

280
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:32,565
I'm your Taekwondo instructor.

281
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:33,765
My name is Chen Qingqing.

282
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:38,285
Now, I'll briefly explain to you
what is Taekwondo.

283
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:43,165
Taekwondo is not just training
in physical self-defense,

284
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:44,845
but also a training of your mind.

285
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:47,325
It's an all-rounded mental
and physical exercise.

286
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:51,885
Every movement in Taekwondo
is based on self-defense.

287
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:55,125
To defend is to handle
an attack harmlessly

288
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,845
and to be always conscious
about your situation.

289
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,325
Do you understand?

290
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:30,285
I'm never going to have a child with you.

291
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,165
I did not say I wanted
to have a child with you.

292
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,565
Hey, wait for me.

293
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,845
Hello, everyone.

294
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:51,725
I'm your new assistant instructor.

295
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:55,565
The reason I am here today
is because I'd like to convey

296
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:58,005
my appreciation for ballet.

297
00:20:58,085 --> 00:21:02,125
Miss, I think you look pretty.

298
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:04,325
You shouldn't...

299
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:08,285
Excuse me, little guy.

300
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:10,005
Is she your girlfriend?

301
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,405
If she isn't, please do not
disrupt our lesson.

302
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:32,485
I told you.

303
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:34,245
You shouldn't have.

304
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,125
It sucks to have to prove myself.

305
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:50,045
Maybe I should return
to my family's business.

306
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:53,805
Given my capabilities,
it won't be an issue for me to succeed.

307
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:58,085
It hurts so much.
Can you not hit me so hard?

308
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:59,325
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:02,805
But didn't you say
that you're not interested in that?

310
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,885
So what if I'm interested or not?

311
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,205
Do you know?

312
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:09,165
People like you

313
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:13,285
who can live your dreams

314
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,565
are one in a million, okay?

315
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:16,885
You saw what happened earlier.

316
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,685
Those dreams of mine...

317
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,845
They are not going to work for me.

318
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:29,365
Do you think I should
just give up my dreams

319
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:31,885
and take over
my family's business instead?

320
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,445
I feel that we can still think about it.

321
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,445
We're still young, aren't we?

322
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:45,885
Welcome.

323
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,085
Lin Yiyang?

324
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:49,485
Why are you here?

325
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:52,565
You don't have to work
in this cafe anymore.

326
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,765
I've bought it as a gift to you.

327
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,365
What the hell do you think you're doing?

328
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:02,325
We're dating.

329
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:04,765
We're not starring in the drama
The President's Lovely Wife.

330
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:07,085
Kidnapping me, buying me a cafe,
what is wrong with you?

331
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,005
It was a joke.

332
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:14,645
I didn't buy this cafe.

333
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,005
Well, you see,

334
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:24,805
I was just trying to rehearse a scene
for our stage play here with you.

335
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:26,365
I'll contact you after work.

336
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:27,965
You should leave.

337
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:29,805
I'm not leaving.

338
00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:31,845
I'm here for work as well.

339
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:48,565
Sir, give us a price.

340
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:49,885
Our boss said

341
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:53,245
he will pay you
twice of the proposed amount.

342
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,005
ABOLISH PLAN

343
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,325
Our boss just said that
you'll be dead if you don't obey.

344
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:08,685
QING QING, FANG FANG

345
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:09,765
Chen Qingqing.

346
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:11,925
Chen Qingqing, I'm coming in.

347
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:21,285
Chen Qingqing, wake up.

348
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:23,445
Chen Qingqing, wake up.

349
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:24,565
Chen Qingqing.

350
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:30,885
Chen Qingqing.

351
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,165
Situ Feng.

352
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:34,165
Why are in you
in our female dormitory again?

353
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:36,005
Why didn't the warden stop you?

354
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:38,245
I didn't cross-dress today.

355
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:39,685
I climbed from the other side.

356
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:41,485
But what's important is that

357
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,725
I think I've figured out
what you should do.

358
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:45,325
This could be your new life goals.

359
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:46,685
Hey, man.

360
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,925
Do you know it's still bedtime for me?

361
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,925
If you really want
to talk about life goals,

362
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:53,045
can you please wait until I'm awake?

363
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:55,445
My princess,

364
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,045
it's already noon.

365
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,805
Do you still want to sleep?

366
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:04,405
I'm serious, Situ Feng.

367
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:08,805
If I let my crazy self out,
it'd be too late.

368
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:13,205
Do not disturb my sleep.

369
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:16,925
Nevermind.

370
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:18,965
It's not a big deal anyway.

371
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:22,165
It's just something related to your dad.

372
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:23,365
I'm leaving.

373
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:25,845
What?

374
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,205
The headquarters have decided

375
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,965
to transfer you to the office in Japan.

376
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:38,725
Japan?

377
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:41,325
The representative from America
really liked your album.

378
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,885
-They've decided to offer you a contract.
-Really?

379
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:46,445
You haven't told her yet?

380
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,245
When were you going to tell me?

381
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:51,885
When you've got your visa
or after you've gone to America?

382
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:54,085
Perhaps

383
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:56,685
I'm just a passerby in your life.

384
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,645
Let's say goodbye here.

385
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:01,725
Goodbye.

386
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:08,485
