A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,765
EPISODE 25

3
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,365
Qingqing.

4
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:02,565
This is the first time
we're going on a trip together.

5
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:03,565
That's right.

6
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:05,925
This is my first real trip with friends.

7
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,805
Ever since I found out
about your relationship with Lin Yiyang,

8
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:11,765
I've begun to find him very attractive.

9
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,845
Love me, love my dog, as they say.

10
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,325
Cut the nonsense.
There's nothing going on between us.

11
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,045
But as for you and Situ Feng,

12
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,565
his attitude toward you has changed

13
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,645
since you came back from the tower.

14
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:25,085
Did the legend of the tower come true?

15
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:28,205
-Are you two together?
-Don't make wild guesses.

16
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:29,485
You'll find out later.

17
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:34,165
The driver has been waiting for two hours.

18
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:37,445
Gosh, we needed to put on makeup.
Don't you know?

19
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,965
Could you show me some respect?

20
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:41,445
-Shut up.
-Hey.

21
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,085
Fine, I will forgive you.

22
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,565
I will carry your suitcase for you.

23
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:46,645
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

24
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:47,685
That way.

25
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:50,685
Hello, Lanting.

26
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,045
Xinya, have you left with Situ Feng?

27
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,525
I'm about to leave.

28
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:56,125
I don't know about him though.

29
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:58,485
Aren't you two coming together?

30
00:02:58,925 --> 00:02:59,845
I thought...

31
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:01,085
What is it?

32
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:03,765
I thought that Feng was going
to pick you up.

33
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,845
He told me that he was going
to meet up with someone.

34
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:07,645
I see.

35
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,645
Hello, Hua Munian. What are you doing?

36
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,205
Cut the crap.

37
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:21,645
Meet me in ten minutes.
You're going to the beach with me.

38
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,285
Can you stop talking?

39
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:25,445
Do you want the budget or not? That's it.

40
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:52,285
Hello, Gu Nanxi.

41
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:54,765
-You're here.
-Xinya.

42
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:58,245
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:00,045
Why? Am I not welcome here?

44
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,285
We're all friends.
Of course, you're welcome to join us.

45
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:07,965
Nanxi, Feng,
I'm going to look for Yiyang and Lanting.

46
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:09,125
I'll meet you at the beach.

47
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,365
Okay. See you later.

48
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,165
Gu Nanxi, let us get some rest.

49
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:16,445
We're starving.

50
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,725
I will give you your room keys.

51
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:21,125
Situ Feng ate two-thirds of our snacks.

52
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:24,404
Don't say that.

53
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,125
Go check in first.

54
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:30,685
By the way, Lanting is throwing
a barbecue party on the beach.

55
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:32,685
Come and join us when you get enough rest.

56
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:34,805
We're sharing a room.

57
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:36,005
Chen Qingqing.

58
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,285
Hua Munian.

59
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:39,285
Xinya kidnapped me here.

60
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,805
She threatened me with the budget.

61
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:44,605
Mr. Gu, please help me out.

62
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,965
I'm struggling to survive.

63
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:50,565
-Qingqing, lend me your sunscreen.
-Yes?

64
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:52,205
I was in a hurry, so I didn't bring it.

65
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:55,125
You're a man.
You don't need to wear sunscreen.

66
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:58,045
UV light can damage your skin.

67
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:00,525
It causes your skin to age and become dry.

68
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:03,165
It's 80 percent the sun's fault.

69
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:07,005
If you wear sunscreen every day,
why are you still so tanned?

70
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,125
-Fangfang, let's go to our room.
-Hey?

71
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,805
Situ Feng.

72
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:15,925
You have such pale skin
and you're also an idol.

73
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:17,085
You must have sunscreen.

74
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:19,885
Gu Nanxi, let's go.

75
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,085
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

76
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,205
Welcome back, Lanting.

77
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:33,885
When Lanting went abroad to study,
I secretly cried.

78
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:36,205
I missed all of you when I was abroad.

79
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:38,605
I could only stay a day
the last time I came back.

80
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,405
I didn't get to spend time with you.

81
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,965
I got on a plane the minute
I finished my thesis.

82
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,805
Welcome back, Lanting.

83
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:47,485
I haven't seen you guys in a while.

84
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,845
It seems like we have a lot to catch up.

85
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,085
Everyone has changed after all.

86
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:54,765
This lady.

87
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,325
I've seen you at the party last time.

88
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,205
My name is Zhang Fangfang.

89
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,445
Yiyang.

90
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:01,725
Your taste is very plain lately.

91
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:10,205
Excuse me.

92
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:13,525
Don't try to bully Fangfang
when I'm not around.

93
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,805
Qingqing, don't think too much.

94
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,245
Situ Feng's friend is also my friend.

95
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,245
Come on. Let's make a toast, everyone.

96
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:25,045
Here.

97
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,125
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

98
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:35,485
Let's play something.

99
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:37,685
How about dodgeball?

100
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,245
-Sure.
-All right.

101
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,365
We used to play that when we were young.

102
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:42,805
-I'm up for it.
-Let's do it.

103
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:44,085
Okay.

104
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:45,885
Do you know how to play?

105
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,805
We've played together since we were kids.

106
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,765
We're not used to having outsiders
in our team.

107
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:00,085
Will it be all right if you three
are on the same team?

108
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,365
Sure, no problem.

109
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:03,525
Fangfang, I will protect you later.

110
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,365
Will you three be all right?

111
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:07,565
Of course we will.

112
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,525
It's not fair for you three girls.

113
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,405
-I'll join your team.
-Okay.

114
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,085
Lin Yiyang, I'm glad you're here.
Look at Yiyang.

115
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:16,885
What did you mean by three girls?

116
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:19,885
I'm absolutely a--

117
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:22,045
I think that this is a great idea.

118
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,565
I think that this is a great idea too.

119
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:32,285
I hope that someone wouldn't cry
after getting hit in the nose.

120
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,045
Let's go.

121
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:36,725
-Hua Munian.
-Chen Qingqing.

122
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,685
I will explain the rules.

123
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,045
Each team will take turns to serve.

124
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,165
The boys have to protect the girls
from getting hit.

125
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,165
Hands are allowed to touch the ball.

126
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:49,445
One point will be deducted
if the ball hits the body.

127
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,925
Three points will be deducted
if it hits a girl.

128
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,005
All right. Let's assign our jobs.

129
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:55,045
That's not necessary.

130
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,085
Feng, protect Xinya.
You're in charge of protecting me.

131
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,325
-Okay.
-I agree.

132
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:04,085
I've never played this game before.

133
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,485
When the ball is coming after you,
hide behind me.

134
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:11,205
How about this?

135
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:14,565
Hua Munian, you boys
are in charge of protecting Fangfang.

136
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:16,925
I'll be all right
because I have good reflexes.

137
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:18,485
What do you say? Let's do this then.

138
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,485
Let's go.

139
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,925
-Come here.
-Protect Fangfang.

140
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:39,085
Come on.

141
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:42,164
Fangfang.

142
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:44,845
Fangfang, watch out.

143
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,125
Fangfang, are you all right?

144
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:51,845
Just hide behind me.

145
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,605
Why did you come to the front?

146
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,085
Mr. Lin.

147
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,405
Why are you so brave today?

148
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:57,925
How dare you bully my girl?

149
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,325
-Your girl?
-Your girl?

150
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:02,445
You won't get points from Fangfang.

151
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,085
Don't even try to get points from Xinya.

152
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:05,205
Come on.

153
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:07,485
A hero saves a damsel in distress.
Let's play.

154
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:14,485
Come on.

155
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:21,525
Hold on.

156
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:23,325
Why does your team

157
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,605
always target the weak girl?

158
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:27,045
You're not playing fair.

159
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:30,245
All right. We won't bully the girl.

160
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:32,045
We'll aim at you, the tomboy.

161
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,725
Hold on. Pause.

162
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:36,045
-Hua Munian, protect me.
-Hey.

163
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:37,245
-Come on, Situ Feng.
-Wait.

164
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:50,685
Qingqing.

165
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:52,885
Qingqing, are you all right?

166
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,845
Did you get hit in the eye?
Let me take a look.

167
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,445
Situ Feng, are you okay?

168
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,165
Let me see.

169
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,365
I was acting.

170
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:03,565
You're crazy.

171
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:07,405
I did get hit in the eye just now. Gosh.

172
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:08,405
Really?

173
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:09,725
Yes, my eye got hit.

174
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,045
-Chen Qingqing.
-Come and get me.

175
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,805
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

176
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:17,245
You pulled a prank on me again.

177
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:19,125
Xinya, it's all right.

178
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,845
We'll have a good time with her later.

179
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:26,325
Hey, you will lose if you go on like this.

180
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:28,045
How about this?

181
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,685
The girls will protect the guys instead.

182
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:31,965
Sure, I would like that very much.

183
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:36,845
Why not? Cross-gender acting
has always been Situ Feng's strong suit.

184
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,925
Gu Nanxi, don't betray your teammate.

185
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:40,765
Can you do it?

186
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,685
Chen Qingqing,
you'd better step up your game.

187
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:49,525
I'm not afraid of you.

188
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:59,285
Baby, can I do anything to help you?

189
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:00,725
-Yes.
-What is it?

190
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:01,765
Shut up.

191
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,045
We've got a point.

192
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,925
Baby, you're wonderful. You saved my life.

193
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:09,925
Don't get carried away.

194
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:11,805
I've been protecting you
since the beginning.

195
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:13,365
Come on. Let's continue.

196
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:16,965
Over here.

197
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:18,685
Hurry, throw over there.

198
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,245
-Hit her.
-Again.

199
00:11:28,685 --> 00:11:29,605
Come on, Lan Xinya.

200
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,085
You're good.

201
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,885
Lanting, it's only a game.

202
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:42,885
Take it easy.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

203
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,885
There's no such thing as taking it easy.

204
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:47,165
If you want to play,
you have to play seriously.

205
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:48,445
I believe that Chen Qingqing

206
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:51,045
is not the kind of person
who surrenders easily as well.

207
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,365
Qingqing, let's take a break.

208
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,845
It's all right. I can still play.

209
00:11:58,445 --> 00:11:59,365
Let's surrender.

210
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,205
How can we give up?

211
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,165
I'm not going to lose to Lan Xinya.

212
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,525
Situ Feng, have faith in me.

213
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,085
Be careful then.

214
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:12,645
Come on.

215
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:18,445
Hey!

216
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:21,925
Hey! Stop.

217
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:23,725
-Stop playing.
-What is he doing?

218
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,525
Qingqing.

219
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:28,965
Qingqing, are you all right?

220
00:12:29,845 --> 00:12:30,725
Qingqing.

221
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:32,125
-Are you okay?
-I'm all right.

222
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:37,285
Come on.

223
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:41,965
What's the matter?

224
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:43,885
The game's over.

225
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:45,045
We're all tired.

226
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,885
Let's go back to the hotel
and get some rest.

227
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,645
Okay.

228
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:53,125
I agree.

229
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:57,685
Wait a minute.

230
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:01,245
Since there's a winning and a losing team,

231
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,045
shouldn't there be a punishment?

232
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:06,165
That's right. Don't be a sore loser.

233
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,325
Besides, the sea breeze is nice.

234
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,725
What's the rush to go back to the hotel?

235
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:13,565
Why don't we sit down and have a chat?

236
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:16,205
All right. Let's sit down for a while.

237
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,245
Let's go.

238
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:29,405
The winning team is allowed

239
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:31,205
to make the losing team
play Truth or Dare.

240
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,365
You can only pick either truth or dare.

241
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,685
So? Who's going to be first?

242
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:42,685
Xinya, Qingqing should receive
the punishment for her team.

243
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:45,285
She was the player
who lost the most points after all.

244
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:46,285
What do you think?

245
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:48,285
I think--

246
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:49,365
I've got an idea.

247
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:50,405
Feng?

248
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:54,085
Let me hand out the punishment.

249
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:57,725
You're all my friends.

250
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:01,765
There's something
that I don't want to hide anymore.

251
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:04,605
I hope all of you would understand.

252
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,085
Especially Xinya.

253
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:11,885
Feng.

254
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:24,645
Chen Qingqing.

255
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,525
Here's your punishment.

256
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:32,405
Be my girlfriend.

257
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,325
Situ Feng. No one does it like this.

258
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:40,805
What's the matter?
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

259
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:43,565
Yes.

260
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:50,485
Let me introduce you.

261
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,925
This is my girlfriend, Chen Qingqing.

262
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:59,205
Qingqing, why didn't you tell me?

263
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,005
We've been through so much lately.

264
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:04,445
We went to great lengths

265
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:06,605
to be together.

266
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,125
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

267
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:11,365
Bottoms up.

268
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:14,885
Baby, congratulations.

269
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,045
Please don't tell anyone about it yet.

270
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,965
We're a family.
Let's keep the news to ourselves.

271
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:22,365
Xinya, are you all right?

272
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:23,445
Don't cry.

273
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,925
I know that you did a lot for Situ Feng.

274
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,365
But he has never laid his eyes on you.

275
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,125
Situ Feng!

276
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:37,285
I've always liked you.

277
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:40,645
Didn't you know that?

278
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:45,405
You promised to take care of me forever.
Did you forget that?

279
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:48,045
Xinya, you must have misunderstood.

280
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,965
I did promise to take care of you.

281
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:51,365
But just as a little sister.

282
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,485
Feng, Xinya has stayed by your side
for so many years.

283
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:57,565
Have you ever liked her at all?

284
00:15:57,765 --> 00:15:59,125
Have you ever had feelings for her?

285
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:02,965
Enough.

286
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,605
I'll go check on her.

287
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:21,365
Lan Xinya.

288
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:24,485
What are you doing?

289
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:27,125
Are you trying to make fun of me?

290
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:28,565
Lan Xinya, calm down.

291
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:29,965
It's just a man.

292
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,165
You'll get over it.

293
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:34,485
This is merely a small setback
in your life. Do you hear me?

294
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:38,765
If Feng is not with me,

295
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:43,605
I would rather not live this life.

296
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,845
Xinya.

297
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:49,565
Lan Xinya.

298
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,085
Xinya, open the door!

299
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,325
Lan Xinya, open the door!

300
00:16:58,445 --> 00:16:59,285
Xinya.

301
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,964
Situ Feng, hurry, go check on Xinya.

302
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,484
She didn't have dinner.
So I wanted to bring her some snacks.

303
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:27,724
I knocked on her door,
but she didn't answer.

304
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:30,124
I asked the reception.
No one saw her leave the hotel.

305
00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:32,285
What? Let's go and take a look.

306
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,845
What should we do?

307
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,205
Xinya!

308
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:37,245
Xinya!

309
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:38,765
Xinya!

310
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,045
Situ Feng, what's the matter?

311
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,685
Chen Qingqing, you'd better pray
that she's all right.

312
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,485
If anything happens to Xinya,
I will not let you go.

313
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:52,365
Step aside. The manager
is going to open the door.

314
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:53,405
Sir, it's this room.

315
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:58,085
Hey!

316
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:01,485
-Xinya.
-Xinya.

317
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:02,405
Wake up.

318
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:03,365
What's going on?

319
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,565
Sleeping pills.

320
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:08,045
Qingqing, how is she?

321
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,685
She still has a pulse.
Hurry, take her to the hospital.

322
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:15,645
Open the door.

323
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:17,405
Let me.

324
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:19,285
Chen Qingqing, don't cause more trouble.

325
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,605
If you weren't here,
things wouldn't have been like this.

326
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,125
Doctor, Is my daughter all right?

327
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:32,565
Don't worry.

328
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,765
The patient is now in a stable condition.

329
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:36,005
She needs to get some rest.

330
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:37,765
Please don't disturb her.

331
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:40,565
Okay.

332
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:06,205
Hello, Grandpa.

333
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:08,365
Why did you call me so early?

334
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,165
Did you stay up late working?

335
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:12,165
No.

336
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:15,925
I couldn't sleep
because I was missing you.

337
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:20,125
Qingqing, where are you now?

338
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:21,245
Me?

339
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:25,805
I'm with a friend right now.

340
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:29,445
What's the matter, Grandpa?

341
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,245
Have you started coughing again?

342
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:33,805
No, I'm all right.

343
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:36,605
My throat itched, that's all.

344
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:37,765
Grandpa.

345
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:40,325
Don't lie to me like I'm a three-year-old.

346
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,765
Have you fallen ill again?

347
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,205
Where are you?

348
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:46,085
I'm at home.

349
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:47,325
Wait for me, Grandpa.

350
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,685
I'm going to get a plane ticket
and fly home right away.

351
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:51,445
Wait for me. I'll be home soon.

352
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:07,525
Lan Xinya.

353
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,485
Is she all right?

354
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:11,405
She should be fine.

355
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:13,205
They've pumped her stomach.

356
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:17,045
The doctor said that she'll need
to be hospitalized for a couple of days.

357
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,765
I'm glad to hear that.

358
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,285
My grandpa just called me.

359
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:23,725
He has fallen ill.

360
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,725
So I have to go back
to Jincheng right away.

361
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:31,485
Okay.

362
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:34,245
Take good care of your grandpa.

363
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:41,245
I should get going.
Take care of Lan Xinya.

364
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:45,445
Okay.

365
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:53,485
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

366
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:57,285
Come back soon.

367
00:20:58,165 --> 00:20:59,245
Okay.

368
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:03,885
I'll miss you.

369
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:05,965
Me too.

370
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,085
I'll get going now.

371
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,365
JINCHENG

372
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:30,045
Sir, could you please drive faster?

373
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:30,965
Okay.

374
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:46,565
Grandpa.

375
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:51,085
I came back to see you.

376
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,165
Xinya.

377
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,245
How are you doing? Are you feeling better?

378
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:09,845
Do you want some water?

379
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:18,565
Xinya.

380
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:35,365
Just get ready to become Situ Feng's wife.

381
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:39,205
Situ Feng, come to the hospital now.
Something happened to Xinya.

382
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,405
What if

383
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:43,685
I can't come back to Yuncheng?

384
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:44,965
What will you do?

385
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:46,365
No matter how deep their love is,

386
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,245
but if they can't see each other,

387
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,805
their feelings will definitely fade.

388
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,165
Situ Feng.

389
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,365
What the hell is this?

390
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,645
What do you mean I need to sign
a non-disclosure agreement?

391
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:56,165
How could you do this to Qingqing?

392
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:58,245
The heir of the Chen Family,
the most prestigious

393
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:00,365
out of the four great families
in Jincheng,

394
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:03,285
is going to be someone's mistress.

395
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:07,685
