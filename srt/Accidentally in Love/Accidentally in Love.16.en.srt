A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:58,405
EPISODE 16

3
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,365
-Qingchen.
-Yes?

4
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,565
I'm sorry for letting you down.

5
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:13,685
You're beautiful.

6
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:15,525
You'll find love one day.

7
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,925
Was what I said earlier too harsh for you?

8
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,525
No.

9
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:34,605
It's good that
you're able to find someone you love.

10
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,565
You can forget what I said earlier.

11
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:39,125
It doesn't bother me.

12
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:46,725
-Hey, Qingchen.
-Yes?

13
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,005
What do you think of Gu Nanxi?

14
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,365
-Actually, he really likes--
-Hey!

15
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:53,605
-Who's there?
-Who's there?

16
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:57,805
-Gu Nanxi?
-Gu Nanxi?

17
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,685
You're finally here.

18
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,245
I thought I'd have to spend my night here.

19
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:05,725
I just got here
and I didn't hear anything.

20
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:11,285
Hello, Xinya.

21
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:13,165
I've found them.

22
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:17,285
Yes, they're both all right.
You don't have to worry now.

23
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,165
When you're coming with the rescue crew,

24
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:21,805
just take the path on the right.

25
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,245
We'll be waiting for you here.

26
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:30,485
That's odd.

27
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:32,485
How did Chen Qingqing get home yesterday?

28
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,245
She said she wasn't feeling well

29
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:38,205
so she took the college bus
and came back to the campus.

30
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:41,325
That's typical of Chen Qingqing.
She always keeps things to herself.

31
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,525
She left without telling anyone
even though she was sick.

32
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,285
Oh, right.

33
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:48,205
Did she find out what happened
at the cave?

34
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:51,005
She seemed furious
whenever I mentioned Qingchen.

35
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,165
She's probably jealous.

36
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:55,645
Gosh, she must be imagining things.

37
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:57,765
Do you really

38
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,045
not have a clue?

39
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:08,365
I think I know.

40
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:11,805
Does Chen Qingqing like Qingchen?

41
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:15,565
Gosh, that's impossible!

42
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,404
Fangfang, what a coincidence.

43
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:23,805
-Are you heading to class?
-Yes, I was just from the dorm.

44
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:29,885
Where's Qingqing?

45
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:31,925
She's not feeling very well.

46
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,605
It might be something she ate yesterday.

47
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,085
I'm going to call in sick for her.

48
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:36,085
Is she doing okay?

49
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:37,565
-I should go and see her.
-Don't.

50
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:39,725
She asked me to tell you
not to go see her.

51
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,125
What? Why?

52
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,165
It's probably because
she doesn't look too good now.

53
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:46,565
You're not allowed to go
into the girls' dorm anyway.

54
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:47,805
That's true.

55
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,645
Feng, since Fangfang has said so,

56
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,085
let's not disturb Qingqing.

57
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:55,485
We should go to class now.

58
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:57,765
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

59
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:07,925
Hi, Mr. Zhou.

60
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,365
I'm so sorry!

61
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:16,925
I'm sorry!

62
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:25,565
Attention to all students, we're
conducting our health inspection tomorrow.

63
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:27,685
Please clean your rooms.

64
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:30,285
Do not throw your trash on the staircase.

65
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,725
Be considerate.

66
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:36,165
Excuse me.

67
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,845
You're so pretty.
You must have a very good taste.

68
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:56,485
Here.

69
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:58,365
Give me some suggestions.

70
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:00,045
Tell me which bag will suit me better.

71
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:03,765
This one.

72
00:07:05,445 --> 00:07:07,845
Young people really have good taste.

73
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:10,485
This bag looks really good.

74
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,005
And it's not too expensive.

75
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:14,405
Goodness.

76
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:16,325
Why didn't I think of it before?

77
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:18,685
Hey...

78
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:22,125
Where did she go?

79
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:24,605
That was quick! People these days.

80
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,045
QINGQING, FANGFANG

81
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:29,765
Chen Qingqing.

82
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:31,645
Situ Feng?

83
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:34,045
Why did he come here?

84
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,845
Why is he here at this hour?

85
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,765
Chen Qingqing.

86
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,725
Chen Qingqing.

87
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,805
Qingqing, are you still alive?

88
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:05,685
Qingqing.

89
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,805
It's me, Situ Feng.

90
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:13,725
Situ Feng.

91
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,565
Do you find pleasure in dressing up?

92
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:16,885
Are you crazy?

93
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:20,165
Yes, I'm crazy.

94
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:23,445
If I didn't dress up like this,
how am I supposed to see you?

95
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:29,205
You...

96
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:30,805
What happened to your forehead?

97
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:34,125
This...

98
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:36,765
When I was sleeping,
I accidentally bumped my head.

99
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:37,885
It's not a big deal.

100
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,284
Why are you so careless?

101
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:42,325
Well...

102
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,005
Why did you come to my room?

103
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:46,445
Excuse me, miss.

104
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,445
You were absent for the whole day.

105
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,765
I was worried you were dead.

106
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:53,645
-Stop cursing me.
-Enough.

107
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:55,205
Stop fooling around.

108
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:57,605
Fangfang said you haven't eaten anything.

109
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,245
I brought food for you.

110
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:06,325
Look!

111
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:09,685
It's Boston lobster pasta.

112
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,525
How did you know it's one of my favorites?

113
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:14,005
Well, that's because,
on the first day of school

114
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:17,325
you specifically asked
for Boston lobster pasta for lunch.

115
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:20,405
It was such a random request,
how could I not remember it?

116
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:22,645
Hurry up, eat it while it's warm.
How does it taste?

117
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:24,805
-It's good?
-Is it good!

118
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:26,045
Where did you get it?

119
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:29,525
I personally made it myself.

120
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:31,325
I don't just cook for anyone.

121
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,125
You'd better cherish it.

122
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:35,445
Don't be smug.

123
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:37,685
Don't eat too fast.

124
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:49,325
You...

125
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:52,245
Why are you staring at me?

126
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:59,125
How exactly did you
hurt yourself while you were sleeping?

127
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:01,325
Were you sleepwalking?

128
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:02,845
That's not what happened.

129
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:12,805
The egg is still warm.
I can rub your forehead for you.

130
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:15,085
-Don't--
-Don't move.

131
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:26,965
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

132
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:29,645
When did you start learning how to cook?

133
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:32,445
When I was little.

134
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,325
I was always home alone.

135
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,245
That's when I began to cook.

136
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,045
That's good for you.

137
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,765
By the way, Qingqing--

138
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,445
Pervert!

139
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:49,685
-Fangfang!
-Don't you worry, Qingqing.

140
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:51,045
-I will catch him for you!
-Wait!

141
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,485
Fangfang!

142
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:55,485
Stop running, you pervert!

143
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:56,925
We need to catch this pervert!

144
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:58,885
Let's hit him hard!

145
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,645
-Stop right there!
-Catch that pervert!

146
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:15,885
Excuse me.

147
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:17,725
Are you all right, Qingqing?

148
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,725
I'm fine, thanks, Fangfang.

149
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:27,605
-Fangfang!
-Hey, Fangfang.

150
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,285
What exactly happened yesterday?

151
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:32,605
There was a pervert who dressed up
as a girl yesterday.

152
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:34,485
His legs were really hairy.

153
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:36,165
What did he look like?

154
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:37,525
Yes, what did he look like?

155
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:40,005
He was wearing a dress,
but his hair was short like a guy.

156
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:42,325
I couldn't really see his face.

157
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:44,525
-What a weirdo.
-Goodness.

158
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:45,965
Luckily, I went back in time.

159
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,765
He wasn't able to do anything to Qingqing.

160
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:51,205
-Great job, Fangfang.
-Great job.

161
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:52,925
Situ Feng.

162
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:57,205
Do you have any idea about the pervert
they were talking about?

163
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:58,125
Me?

164
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:00,565
How would I know?

165
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,165
I'm glad nothing happened to Qingqing.

166
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:05,325
That's odd.

167
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,485
Shouldn't you be worried
about Chen Qingqing?

168
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:08,925
I am.

169
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:11,525
I'm worried. I am really worried.

170
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,525
All right.

171
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:33,165
Hey.

172
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,085
You're finally here for class.

173
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:39,085
Yes.

174
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:42,765
Qingqing, were you all right yesterday

175
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:45,045
after being harassed by that pervert?

176
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,045
I'm fine.

177
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:52,925
That's a relief.

178
00:12:58,605 --> 00:12:59,565
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

179
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,845
The lecturer is looking for you.
It looked like it was serious.

180
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,285
-Now?
-Yes.

181
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,645
Were you looking for me, Ms. Chen?

182
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:25,365
Qingqing.

183
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:27,645
The reason you came to this college

184
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,965
was because of your dad, wasn't it?

185
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:32,325
Yes.

186
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,525
Recently,

187
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,325
I've been trying to look into it as well.

188
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,365
It seems like your parents

189
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,645
got into an accident
while they were eloping.

190
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,485
I think...

191
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:54,965
INFLUENTIAL FAMILY IN JINCHENG

192
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:58,405
I think the news was going to affect
Ming De College's reputation.

193
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:03,925
Back then, the news was kept hidden.

194
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,485
But...

195
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:10,005
But my grandpa told me...

196
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:14,685
Qingqing.

197
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:16,885
Perhaps your grandpa kept this a secret

198
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,285
for your own good.

199
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,245
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

200
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,845
Hello, Qingqing.

201
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:41,245
Grandpa.

202
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:45,045
My parents passed away
in a car accident, right?

203
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:49,925
My mom didn't die of an illness.

204
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,765
My dad didn't leave to enjoy his life.

205
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:55,605
They were being pushed to the edge by you.

206
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:59,605
That's how they got
into an accident, am I right?

207
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:00,965
Qingqing.

208
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,805
I was only doing this for your own good.

209
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:07,165
So it was all a lie.

210
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:08,725
Liar!

211
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,165
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

212
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:14,805
I don't want to listen to you.

213
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:28,245
That is Mr. Xiao Jingnan.

214
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,845
He's an honorary alumnus of our school.

215
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:32,125
He used to be
the president of the School Council

216
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:34,205
and has made great contributions
to the school.

217
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,845
XIAO JINGNAN

218
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,725
CHEN YOUYOU

219
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:47,765
Your mom was like a hero.

220
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,285
Ever since I got to know her,

221
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:52,165
she has been helping me, caring for me

222
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:53,925
This photo was taken

223
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:56,525
when your parents first met.

224
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:58,765
Two people who really love each other

225
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:00,525
will surely outdo themselves

226
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:02,245
for one another.

227
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:03,405
Qingqing.

228
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,565
We wanted to tell you

229
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:07,405
that you're a smart and beautiful girl.

230
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:09,565
We are proud of you.

231
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:13,965
But more than that, we hope you will be

232
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,365
a happy and brave girl

233
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:18,565
and go after the life you want.

234
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:04,325
She's over there.

235
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:08,925
-Qingqing.
-Qingqing.

236
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,124
-Qingqing.
-What happened?

237
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,124
What's going on?

238
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,805
I'm afraid I have to leave this college.

239
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,324
My dad...

240
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:24,565
He has passed away.

241
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,405
I was hopeful

242
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:39,325
when I first came to this college.

243
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,405
I thought this is how I could find my dad.

244
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:46,845
But...

245
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:51,445
After hearing the news,

246
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,245
I don't see hope anymore.

247
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:57,885
Everything is shattered.

248
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,605
Should I stay?

249
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:06,685
I'm not sure.

250
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,445
I feel like

251
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,405
everything has lost

252
00:18:15,645 --> 00:18:17,445
its meaning.

253
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:19,925
That's not true.

254
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:20,845
Qingqing.

255
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:22,645
You still have us.

256
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:24,405
We're all your friends.

257
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:28,565
You still have a reason to stay
at Ming De College.

258
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:32,845
You must remember

259
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,125
that you're never alone.

260
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:39,485
Qingqing.

261
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:43,885
Don't go.

262
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,565
Chen Qingqing.

263
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:00,725
Was I not clear about this?

264
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,885
It has been a long day.
Is that all that you've done?

265
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,365
What's going on, Xinya?

266
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:08,565
Mr. Gu.

267
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:10,565
It's good that you're here.

268
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:12,605
I told her to organize
the files for the freshmen.

269
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,045
She mixed up all the files
for the sophomores and the juniors.

270
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,245
Even the order of arrangements
were all wrong.

271
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:18,205
I don't care.

272
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:21,365
You have to complete
all these files today.

273
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:22,325
Okay.

274
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,725
I will bring them home with me
to finish them

275
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:26,845
and submit them to you by tomorrow.

276
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:28,485
Remember your promise.

277
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:30,045
Don't forget.

278
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:40,645
Qingqing, let me help you.

279
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,285
Thanks.

280
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,805
I will help you with the files.

281
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:51,445
You should go back and rest.

282
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:53,365
Leave these to me.

283
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,125
I can't do that.

284
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:58,045
This is my responsibility.

285
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,445
Don't be so hard on yourself.

286
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:02,645
Given your current state,

287
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:05,885
it might take forever
to finish all these files.

288
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:08,485
Qingqing.

289
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:12,725
Do you still remember what I told you
back at the campsite?

290
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,405
If you ever need help,

291
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:16,765
you should come look and for me.

292
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,165
Never keep it to yourself.

293
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:25,565
Go back and rest.

294
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,365
I'm heading over to the office now.

295
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:28,765
Okay.

296
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,165
Thank you so much.

297
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:33,005
Don't mention it.

298
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:51,605
CHEN QINGQING, DATE OF BIRTH,
JANUARY 30, 1999

299
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:03,085
Fangfang.

300
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:05,365
Why did you bring me here?

301
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:09,805
You've been staying in campus
most of the time.

302
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:11,685
We should get out sometime.

303
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:13,285
Get out?

304
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:17,125
But it's so dark here

305
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:19,685
and there's nothing to see.

306
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:24,805
Fangfang.

307
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:28,405
Fangfang.

308
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,645
Fangfang!

309
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,125
Fangfang.

310
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,125
-Happy Birthday, Qingqing!
-Happy Birthday!

311
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:01,245
Thank you, guys.

312
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,685
How did you know today was my birthday?

313
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:06,205
Baby, you should thank our president.

314
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:10,565
I was organizing some files
and I accidentally saw yours.

315
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:13,045
So I thought of gathering everyone
to celebrate your birthday.

316
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,045
I hope you don't mind.

317
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,485
Of course not!

318
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:17,405
Thank you, Gu Nanxi.

319
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:22,165
Did you put up all these lights?

320
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:23,285
Yes.

321
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:24,525
They look beautiful.

322
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:27,845
Qingqing.

323
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:29,405
Make a wish.

324
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,605
Congratulations, baby.
You're one year older.

325
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,685
You're annoying!

326
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:35,605
Don't mind him.

327
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,685
You will always be 18 years old to us.

328
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:38,845
Hurry up, make a wish.

329
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:55,565
All right, let's have some cake!

330
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:58,405
-Great!
-Wow!

331
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:53,845
It has gone out.

332
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,885
Gu Nanxi, thank you so much.

333
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:01,125
This is the first time in my life

334
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:03,965
to celebrate my birthday with my friends.

335
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,125
I'm very happy tonight.

336
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,525
I feel very lucky
to have all of you as my friends.

337
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:13,085
Actually, I am not the only one
you should thank.

338
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:15,525
They all took part in this as well.

339
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:19,005
That's right.

340
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:22,085
I have prepared a mystery gift
for all of you.

341
00:24:22,165 --> 00:24:23,205
What mystery gift?

342
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:24,285
Please tell us!

343
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,205
This mystery gift
can't be opened under the tree.

344
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:28,485
What is it?

345
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:31,645
You're annoying.
All this mystery is killing me.

346
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:34,925
Gu Nanxi, stop beating around the bush.
Tell us now.

347
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:35,885
All right.

348
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:38,725
I'm sure all of you are going
to love this gift.

349
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:40,165
Especially you, Qingqing.

350
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:41,405
-Really?
-Yes.

351
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,005
Everyone, come with me.

352
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,605
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

353
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:52,085
We're here.

354
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:54,965
This is the place?

355
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:57,605
-Baby, there's nothing here.
-That's right.

356
00:24:57,685 --> 00:24:59,165
Wait for me here.

357
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:00,365
I'll be back.

358
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:02,045
Make sure no one leaves, okay?

359
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:03,725
Wait for me.

360
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:07,365
Gosh.

361
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,125
I left my bag back there.

362
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:11,365
I need to go back and get it.

363
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:12,605
Qingqing, it's dark out there.

364
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:14,725
-Let me go with you.
-Okay.

365
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:16,205
Wait for us.

366
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:25,125
-Hello?
-Yes, Mom?

367
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:27,125
What? Something went wrong
with the budget?

368
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:29,125
-I'm coming now.
-Okay, I'm coming home now.

369
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:31,925
-Sorry, I have to head back.
-Sorry, I have to head back.

370
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:40,045
It's right here.

371
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,645
CHEN YOUYOU

372
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:39,045
Qingqing.

373
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,165
Where's everyone?

374
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:20,365
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

375
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,965
It's almost midnight.
I have a present for you.

376
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:24,925
It's a song.

377
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:26,805
It's called "Soulmate."

378
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:39,085
That day you asked

379
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:43,925
Are there lights in the dark

380
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:49,725
I looked up facing the stars

381
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:56,765
Wondering about the world

382
00:27:57,365 --> 00:28:01,245
Wanting to share everything with you

383
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:12,325
Brutal wind, damaged sprouts

384
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:18,845
Spring will lose its meanings

385
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,405
Light breeze

386
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:25,765
Dreams and scents

387
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:30,605
Home is where you are

388
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:38,205
I'm waiting by the stars

389
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:43,525
The crescent of your eyes

390
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:51,805
Melody lingering about like the wind

391
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:58,725
Always by your side

392
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:07,845
Situ Feng.

393
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:10,125
Thank you for singing for me.

394
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:16,125
This song

395
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:19,365
was my mom's favorite song.

396
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,405
Then...

397
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:23,605
she fell ill

398
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:25,365
and passed away.

399
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:27,445
Situ Feng.

400
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:30,445
I remember

401
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:32,885
before my mom left me

402
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:34,845
she said

403
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:38,285
if she's not around anymore,

404
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:42,845
she will turn into a star
to look after me.

405
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:46,645
I believe your parents would be the same.

406
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:49,805
Even though

407
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:51,685
they are gone,

408
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:53,885
but they have

409
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:57,765
influenced our lives forever.

410
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:11,565
Dear Mom and Dad.

411
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:15,445
Are you both

412
00:30:18,365 --> 00:30:19,725
doing well up there?

413
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:29,645
When I was little,

414
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:31,005
my mom gave me this guitar pick.

415
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:35,245
I turned it into a necklace,
hoping it'd bring me good luck.

416
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:38,205
Now, I'm giving it to you.

417
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,245
I hope it will bring you good luck too.

418
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:42,325
Situ Feng.

419
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:44,845
This is such a precious item to you.

420
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:46,525
Are you sure you want to give it to me?

421
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:49,165
Why? Do you think I'm a petty person?

422
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,405
That song was not the only gift, okay?

423
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:55,525
Try it on.

424
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:06,485
Thank you, Situ Feng.

425
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,885
I promise to cherish it for you.

426
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:34,645
To think I actually prepared
fireworks for them

427
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:37,645
and they left me hanging,
to be all romantic with one another.

428
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,725
Why do I always end up
helping other people?

429
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:47,285
I am not going to set off the fireworks
this time.

430
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:52,645
Situ Feng, look at the fireworks.

431
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:54,885
It's rare to have fireworks at this hour.

432
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:56,045
Who set off the fireworks?

433
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,085
It's beautiful.

434
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:00,405
Perhaps

435
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:03,005
it was your necklace
that brought us the fireworks.

436
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:17,325
Chen Qingqing!

437
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:19,245
Stay away from Situ Feng from now on.

438
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:21,005
Isn't this Situ Feng's necklace?

439
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:21,925
Why is it with you?

440
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:25,045
-Qingqing.
-Lin Yiyang!

441
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,565
Didn't I tell you?
Don't lay your hands on Chen Qingqing.

442
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,365
This is helium.

443
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:36,805
It will create a magical effect
when people inhale it.

444
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:39,925
Fangfang!

445
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:43,125
Qingqing, we need to find Situ Feng
as soon as possible.

446
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:46,765
This isn't the first time he disappeared.

447
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:50,445
