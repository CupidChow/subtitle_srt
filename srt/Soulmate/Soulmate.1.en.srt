1
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,230
One moment, I'll
turn on the lights.

2
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,010
Could you follow me?

3
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,190
<i>KIM Da-mi</i>

4
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,640
The gallery is downstairs.

5
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,790
Watch your step.

6
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,810
<i>JEON So-nee</i>

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,290
This way, please.

8
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,520
<i>BYUN Woo-seok</i>

9
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,550
<i>Directed by MIN Yong-keun</i>

10
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,730
This is you, right?

11
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,930
Take a closer look.

12
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,410
It look like a photo
but it's a drawing.

13
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,290
It's hyperrealism.

14
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,360
This entire drawing
was done with a pencil.

15
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,660
This piece won our
gallery's recent contest,

16
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,790
aside from the name 'Ha-eun, '
there was no other information.

17
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,520
The director would like to
sign her as in-house artist,

18
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,760
but we can't reach her.

19
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,940
We sent an email
but no response.

20
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,030
I know that she's
close friends with you.

21
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,750
If you're in touch with her,
could you introduce us?

22
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,470
I don't really know her.

23
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,400
We had run-ins as children.

24
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,190
That wasn't the case at all.

25
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,120
While searching
online with her email,

26
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,700
we came across a blog.

27
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,300
<i>Summer Milky Way</i>

28
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,460
There were posts about you two.

29
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,210
It looked like you
two were very close.

30
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,500
This is a printout of the blog.

31
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,450
<i>Ahn Mi-so / Ko Ha-eun</i>

32
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,770
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

33
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,950
Mi-so!

34
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,750
It's been a while.

35
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, indeed.

36
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,460
Are you in touch with Ha-eun?

37
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,610
We lost touch a while ago.

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,520
I thought you two would last.

39
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,830
We were kids back then.

40
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,620
By the way, what
brings you here?

41
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,220
Mr. Ham Jin-woo?

42
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,740
- Hello.
- Evening.

43
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,360
One sec.

44
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,650
Thank you for coming.

45
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,270
I'm curator Kang Mal-geum.

46
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
Hi.

47
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,320
Shall we talk inside?

48
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,380
Mi-so!

49
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,240
<i>Spring, 2001, Graduation</i>

50
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,050
<i>Summer Milky Way</i>

51
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,530
<i>Summer, 1998</i>

52
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,070
<i>I remember the cicadas
when I think about those days.</i>

53
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,160
<i>They sounded sluggish somehow.</i>

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,280
<i>It was a hot day, and
the class was boring.</i>

55
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,860
<i>One that sluggish
day, you came along.</i>

56
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,900
'Who' is gathering
'what' from 'where'?

57
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,780
Now, we can replace 'who'
with 'aunt', and 'what' with...

58
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,020
- Location.
- That's right.

59
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,490
One moment.

60
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,970
Hello.

61
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,320
I brought you the new student.

62
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,390
I see.

63
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,710
Come in.

64
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,000
We got a new student from Seoul.

65
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,640
Could you introduce yourself?

66
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,640
Ahn Mi-so.

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,400
Ahn Mi-so.

68
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,740
And? Do you want to say
anything to the class?

69
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,850
All right, do you see that desk?

70
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,800
Go sit over there.

71
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,420
Okay, let's continue.

72
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,050
'Where' is where? What is this referring to?

73
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,740
So this has to be a location.

74
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,060
And when referring
to gathering...

75
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,140
Ahn Mi-so!

76
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,410
Ahn Mi-so!

77
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,620
Get back here!

78
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,560
Ahn Mi-so!
Stop right there!

79
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
Hey!

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,220
Ahn Mi-so!

81
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,620
Your bag!

82
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,400
Take it, you left it.

83
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,930
come up, stairs are over there!

84
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,590
Why not?

85
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,480
I can't go anywhere
high, I'm scared.

86
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,490
When you're scared, just squint.

87
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,770
It's less scary.

88
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,260
What's your name?

89
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Ko Ha-eun.

90
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Ha-eun?

91
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,640
Does it mean 'summer'
and 'Milky Way'?

92
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,740
Summer Milky Way?

93
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,470
Not for Milky Way,
it means 'gentle'.

94
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,310
'Gentle summer' is boring.

95
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,050
Go with 'Summer Milky Way.'

96
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,880
The 'Mi-so' literally
means smile?

97
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,320
Probably.

98
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,460
Then why don't you ever smile?

99
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,510
I don't?

100
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:19,100
No, not at school,
not right now.

101
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:28,590
Because Ahn means 'not'?

102
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,410
She's drenched.

103
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,320
It's okay.

104
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,240
What do we do?

105
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,200
It's okay, kitty.

106
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,460
Could you wipe her?

107
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,530
What's that?

108
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,100
She was alone in the
rain, so I brought her.

109
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,750
And her?

110
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,950
My friend.

111
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,800
Wash up quickly, let's eat.

112
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,170
Isn't it stuffy wearing these?

113
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,730
It is.

114
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,250
- Why do you wear it?
- I dunno.

115
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,140
Girls are supposed
to suck it up,

116
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,090
so it becomes comfy later.

117
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,290
I won't wear it when I
grow up, I hate feeling stuffy.

118
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,450
Ha-eun, not again?

119
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,520
Carrots are sucky.

120
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,560
I told you eat
what you're given.

121
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,130
Your mom and I raised
the crop ourselves.

122
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,620
I still hate it!

123
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,820
Put them back in.

124
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,890
You're embarrassing
yourself in front of your friend!

125
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,410
Let her be, don't
force it on her!

126
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,340
She'll eat it herself
when she grows up.

127
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,560
She became a picky eater
because you baby her.

128
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
Eat what you're given.

129
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,670
That's enough, you're stubborn
like others in your family.

130
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,280
Not at the table...

131
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,580
I can't eat these...

132
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,730
But I like carrots.

133
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,350
Cool! I'll eat broccoli.

134
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,630
Problem solved.

135
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,960
Carrots for Mi-so,
broccoli for Ha-eun.

136
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,190
Happy?

137
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Jeez!

138
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Here.

139
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
One sec.

140
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Here.

141
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,460
Good evening, I'm so sorry.

142
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,270
Hello...

143
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Come here.

144
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,620
Can't you call me and
tell me where you are?

145
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,170
And why did you run off like
that, you embarrassed me.

146
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,860
I said I don't want
to go to school.

147
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,040
I'll transfer again soon anyway.

148
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,690
I told you, not this time!

149
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,550
You said the same
thing in Bucheon.

150
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,890
And Gangneung too.

151
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,220
How many times
already this year?

152
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Ahn Mi-so!

153
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,840
When his situation improves,
he'll bring us back to Seoul!

154
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,460
You're not the only
one, I'm sick of this too!

155
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,020
You only care about yourself...

156
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,500
It looks the same,
will you be an artist?

157
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,990
No.

158
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,350
Why? You draw so well.

159
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,910
Dad said artist starve to death.

160
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Try it too.

161
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,350
I don't draw so well...

162
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,200
Doesn't matter, anyone can draw.

163
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,380
What should we call her?

164
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,170
I have a name in mind.

165
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,070
What?

166
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,060
'Mom'.

167
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,810
'Mom'?

168
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,030
You can't call a cat that.

169
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,250
But you can call
it affectionately.

170
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,210
Mom!

171
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,070
Mom!

172
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,600
Mom!

173
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,530
This is her?
Which way is up?

174
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,850
These are eyes, legs here.

175
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,420
And her feelings.

176
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:28,706
Feelings?

177
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,400
You drew that too?

178
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,630
Yeah!

179
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,400
Is it weird?

180
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
No.

181
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,930
<i>That's when I first realized,
feelings can be drawn too.</i>

182
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,360
<i>You'd moved me with
weird words at times.</i>

183
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,580
<i>Same thing happened
when your mom moved back.</i>

184
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,870
<i>I didn't say anything
and just felt sad,</i>

185
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,500
<i>but you said we'd
never be apart.</i>

186
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,490
<i>You'd rather stay in Jeju alone.</i>

187
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,670
<i>We were able to stay together</i>

188
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,570
<i>because of what you said.</i>

189
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,170
Mi-so.

190
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,680
You think you're Picasso?

191
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,730
Stick with the basics, okay?

192
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,000
Okay.

193
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,440
<i>Skip class and come
out to the front gate.</i>

194
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,540
Then this poetry is
about waiting for peonies,

195
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,780
and sadness that came
after spring, but he still waits.

196
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,850
It's a misconception that
peonies symbolize 'independence'.

197
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:30,480
What's wrong?
You got a fever?

198
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,150
I had a sore throat
since the morning...

199
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,210
I think the fever's
getting worse.

200
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,070
All right, head home
and get some rest.

201
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,710
Ko Ha-eun!

202
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,650
Ha-eun, you're evolving.

203
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,450
It felt so stuffy,
I almost died.

204
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,520
I had club activity, so I
left, no one looks for me.

205
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,020
What's going on today?

206
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,870
Your birthday's tomorrow,
let's get your ears pierced.

207
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,260
Why do that for my birthday?

208
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,480
Or you'll never get pierced.

209
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
What?

210
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,870
You need someone to
push you into doing it.

211
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,870
It's good for blood
circulation too,

212
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,160
it's good for you, me,
someone's sister, and others too.

213
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,890
Bullshitting again.

214
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,130
One, two, three, four!

215
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,230
One, two, three!

216
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,380
You did good.

217
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,240
It really doesn't hurt?

218
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,290
It stings for a second.

219
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,320
Pain is temporary, and
pleasure is permanent.

220
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,790
It's not the other way?

221
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,940
No, it changed recently.

222
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,030
One, two...

223
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,490
Hold on!

224
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,610
You have to do it
after three, okay?

225
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,580
Don't do it on three.

226
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,070
I'll count to three, and then do
it, so stay still, or you'll get hurt.

227
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,550
One, two, three!

228
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,220
What was that?

229
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,330
Why did that fall?

230
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,480
Oh man, come on...

231
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,270
Did you knock them
over with your bag?

232
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,550
No, I wasn't doing anything,

233
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,410
they just fell by themselves.

234
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,210
How could they
fall on their own?

235
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,750
What a load of crap.

236
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,530
Those cost over
$100, what did you do?

237
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,540
How could they cost that much?

238
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,230
They look a few bucks each.

239
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,620
We'll compensate you.

240
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,940
If thet're so expensive,
why put them by the door?

241
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,030
Stop it.

242
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,340
Sir, we'll pay you for them.

243
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,560
I've never seen such a brat!

244
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,030
You broke them, yet
you show no remorse.

245
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,620
Which school do you go to?

246
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,380
You look like a
trade school student.

247
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,600
Are you badmouthing
trade schools?

248
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,630
You got an anger issue,
you dumb trade schooler!

249
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,610
Sir, don't do that!

250
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,100
We got a set of lunatics!

251
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,060
Ha-eun, let's just go,
he's not worth the fight.

252
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,760
Where are you going?
Get back here!

253
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,980
Pay for the damages!

254
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,530
Get back here!

255
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
You brats!

256
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,160
You bitches!

257
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,900
Just wait till I catch you!

258
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,180
Stop right there!

259
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,910
Stop, you brats!

260
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,540
I'm gonna kill you two!

261
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,940
I'll see you in a bit!

262
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,650
What?

263
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,490
You said you'll pay!

264
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,840
Stop right there!
Just pay the cost price!

265
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Mi-so.

266
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,640
Try this drink.

267
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,640
Carrot drinks
are good for girls.

268
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,200
Wow, thank you.

269
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,810
You got no manners,
you brought just one?

270
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,880
You hate carrots!

271
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,850
You could've brought
mom's sweet rive drink.

272
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,800
Now you're ordering me around?

273
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,050
If you want it,
you can go grab it.

274
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,560
Sometimes I wonder
which one's your daughter.

275
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,240
- Mi-so.
- Yes?

276
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,200
Isn't is tough
working at the hostel?

277
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,410
It's fine, I got a roof
over my head too.

278
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,310
Does your mom call often?

279
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,690
No.

280
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,140
No news is good news.

281
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,220
When things get tough,
don't hesitate so talk to me.

282
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,780
You're pretty and
talented, so it's all up to you.

283
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,050
Got it?

284
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,890
Yup.

285
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,890
Boss, I'm here!

286
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Hey there.

287
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,920
Mind if my friend sleeps over?

288
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,360
- Good evening?
- Hey.

289
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,490
It's childish, right?

290
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,810
Nope.

291
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,830
The art teacher complimented
you, she said you got talent.

292
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,970
That's weird, she
always belittles me.

293
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,780
You can't drink after
getting a piercing.

294
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,930
Why not?

295
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,010
You already drank so much.

296
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,870
I'm still sober, so sober!

297
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,800
It's red already.

298
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,500
Whose song is this?

299
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,520
Janis Joplin.

300
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,150
- Oldie?
- Yeah.

301
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,490
She's the real deal,
her songs are too.

302
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,390
Why?

303
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,230
She died at the age of 27.

304
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,800
What's that got to do with
her being the real deal?

305
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,790
She died in her prime.

306
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,150
She sang with everything
she's got with this voice.

307
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,200
I want to live like
crazy for 10 years,

308
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,040
and die at 27.

309
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,450
What about me then?

310
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,650
You gotta live till
100, live my share too.

311
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,610
I'm kidding, you look so drunk.

312
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,390
If you die before
me, I'll kill you.

313
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,970
Fine, fine.

314
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,850
I'll live till I'm old and wrinkly,
and I'll paint the wall with shit.

315
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,540
Forget it, who's
gonna clean that up?

316
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,060
Who else, you!
You!

317
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,850
- Stop it, I'll get wrinkles!
- Who cares!

318
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,640
Stop it, stop!

319
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,070
Wait a minute,
something's on you, it's you!

320
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,570
Ha-eun.

321
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,930
Let's get breakfast.

322
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,250
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

323
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,790
Where are we?

324
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,190
A resort that went bust,
I guess no one bought it.

325
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
So I took it over.

326
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,680
Please come in!

327
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,260
Tada!

328
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Tada again!

329
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,280
It's got your initials,
this is H and E.

330
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,730
That's why you told me
to get pierced yesterday?

331
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,860
Yes.

332
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,230
But you only got one ear done,
so wear the other one later.

333
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,990
Put it on for me.

334
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,380
It'll hurt right now
because of swelling.

335
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,650
It's okay, I can suck it up.

336
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,020
All done.

337
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,380
You wear this until I
get the other ear pierced.

338
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,750
Come here, I'll
put it on for you.

339
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,370
I'll ride the Trans-Siberian
train to Lake Baikal first.

340
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,160
Then off to France to learn
to paint and attend galleries.

341
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,640
And from Spain, you can
hop on a ferry to Morocco.

342
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,400
So I'll do a full circle
around North Africa.

343
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,310
Come with me.

344
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,510
You know I can't fly,
I'm afraid of heights..

345
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,600
We can get to Vladivostok
on a ferry, so it's okay.

346
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,900
Travel, learn to paint.

347
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,240
You said you wanted
to live your life painting.

348
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,650
Painting feels so foreign to me.

349
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,470
My dad's dream is for
me to become a teacher.

350
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,150
Let your dad achieve
his own damn dream.

351
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,960
Come with me, please?

352
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,540
It's scary somehow.

353
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,280
What's there to be scare of?
I'll protect you.

354
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,830
Who's protecting whom?
You look so frail.

355
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,860
Lean on me.

356
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,470
You're not my boyfriend,
why should I lean on you?

357
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,890
Whatever, it's not like
you got a boyfriend.

358
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,420
Eh? You do?

359
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,660
I met a guy from Hanra High
basketball club early in the semester.

360
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,470
You're not dating already?

361
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,400
No, we only saw that one time.

362
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,590
There's a club soiree this
weekend, so who knows.

363
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,720
You like him?

364
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,790
I wanna draw.

365
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Draw what?

366
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,310
His face.

367
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,810
You always draw your teacher
on the textbook all the time.

368
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,400
That's different, his
eyes are so pretty.

369
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,970
Why are you so serious?

370
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,790
- We'll head out first.
- Yeah.

371
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
'Panic'?

372
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,350
It's a 'Panic' song.

373
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,000
You like oldies?

374
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,080
Got a girlfriend?
Dated a lot of girls?

375
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,780
Do you know me?

376
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,680
You got a club soiree
this weekend, right?

377
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,070
There's a girl who's
interested in you,

378
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,400
so act properly.

379
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,930
If you're not into her, say
so, but if you do, stick with her.

380
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,930
Don't be vague,
and no heartbreaking.

381
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,490
Are you the one
interested in me?

382
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,310
Piss off.

383
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,290
Don't get ahead of yourself.

384
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,580
Then who are you?

385
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,650
Me?

386
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,190
Janis Joplin.

387
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:11,420
Hey, scooter! Get out of there!

388
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,100
If you see me
again, just ignore me.

389
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,890
Get off the field!

390
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,850
All right.

391
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,220
All right, what's our
soiree's highlight?

392
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,370
Don't play dumb.

393
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,710
It's mating!

394
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,400
Are we animals?
Stop saying 'mating'!

395
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
Coupling!

396
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,220
As per our club's tradition, it's
done with a game of Go-Stop..

397
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,920
If there's someone you
like, shout Go at him.

398
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,180
Then the one selected
now has a choice,

399
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,780
either Go or Stop.

400
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,000
If you don't like him?

401
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,200
Then Go someone else,
or Stop if you like him.

402
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,570
And we got a new couple.

403
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,780
- Okay?
- Okay!

404
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,090
Go.

405
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,510
Whoa.

406
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Go.

407
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,290
Go.

408
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,800
Holy cow!

409
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Go.

410
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,170
Really?

411
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,340
Stop.

412
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,180
That's awesome...

413
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,210
<i>Ha-eun</i>

414
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,370
<i>The person you're
calling is unavailable.</i>

415
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,660
Why do you want to draw me?

416
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,170
I get to know it as I draw.

417
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,690
Know what?

418
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,600
Feelings.

419
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,610
Feelings?

420
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:59,000
When I draw exactly the
same, I get to see my feelings.

421
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,110
I begin to understand
how I feel about this person.

422
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,610
So I have to draw as close
to the real thing as possible.

423
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,770
Without exaggeration.

424
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,240
- Can I take a picture?
- Yeah.

425
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,630
I like you.

426
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,890
To like someone, you
gotta be courageous.

427
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,430
I'm working up the
courage to say this.

428
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,070
<i>Summer, 2004</i>

429
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,250
<i>It didn’t take long to
become close to Jin-woo.</i>

430
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,900
<i>I wanted to bring my 2
favorite people together...</i>

431
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,930
Eh? Sunglasses?
Can you see?

432
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,970
I told you about him,
this is Ham Jin-woo.

433
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Good evening.

434
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,830
This is my BFF.
Ahn Mi-so.

435
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,260
You two are the same
age, so become friends.

436
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,410
I’m gonna hit the
restroom, have a chat.

437
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,290
You’re her, right?
Janis Joplin.

438
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,670
Right?

439
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,270
You are, could I get a 7UP?

440
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,310
No soda to minors,
only alcohol, $10.

441
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,560
What is it?

442
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,170
Sex...

443
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,690
0n the Chilly.

444
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,790
Why does she like you?

445
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
Everything.

446
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,920
Why do you like her?

447
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Everything.

448
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,400
That’s a dumb answer for when
you don’t know that person well.

449
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,650
Then why do you like her?

450
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,680
Her eyes when she
suddenly turns around,

451
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,290
tears after a yawn,

452
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,830
and her 2 front teeth
when she smiles.

453
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,650
And a mole on her right cheek.

454
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,590
She doesn’t have a
mole on her cheek.

455
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,970
She does.

456
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,300
- She doesn’t.
- She does.

457
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,060
She doesn’t.

458
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,380
For the next song,
we’ll bring out our muse.

459
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,240
Ahn Mi-so, come!

460
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,080
Come on, Mi-so!

461
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,760
Ahn Mi-so!

462
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,270
Ahn Mi-so!

463
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,170
Isn’t she cool?

464
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,710
She’s one of a kind.

465
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,900
Sometimes I’m jealous of her.

466
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
How so?

467
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,370
She’s so free.
and also very delicate.

468
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,850
Three.

469
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,530
That's good.

470
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,640
Let's take a photo.

471
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,840
3 seconds!

472
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,460
One, two, three, jump, jump!

473
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,680
One more time, jump higher!

474
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,790
One, two, three!

475
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,420
One, two, three!

476
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,960
Rock, paper, scissors!

477
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,710
Rock, paper, scissors!
Nice!

478
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,310
Three!

479
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,300
Come on!

480
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,700
Jin-woo, you okay?

481
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,650
All good.

482
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,990
Jin-woo, have fun!

483
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,110
What is it?

484
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,070
I think I'm getting a blister.

485
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,460
Are you okay?
Can you continue?

486
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,090
Does it hurt?

487
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,950
You two go on ahead.
I'll stay here.

488
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,630
We gotta make a wish
together, this was your idea!

489
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,390
You can make a wish for me.

490
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,830
Okay.

491
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,310
You stay with her.

492
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,560
I'll make wishes for all of us.

493
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
Mi-so!

494
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,130
Huh?
Without permission?

495
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,840
You looked so happy.

496
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,660
Of course, I'll be back!

497
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,680
Jin-woo, go with her,
she might get hurt.

498
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,550
You sure?

499
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,420
Get going.

500
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,400
Ahn Mi-so!

501
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,130
Is that your guardian?

502
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,860
Yeah, but it's not effective.

503
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,270
And yours?
Why do you always have that?

504
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,030
This? It's called 'byukjomok',

505
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:27,200
it's made from a
lightning-struck jujube tree.

506
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,870
- Lightning?
- Yeah.

507
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,110
It supposedly
wards off misfortune.

508
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,610
I almost died of an illness.
as a kid, but I recovered

509
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,840
after wearing this.

510
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,020
Can I look at it?

511
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,810
It wasn't so bad walking slowly.

512
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,560
Did you make my wish?

513
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,980
Yeah, let's go.

514
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,530
It might be dangerous.

515
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,100
You two take the
bike, I'll go slow on this.

516
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,180
No, it's mine, l'll ride it.

517
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,680
Have a safe ride,
I'm gonna go ahead.

518
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,860
<i>It felt weird seeing your
back as you took off.</i>

519
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:52,410
<i>I realized that I don't
remember seeing your back.</i>

520
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,190
<i>Because you were
always beside me.</i>

521
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,510
Let me go say good bye.

522
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,560
Okay.

523
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,510
I'm off.

524
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,720
You like him enough
to drop out and leave?

525
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,290
How could you just leave?

526
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,320
Without telling me anything.

527
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,010
I want to go to Seoul now.

528
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,120
And he says he needs me.

529
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,450
You? Do you need him too?

530
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,030
He's good to me.

531
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:56,010
He'll introduce me to
his art teacher friend.

532
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,700
What's the only reason?

533
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,010
Mi-so! Get back in!

534
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,100
Okay!

535
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,420
I gotta go.

536
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,630
Will you be back?

537
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,480
Of course!

538
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,030
Don't talk like you'll
never see me again.

539
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,810
Call me often, okay?

540
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,220
Yeah, don't cry
because I won't be here.

541
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,710
Could you hurry up?!

542
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,170
We're departing
soon, hurry, hurry!

543
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,850
We have to go, I'm gonna drive.

544
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,050
<i>Do you remember?</i>

545
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,110
<i>You told me a passage
from a book you read.</i>

546
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,680
<i>You said the sun can shine
brightly because of the shadow.</i>

547
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,060
<i>Even though they
can't become one.</i>

548
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,050
<i>the shadow is always
there in the distance.</i>

549
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:25,320
<i>so the sun was never
lonely, and is able to shine.</i>

550
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:31,870
<i>I suddenly remember that.</i>

551
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,780
<i>Letter, 2006</i>

552
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,170
<i>Dear Ha-eun.</i>

553
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,240
<i>Sorry I haven't been in touch.</i>

554
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,910
<i>I lost my phone like an idiot.</i>

555
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,350
It's a bit tough
qetting up here.

556
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,690
but you can't beat the price
with a house this spacious.

557
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,900
<i>I finally got a rental today.</i>

558
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,810
<i>It's on a hill, so It's
tough getting up here,</i>

559
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,620
<i>but it's got a killer view.</i>

560
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,470
<i>I'm gonna paint for real here.</i>

561
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,870
<i>I work at the club
where Ki-hoon performs,</i>

562
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,370
<i>and take classes in the day,</i>

563
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,560
<i>It's a bit tiring,
but that's okay.</i>

564
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,180
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

565
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:52,830
<i>It's nice to have an
address to send letters to.</i>

566
00:52:55,770 --> 00:53:00,470
I took the college entrance exam,
but I don't know what to major.

567
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:04,820
<i>Both dad and Jin-woo
want me to be a teacher.</i>

568
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,320
<i>If that happened, there
won't be a problem,</i>

569
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,010
<i>but it would also be dull.</i>

570
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,180
<i>Mi-so.</i>

571
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:16,910
<i>Isn't it weird that one
exam seals our future?</i>

572
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:23,220
<i>Yeah, everyone boils
their life for that one day.</i>

573
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:26,420
<i>It's the same for my art class.</i>

574
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,350
<i>Everyone draws the same thing.</i>

575
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,030
<i>But I got a compliment
for the first time in my life.</i>

576
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,650
<i>The instructor here said my
painting is unique and got character.</i>

577
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,120
<i>He wants me to be his protégé.</i>

578
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,820
<i>So Ha-eun, live the life
that you feel like living.</i>

579
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,630
<i>Trust your talent.</i>

580
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,000
<i>I thought things would
be very different in college.</i>

581
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,090
<i>But I'm still the same.</i>

582
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:14,100
<i>Classes are boring,
and I just doodle.</i>

583
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:19,780
<i>But when l doodle,
I feel at ease.</i>

584
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,510
<i>How was your Christmas?</i>

585
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:29,410
<i>I'm so glad I came to Seoul.</i>

586
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,840
<i>I met so many
different people here.</i>

587
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,930
<i>Everyone likes me and
I get a lot of inspiration.</i>

588
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:41,350
<i>Seeing so many people live
free, I learn so much from them.</i>

589
00:54:58,980 --> 00:54:59,980
<i>Ha-eun.</i>

590
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,820
<i>I'm gonna travel a
lot and paint for real.</i>

591
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,670
<i>Mi-so's Homepage</i>

592
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,800
<i>It makes me feel good to
imagine you traveling and drawing.</i>

593
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,940
<i>It feels like I'm receiving
some courage somehow.</i>

594
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:32,500
<i>This is embarrassing...</i>

595
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,660
<i>but should I take up
drawing again like you?</i>

596
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,370
<i>Guess where I am.</i>

597
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:45,600
<i>I'm finally starting the journey
on the Trans-Siberia train.</i>

598
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,740
<i>It'll take 50 days to reach
Moscow from Vladivostok.</i>

599
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,940
<i>I want to stop at Olkhon
Island to check out Lake Baikal.</i>

600
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,650
<i>Remember what I told you?</i>

601
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:01,770
<i>Go to Europe afterwards,
and head to Morocco.</i>

602
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,980
<i>I want to capture
these new worlds</i>

603
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,810
<i>with my drawings.</i>

604
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,630
<i>It might be a long journey.</i>

605
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,750
<i>I'll send you a postcard
from Lake Baikal.</i>

606
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,270
<i>Bye.</i>

607
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,980
Thank you!

608
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,160
So?

609
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,230
If the transfer is finalized,
then it's a done deal.

610
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,050
Sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

611
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,910
I'll come back after
the regular classes.

612
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,800
Can't you do it here?
Do you have to go to Seoul?

613
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,310
I told you.

614
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,800
My medical school will
be turned into a college.

615
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,410
If I'm going to transfer,
Seoul is the best option.

616
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,100
Ha-eun.

617
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,520
I want to do this the right way.

618
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,760
<i>Mi-so, how's your travel?</i>

619
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,510
<i>I sometimes imagine.</i>

620
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,800
<i>what the world you see is like,</i>

621
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,300
<i>and what kind of
drawing you're creating.</i>

622
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,960
<i>I wanted to visit you in
Seoul when I got into college,</i>

623
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,690
<i>but I never got to.</i>

624
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:42,220
<i>It's been 5 years.</i>

625
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:48,680
<i>I didn't know our time apart
would be this long back then.</i>

626
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,910
<i>You've received a message</i>

627
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:56,120
<i>Looks like I'm always
sending people away.</i>

628
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,260
<i>Saying farewell
is always difficult.</i>

629
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,960
<i>When l become an
adult, would it get easier?</i>

630
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,670
<i>Did you arrive in
Lake Baikal well?</i>

631
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,870
<i>I'm still waiting
for that postcard.</i>

632
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:42,170
<i>I'm curious what you look
like in front of that lake.</i>

633
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,470
I'll visit often.

634
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,950
Take care of yourself.

635
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:57,330
Don't cry.

636
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,540
After arriving in Moscow
via Trans-Siberia train.

637
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:09,260
I looped around
Europe on a train.

638
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,860
then went back to Morocco.

639
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,810
You sure got grits for a girl.

640
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,000
You're something.

641
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,670
I knew I'd regret it if I
was too scared to travel.

642
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,940
This was made by
the Spanish fypsies.

643
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,340
Oh my!

644
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,270
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah!

645
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:30,910
Mi-sol!
You're better than
my own daughter!

646
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,200
It's so pretty!

647
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,240
You try it too.

648
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,930
Let's see, you're a hottie!
You look so young!

649
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:40,810
Where's mine?

650
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,500
Yours?

651
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,200
Right here!

652
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,250
Here.

653
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,690
Really?

654
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,340
Postcards?

655
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,710
Where is this?

656
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,130
Lake Baikal.

657
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:04,440
Where's Lake Baikal?

658
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:08,780
Is that in Russia?
In Siberia?

659
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,060
Change into this.

660
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,250
Wanna bathe together?

661
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,790
We're not kids anymore.

662
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:41,340
You don't have to, but
show me your titties.

663
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,030
What? You pervert!

664
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:49,010
Hey! Mi-so!

665
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,800
Look it the sky!

666
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,720
It's so pretty, let's
have fun in Busan later!

667
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,300
- Look, sun!
- Where?

668
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,860
Wow, it's Busan!

669
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,420
It's so big!

670
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,570
Look how shiny it looks.

671
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:28,280
One, two, three!

672
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,990
One, two, three!

673
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,820
- Lookup.
- Jesus!

674
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,620
I can't do this!

675
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:15,910
Anyone here? Hello?

676
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:16,750
Yes?

677
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,900
Is there a room?

678
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,460
Temporary or overnight?

679
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,610
Sleep here?

680
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,460
Yeah!

681
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,830
How much is overnight?

682
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,940
40$.

683
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,870
Let's go elsewhere.

684
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,830
Why? It's cheap here.

685
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,000
Sorry about that.

686
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,260
It's so soft.

687
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:46,860
Aren't you happy we came here?

688
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,430
Since you paid for the
room, I'm buying dinner.

689
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,580
Sure!

690
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,960
Ha-eun, could you
grab a pad from my bag?

691
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,090
Okay!

692
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:06,990
Are you hungry? What should we have?

693
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,230
Pork belly?

694
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,240
0r there's a famous pork
feet in Nampo, how about that?

695
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,520
Let's have something amazing.

696
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,190
Mom gave me some
money to use in emergency.

697
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,750
Why? Don't feel like pork feet?

698
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:27,970
Found it?

699
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,280
Yeah.

700
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,040
- Welcome.
- Table for 2.

701
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,720
- Do you have a reservation?
- No.

702
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,290
I'll show you to your table.

703
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:59,710
Thank you.

704
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:17,500
Let's go somewhere else,
prices here are outrageous.

705
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,810
Let's just eat, I'll chip in.

706
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,580
We can eat till our belly burst
for half the price elsewhere.

707
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,630
We gotta spurge a little.

708
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,520
When will I dine at a
place like this with you?

709
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:35,490
Hold on a sec.

710
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:41,820
Could I borrow a shaker?

711
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,200
Thank you.

712
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:55,130
Could I make you cocktails in
exchange for a bottle of wine?

713
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:59,370
Gents, would it be okay if
she makes you cocktails?

714
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,180
Of course, bravo!

715
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,530
Nice!

716
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,530
Pour it, pour it!

717
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,480

719
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,340
You're amazing!

720
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,870
This is a $120 bottle!

721
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Thank you!

722
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,740
Let's have some fun,
this is a $120 bottle.

723
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,840
What was that?

724
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,180
What was what?

725
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,390
You don't know those men.

726
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,450
They came here to spurge.

727
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:00,120
I got them hyped up
and got this in exchange.

728
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,340
Why freeload drinks
from strangers?

729
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:05,380
I didn't freeload.

730
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,680
I was fairly compensated
for a job I performed.

731
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:12,780
Did you come here to work?
We came here for fun.

732
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,480
You didn't know?

733
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,500
This is how I live.

734
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:21,870
Mi-so...

735
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:23,500
Didn't I tell you?

736
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,750
l was so starving one time
but I had no money.

737
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:29,020
So i did the 'Free
Hug' for $1 each,

738
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,210
but since it wasn't free,
I called it 'Healing Hug'.

739
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:34,340
Do you know how
much I made in 3 hours?

740
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:35,390
Okay, stop it.

741
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,970
I made $50.

742
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:39,890
So I ate steak with it.

743
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,690
Was I freeloading then too?

744
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,110
Don't go around saying that.

745
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,170
Why?

746
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:52,590
Do I embarrass you?

747
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,720
You'll never ever understand,

748
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,580
how I lived thus far.

749
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,170
Hi.

750
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:07,750
Is your friend a whale too?

751
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,750
How much can you drink?

752
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:10,970
Go away.

753
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,180
Eh? She's so respectful.

754
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,510
You're cute when
you play hard to get.

755
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,730
I got a boyfriend,
please go away.

756
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:21,060
I got a wife.

757
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,810
Just go, we're having
a private conversation.

758
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,240
What got up your
butt all of sudden?

759
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,670
You were kissing
our asses back there.

760
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,780
Piss off, asshole,

761
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,680

bottle and scar your face.

762
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,060
Come on, let's go.

763
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,890

01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,840
What the hell's your problem!

765
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,700
She's a psycho!

766
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,300
What do you want to eat?

767
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,030
I'm gonna order a steak.

768
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,520
Screw that, get a
pizza, I'm buying.

769
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,600
Excuse me.

770
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:04,930
Yes?

771
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,710
Could we get 2
tenderloin steaks?

772
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,170
Absolutely, right away.

773
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:16,450
Where am I supposed
to freeload steaks now?

774
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,100
What's with you?

775
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,990
Since you paid for the
room, I wanted to get dinner.

776
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,780
You know what my life's like, so
how could we have hotel steak?

777
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:31,280
I'm buying because I
got money right now.

778
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,630

calculative between friends?

779
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,880
Calculative?

with him freely.

785

Why should you step out for him?

786
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,390
He's got nothing to do with you.

787
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,850
Or are you feeling guilty?

788
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,360
Look at you.

789
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:11,430
See how you're
being calculative?

790
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:15,230
You pretend to be
naive on the outside,

791
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:17,550
but calculating
everything on the inside.

792
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,160
Aren't you the one
who feels guilty?

793
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:20,620
What do you mean?

794
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,080

for Seoul with Ki-hoon,

acquisition rate the most.

01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:38,630
As of yesterday, it's at 93,7%.

You could say it's
all but confirmed.

801

Wouldn't it be safer to
wait for regular pre-sale?

802
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:48,770
You can only take advantage

803
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:53,400
of pre-sale bonus when
you sign up before 95%.

804

I consult pre-sale lots,
but that's a side hustle.

I go to her, you

wants you to come to Jeju.

897
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:44,800
No one in this world
ever loved you except me!

898
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,010
You're right.

899
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:55,740
Without you, I'm nothing...

900
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:09,780
How did we end up like this?

901
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,920
Ha-eun...

902
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,750
Thank you for
everything, Jin-woo.

903
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,460
Lend me this.

904
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:30,990
What?

905
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:35,450
You said this kept you
alive, I think I need this.

906
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:39,390
I don't want to
die until I'm 27.

907
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:34,130
<i>I'm unavailable at the moment.</i>

908
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,920
<i>Mi-so.</i>

909
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:43,540
<i>A month went by.</i>

910
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,080
<i>I didn't want to
think about anything,</i>

911
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:51,950
<i>but you can't force your
mind to take a break.</i>

912
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:02,060
I moved out of my
Seoul apartment.

913
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,870
I want to prep
for the exam here.

914
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,270
I'll spend the rest of
my life making up to you

915
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:13,130
for all my mistakes...

916
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:48,750
<i>We decided to get
married after his exam.</i>

917
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:53,790
<i>and started living in a Jeju
house provided by his parents.</i>

918
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:00,450
<i>It was a bit scary.</i>

919
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:05,060
<i>It was my first
time leaving home.</i>

920
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,230
- Ha-eun.
- Yeah?

921
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:20,430
Should we head to Seoul
when we have a child?

922
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Why?

923
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:26,150
There's difference in salary.

924
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,220
and I want to be
where the opportunity is.

925
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:35,640
I'm not sure, I never
thought about living in Seoul.

926
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:38,810
This was my dream,

927
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,640
just like you
becoming a teacher.

928
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,640
I never wanted to be a teacher.

929
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:53,990
Huh?

930
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,860
I never once wanted
to be a teacher.

931
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,980
What do you mean? Then why go to teachers college?

932
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:12,280
Should I give up teaching
and learn to paint?

933
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:14,660
Paint?

934
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,040
I always liked painting
ever since I was a kid.

935
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,840
I know you draw so well.

936
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,170
Actually, when we first met.

937
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:32,060
I was so shocked by that
drawing, it was incredible.

938
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,120
- Really?
- Yeah.

939
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:37,660
But Ha-eun,

940
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:40,400
could you leave it as a hobby?

941
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:45,210
Drawing realistically
is a skill, not a talent.

942
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,230
Yes, slightly to this
way, oh, very good!

943
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:59,010
Please smile widely!

944
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:03,260
Very nice, hold it, one, two!

945
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:08,020
Thank you.

946
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:09,970
Thank you so much for coming.

947
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,640
Family. please!

948
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:43,650
<i>It was selfish, and I
felt bad for everyone.</i>

949
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,100
<i>but it was my best.</i>

950
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:52,870
<i>After the big wave washed
over, my mind became clearer.</i>

951
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,980
<i>I decided to leave Jeju.</i>

952
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,340
- Were you disappointed?
- Sure I was.

953
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,300
If I wasn't, I'd be an angel.

954
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:25,600
I'm sorry I didn't get to
live the life you wanted.

955
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,810
What's the life I
wanted for you?

956
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,440
You know, a normal life.

957
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:45,950
Do you know why
every face is different?

958
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:52,290
So that they can
all live different lives.

959
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:59,550
Turns out, there
is no set way of life.

960
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:03,430
Live the way you want to.

961
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,240
That's what I really want.

962
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:03,910
<i>I was always curious
about your home in Seoul.</i>

963
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:06,990
<i>It didn't feel unfamiliar.</i>

964
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:27,490
<i>Maybe that's why I felt at home.</i>

965
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:31,190
<i>It was quiet enough
to feel the time flow.</i>

966
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:43,380
<i>And of course, lonely too.</i>

967
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:47,040
<i>I thought of the faces I missed.</i>

968
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:56,980
<i>Mom's face, dad's
face, Jin-woo's face...</i>

969
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:08,330
<i>But the face I missed
the most was yours, Mi-so.</i>

970
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:27,610
- Who is it?
- It's Mi-so.

971
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,430
- Welcome.
- Hey there.

972
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,010
I'm back.

973
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:33,120
Good afternoon.

974
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,050
She's the friend I told
you about, Ko Ha-eun.

975
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,040
- Welcome.
- Hello.

976
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,900
This is my landlord,
and Sung-yeon.

977
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,370
Hi. I'm a tenant, just like Mi-so.

978
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:46,550
You didn't have dinner yet?

979
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:49,630
Go have a chat,
I'll get it ready.

980
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:56,020
Crème de la crème
of our 28-course meal!

981
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,680
Let's take a look.

982
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,310
It's incredible.

983
01:34:59,830 --> 01:35:06,020
You don't eat like
this everyday, right?

984
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:08,190
Of course not, how
would we do that?

985
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:14,260
28 courses today, 72
yesterday and 146 2 days ago.

986
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:17,080
Yeah, last week was
tough with 385 courses.

987
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:19,370
We had food to the
door and ate for 4 days.

988
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:22,150
Stop it, it's not funny.

989
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:27,520
How did the three of
you came to live together?

990
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:31,680
My husband passed away
and I looked for roommates,

991
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:33,310
and to make some money.

992
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:36,980
And Sung-yeon was
working at a restaurant.

993
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:40,390
I was a regular, and
Mi-so was a waitress.

994
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:44,010
This crab's a bit salty.

995
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,140
Yeah?

996
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:51,070
Sorry, I poured too much love.

997
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,290
Stop it, it's cheesy.

998
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:58,280
Cheesy? Want some nachos
to go along with it?

999
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,830
Mi-so smiled, look.

1000
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,330
Eat up.

1001
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:12,590
I'm off.

1002
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,340
Not scared of flying anymore?

1003
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:21,670
It is a bit scary, but
squinting makes it okay.

1004
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:25,570
Send me letters, I'm
not going anywhere.

1005
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:40,220
This is M, and this is S.

1006
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:06,940
<i>Mi-so, guess where I am.</i>

1007
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,880
<i>I'm on the Trans-Siberia
train to Lake Baikal in Olkhon.</i>

1008
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:26,820
<i>I realized something
while traveling.</i>

1009
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:32,270
<i>We will live
different lives now.</i>

1010
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:42,650
<i>You'll be like the old me...</i>

1011
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:57,270
<i>and I'll be like the old you.</i>

1012
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:04,280
<i>I realized something
while traveling. We will live different lives.</i>

1013
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:12,960
Ms. Ahn, someone's look for you.

1014
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:23,970
How did you know I worked here?

1015
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,010
Raemi Gallery, I
asked the curator.

1016
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:32,070
She told me you didn't
know Ha-eun very well.

1017
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:35,310
It's not like I have to
tell her about everything.

1018
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:39,190
Mi-so, tell me the truth.

1019
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:41,380
Where is she now?

1020
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:43,270
I told you, I don't know.

1021
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,990
Why are you curious about her?

1022
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:48,530
If you read her words,
you know why I'm curious.

1023
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:51,970
She left like that
and didn't tell anyone.

1024
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,480
Tell me, where is she now?

1025
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,150
I told you, I don't know.

1026
01:39:00,110 --> 01:39:02,820
<i>Ha-eun</i>

1027
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:12,740
Here you go.

1028
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:13,820
Mom.

1029
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:17,270
Did you have fun
with your friends?

1030
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,170
Yes.

1031
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:19,760
- What about lunch?
- I had curry.

1032
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:22,180
Curry? That's what you loved.

1033
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:28,100
<i>Ahn Ha-eun</i>

1034
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,950
- Stay here for a bit.
- Okay.

1035
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:50,320
Right, she's you
and Ha-eun daughter.

1036
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:07,870
What does it feel like?

1037
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:13,940
I can sometimes
feel her heartbeat.

1038
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:16,690
It's pretty cool.

1039
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:21,550
Does Jin-woo know?

1040
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,480
No.

1041
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:32,440
I left him at the altar.

1042
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,710
He's a Good man,
he loved me quiet a lot.

1043
01:41:42,030 --> 01:41:44,770
Had we gotten married,
we'd have done pretty well.

1044
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:50,120
But I suddenly had a thought.

1045
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:54,740
Is the person Jin-woo
likes the real me?

1046
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:04,910
I thought I'd forget about
who I was with passing time.

1047
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:08,010
I was afraid.

1048
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:15,000
Mi-so, I want to
lie down for a bit.

1049
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,680
I already knew.

1050
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:32,520
What?

1051
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:43,450
What you were feeling,
I knew it all along.

1052
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:59,380
<i>But I was scared and hated
that you were drifting away.</i>

1053
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:04,550
<i>I hated you without knowing why.</i>

1054
01:43:10,970 --> 01:43:12,650
Did you hate me?

1055
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:15,520
Yes!

1056
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:20,930
I hated you.

1057
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:24,620
You too?

1058
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:30,340
But you came back.

1059
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:35,410
Because I missed you.

1060
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,200
And...

1061
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,680
I wanted to show you.

1062
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,800
Show me what?

1063
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:50,050
Mi-so.

1064
01:43:54,850 --> 01:43:58,360
That's her baby nickname.

1065
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:40,150
It was a difficult operation
due to heavy bloodlost...

1066
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:44,610
but both the mother and
baby are well, congratulation.

1067
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,410
It's my first time seeing
what a baby look like.

1068
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,290
Should we raise her together?

1069
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:01,760
You can't even
take care of yourself.

1070
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:04,760
Why? It's nice to have two mother.

1071
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:09,380
I'll teach you all about dating.

1072
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:12,600
Isn't that my work?

1073
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:16,010
She'll end up alone
and sad if you taught her.

1074
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:22,440
She laughed.

1075
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:28,120
- Hello.
- Hello there.

1076
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:30,030
Ha-eun!

1077
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,380
Hello?

1078
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:53,870
Ha-eun, where are you?

1079
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:59,440
You haven't changed your
mind about our promise, right?

1080
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,380
What do you want?

1081
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:06,690
<i>You said so yourself,
that you'll let me leave.</i>

1082
01:46:08,110 --> 01:46:09,110
<i>Ha-eun.</i>

1083
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:14,280
When the baby is born,
do whatever you want.

1084
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:19,040
I know why you leave Jeju.

1085
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:25,200
Feel free do whatever you want.

1086
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:31,680
I understand, Ha-eun.

1087
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:34,090
Let's talking first.

1088
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:37,740
<i>You can't leave
without saying goodbye.</i>

1089
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:41,830
You know I can't
leave when I see you.

1090
01:46:43,150 --> 01:46:46,740
Even so, you can't
suddenly pick up and leave.

1091
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:54,000
I'm sorry, Mi-so, I...

1092
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:03,650
Hello?

1093
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,340
Ha-eun!

1094
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:45,020
<i>That was the last time.</i>

1095
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:48,070
You don't know Where she went?

1096
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:50,490
Yes.

1097
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,110
no call from that time?

1098
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:03,650
Could I come see her some time?

1099
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:08,700
Play dump you don't know her.

1100
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:13,240
It was Ha-eun request.

1101
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,600
What are you watching?

1102
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:23,640
Slime.

1103
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,140
- Is it fun?
- Yes.

1104
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:57,230
Where's the room 201's woman?

1105
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:59,190
I called you just now...

1106
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,340
She's in emergency
surgery due to bloodlost.

1107
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:13,770
I'm sorry.

1108
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:18,010
Her condition
worsened too fast...

with you and Ha-eun was
Mom's entire life, right?

1120
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:53,070
<i>After calling off the wedding,
she lived alone in this address.</i>

1121

my daughter's stuff back?</i>

Alright.

I'm heading out, goodbye.

1126
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:28,540
I'm sorry.

1127
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:32,130
Ha-eun, mom's here.

1128
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:37,840
She's been asking you all day.

1129
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,170
Head on home.

1130
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:54,620
<i>I realized something
while traveling.</i>

<i>Do you remember?</i>

1135
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,990
<i>The passage from a
book I told you about.</i>

1136
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:22,620
<i>You said the sun can shine
brightly because of the shadow.</i>

1137
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:25,600
<i>Even though they
can't become one,</i>

1138
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:28,940
<i>the shadow is always
there in the distance,</i>

1139
01:55:29,170 --> 01:55:33,150
<i>so the sun was never
lonely, and is able to shine.</i>

<i>Working on the
drawing you left behind,</i>

Thank you for coming.

I'm the one thankful
for the invitation.

1147
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:15,620
Ha-eun emailed us back
and declined our offer.

1148
01:56:16,150 --> 01:56:20,220
But she did promise to
show us her newest work.

1149
01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:21,430
That's good.

1150
01:56:22,370 --> 01:56:23,730
Is she your daughter?

1151
01:56:24,790 --> 01:56:26,380
You look just like your mom.
