Hello, Pond.

26
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,980
My class just finished.

27
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,670
Can you please reserve a seat for me?

28
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,530
Then, can you please tell Can to reserve a seat for me?

29
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,160
Okay.

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,080
Where are you off to in a hurry?

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,590
I'm rushing off to the football stadium.

32
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,230
There is a match between our school and the Engineering Department.

33
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,080
I'll head off first.

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,760
Let me go with you.

35
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,150
Yes?

36
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,690
Let's go. Aren't you in a hurry?

37
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,010
Yes.

38
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,120
Ai'Pond, hurry up.

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,600
You're so slow, dude.

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,260
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah...

41
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,620
Woohoo!!!

42
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,070
Hey, save a seat for Ai'Pete, too.

43
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,490
Ai'Pete is coming, too?

44
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,750
Of course, he's coming.

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,890
Why would he come?

46
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,530
This is the engineering stand. Why doesn't he sit at the IC stand?

47
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,780
That's why I said you are so out of the loop.

48
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,350
Ai'Pete is coming to cheer for someone.

49
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,760
Not to cheer for his school. Geez.

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,390
Right, baby?

51
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,150
It's Ai'Ae, right?

52
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,730
I knew it.

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,190
Lately, they've been so damn inseparable.

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,170
Hello?

55
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,760
Yeah. I'm standing and waving my hand right here.

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,550
Can you see me?

57
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,300
What?

58
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,280
Your friend came, too?

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,650
Yeah... Sure... Sure... Come on over. There's space available.

60
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,470
'k, 'k, 'k.

61
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,630
Ai'Pete's friend is coming!?

62
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,420
Yeah.

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,480
Shit, Ai'Pond! Damn you.

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,910
- What?
- Block me.

65
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,160
Sit... Sit... Sit...

66
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,900
What is it?

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,570
Ai'Pete's friend?

68
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,130
Why? You haven't stopped hating his guts?

69
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,780
I don't really think he's as shitty as you said he was.

70
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,830
I've met him so many times already.

71
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,510
I haven't seen him do anything to me.

72
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,490
Except that... that he acted like I was invisible.

73
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,130
That's all. Other than that, he's never insulted me.

74
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,710
That guy is way shittier than you think.

75
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,510
Really? Tell me about it.

76
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,460
I'm leaving. I need to poop.

77
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,800
What!?!

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,500
If you need to poop then just go poop. Why are you telling me that??

79
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,770
Yeah. I'm going for sure. You should move out of the way.

80
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,190
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,490
Clumsy.

82
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,850
You, come have a talk with me.

83
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,120
Hey! Ae has the ball now.

84
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,050
Right there! There... There...

85
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,360
Go!!!

86
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,430
Yeah!!!

87
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,590
Just now, you did that on purpose. Right?

88
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,690
So, now you know that it's annoying?

89
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,080
What?

90
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,590
Do you know now?

91
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,060
That the way you're always looking to start a fight with me every time,

92
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,610
just how annoying it can be?

93
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,010
When did I look to start a fight with you?

94
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,310
Did you already forget that you punched me?

95
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,220
You even stuck your nose in my business.

96
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,210
That's because you have a dogmouth!

97
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,390
The first time we met, you said that we were dirty.

98
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,800
Another time we met you, you called us disgusting.

99
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,060
So, what do want me to do?

100
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
Bow down to the floor and thank you?

101
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,460
Just punching you only one time was generous enough.

102
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,100
Well, I just said the truth.

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,350
You're the one who's disgusting.

104
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,010
You're gay, right?

105
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,370
How very disgusting.

106
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,590
Is being gay that disgusting?

107
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,400
Yeah.

108
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,390
Then what I said was right then.

109
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,020
To say that your friend is very disgusting.

110
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,730
My friend?

111
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Don't tell me that... that you're talking about Ai'Ae and Pete.

112
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,220
And if you were to tell me

113
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,270
the fact that I touched my lips on your lips seemed so disgusting,

114
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,530
then your friend might be even more disgusting than you know.

115
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,900
Because he uses...

116
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,030
to touch all over Pete.

117
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,130
Tin, you piece of shit.

118
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,210
My friend is not like you.

119
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,670
And when I said that being gay is disgusting,

120
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,860
I was insulting YOU.

121
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,260
I'm not insulting all gays around the world.

122
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,430
Ai'Ae and Ai'Pete... they're dating.

123
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,971
You have no right to criticize their love, damn it.

124
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,921
At the very least, they've never insulted others or looked down on others.

125
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,350
Ai'Ae is a nice guy.

126
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,300
Ai'Pete is also a nice guy.

127
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,020
Those guys are my friends.

128
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,660
So, whoever insults my friends,

129
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,280
is the same thing as being my enemy.

130
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,310
Are you done talking?

131
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,210
And you better remember this in that skull of yours...

132
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,320
That whether they're gay,

133
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,830
whether they're in a relationship,

134
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,380
those guys are still my friends either way.

135
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,310
And I'm not going to let anyone insult my friends, ever!

136
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,200
Do you understand?

137
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,020
I might be a lot more disgusting than you think.

138
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,375
P'Tul, nobody loves me.

139
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,120
Mom and dad don't even love me.

140
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,130
They love you, you know.

141
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,430
Even if no one loves you, I love you the most. All right?

142
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,650
Really? You really love me?

143
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,290
Of course, it's true.

144
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,720
If there's someone in this world who loves you the most,

145
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,880
remember that it's this big brother of yours, right here.

146
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,810
I hate him so much, Mom.

147
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,960
I don't see him as my younger brother.

148
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,520
Why didn't he just die when he was in your stomach?

149
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,120
Just wait and see.

150
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,250
I will take everything from that little bastard.

151
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,350
He has to also face what I faced.

152
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,960
He has to suffer even more than I suffered.

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,660
There isn't any...

154
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,720
There isn't anyone you can trust.

155
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,720
There isn't any, Tin.

156
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,090
Don't be stupid that foolish kid again.

157
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,810
Don't trust anyone.

158
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,400
If you don't trust anyone,

159
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,190
then you won't get hurt.

160
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,600
Engineering! Engineering! Engineering!

161
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,820
That's my friend. My friend. The one who scored two goals is my friend!

162
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm not his girlfriend, okay?

163
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,430
I'm going to go insane... Acting like he got it himself.

164
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,500
What about your school? ChaAim.

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,900
We lost the round a while back already.

166
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,800
That's how it is for a school that's full of girls.

167
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,250
There weren't enough people that signed up, so the seniors had to play and help us.

168
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,820
But I think that... you look pretty happy that your own school is losing.

169
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,340
I'm not brave enough to shout,

170
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,810
but I'm still pretty happy.

171
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,980
So you must really like Ae, right?

172
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,480
Oh... I'm sorry.

173
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,760
I didn't mean to pry.

174
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,610
Let's just say we didn't say anything about it.

175
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,070
Am I being that obvious?

176
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,040
If you're asking like this, then that means I can answer. Right?

177
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,870
Well... Not really. You don't seem that obvious. If it was an outsider looking in, they probably wouldn't even know.

178
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,610
They would think that you're a guy who's handsome and polite.

179
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,700
But my school doesn't really have many straight guys.

180
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,650
So, I'm kind of more familiar with it.

181
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,830
You don't have to worry. I won't tell anyone.

182
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,480
Okay.

183
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,270
See? And smiling like that?

184
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,510
The girls wouldn't be able to think anything in time. They'd just melt first.

185
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,100
This is my girlfriend.

186
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,380
Don't sprinkle your charm on her, damn it.

187
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,050
Let go. You have so much sweat.

188
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,950
What's going on, Aim?

189
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,100
When it comes to Pete, you smile so sweetly. But when it's me, you brush my hand away.

190
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,410
That's not fair at all.

191
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,760
It doesn't look proper.

192
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,620
Okay... Okay...

193
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,360
If it's like this, I like it.

194
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,670
My girlfriend has to treasure herself.

195
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,380
Save it for me so in the future.

196
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,830
Letting me be the only one to touch you is enough, right?

197
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,510
Geez... Pervert.

198
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,470
Can't I just imagine it?

199
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,600
Just wait until your next life then.

200
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,530
We finally won!

201
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,900
How embarrassing...

202
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,430
Don't touch me... Don't touch me...

203
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,320
Can't stop smiling, can you?

204
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,260
Ae is really good.

205
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,610
You should've seen him when he scored the first goal, too.

206
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,080
Just amazing.

207
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,960
I'm sorry that I made your school lose.

208
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,260
But... I'm glad... that you won.

209
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,480
Thank you.

210
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,850
Then I'm going to go change my clothes first.

211
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,730
Then let's go find something to eat together.

212
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,340
Are you guys going to find something to eat or are you going to eat each other?

213
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,700
You can tell me, friend. That way I don't have to wait up tonight.

214
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Too nosy, Pond.

215
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,300
Who said I wasn't nosy?

216
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,580
Geez... How annoying.

217
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,000
Geez, baby. Don't be annoyed with me.

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,300
Now you're more annoying than usual.

219
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,370
Come on.

220
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,270
Then, tonight, can I stay over at your dorm?

221
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm going to change clothes now.

222
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,430
What were you guys talking about?

223
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,040
It's nothing, Pond.

224
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,960
You won't stop bothering them...

225
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,420
Come here. Come here.

226
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,250
He's all shy.

227
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,540
Get back safely, Beautiful.

228
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,380
When you get home, tell me through LINE too. Okay?

229
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,220
I have something I want to ask you.

230
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,970
Yes, Sir?

231
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,710
Pond, will you get sick of me for being too reserved?

232
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,320
I'm serious here.

233
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,030
Well, you are asking me something silly.

234
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,130
My friends said I'm too reserved.

235
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,710
And how is that a bad thing, Aim?

236
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,180
Aim, listen to me, all right?

237
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,920
If some guy tells you he's sick of you just because you won't let him touch you,

238
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,220
then that guy is someone who is complete trash. You can just stop being involved with him.

239
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,970
Which I'm not like that.

240
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,820
I like you because of who you are.

241
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,800
Even though I might be... somewhat of a pervert...

242
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,920
Not somewhat, but a whole lot.

243
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,150
Okay... Even though I might be a big pervert,

244
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,980
but it's not like that's the only thing I think about when it comes to my girlfriend.

245
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,350
If my girlfriend is not ready, I can wait.

246
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,061
Isn't that even better?

247
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:27,592
That means that I was able to get a wonderful woman to become my girlfriend. Isn't that right?

248
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,240
Do you understand?

249
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,380
Fine, I understand.

250
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,960
See? You know how to be such a good guy, too.

251
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,610
Why don't you act like this for others to see, huh?

252
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:46,160
Well... There are some things that I'd like to keep only for my important person to see after all...

253
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,560
Let's go.

254
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,350
Right... Aim, what do you think?

255
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,917
Have Ae and Pete done it yet?

256
00:15:56,917 --> 00:16:00,570
You were good for three seconds and you're already back to being trash again?

257
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:06,157
But I also know... that you like that I'm like this.

258
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:07,162
I won't argue that.

259
00:16:07,162 --> 00:16:09,852
There... There... not arguing it.

260
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,320
Ae, what would you like to drink?

261
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,900
I have Orange soda, Green soda, Red soda...

262
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
Red, Green, Orange...

263
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,780
Green, Red, and Orange...

264
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,000
Which one?

265
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,220
Geez, any drink is fine.

266
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,280
Okay...

267
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,810
Ouch!

268
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,680
Are you all right, Pete?

269
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,000
What's with you?

270
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,010
Are you hurt?

271
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,140
Come on. I'll pour it myself.

272
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,220
But I want to do it for you.

273
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,010
You should stop being shy first.

274
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,610
You're going to make me shy, too.

275
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,000
Since that day, the two of us...

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,830
haven't really had time just the two of us...

277
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:19,930
Plus... you were really cool playing football, too...

278
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,310
Don't say something to make me blush, all right?

279
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,550
I'm going to take a shower first.

280
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,218
My body feels damn sticky right now.

281
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,273
Then... I'll make some food for you to eat then.

282
00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:37,078
Pa'Jiew taught me a bunch of things.
(T/N: Pa=Auntie)

283
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:39,450
Are you sure that you won't burn down the apartment?

284
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,800
Oh... I won't burn down the apartment, Ae.

285
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,268
Ai'Pete.

286
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:58,048
Did you want something?

287
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:03,086
Take a bath with me.

288
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:14,781
I think I should get out, Ae.

289
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:16,970
Hey. Then I'll get out with you.

290
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,582
Ae, didn't you want to soak in the water?

291
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:24,282
The reason why I wanted to soak in it, was to soak in it with you.

292
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:41,186
What are you so shy about?

293
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,031
I said to stop being shy already.

294
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,221
I've seen everything already.

295
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,867
- Ai'Pete, do you want me to wash your hair? I'll wash it for you.

296
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,782
That's okay. I just washed it this morning.

297
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,182
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

298
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,795
Ae, don't touch it.

299
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,139
Ae!

300
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,901
I want to touch it a bit, come on.

301
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,313
Please don't touch it, Ae.

302
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:08,003
Oh, Ae. I have a question for you.

303
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,055
The thing is... are you available next weekend?

304
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:12,219
Why?

305
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,371
It just happens to be my mom's birthday next week.

306
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:16,411
I wanted to invite you to come, too.

307
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:19,423
My mom is also inviting you, too, Ae.

308
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,483
Will you go? Please? Please? Please?

309
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:25,967
Why are you trying to be so cute?

310
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,407
Just a bit... So will you come?

311
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:32,062
Of course, I'll go. An elder invited me after all.

312
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:36,029
But for now...

313
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:38,039
Can I just do this with you?

314
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:39,554
Ae! Don't...

315
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,564
You shouldn't ask me.

316
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:43,689
Ae, you know that I'm shy.

317
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:47,339
- You're always shy.
- Ae, you know that I never say no to you.

318
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:51,057
Why are you so cute like this?

319
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,100
I'm not going.

320
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,980
Do you not understand the human language or something?

321
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,800
How can we talk if I don't understand?

322
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,380
I don't know. Either way, I have to see P'Ae today.

323
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,400
Ley, you have to come with me, too.

324
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,440
I'm not going. It's a waste of study time.

325
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,860
Come on... I'm tired already. Let's go.

326
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,450
Let go.

327
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,450
Let go...

328
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,550
Oh no!

329
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,040
Why did you let go?

330
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,560
Sorry. But, Ley, I just wanted you to accompany me. That's all, but you won't go.

331
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,140
Besides, it's your brother's match today, too, right?

332
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,150
So what? Whether they compete and win or lose, it won't help improve our grades. Right?

333
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,980
Geez. So, are you really not going to go?

334
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,970
I'm mad at you now.

335
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,940
Fine... I'll go with you.

336
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,030
Yay! Let's go!

337
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,000
Either way, I still want to be in a relationship with you.

338
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,050
But I can still assure you that no matter what, I can't be with you, Tin.

339
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,275
It's not going to happen!?

340
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,335
Even if I steal you away?

341
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,660
It's hot, so hot. And there are too many people. Let's go back.

342
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,330
Oh... Come on...

343
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,110
Hey. Isn't that P'Pete?

344
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,140
That's such great stuff!

345
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,820
P'Pete is a close friend of P'Ae.

346
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,210
Let's ask him if he knows where P'Ae is.

347
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,820
Coming here to see such good stuff like this. It makes it kind of worth wasting some studying time.

348
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,620
P'Pete!

349
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,820
Hold on...

350
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,967
What is it? Why are we hiding?

351
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,680
Who are those two older guys?

352
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,750
Oh... That's P'Pete. A close friend of P'Ae.

353
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,300
As for the other one... He must be a close friend of P'Pete, I guess?

354
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,910
So, what are they to each other?

355
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,270
What are they to each other?

356
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,620
I-I don't know.

357
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,395
I thought I was coming here for nothing.

358
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:42,030
But to come here and find such a fine couple as this,

359
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,580
it's totally satisfying!

360
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,380
What are you talking about?

361
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,710
Shhh... Don't interrupt.

362
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,580
Ai'Ley, my lovely little sis!!!

363
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,300
Are you here to cheer on your beloved big brother?

364
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,040
No, I'm not... Be quiet...

365
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,540
Ai'Tin! What are you doing to Ai'Pete this time?

366
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,520
Ai'Tin, what are you trying to start with Ai'Pete this time?

367
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,530
Get the fuck far away.

368
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,840
If I want it, then I'll just steal it.

369
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,970
I'm talking to you right now, damn it.

370
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,050
P'Can, what is with you?

371
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,840
As soon as you get here, you just tried picking a fight with him.

372
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,350
Ai'Ley, don't let this handsome face fool you.

373
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,870
This one is the shittiest one that I've ever met.

374
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,010
Tin, hasn't done anything to me, Can.

375
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,430
I don't believe it.

376
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,030
Tell me what he did to you.

377
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,360
He really didn't do anything. I can be a witness.

378
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,540
This older guy was asking P'Pete to be in a relationship.

379
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,750
What was that?

380
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,480
Yeah. I heard it with both my ears.

381
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,980
Can someone help explain this to me? So, is P'Pete gay or is this older guy gay?

382
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,700
And is P'Pete straight?

383
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,570
Or what is it exactly?

384
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,040
You said you are looking for P'Ae, right? Let's just go.

385
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,070
That's okay. That can wait. I want to know.

386
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,600
Yeah, all right. I'll tell you later.

387
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,430
This kind of stuff... I'm an expert.

388
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,210
Good luck to you.

389
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,000
I'll be leaving now.

390
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,500
Can...

391
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,470
I think this is all just a misunderstanding, Can.

392
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,100
Right! Can, don't you have a soccer match coming up?

393
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,500
I think you should go get ready.

394
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,270
Ai'Pete, I saw that Ai'Ae was looking for you.

395
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,050
You should go see him.

396
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:40,740
I have something to talk to your friend about.

397
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,810
I also have something to say to "little eyes," too.

398
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,370
Who are you calling "little eyes"?

399
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,870
Your eyes are not that big either.

400
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,580
Uh.. then... I'll just excuse myself for now, all right?

401
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,120
Whatever issue you have, say it.

402
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,560
What's YOUR issue?

403
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,060
Last week, you were just insulting my friends. Calling them disgusting.

404
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,750
And now, you're asking Ai'Pete to be in a relationship?

405
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,000
Are you eating your own words or something?

406
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,180
Before you talk crap,

407
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,110
did you forget something?

408
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:30,840
This is my business with Pete. It has nothing to do with outsiders.

409
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,970
Yeah, I'm an outsider.

410
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,800
I was being nosy.

411
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,330
But those guys are my friends!

412
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,320
And you called my friends dirty.

413
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,560
You called them very disgusting.

414
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,280
And now you're trying to interfere with my friends?

415
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,660
You're thinking of causing conflict between them, aren't you?

416
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,080
You're the fucking worst piece of shit.

417
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,720
There are so many guys out there. Why don't you just pick one?

418
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,440
Don't mess with Ai'Pete.

419
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,850
No one is like Pete.

420
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,180
But Pete has a boyfriend already.

421
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,580
And his boyfriend is my friend.

422
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,360
You, do you really want to protect your friend that badly?

423
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,840
Yeah.

424
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,440
Then why don't you...

425
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,850
spread your legs for me instead?

426
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,530
Just go die, you bastard!

427
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,650
No one has ever punched me twice.

428
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,470
This time... I won't let you go.

429
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,870
Did we... really lose?

430
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,780
Yeah, we lost.

431
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,370
Our team lost?

432
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,930
Who the fuck else do you think it was?

433
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,030
But our team has the best athletes, dude!

434
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,010
Yeaaah...

435
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,420
We are sport science students.

436
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,670
And more than half our roster is from the college football team.

437
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,000
But we lost to the Engineering Department, 3:1.

438
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,100
The scores aren't even close to each other either.

439
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,610
And do you know who the one was that made us lose?

440
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,280
It's the one who kept messing up passing the ball over and over again.

441
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,650
Every time I sent it to you...

442
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,100
you kept passing it to Engineering each time, Can...

443
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,920
I'm sorry.

444
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,380
Forget it.

445
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,760
Winning or losing, it's a normal thing.

446
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,840
But... what's up with you, dude?

447
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,570
I'm not mad because we lost.

448
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,270
But I'm mad with the person who is driving me nuts.

449
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,470
What does that even mean?

450
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,640
You better remember this,

451
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,580
Ai'Tin.

452
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,230
You'll pay for this.

453
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,450
Wait for me, Can.

454
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,410
Congratulations, Ae.

455
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,980
Why don't you look very happy?

456
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,030
Well, I wanted you to win.

457
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,230
But I also didn't want Can to be upset.

458
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,210
I don't know where he is right now.

459
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,800
Ai'Can? You don't have to mind him.

460
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,180
Someone like him, he'll get over being sad in a second.

461
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,270
Geez, for you... You totally pummeled my team, Ai'Ae.

462
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,160
But I'll forgive you if you play this well in the university league next semester.

463
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,250
Right, Ai'Ae. Do you know what's wrong with the Albino Monkey?

464
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,310
Despite being kind of a nutjob, he's never been this bad before.

465
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,040
I don't know either. I'm worried about him, too.

466
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,440
If you don't know, then forget it.

467
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,240
Once he gets really stressed out, he'll eventually tell us himself.

468
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,210
Oh yeah! Where is the Engineering team going to celebrate?

469
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,530
I don't know. I'm not going.

470
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,300
What? Why aren't you going?

471
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,170
The reason Engineering won was because of you, you know. You scored two balls.

472
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,050
I can't. I have to get ready to meet my *boyfriend's family tomorrow.
(T/N: 'Faen' is gender neutral and means both boy/girlfriend)

473
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,750
Huh?

474
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,610
You didn't hear it wrong.

475
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,700
I have to get ready to go to my boyfriend's house.

476
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,300
I'm going to go pack my bag first.

477
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,050
Okay.

478
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,420
Who's his girlfriend, Ai'Pete?

479
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,410
Yes?

480
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,560
And hey... what's wrong with your face? It's pretty red. Are you sunburned or something?

481
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,160
So damn stupid...

482
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,210
Why are you insulting me?

483
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,810
Then... I'm going to go head out with Ae.

484
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,280
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Bye.

485
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,770
What the heck is with him?

486
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,870
Dude, you don't need to be confused.

487
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,460
Let's go. Let's go treat the first years to some alcohol instead.

488
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,870
I don't have money to treat them to alcohol...

489
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,710
But you are the captain.

490
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,760
It's always me...

491
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,400
- Let's go.
- Yeah... Let's go, let's go.

492
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,350
Come on, Ai Can.

493
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,450
Calm down. Winning or losing is normal.

494
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,270
I know it's normal. I just don't want to lose to that guy.

495
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,580
You mean Ai'Ae?

496
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,940
Not Ai'Ae! Shit, P'No. You don't fucking know anything.

497
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,250
Geez. I'll kick you, you Albino Monkey. I was asking you nicely.

498
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,460
Kick me then. Get up and just kick me. I'm not scared of you.

499
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,680
P'No... Please, don't hold it against him. Ai'Can is... drunk.

500
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,870
Good, could I sleep at your house?

501
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,870
I don't want to go home.

502
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,580
If I go back, my little sister is definitely going to laugh at me.

503
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,860
I even lost at football.

504
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,880
No...

505
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,780
My mom... is... going to... yell at me...

506
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,180
Please...

507
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,760
Ai'Good, I'll leave Ai'Can to you. All right? I have a call, I have to answer it.

508
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,360
Where are you going?

509
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,270
I'll be right back.

510
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,650
Hold on, Ai'Nic. It's too loud here.

511
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,370
Can I sleep over, please?

512
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,610
Please.

513
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,410
Why don't you ask the others?

514
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,610
Is your house available?

515
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,460
Let's just toast.

516
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,100
Hello, Ai'Nic. What's up?

517
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,480
Where are you right now?

518
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,930
I'm at a bar. I'm taking care of a drunk freshman.

519
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,000
P'No, what time are you coming back?

520
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,380
It'll be whatever time it is.

521
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,200
Can you give me a specific time?

522
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,810
Hey, you are my little brother. Not my mom.

523
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,120
Oh, come on, P'No. Just tell me, please.

524
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,940
Then I probably won't be back. I have to take care of the drunk freshman.

525
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,170
Tell Mom for me, okay? Later.

526
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,900
What's with him lately?

527
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,900
He's been on me even more than Mom.

528
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,420
Whatever.

529
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,940
So, my big brother isn't coming home.

530
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,730
Yeah, I heard that.

531
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,180
Then you should go home, Ai'Kla.

532
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,220
Who's the underclassman that P'No has to drop off?

533
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,030
Who the hell is he? I'm starting to hate him now.

534
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,820
I see you just hating anyone who gets close to my older brother.

535
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,640
Or should I put him in bed and finish him already?

536
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,810
Are you serious?

537
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,070
What?

538
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,870
It's gotten this far, and I'm not going to take it seriously?

539
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,630
And you have to help me, too.

540
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,830
Stop right there. I'd like not to get involved with this.

541
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,030
I have a business proposal for you on this.

542
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,610
Is it going to be a deal or not?

543
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,340
Of course, it's a deal.

544
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,720
You're pretty easy, dude.

545
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,780
Of course, I'm easy.

546
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,680
It's settled.

547
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,410
Come on, let's go inside the house, Ae.

548
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,210
Look at your house! You are so out of my reach.

549
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,900
Are you sure that I'm allowed to come?

550
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,010
Of course, you're allowed to come.

551
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,960
Well, my mom is the one who wanted you to come.

552
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,820
But I came here empty-handed. I don't have a single gift at all.

553
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,250
It's all right. Just you coming here is already the best gift.

554
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,980
Hold on.

555
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,620
Is that a gift for you or for your mom?

556
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,920
For Mom, of course.

557
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,730
Well, Mom wanted you to come. If you came, it's only normal for her to be happy.

558
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:02,980
Actually, I'm the one that wanted you to come.

559
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,360
You're always making yourself to be so cute, Ai'Koon Chai.

560
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,820
Yes... But we can't use a word like "cute" for a tall guy like me.

561
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,540
Then you can use it for me then.

562
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,610
It's not like I'm calling you "cute" or anything.

563
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,920
I'd say you're "Tay" (Cool/Handsome) instead.

564
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,810
What did you say?

565
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,320
I'd say you're "Tay" instead.

566
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,030
If a shortie like me is "Tay,"

567
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,960
then someone tall like you can be "cute" for me, too.

568
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,100
If I'm willing to be cute in your eyes.

569
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,160
You'll be "Tay" only for my eyes, right?

570
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,870
Let's go inside the house, Ai Koon Chai.

571
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,560
Okay.

572
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,700
Before I can't stop myself and kiss you, right here.

573
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,140
Okay.

574
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,640
Ae, which flower do you think is pretty?

575
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,360
It already looks nice on the plant.

576
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,010
Why would you cut them?

577
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,470
I... put roses in a vase for my mom's birthday every year.

578
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,700
So, why does it have to be roses?

579
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:49,001
When I was very young,

580
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:53,400
a big bouquet of roses was always delivered on her birthday every year.

581
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,480
So I asked her who sent them to her.

582
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,920
Mom said that dad sent them.

583
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,130
At that time, I thought that my dad loved my mom very much.

584
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:09,323
But I also wondered why didn't dad just deliver them himself.

585
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:14,893
Until I realized that... the one who sent them was my dad's secretary.

586
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,095
What flowers are these? They're so beautiful.

587
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:23,444
They are roses.

588
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:25,944
Your dad sent them to mom.

589
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,950
Do you like them?

590
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,230
It's something strange.

591
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,450
Because presently, that secretary is my father's new wife.

592
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,759
He never remembered our faces, Ae.

593
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:02,289
He never remembered my mother's birthday at all.

594
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:10,197
Once dad and mom got divorced, there were no roses sent over ever again.

595
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,400
So I decided to pick roses for my mom.

596
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,050
At that time, my hands were covered in wounds.

597
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,760
Some roses looked nice, others were not so much.

598
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,940
And I also told my mom that...

599
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,340
From now on, I'll be the one who gives you roses every year.

600
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,320
Thank you, dear.

601
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,920
Oh, my!!! Does it hurt, son?

602
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,270
Thank you so much.

603
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,360
If you can make your mother happy,

604
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,130
then I will be the one to make you happy.

605
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,320
So, which flower do you want?

606
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,740
I'll cut them for you.

607
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,310
This one.

608
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,050
♫ I won’t wish to catch those distant stars ♫

609
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:34,330
♫ I don’t want to make them mine ♫

610
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,600
♫ I won’t wish for the world to keep spinning ♫

611
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:44,020
♫ I won’t turn back time ♫

612
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,860
♫ In this universe, there is nothing more meaningful ♫

613
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,910
♫ Than you whom I am longing for ♫

614
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,310
♫ I only beg for you to be with me forever ♫

615
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,000
♫ You're the only one I'm asking for ♫

616
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,320
♫ I want you to be my sky when I fly ♫

617
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,640
♫ Be my guiding star when I'm lost ♫

618
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,500
- Hello.
- Hello, Ae

619
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,310
I'm so sorry. I just had some important work come up.

620
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,270
So I wasn't able to stay and welcome you. Even though I'm the one who invited you.

621
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,230
So where is Pete, dear?

622
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:27,539
The roses, huh?

623
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:32,376
Ai'Pete does this every year?

624
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:34,155
Yes.

625
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:36,645
The first year I saw it,

626
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,160
my heart was going to stop.

627
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,830
His hands were covered with blood and wounds all over.

628
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,780
I should've hit him until it left marks on his butt.

629
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,300
Ai'Pete is really happy to be able to do it for you, Auntie, really.

630
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,760
Yes.

631
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,480
I know that... Pete wants to make me happy.

632
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,450
So it's also not wrong if I want to do everything I can for Pete's happiness, right?

633
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,607
Auntie, you knew...

634
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:19,307
Who came?

635
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,670
Who came?

636
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,440
Khun Putch. Khun DeLi's here.

637
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:40,051
Happy birthday, Auntie.

638
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,340
How many times have I told you that you don't need to bring a gift, dear?

639
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,920
Just your feelings is enough.

640
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,120
I can't do that. Last year, I wasn't able to come. So this year, I have to be able to give it to you myself.

641
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,410
Oh! My mother also wanted me to give you her regards too, Auntie.

642
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,830
She happened to be stuck with some business today, so she wasn't able to come herself.

643
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,010
Then... please relay my thanks to your mother, all right?

644
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,660
Yes.

645
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,300
So, have you met each other before?

646
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,910
This is Ae, dear. He's Pete's friend from university.

647
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,660
Hello.

648
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,020
Ae, DeLi has been my friend since we were little kids.

649
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,680
Hello.

650
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,690
Then I'll leave you kids to chat for first. I'll excuse myself for now, all right?

651
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,040
- Sure.
- Okay, Mother.

652
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,570
That's very nice to be able to be at the same university as Pete, too.

653
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,160
Actually, I wanted to study there, too.

654
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,760
But my dad wouldn't let me.

655
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,830
He said that I had to study at the same place he did no matter what.

656
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,210
Such a shame. Right, Pete?

657
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,800
Pete?

658
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,340
Yeah, it's such a shame that we don't see each other very much.

659
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,008
True.

660
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:54,788
Then... should we meet more often then?

661
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,030
[Preview]

662
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,220
Pete, you know how to peel shrimp now?

663
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,940
And still remember that I don't know how to do it.

664
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,050
You know something, right? Tell me right now.

665
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,540
Ai'Tum! I really don't know anything.

666
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:22,150
You came home, but you're not even thinking of greeting your older brother at all?

667
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,270
Gucci!

668
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,060
Thank you very much for...

669
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,032
Help...

670
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:29,912
Ai...
