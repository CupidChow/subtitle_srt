♫  Hug me a little longer. Hold me more tightly than yesterday  ♫

26
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,100
We're finally done with exams!!! Woohoo!!!

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,210
So for this break, where are you guys going to travel to?

28
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,100
Of course, we're going to the beach. What kind of question is that?

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,920
The beach?

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,020
Yes.

31
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,980
Which beach?

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,340
The one that you're not going with us.

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,470
Where is it? I want to go, too!

34
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,100
You're not going either!

35
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,410
Oh, right. Dude, is Ai'Pete coming, too?

36
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,080
No.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,450
If he went, he wouldn't know anyone anyway.

38
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,220
He'd just pointlessly be uncomfortable.

39
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,250
Not just me missing this trip.

40
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,250
He'll be uncomfortable? Or is it that you'll be uncomfortable because of Ai'Sun?

41
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,250
What Sun are you talking about...

42
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,630
What "sun"?

43
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,760
Oh right! Come on! Let's take a picture for some memories!

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,670
I've just gotten a new phone.

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,050
- Wow.
- Since Ai'Bow won't be going.

46
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,250
Hey, you guys!

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,430
It's really big!

48
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,310
What are you guys doing?

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,440
- Taking a picture.
- Let me join in, too!

50
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,640
It's my new phone. Come.

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,920
- So what about it?
- You hold it.

52
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,580
Here... Turn the camera here.

53
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,010
- Turn the camera?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,130
That's turning the phone around!

55
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,120
Ai'Bow, press it, too!

56
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,920
What?

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,160
This is also the wireless remote shutter.

58
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,850
Where?

59
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,560
Look at the button, press it.

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,830
- Look.
- How?

61
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,840
1... 2... 3.

62
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,980
1... 2... Woohoo...

63
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,850
There... Perfect!

64
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,900
My phone.

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,610
- Let's take pictures elsewhere.
- Give it back already.

66
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,150
- I like it though...
- No. Buy your own.

67
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,330
- Let's take pictures elsewhere...
- Can I have the stylus?

68
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,630
I need to use the stylus too, so no.

69
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,380
- Guys... Look... The car door opened.
- Let's take pictures elsewhere.

70
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,270
How amazing.

71
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,760
- Hey! What a great stylus!
- How about you guys get together and buy a new one, all right?

72
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,090
- Hey! Give me my stylus!
- I'm going to go.

73
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,640
I'll go, too.

74
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,700
Tar...

75
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,180
Where is Mom?

76
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,270
Mom went to work already.

77
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,940
I have a question to ask.

78
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,740
I have to call a friend in France.

79
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
I'm going to excuse myself a bit.

80
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,810
Tar!

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,380
Tar!!!

82
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,470
Who said you could come in?

83
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,410
Tar... We have something we need to discuss.

84
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,740
But I don't!

85
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,230
Get out already!

86
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,700
Tar! Why do you have to try to hide it from me?

87
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,470
I know that something happened, but you won't tell me!

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,960
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,650
I don't understand.

90
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,360
And just get out already.

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,660
Tar! Why do you have to hide it from me?

92
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,030
If there's something going on, then tell me!

93
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,410
So I can help you!

94
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,610
Whatever you try to do, you can't help me.

95
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,610
Why the hell can't I help you?

96
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,610
Tar, why don't you try telling me first!

97
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,510
P'Tum, just leave.

98
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,060
I don't have anything to say anymore.

99
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,680
Tar, why can you tell Ai'Tharn and Ai'Type?

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,650
But you can't tell me?!

101
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,760
Right...You're still hung onto Ai'Tharn, is that it?

102
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,880
P'Tum... You are talking nonsense now.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,140
Tar... Let me tell you something.

104
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,580
No matter how badly you want to go back to Ai'Tharn,

105
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,540
there will never be a day where he'll ever come back to you!

106
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
P'Tum... Get off!

107
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,720
Get off... Get off...

108
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,700
Get... off...

109
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,660
Get..

110
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,050
Don't!

111
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't...

112
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,840
Get off!

113
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,870
Get off...

114
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,930
Get off!

115
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,730
P'Tum... Stop...

116
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,760
Stop...

117
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:40,900
P'Tum... Get off!

118
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,120
Don't look down on me!

119
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,550
When you don't even know anything!

120
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,900
Get out!

121
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,600
P'Tum, you don't know anything... What I've been through...

122
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:12,630
[I bought you dinner. You should eat it. I went out to meet a friend. And... I'm Sorry.]

123
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,450
P'Tum, please don't love someone like me...

124
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,830
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,160
Thank you, P'Tum.

126
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,979
"For second place,

127
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:37,900
the young and handsome guy that many girls want to date the most...

128
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,270
The scores were extremely close to our first place winner.

129
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,210
The reason being is that this handsome young man already has a beautiful wife,

130
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:53,180
although he may never lose the title of being the dream guy for many women.

131
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,500
And the second-place winner that we're talking about is...Tul Medthanan."

132
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,010
Is this really Ai Tin's brother?

133
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,430
Their faces are totally different.

134
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,720
You mannerless bastard

135
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,380
Fake.

136
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,720
You terrible person.

137
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,870
Seeing his face makes me want to really punch his face!

138
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,310
I'm not interested! I'm not interested!

139
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,050
I'm not interested! I don't care! I'm not going to reply either!

140
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,300
Why do you keep bothering me so much?!

141
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,260
Fine, I'll just mute it!

142
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,160
Ai'Tin... Are you threatening me?

143
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,580
Hello...

144
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,830
What is it, dude?

145
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,900
Why did you ignore my message?

146
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,140
It's not that I wouldn't reply... I didn't see it...

147
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,740
Five minutes ago, you just changed your profile picture.

148
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,740
Well...

149
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,830
I changed the picture and just put my phone down.

150
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,760
But my first message was sent about an hour ago.

151
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,630
Fine... Whatever it is, just say it.

152
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,650
I don't have a lot of time to talk to you.

153
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,650
I still have to go play with my dog.

154
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,430
Do you know something?

155
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,250
You are acting like you are avoiding to pay the debt.

156
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,760
Hey! I'm not avoiding the debt!

157
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,470
Someone like Kirakorn never avoids a debt to anyone!

158
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,210
And also, it hasn't even been a week yet.

159
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,540
You can't be saying that I'm avoiding the debt!

160
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,430
But you are acting like that.

161
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,250
So what do you want me to do? Say it.

162
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,320
If I tell you, will you do it?

163
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,760
Yeah, I'll do it. Just tell me already.

164
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,070
Good.

165
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,140
Message me right after you wake up.

166
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,700
Reply to my message within an hour.

167
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,960
And if you fail to do so, it means you broke your promise.

168
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,270
Understood?

169
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,910
Yeah... fine.

170
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,680
Then from now on, every morning,

171
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,760
I'll be the first one to send you "Good Morning."

172
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,050
I'll even throw in, before you go to bed, a really sweet sticker for you, too!

173
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,520
Are you happy now?

174
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,760
That's all I want to hear.

175
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,160
Hopefully, you'll keep your words.

176
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,870
Bye...

177
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,260
Ai'Tin!

178
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,540
You tricked me again...

179
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,070
And Ai'Can... Ai'Can...

180
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,940
How could you randomly make promises?

181
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,360
Am I going to be able to do this?!

182
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,260
Right... Can...

183
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,630
You really are so stupid!

184
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,270
Ai'Tin uses a profile picture, too...

185
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,780
This should be the picture that Ai'Ley wanted.

186
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,740
Ai'Ley! I finally got Ai'Tin's picture for you.

187
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,470
Is she not here?

188
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,610
Then I'll just sit and play around in her room then.

189
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,210
What was she looking at?

190
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,650
Shit!!!

191
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,380
Brother Can!

192
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,850
How can you come into my room?

193
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,500
What are you looking at?

194
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,430
Brother Can!! Get up and away right now!

195
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,940
Ai'Ley...

196
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,540
What have you been up to?

197
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,850
Ley...

198
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,520
I'm a BL Fangirl.

199
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,590
BL fangirl...

200
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,440
that likes guys flirting with guys?

201
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,470
Yeah. Why? Got a problem?

202
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,010
No...

203
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,850
I also have friends like that, too.

204
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,740
I just never thought that my little sister would be this advanced level of...

205
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,690
Brother Can!

206
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:12,290
We call it Appreciation of Masculine Body Art,

207
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,700
and... please don't tell Mom, all right?

208
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,760
Fine...

209
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,490
I'm going back to my room, all right?

210
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,890
Hold on

211
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,820
Since you know it now...

212
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Brother Can, you have to help me with one thing...

213
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,780
What do I have to help you with this time?

214
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,070
About P'Tin and P'Pete,

215
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,710
I want to know more about them.

216
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,890
So, Brother Can,

217
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,400
you need to investigate

218
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,380
and be ready to report to me 24-7.

219
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,200
Okay?

220
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,590
Understood?

221
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,240
No... I don't understand.

222
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,380
Brother Can, it's such a simple matter, why can't you understand it?

223
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,280
Have you forgotten?

224
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,040
Just who is it that makes the food you eat?

225
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,710
What if one day...

226
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,380
I mistakenly grab...

227
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,000
instead of chili, a cockroach... for example...

228
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,560
- Just how yummy would your food be?
- Geez!

229
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,270
I don't know.

230
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,210
Also, you must full-heartedly help the P'Pete x P'Tin ship, too.

231
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,820
And... don't tell Mom, either.

232
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,870
Good.

233
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,180
Therefore, I'll consider it that you've agreed. You must be ready to report 24-7.

234
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,450
Okay? Understand? Go. Go back to your room.

235
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,670
Report 24-7, all right?

236
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,290
I don't want to tell you...

237
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,540
Ai'Tin likes your older brother, actually...

238
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,580
You want me to say "sweet dreams" every night, right?

239
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,800
Fine...

240
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,140
Take this then.

241
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,620
And what do I have to be so irritated about?

242
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,340
Just because Ai'Ley misunderstands

243
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,340
that Ai'Tin is after Ai'Pete.

244
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,510
But whatever!

245
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,870
It's all because of you, Ai'Tin!

246
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,890
Making me all irritated!

247
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,010
"I hope you have a nightmare..."

248
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,110
Abracadabra!!!

249
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,170
Have a nightmare for sure!!!

250
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,800
I think...

251
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,870
Tonight, I'll probably be having a good dream instead.

252
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,980
Lately, Tin, it looks like you've changed.

253
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,400
How so?

254
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Well... Tin, you look more approachable now.

255
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,160
Do you know? When he'll be coming to campus?

256
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,840
Tin, do you mean Can?

257
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,360
I've heard that... Can has soccer practice next week.

258
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,780
Right... Can sent a LINE message to say that he changed his number already.

259
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
Tin, did you know that yet?

260
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,510
That right there. Tin, you really did change.

261
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,850
Tin, you don't have to answer me.

262
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,100
But... I'm sure that it must be because of Can.

263
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,260
If you think that way, then it's not wrong.

264
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,050
Hello, Ai'Good.

265
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,160
Why the hell did you rush back home?

266
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,940
Look, I'm already here at the soccer field.

267
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm... not... betraying... you.

268
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,390
Because... I... didn't...make...plans...with...you...

269
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,270
Oh, come on... I left you a message.

270
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,710
See? You made me make a pointless trip again.

271
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,400
I already spent money on a ride here.

272
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,510
The sun is freaking hot.

273
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,750
I'm all covered in sweat now.

274
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,140
It's... your money... Not mine... Bye...

275
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,380
Ai'Good!

276
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,690
Bloody Holy Moly... All gods and Buddha's bless me!!!

277
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,020
You scared me.

278
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,270
What are you doing here?

279
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,740
Don't be stupid.

280
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,870
This is the university.

281
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,110
So, of course, I'm here to learn.

282
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,200
You called me stupid again.

283
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,910
I'm not stupid at all!

284
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,270
I'm just foolish...

285
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,490
and I believe people too easily.

286
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,850
You can't call me stupid again, all right?

287
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,740
Your face is all red.

288
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,940
I'm not... I'm not blushing or anything.

289
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,300
I just had a long walk, and the sun was hot.

290
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,400
It doesn't-doesn't have anything to do with you.

291
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,690
If you're not blushing, then you're not blushing.

292
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,970
You're saying that like you don't believe me.

293
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,960
- Get out of my way already! I'm going to go home!
- Wait.

294
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,640
Didn't you say you were going to say "Sweet dreams"?

295
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,660
I d-did... send it every night, right?

296
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,780
That horror clip of yours or whatever?

297
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,910
Why? It's pretty fun.

298
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,890
And the one from yesterday, especially! It was damn scary!

299
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,090
I watched it and it totally spooked me!

300
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,000
You like watching movies?

301
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,220
Yes... The scary ones.

302
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,360
Like the head getting cut off and blood splashing everywhere.

303
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,110
Then should we go and watch a movie together?

304
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,360
I'm not going.

305
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,490
There's. No. Way.

306
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,210
I was even thinking of inviting you to my private movie theater at home.

307
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,290
Your private movie theater?

308
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,140
Is there a really big screen?

309
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,110
Yeah...

310
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,140
And... really soft and comfy seats?

311
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,800
With snacks to munch on?

312
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,250
Yeah...

313
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,400
Sweet beverages?

314
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,020
I have those.

315
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,940
Is there AC?

316
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,060
It's cool.

317
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,660
Is it free?

318
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,320
Free.

319
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,070
Then I'll go.

320
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,400
Then let's make plans for Sunday then.

321
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,100
Then... I'll be heading off, all right?

322
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,050
Bye.

323
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,560
Hold on.

324
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,410
Next time, you should warn me.

325
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,090
Not to do anything to you when you're sweating.

326
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,860
It's salty.

327
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,470
And who told you to kiss my cheek?

328
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,490
This cheek is my cheek.

329
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,880
You didn't ask for permission or anything.

330
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,870
I don't need to ask for it.

331
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,800
I'm just collecting interest.

332
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,080
I'll leave now. I have a class.

333
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,850
Why...

334
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:55,560
do I feel... ticklish... and like I have to poop?

335
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,090
Why did you kiss me? My face is all red.

336
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,320
And why does my face have to be all red?

337
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,960
I'll just use it and make it whiter.

338
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,600
Is it white yet?

339
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,050
Who am I talking to?

340
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,860
Cantaloupe...

341
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,140
Can...

342
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,210
Is it white yet?

343
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,970
It's white, right?

344
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,150
Let's get going.

345
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,830
It's my first year with Ae's birthday.

346
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,060
What should I give him?

347
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,830
If I give him something too expensive, Ae probably won't accept it.

348
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,210
What should I give Ae?

349
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,410
And it's my boyfriend's first birthday since we've been together, too.

350
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,390
♫ I won’t wish to catch those distant stars ♫

351
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,580
♫ I don’t want to make them mine ♫

352
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,940
♫ I won’t wish for the world to keep spinning ♫

353
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,140
♫ I won’t turn back time ♫

354
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,370
♫ In this universe, there is nothing more meaningful ♫

355
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,310
♫ Than you whom I am longing for ♫

356
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,530
♫ I only beg for you to be with me forever ♫

357
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,960
♫ You're the only one I'm asking for ♫

358
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,700
♫ I want you to be my sky when I fly ♫

359
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,380
♫ Be my guiding star when I'm lost ♫

360
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,480
♫ I only beg for you to embrace me in the deep cold night ♫

361
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,640
♫ Hug me a little longer. Hold me more tightly than yesterday ♫

362
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,360
♫ I won’t ask for anyone to understand it ♫

363
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,630
♫ I won’t ask for other precious things ♫

364
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,940
♫ I won’t ask for things that others are craving  ♫

365
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,000
Hello...? P'No...

366
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,130
P'! Today's the start of semester break...

367
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,630
Why would I go take a look?

368
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,630
I'll go! I'll go!

369
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,270
Then, wait for me just a second!

370
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,790
If it's for something free... I definitely wouldn't miss it!

371
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,520
I swear that I'll get there before the market closes.

372
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,660
P', you don't need to hang up!

373
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,640
Hello?

374
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,480
Have lunch with me.

375
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,330
I'm not going.

376
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,720
I have lunch plans with my most lovely P'No. Because he's treating me to a meal.

377
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,180
Why?

378
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,300
I told you already that he's treating me to a meal. Are you not listening or something?

379
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,880
Where are you going to eat?

380
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,480
The market at the university.

381
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,140
Right... A young master like you wouldn't know

382
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,630
that our university holds a small market every Friday.

383
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,030
Wait for me in front of the market. I'll go and see you.

384
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,410
Ai'Tin! I'm going to eat with my seniors!

385
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,220
Ai'Tin!

386
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,900
I have to see him again?

387
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,320
Dude, so where's Ai'Type? It didn't seem like he'd come with us.

388
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,970
I don't know. Probably went with his hubby or whatever.

389
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:10,740
Always the hubby. He's always with his hubby!

390
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,000
He's finally arrived.

391
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,900
We waited until we got exhausted.

392
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,400
P'No... P'Champ...

393
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,260
- What's the matter with you?
- Forgot to poop in this morning?

394
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,590
Free lunch.

395
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,460
Yeah, I know! See? I said I'd treat you.

396
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,960
Here. Just go into the market and I'll treat you.

397
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,080
Treat me to what?

398
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,590
Grilled skewered pork, of course. Didn't you want want to eat skewered pork? I'll buy it for you.

399
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,130
Is two skewers, okay?

400
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,140
Ten skewers...

401
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,120
Ten skewers, huh?

402
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,390
Did you think skewered grilled pork at an open-air market would be 3 baht or something?

403
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,190
Geez... Since I said I'd treat you, you're trying to take advantage of me. You bastard.

404
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,670
But weren't you the one who said that you'd treat me to a meal?

405
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,680
Stop arguing already. I'm hungry!

406
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,870
How could I go with you guys, when I'm this depressed?

407
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,270
Oh! So... you're not going to go with us then?

408
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,340
Geez! What a waste of time, Ai'Can!

409
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,770
Let's go, Ai'Champ.

410
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,860
If I weren't someone who kept his word, you...

411
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,860
What would you do to me?

412
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,770
What's the matter with you?

413
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,320
You're looking at me like you're looking at shit.

414
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,800
Not at all.

415
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,270
And you're even looking at my face and sighing, too.

416
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,040
I even waited for you.

417
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,780
Otherwise, I would've been off eating with my seniors already.

418
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,210
You even came late. And it's really hot, too.

419
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,640
My stomach keeps grumbling and growling, too!

420
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,110
Who said that I came late?

421
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,730
Never mind. Let's go and eat. I'm so hungry that my stomach keeps growling.

422
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,680
Let's go.

423
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,030
Wait.

424
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,280
What's with you now? I'm hungry! It's also really hot!

425
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,800
Did you wash your face today already?

426
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,070
I washed it already...

427
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,260
I thought so.

428
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,830
It tastes so much better than the other day.

429
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,170
My cheeks taste like something...?

430
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,920
Why do I feel ticklish like I have to poop or something?

431
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,240
Here. 20 baht, dear.

432
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,170
Come back again, all right?

433
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,210
Hey! Wait up, dude!

434
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,540
There are so many tasty looking stalls.

435
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,990
The fish maw looks really tasty!

436
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,530
The sausages also look tasty!

437
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,580
The chicken looks tasty, too!

438
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,740
3 for 20, dear.

439
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,660
This is clearly Heaven!

440
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,460
More like hell, I'd say.

441
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,620
It's hot.

442
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,260
Crowded.

443
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,440
Smelly.

444
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,460
How's it smelly? You should try smelling it.

445
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,130
See? The chicken smells damn good.

446
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,800
Uncle?

447
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,020
"Sis!"

448
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,770
Sis, can I have 3 chicken, 2 livers, and 2 drumsticks?

449
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,410
Would you like the butts, too?

450
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,040
I don't know how to eat it (never had it)...

451
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,330
Got it... Got it... Got it...

452
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,240
Have you been selling a lot today?

453
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,520
It's been good. But a bit too hot.

454
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,710
Hey, dude! I'll pay for it myself.

455
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,400
I don't have any change.

456
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,980
You don't need to give me change.

457
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,300
I'll pay you back, all right?

458
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,700
You don't need to.

459
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,520
Can you just hurry and buy it already? It's so hot.

460
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,220
All right! Then follow this Kirakorn. I'll take you around shopping myself.

461
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,030
Dude, this fish maw looks damn tasty!

462
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,220
Are you done yet?

463
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,740
Oh right! I forgot to buy drinks!

464
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,190
I'm going to buy drinks really quick, all right?

465
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,590
Just stay here.

466
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,320
If you go, you'll take forever.

467
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,520
I was pushing it a bit much?

468
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,210
Oh wow... Ai'Can...

469
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,740
Didn't you say you didn't have money?

470
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,860
Are you eating all this for one meal all by yourself?

471
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,840
Not at all, P'... These are my friend's.

472
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,340
But what about you? Where did P'Champ go?

473
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,440
Ai'Champ? Over there.

474
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,910
He ditched me and disappeared who knows where. He left me by myself.

475
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,810
What!?!? P'No got ditched?

476
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:57,200
P'No got ditched! P'No got ditched!

477
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,830
Is it so bad that you're lonely?

478
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,920
Are you done trying to piss me off?

479
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,770
Not yet.

480
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,100
I think I should tell everyone on the soccer team

481
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,860
that you are the dumped captain.

482
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,700
Dumped captain... You as*hole monkey...

483
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,580
- I cannot breathe... P'
- Ai'Albino Monkey...

484
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,680
I'm going to spill the fish maw!

485
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,780
That's a matter of your fish maw then!

486
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,570
What are you guys doing?

487
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,570
The food... are we going to eat or not?

488
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,440
Of course, we're eating, dude! We bought so much. How could we not eat it?

489
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,940
If we're going to eat then let's quickly get going.

490
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,830
Hurry up.

491
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,230
I don't like slow people.

492
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:39,120
Ai'Can, what's with your friend? Why...

493
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,810
does his face look like he's about to kill me?

494
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,010
I don't know, but I'm going to go first, all right?

495
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,560
Ai'Tin! What about my grilled chicken?

496
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,480
What kind of kid seems so damn scary?

497
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,510
Hey! Can you walk slower, dude? You're going to spill the fish maw.

498
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,890
Where are you walking in a hurry, too?

499
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,730
Are you mad at me right now?

500
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm sorry.

501
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,380
I guess I teased you a bit too much.

502
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,190
I just saw you sweating a lot and it seemed pretty funny.

503
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,030
Come on. I'll wipe your face for you.

504
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,920
Do you have a handkerchief?

505
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,320
You don't have one, dude?

506
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,520
It's in my pants pocket.

507
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,670
Which side?

508
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,790
Left.

509
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,470
Left...

510
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,510
Watch where you're grabbing!

511
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,920
I am... See?

512
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,480
Sit down first, dude.

513
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,500
Would you sit, please?

514
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,700
Come here... This servant

515
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,040
will dry the sweat for the young master himself.

516
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,280
You are really sweating a lot.

517
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,290
But I only teased you a little bit. I don't see why you'd have to be this upset at me.

518
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,510
You've got a handful of food, too.

519
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,460
Or are you hangry (Mad+Hungry)?

520
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,980
There's a place I can recommend!

521
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,970
It's nice and breezy.

522
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,900
I think you'd like it.

523
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,810
You must be in a good mood now, dude.

524
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,310
Good. When you're with me, you have to be in a good mood. You know?

525
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,310
Because I like people who are in a good mood.

526
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,110
And I'm in a good mood, too!

527
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,190
Including that guy?

528
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,990
Oh! You mean P'No?

529
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:43,280
Yeah! P'No is a guy who's pretty cheerful too, dude.

530
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,480
Although he tends to be irritated, but whatever.

531
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Always calling me Ai'Albino Monkey this and that...

532
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,120
But he always lets the Albino Monkey do as he wishes.

533
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,830
As for me, I'm always practicing my dance to annoy the crap out of him in the middle of the field.

534
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,280
It's pretty funny to see him mad at me.

535
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,790
I like you.

536
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,560
I know that already.

537
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,460
You don't even realize it.

538
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,180
Realize what?

539
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,690
Don't confuse me.

540
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:19,210
Explain to me. What do you mean?

541
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,610
I'm flirting with you right now.

542
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,810
I know that already.

543
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,390
I also told you already that, I'm not sure if I feel okay with you yet.

544
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,990
Because I like you, so I don't want you to be close to any other guy.

545
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,220
But that's P'No, dude.

546
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,710
Don't you want me to be in a good mood?

547
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,410
Kissing again, dude?

548
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,010
What's with you?

549
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,520
It's always kissing or pecking my cheeks!

550
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,410
Last time, it was a phone in exchange for a kiss.

551
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,480
Before that, it was snacks in exchange for a peck on my cheek.

552
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
What's with all the kissing, huh?

553
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,520
Are you a "Kissing Monster" or something?

554
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,940
Okay. Fine.

555
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,800
But if I kiss you,

556
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,260
bou can't make a pissed off face at me. All right?

557
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,260
Hmm... then...

558
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,060
This isn't what would be called a kiss.

559
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,580
It's also lips touching lips though.

560
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,580
So isn't that a kiss?

561
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,520
There are plenty of things to eat, dude!

562
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,020
Why don't we eat? I'm starving.

563
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,640
You, little rascal.

564
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,010
But if it wasn't you,

565
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,460
I would've been yelling and mad.

566
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,173
Hello, Ai'Nic?

567
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,653
When is your house going to be available?

568
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,090
That's not it...

569
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:52,210
What I mean is, when will your parents be away again?

570
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,940
Yes, I want to finish him.

571
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,340
If there's anything that you want, just name it.

572
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:08,310
But your big brother... has to be mine.

573
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,670
Bye.

574
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,520
What's up?

575
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,888
Ae, tonight, can you stay and chat with me for a while?

576
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,810
Are you all right?

577
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,300
Well, I just want to talk to you.

578
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,960
Can we save it for another day?

579
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,910
Tomorrow, I have to also help my big brother with some errands.

580
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,600
Just one hour, please?

581
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,460
Ai'Pete, why are you so unreasonable today?

582
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,670
Am I being unreasonable?

583
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,210
Well, I just wanted to be the first one to tell you. Do you really think I'm being unreasonable?

584
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,670
I'm sorry to bother you. Just go to bed. Good night.

585
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,870
What the hell is his problem?

586
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,160
He even turned off his phone?

587
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,570
Hey, Ae...

588
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,470
I already prepared the things for the alms giving for you, all right? (T/N: Monks come by in the early morning for alms. It's common to give alms for merit on birthdays)

589
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,000
Alms giving for what, Mom?

590
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,530
What? Look at you.

591
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,810
What Oh said was actually right.

592
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:34,320
My son forgot what day and night it is it seems!

593
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,070
I bet if this was an important soccer match, you wouldn't have slipped up, right?

594
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,970
What kind of person forgets about their own important day?

595
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,510
An important day...?

596
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,026
What's tomorrow, Mom?

597
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:47,600
What?

598
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,180
Well, it's the day when I pushed you out into the world, of course!

599
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,890
You want me to be detailed?

600
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,870
It was the day when I was still beautiful and glowing.

601
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:05,180
And I also carried my huge belly into the hospital, screaming my mouth off throughout the hospital and delivery room!

602
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,210
While having your dad hold onto my hand

603
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,550
before I was finally able to deliver you.

604
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,850
FUCKING SHIT!!!

605
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,030
HEY! Are you cursing at your mom?

606
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,460
Not at all, Mom. I'm cursing at myself.

607
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,520
Thank you for preparing the things for the alms giving.

608
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,230
Then I'm going to go to sleep now, all right?

609
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,110
Don't forget to wake up.

610
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,320
Ae, Ai'Ae!

611
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,090
You even forgot your own damn birthday?

612
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,530
Answer me, Ai'Pete...

613
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,290
At least let me say sorry to you...

614
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,420
Come on... Ai Pete... Please...

615
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,380
Let me apologize to you...

616
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,430
Hey... What's the matter, Ai Ae?

617
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,130
I saw that you've been trying to call someone for a while now.

618
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,460
Not at all. It's nothing, bro.

619
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,410
[Pond: Happy Birthday, Ai Shorty... I wish you to grow a little higher this year.]

620
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,850
That damn asshole, Pond.

621
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,520
What are you looking at, Bro?

622
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,730
Hey... this guy...

623
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,320
Look... If you weren't my little brother, I would have thought you were picking a fight with me.

624
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,000
Right, P'Oh... could I ask another thing from you?

625
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,050
Hey... Of course, my dear brother.

626
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,390
Lately, your big brother has been in a good mood. My daughter has been really cute.

627
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,960
Whatever you want, I got it.

628
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,730
Name it.

629
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,330
Can I borrow your car to go to my university?

630
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,020
Hey, right now?

631
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,190
Yes, I'll return it later tonight.

632
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,480
Look, Mom was even willing to close the shop.

633
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,910
And another thing, Nong Yim especially practiced singing a song for you, too.

634
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,310
If you're not here, I won't let it go.

635
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,810
Fine... Fine... Just forget about it, Bro.

636
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,460
Look at him. What's with him?

637
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,240
[Pond]

638
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,870
Hello? Hello, Pond.

639
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,690
I finished it already, but... I still haven't given it to him, Pond.

640
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:57,360
The thing is... I haven't seen Ae yet... And I don't know when I'll be seeing him either.

641
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,510
Can I go?

642
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,190
Of course, I do! I really want to give it to Ae.

643
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,820
Okay, Pond. Thank you so much.

644
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,100
Hello, Ai'Pete?

645
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,190
Listen to me first! About last night, I'm sorry!

646
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,110
I... forgot my own birthday.

647
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,850
It's not that I don't want to go and see you.

648
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,180
I know, Ae. I'm the one that needs to apologize.

649
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,800
That I was so stupid that I wanted to see you that badly.

650
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,310
No... No... You weren't stupid at all!

651
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,830
If... I was to tell you something...

652
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,620
Ae, can you promise that... you won't be mad at me?

653
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,280
I won't be mad.

654
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,600
Then, Ae, can you come out to the front of your house?

655
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,350
Pete!!!

656
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,220
Ae... you're not mad at me, right?

657
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,080
That I came to see you at your home like this...

658
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,460
Come on in.

659
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,950
Okay.

660
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,700
Oh! Pete! How'd you get here?

661
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,810
Hello, P'Oh.

662
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,590
I brought a birthday gift for Ae.

663
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,760
Is that so? Right, since you're here already, and you even brought a present for my little brother,

664
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,120
why don't you stay for the party with us?

665
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,590
You can't leave. I'm not letting you leave.

666
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,000
But I...

667
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,940
No, but...

668
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,050
Even with your friends and buddies, you're this mean, Ai'Ae?

669
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,580
Oh right, Pete.

670
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,460
Since you're here already, why don't you stay for the party with us? All right?

671
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,480
Nong Yim also wants to see you.

672
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,750
Then... I'll be imposing on you.

673
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,510
It's not a problem at all.

674
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:08,980
Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you...

675
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,370
Happy birthday...

676
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,250
Happy birth... day...

677
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,670
Happy birthday to Uncle Ae.

678
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,720
Come on and kiss Uncle Ae's cheek.

679
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,550
I'm not letting you.

680
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,510
What is this?

681
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,820
It's Uncle Ae's birthday, so you have to let Uncle Ae kiss your cheeks!

682
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,020
I won't let you.

683
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,010
You're not letting me?

684
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,460
Hey! That's enough! My daughter's cheeks are going to end up all bruised!

685
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,610
- Geez, calm down.
- Oh, Dad... Dad, you need to calm down.

686
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,680
I miss her.

687
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,820
Teasing your uncle, so you deserve to be kissed.

688
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,890
How about once more?

689
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,810
Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete. Help me.

691

692
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,950
Oh! Hey! Mom!

693
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,110
Sweetie...

694
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:18,770
You won't let yourself get kissed, so you're letting Uncle Pete get kissed instead?

695
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,350
How was it?

696
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:24,880
Have a seat.

697
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,390
- Come here, Sweetie. Come here.
- Come right here.

698
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:34,700
Right... Pete, it's pretty late now. I think tonight you should stay over, all right?

699
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,910
Driving back home so late is dangerous.

700
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:37,980
Well...

701
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,150
That's right. Why don't you stay over here?

702
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,100
-Actually, Ae has never brought a friend to stay over here, right?
- That's right.

703
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,760
Hey, tonight, Uncle Pete is going to sleepover at our house. Isn't that great?

704
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,600
I want to sleep, too! I want to sleep with him, too!

705
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,860
Oh! This is bad. It'll be difficult to refuse now.

706
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,850
Just sleep here, all right?

707
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,670
Stay over my house, all right?

708
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:03,290
Then... tonight, please me let me stay over for a night.

709
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,060
All right, come on everyone. Why don't we eat?

710
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,210
What do you want to eat, sweetheart?

711
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,450
I like your cheek even more than I like my niece's cheek.

712
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,240
- Mom, what do you want to eat?
- Come here. Try this.

713
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,420
Make sure they're the same amount, all right?

714
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,610

I'll bring her back to her parents.

727
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,550
She can stay with us tonight, actually.

728
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,190
No,

729
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,450
I don't want her to wake up and see something she shouldn't see.

730
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,310
What's the matter?

731
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,710
Ae!

732
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,920
Now, you are acting like a little baby...

733
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,130
Ae... Ae!

734
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,630
What is it?

735
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:22,510
I really think that I'm annoying.

736
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,270
Why do you say that?

737
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,930
I'm easily upset about you.

738
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,930
And I'm kind of greedy.

739
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,490
I used to be satisfied just to hear your voice.

740
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:43,290
Or smiled all day after seeing you.

741
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:49,310
But now, if you go to bed early or can't come to see me,

742
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:53,200
I'm all upset and sad.

743
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,910
Even I myself can feel that I'm annoying.

744
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,990
Here...

745
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,580
As long as you are missing me, then you are not annoying.

746
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:12,760
But if you're thinking of someone else, then I'll be very mad.

747
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,470
I'm sorry, too.

748
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:24,160
That I forgot my own birthday, make you upset, or make you mad.

749
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
I'm truly sorry.

750
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,910
Forgive me, please.

751
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,080
I have a gift for you.

752
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,220
I told you not to buy me a gift.

753
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,420
I didn't buy it.

754
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,330
But I made it myself.

755
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,770
I handcrafted it.

756
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,520
I don't know if you like it.

757
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,360
You did all of this?

758
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,710
Yes.

759
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,790
I made this by myself.

760
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:05,620
Except for the engraving, I went to a shop to do it.

761
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,630
Do you like it?

762
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,610
Ae!?!?

763
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,670
Thank you.

764
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,510
