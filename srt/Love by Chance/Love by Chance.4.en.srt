Since you're done showering, put on some ointment.

27
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:01,117
Okay.

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,913
Let me see your wounds.

29
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:07,354
Take off your top.

30
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:08,839
Take of my top?

31
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:12,200
Why? Are you feeling so shy? We're both guys.

32
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:33,474
Does it hurt?

33
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,641
It hurts so bad that I want to cry.

34
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,252
I understand.

35
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:39,494
I was also punched like this before.

36
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,254
It hurt like hell.

37
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:44,374
I'll apply some ointment for you.

38
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:47,674
- Let me know where it hurts.
- Okay.

39
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,771
Ouch.

40
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:39,024
Right here. It's going to hurt a little bit.

41
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:03,960
I bet it hurt.

42
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,070
A little.

43
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:12,004
Then if there's nothing else, I'll go back to my dorm.

44
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:14,345
Since you're alone, make sure to properly lock the door.

45
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:15,647
I'll be back to visit tomorrow morning.

46
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,282
Ae, can you not go back just yet?

47
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:19,293
Are you still scared?

48
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,007
Pete, I already told you several times.

49
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,316
If something is up or if there's something you want, just tell it to me straight.

50
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:29,987
Then, Ae, can you please keep me company?

51
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,324
Fine.

52
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:34,673
Another thing, I'm afraid that bastard might return.

53
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,314
I'm still afraid to leave you by yourself.

54
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:52,774
Pete, can I take a pillow?

55
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:55,845
Ae, are you sleeping there?

56
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:58,822
Yes. Where else should I sleep?

57
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,933
I can sleep anywhere.

58
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:05,083
My dorm mattress and the floor here aren't that different.

59
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,969
You can sleep on the bed. That way it won't be uncomfortable either.

60
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:10,310
Why would I feel uncomfortable?

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,311
I don't know if you can sleep next to a person you just met.

62
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:15,162
I'm okay with whatever.

63
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:17,404
I'm just sleeping next to a friend.

64
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,384
Then, you should come and sleep on the bed.

65
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:24,484
Since it's just sleeping next to a friend.

66
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:36,214
What's the matter?

67
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:41,604
I'm already right here.

68
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:46,224
When my sister smiles and fusses, I comfort her just like this.

69
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:49,064
I'm not fussing.

70
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:50,751
But...

71
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,643
Can you hold my face like this until I fall asleep?

72
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:56,234
Are you trying to act weak with me? Hmm?

73
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,264
No, I'm not.

74
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:03,939
Being weak like this also good. It's cute. I like it.

75
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,031
But you should go to sleep. It's late already.

76
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:08,487
Good night, Ae.

77
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:10,512
Then I'll go take a shower first.

78
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:12,123
Okay.

79
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:23,960
♫ It must be love that makes me stand right here ♫

80
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:32,850
♫ It's love that makes my heart want to keep holding on ♫

81
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,300
♫ Although there is no chance ♫

♫ Even if I have to miss again ♫

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,640
♫ But love still asks me to do this ♫

84
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,590
♫ to give to you until you take it ♫

85
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,900
It'll be fine.

86
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,574
If I have Ae,

87
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:58,124
I will be all right.

88
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:00,480
♫ You are my happiness ♫

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,210
♫ If you don't take my love, I'm ready to start again ♫

90
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,420
♫ If in the end, you don't change your mind ♫

91
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,650
♫ It's okay because my heart won't change ♫

92
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,840
♫ You will have to wait for the world to stop spinning
before my heart will stop beating for you ♫

93
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,510
♫ Can you hear me? ♫

94
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:32,540
♫ You would have to wait for the world to stop spinning ♫

95
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,520
♫ It must be love ♫

96
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:08,116
Shit! Pete!

97
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,694
What am I thinking?

98
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:57,154
It's just morning wood.

99
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,634
Yes. It's normal. Just morning wood.

100
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:31,994
Did I wake you?

101
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:39,804
No. I woke up by myself.

102
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:42,004
Ae, have you been awake for a while?

103
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,284
I usually wake up pretty early every day.

104
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:46,484
Pete.

105
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,124
Yes?

106
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:50,884
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:53,114
What are you sorry about, Ae?

108
00:09:58,254 --> 00:09:59,914
That I woke you up.

109
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:04,203
You should quickly take a shower. I have to quickly go back to the dorm to change.

110
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,964
Okay.

111
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,794
What the hell was I thinking?

112
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:20,314
What did you just do, Ae?

113
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:37,254
Pete.

114
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:38,608
Yes, Ae?

115
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:42,538
From now on, ten minutes before you arrive at school,
give me a call first.

116
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:45,114
And if you're going to leave, call me too.

117
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:46,684
I'll take you back.

118
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:48,894
And next time, don't walk back by yourself.

119
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,614
Do you understand?

120
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:54,614
I don't think he'll be back for a while, Ae.

121
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:56,055
I'm not underestimating him.

122
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,858
I already told you I'll protect you for sure.

123
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,833
So, I'll have to do it then!

124
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,414
But I don't want to bother you that much.

125
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:06,585
You'll bother me more...if you make me worried again like last night.

126
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:11,907
If you're so considerate of me,

127
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:15,178
let me play with your cheeks next time. How about that?

128
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:18,187
Now go home.

129
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:20,907
Your mom must be so worried about you.

130
00:11:20,907 --> 00:11:22,934
Right, I forgot something.

131
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,864
Give me your hand.

132
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:44,494
When you get a new phone, make sure to call me, too.

133
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:47,137
Thank you so much, Ae.

134
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,650
Is that your bag?

135
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,862
Yes.

136
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,463
It's was about to fall in.

137
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,677
Here.

138
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:31,594
Thank you.

139
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:33,963
Then, I'll be leaving first.

140
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,986
Geez. Right on time.

141
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:49,366
Ai'Ae, where the hell did you disappear to last night?

142
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:53,416
Do you know? It's all your fault if I'm late. Because you didn't wake me up.

143
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,897
When I got back to the room, I woke you up already.

144
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,584
But you said you wanted ten more minutes.

145
00:12:57,585 --> 00:13:00,556
Geez! Why did you listen to me?

146
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:02,316
You know damn well that I was sleep talking.

147
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,596
You shouldn't trust me!

148
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:05,938
Yeah. I can trust that.

149
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:11,026
Ai'Shorty! You better confess nicely to me!

150
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:14,107
That last night you were... AH~

151
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,196
With Ai'Pete already, right?

152
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,806
"Ah," your dad! Asshole!

153
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:24,516
Come on. Go ahead and tell me.

154
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,623
You and me, we're friends.

155
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,045
You can tell me.

156
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,706
I can take it.

157
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,486
Look. Did you know?

158
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:35,028
Ai'Ping and I, we have a bet.

159
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:37,185
That you are bottoming for Ai'Pete.

160
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:40,716
Or Ai'Pete is bottoming for you?

161
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,796
If you don't stop thinking about it,

162
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:45,436
you will be at the bottom underneath my feet.

163
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,544
Why are you so cruel to me, honey?

164
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:49,618
If that's true, why don't you getting under my feet then.

165
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:53,038
All right, all right. Sit down in your places already.

166
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:57,106
Okay. We'll continue with what we left off last week, everyone.

167
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:01,286
You should watch yourself.

168
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,066
I just want to know.

169
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:06,529
- Asshole Pond!
- Calculus. Come on. Chapter 4.

170
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,386
Fine.

171
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:33,469
Ae!

172
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:36,670
Ae!

173
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,437
Have you seen my underwear? Get it for me, would you?

174
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:43,979
Ai'Ae! Can you hear me?

175
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:44,692
Ai'Ae!

176
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,455
Are you calling for your dad?!

177
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:49,116
I called you and you wouldn't turn around.

178
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:52,296
Geez, you're standing there still worried about Pete, right?

179
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:53,786
If you're worried about him, then give him a call.

180
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:57,566
Don't be stupid. I told you that his phone was stolen.

181
00:14:57,566 --> 00:15:00,436
But I'm smart enough to know that...

182
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:02,126
You admit that you are being worried about him.

183
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:05,066
I'm right on the mark, right?

184
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:10,286
Ai'Pond, do you think it's possible?

185
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,816
That suddenly I got aroused?

186
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:14,786
What? Oh my god!

187
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:17,525
Shit. That was close.

188
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,613
What did you just say?

189
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:21,346
You got aroused!?

190
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:23,511
Thank god for giving him the sexual feeling.

191
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:27,425
I'm so damn happy. You're finally a normal human being!

192
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,196
But wait a minute.

193
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,823
Short and tiny as yourself... Don't think of coming on to me. I don't want it.

194
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:35,263
Can you not mess around? I'm being serious here.

195
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:38,065
Okay, okay, okay... I can be serious then.

196
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,626
Geez, I'm just worried about it.

197
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:45,346
Well, don't think that when you're feeling it you have to "kick the ball."

198
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:46,796
Teenagers like us,

199
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:50,866
seeing some boobs or asses; of course, it's normal to get aroused.

200
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,383
18 not 80.

201
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:58,045
Look at me. In one day, I probably can get aroused 10-20 times a day.

202
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,152
Because you are a pervert, asshole.

203
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:02,216
All right, I won't argue with that.

204
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:07,496
But... come on. I'll show you my collections instead. Hurry up.

205
00:16:07,496 --> 00:16:08,966
I don't want to. I'd rather go out for a run.

206
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,530
What the heck?

207
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:13,370
You need to watch this and get it out, not run. Didn't I just say it?

208
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:15,838
Ae! Come back here!

209
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,550
♫ I travel with a nervous heart ♫

210
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,900
♫ I don't know where this road will end ♫

211
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,896
[I got a new phone already. I won't go to school for a few days. The bruises still hurt. Thanks for so much today.]

212
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:49,890
[The bruises still hurt. Thanks for so much today. And also... sweet dreams.]

213
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,300
♫ Will there be? Someone who searches for love like me ♫

214
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,640
[Sweet dreams]
♫ Someone who searches for love like me ♫

215
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,470
♫ who searches for the meaning of love ♫

216
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:11,586
Except for Mom's phone number, your number is the first one in my phone.

217
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,460
♫ Until I found you holding my hands ♫

218
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,210
♫ And took me to the whole new world ♫

219
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,350
♫ To a distant land that I’ve never seen before ♫

220
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:32,016
Why are you in such a hurry? Didn't you go out for a run?

221
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,186
Acting like you watched porn and want to...

222
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,786
Ai'Ae! Did you need to poop?

223
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:38,726
Shut up!

224
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,486
Go ahead and curse me. I've gotten used to it.

225
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:43,623
Let's continue watching porn instead.

226
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:48,566
Long time no see, my dear Miyabi.

227
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:57,592
Want to eat anything in particular today?

228
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:59,846
Anything is fine, Ae.

229
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,316
Then you can just sit and wait here.

230
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:02,966
Okay.

231
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:16,546
Let's watch a movie on Saturday.

232
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:17,616
Yes?

233
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:19,786
Pete, I want to watch a movie.

234
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:22,326
And why are you telling me?

235
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:24,666
Come on. Don't pretend to be dumb.

236
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,796
When a friend invites you for a movie, how are you supposed to answer?

237
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:28,616
Oh, are you asking me to watch a movie with you?

238
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:32,046
Hell, yeah. So? Are you coming?

239
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:35,897
Ai'Ae is coming, too.

240
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,536
Watching a movie with Ai'Shorty.

241
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:42,956
Good opportunities like this are hard to come by.

242
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,146
Think about it.

243
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,195
In a really dark movie theater,

244
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,616
a really cold temperature,

245
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:51,156
suddenly...

246
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:54,446
someone reaches out to grab your hand.

247
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:59,196
And after that, someone puts his arm around you. Like this.

248
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:00,946
A golden opportunity like this.

249
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:05,696
If you don't take it, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

250
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,426
Ai'Pond, what the hell are you doing?

251
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:10,556
Nothing. Nothing. I didn't do anything. I'm eating!

252
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:13,786
- What fucking "nothing"? I saw you sitting here.
- Nothing. I was just eating.

253
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,556
I didn't do anything, right?

254
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:17,151
Right.

255
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:26,656
Right, did you know Ai'Pete is watching a movie with us?

256
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:29,726
Oh, Ae wasn't already going?

257
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,426
What? Did I say it?

258
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:34,546
Don't be silly! Not at all.

259
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:37,016
Such small details, forget about it.

260
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:40,956
Either way, Ae is already coming. Right?

261
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,592
Right, Ai'Ping is sitting there alone.

262
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:46,392
I'm going to go sit and eat with Ai'Ping then.

263
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:48,476
See you on Saturday.

264
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:52,752
What were you talking to him about?

265
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:54,386
Just a bit about the movies.

266
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:56,549
Why did he have to touch your cheek then?

267
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:57,816
Don't tell me that he kissed you?

268
00:19:57,816 --> 00:20:00,086
Not at all. Pond didn't kiss me at all.

269
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:04,549
Good. Your cheeks should only be for me to grab.

270
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:16,163
Hey! Watch your step.

271
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:18,359
Oh my.

272
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,433
What a coincidence meeting each other again.

273
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:23,446
Or could it be... that you were pretending you had something to say?

274
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,815
But, in fact, you're secretly my stalker, right?

275
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:27,637
Weirdo.

276
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:30,109
Ouch... That really hurts.

277
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,939
That word, I get it a lot already.

278
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:36,986
Say you're sorry first.

279
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,289
Sorry for what?

280
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,716
You were the one walking into me. I wasn't the one walking into you.

281
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,496
That matter is about that.

282
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:45,772
But about when ChaAim said I was a quarter ghost.

283
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,365
How do you know my name?

284
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,987
Well, I'm good.

285
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:52,088
More like a psycho!

286
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:54,616
Get out of my way, quarter ghost.

287
00:20:57,346 --> 00:21:00,356
Why does being insulted make me so happy?

288
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:09,376
What's with today? I don't see any shuttle buses?

289
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,522
My department building is freaking far.

290
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:13,583
Damn!

291
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:23,252
Hey. Why the hell did you honk at me?

292
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:27,759
My heart is all right. It's still beating. I don't need to go to the hospital.

293
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,526
Hey, you! Rude driver.

294
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,526
Why the hell did you honk at me, huh?

295
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:33,166
Get out and talk to me damn it!

296
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,459
Your family didn't teach you that this is a campus street.

297
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,665
It's for people on campus to walk.

298
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:38,926
Get out right now.

299
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:41,536
Lower your window. If you don't lower your window, I'll break it!

300
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:43,166
Lower your window right now.

301
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,278
Why do you have to honk at me, huh?

302
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:47,898
This is a street for cars to drive on.

303
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:50,632
If you have a brain, you should be able to think.

304
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,196
Who is the one who should say sorry?

305
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:56,106
- Did you say I have no brain? You're the one who honked at me!
- Oh, you can think.

306
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,257
Get out and talk with me now. You honked at me. What would you do if I had died?

307
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:02,737
Then next time, don't walk and block the street again.

308
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:04,645
It's a bothersome sight.

309
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:07,606
Ai'Thai Program.

310
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:09,117
Hey, where are you going?

311
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:11,098
Get out! Hey!

312
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:15,432
Get out! What if I had a heart attack? Where are you running off to?

313
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:17,544
Jerk. I wasn't that in your way.

314
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,486
I'm a human being, not a log.

315
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:23,296
Wait until I can buy my own car. I'll honk at you, too!

316
00:22:26,564 --> 00:22:29,687
Damn it! I'm so annoyed!

317
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:34,637
I... was... so... surprised...

318
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,967
Good!

319
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,087
What with you, Ai'Can? Did somebody step on your tail?

320
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,217
P'Champ,

321
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:44,416
if some stepped on my tail, I wouldn't be this annoyed.

322
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,228
So, what's going on? Tell me.

323
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:48,428
I'm mad P', I'm so mad.

324
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:50,639
This morning my alarm clock didn't even wake me up.

325
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:52,871
Or it did and I happened to turn it off. I'm not sure.

326
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,592
Then I went downstairs and Mom rushed out to work, so I didn't have anything to eat.

327
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:59,047
Then my sister said I was as slow as a turtle with a broken leg.

328
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:01,087
I'm a monkey, you know? Not a turtle.

329
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:03,304
When I got here, the school didn't even have any buses yet.

330
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:05,177
- So, I decided to walk...
- Hold on, hold on, Can.

331
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:08,307
Uhh... You are going off-topic again.

332
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:11,447
So, the thing you're annoyed about is

333
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:12,541
you woke up late,

334
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,346
didn't have breakfast to eat,

335
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:17,247
or is it about your sister insulting you?

336
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:18,867
Can you point it out for us to understand?

337
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:20,587
P'No, did you listen to me at all?

338
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:23,217
Such small matters like that I wouldn't get annoyed.

339
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:25,517
So, have you seen my face?

340
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,037
Should I smack you just once?

341
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:29,347
Just get to the point for me.

342
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,477
You are always mean to me.

343
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,777
The reason that I'm annoyed is because of that IC kid.

344
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:36,597
IC kid?

345
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:39,187
That's right. That IC kid.

346
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:43,097
The type that brags about being rich. The type you can't get along with. The type with a bad personality.

347
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:45,304
I hate that IC kid!

348
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:48,997
And... why are you hating on him then?

349
00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:51,717
Yeah, why the hell are you hating on him then?

350
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:54,947
I don't know. I don't understand. And I don't care either.

351
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:57,857
"I hate that IC kid" means "I hate that IC kid."

352
00:23:57,857 --> 00:24:01,007
If I see him next time, I'll beat him up badly.

353
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:05,097
Geez! I'm so annoyed! I'm leaving.

354
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,217
Hey, Can...

355
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:10,880
Wait for me...

356
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,972
Ai'Champ, can I ask you something?

357
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:17,965
What?

358
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:23,187
So... am I dumb or am I... dumb?

359
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:24,697
For not understanding Ai'Can.

360
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:28,837
It's not just you. I don't understand him, either.

361
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:30,737
I'm also confused here.

362
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:33,397
Perhaps there will never be a day where we can understand him.

363
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:35,624
I told you, he's not like everyone else.

364
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,667
Hey, I'll head off first. My ride's here.

365
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,839
Okay? Hold this for me. Throw it away for me.

366
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,560
- Hey! Hey! Wait a minute! Hey!
- I'm off. See you.

367
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,967
- See you tomorrow.
- Ai'No!

368
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:53,517
What the...

369
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:13,417
Hello, P'Techno... Hello.

370
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:16,464
Hey! What's up Ai'Kla? Thanks for coming to picking me up.

371
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:19,916
I... didn't want to use a motorcycle taxi. I'm still pretty broke lately.

372
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,952
Uhh, Ai'Nic told me...

373
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:25,897
your motorcycle is... broken?

374
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:30,387
Yes, it is. I don't know what's wrong with it. It suddenly won't start.

375
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:34,367
Luckily, Ai'Nic said he'll ask for money from Mom to fix it for me.

376
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,087
I'm even more broke lately because I have to treat all the freshmen.

377
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:41,252
Bad luck on bad luck. Even my motorcycle is broken, too.

378
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:44,387
But it's a good thing you came to pick me up. You really helped me out.

379
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:46,977
That's okay. I'm very happy to do it. Please.

380
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:49,367
- Hey, thanks.
- Sure.

381
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:56,457
Just cut it already.

382
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:59,047
Are you sure that you'll pay for the repair?

383
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:03,277
Just quickly cut it. Don't take your time. I said I'll pay, so I'll pay.

384
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:06,205
Wait... If I cut it, what do I get then?

385
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:11,616
You're in trouble with P'Fai because she knows you're dating several girls at once, right?

386
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:14,013
I'll clear that up for you.

387
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:17,027
- Deal?
- Deal.

388
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,187
Geez. Let's go. What are you waiting for?

389
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:22,877
Yes. Yes.

390
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,797
Thanks Ae for dropping me off.

391
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:44,417
You can stop thanking me already. This is nothing.

392
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:47,496
I told you I'll take care of you, so, of course, I'll do it.

393
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:50,330
Besides, slim guys like you don't look good with bruises.

394
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,820
I'm leaving then. Call me when you are done.

395
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,567
Yes, Ae.

396
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,947
See you, all right?

397
00:27:24,446 --> 00:27:28,507
Hi, Tin. Can I sit with you?

398
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:30,347
Who said you couldn't?

399
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,617
What business do you have?

400
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:38,067
The thing is... there's something I'd like to ask you to help with.

401
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,523
And why do I have to help you?

402
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:41,937
I know this is kind of bothering you.

403
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:45,197
But you are the only one that can help me with this.

404
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,157
I'm sorry.

405
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:50,577
You don't need to make a sad face.

406
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,007
Whatever it is you want help with, just say it.

407
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:53,237
Well...

408
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:54,587
But don't forget.

409
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:58,457
The reason I like you is because of your personality.

410
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:00,911
But it's not that I'm going to help you with everything.

411
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,612
Why don't you just tell me first then.

412
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:05,637
And hurry up. I need to finish my work.

413
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:07,287
Of course.

414
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:12,294
I want you to help me to check this person,

415
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:14,993
what this guy is up to now.

416
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:17,877
What he's up to now?

417
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:21,067
You mean illegal stuff?

418
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,517
I also have no idea.

419
00:28:23,517 --> 00:28:27,977
Don't tell me the one who has trouble with this guy

420
00:28:27,977 --> 00:28:30,717
is one of your Thai Program friends.

421
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:33,197
And you promised them you'll help?

422
00:28:33,197 --> 00:28:34,357
That's why you're pleading me.

423
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:38,107
It's not. This is about me, really.

424
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:44,607
N'Pete-ka! Oh wow! You're with the Prince of Ice, too.
(T/N: "Ka" is a Thai particle used by women, "Krab" is used by men)

425
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:46,617
Hello, P'Money.

426
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,717
Hello there, Nong Pete.

427
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:52,107
As for Nong Tin, you don't have to make such a disgusted face with me, Handsome.

428
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,667
Or do you want to try something new?

429
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,707
No. I'm afraid of getting diarrhea.

430
00:28:57,707 --> 00:29:01,837
Oh my. Is that your mouth or a toilet that you're speaking from.

431
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:08,137
Just send me that picture then.

432
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:09,870
Okay.

433
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:15,457
Don't let me see you alone in the dark.

434
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:20,617
I'll smack your head, pull you into a bush, and swallow you alive.

435
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:22,267
Nong Pete, Nong Pete.

436
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,234
How can you be friends that type of person?

437
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:26,087
Tin also has good sides to him.

438
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:30,347
Besides being handsome, I don't see anything good about him.

439
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:45,425
[Do whatever you think you won't regret.]

440
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:47,947
[Remember that you only live once, Tar. You can be happy like others already]

441
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:52,577
I'm worried I'll regret it later, P'Type.

442
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:55,237
That's why I'm not brave enough to move forward.

443
00:29:55,237 --> 00:29:58,107
I'm not as strong as you are.

444
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:07,443
If we weren't brothers, this would be so much better, P'Tum.

445
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:19,268
What should we watch today?

446
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:21,255
That one. The second one is interesting.

447
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:23,287
Don't want to. I want to watch this one.

448
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,617
The Su-C King... What?

449
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:26,717
What the hell kind of movie is that?

450
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:28,887
It's right there! It's written right there!

451
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,417
All right? Let's watch this one, all right?

452
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,780
- Whatever.
- Any movie is fine.

453
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:36,067
Okay, the two of us go will buy the tickets then.

454
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,777
Do you want us to go help you?

455
00:30:37,777 --> 00:30:40,977
It's all right. The two of us going is enough.

456
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:41,987
Go!

457
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:43,637
Right.

458
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:52,997
What do you think about Ai'Pond's personality?

459
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:55,587
I think Pond has a nice personality.

460
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,887
He might just come off as a bit strange.

461
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:02,017
Maybe not a little. I think Pond is freaking weird.

462
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:04,862
But when you say he's a little strange...

463
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,885
Do you like him?

464
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:10,186
Well... I do like him... Pond is pretty funny.

465
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,329
Hurry up.

466
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,105
- Geez?
- You're so slow. Hurry up!

467
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:18,185
You're always rushing.

468
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:20,173
I'll go to the bathroom.

469
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,400
Why is he looking at me like that?

470
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,900
What the hell?

471
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:30,049
What's the matter with him today?

472
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:32,550
- I haven't done anything yet.
- Right.

473
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,887
Pete, did you say something to Ae?

474
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:36,887
Not at all, Pond.

475
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,007
That can't be true.

476
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:45,297
My instinct is telling me he's mad at me.

477
00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:48,587
And he's kind of cruel.

478
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:51,447
What is he going to do to me today?

479
00:31:53,923 --> 00:31:57,197
He's smiling? Geez.

480
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,500
You sit here.

481
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,840
It's closet to the aisle. You can get out easily.

482
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,560
Okay.

483
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,210
Why is he looking at me like that?

484
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:29,876
He's staring at me again.

485
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:31,046
Switch seats with me.

486
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:32,765
- Just sit.
- You don't see how he's looking at me?

487
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:34,329
You sit there.

488
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,126
He's going to bite.

489
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,690
No, switch with me.

490
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,700
Ae, do you want some?

491
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,380
Yes.

492
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,039
Why is your hand so cold?

493
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,950
I just feel cold.

494
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,221
What was that? I didn't hear you.

495
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,320
I feel cold.

496
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,470
This isn't chilly. It's freezing cold.

497
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,930
I'm all right now.

498
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:44,429
That's okay. I'll hold your hand. I like it.

499
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:46,560
Your hand is so soft.

500
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,093
So, how was it? Was the movie fun?

501
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:12,494
It was pretty fun.

502
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:15,337
Ai Ping, the movie was really exciting, right?

503
00:34:15,337 --> 00:34:17,525
- The action scene was really thrilling.
- Yeah.

504
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:19,345
Only one thing that sucks.

505
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:20,949
What is it?

506
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:24,699
Oh! The leading actress' boobs were not big enough for you, right?

507
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,475
That's also true.

508
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:27,996
But my point is...

509
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:28,887
What?

510
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:30,973
I couldn't eat enough popcorn because of you.

511
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:33,437
The movie didn't start and you kept on eating it and eating it.

512
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:37,108
You should've just poured it into your mouth. I only ate 2-3 bites!

513
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,168
Take this, then.

514
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:40,887
Ai'Shorty, you too!

515
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:43,836
Why are you just holding onto it? Such a waste.

516
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:46,172
It's so dry now. How am I supposed to swallow it down?

517
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,882
If you want to eat it, then take it.

518
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:51,652
Wait... Or could it be...

519
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:58,482
The reason you didn't eat the popcorn, were you eating something else in the theater?

520
00:34:58,482 --> 00:35:02,243
Both of your faces are all red!

521
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:05,744
My "nosy gland" is going, "Beep-beep-beep!"

522
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:10,316
Ai'Pond, your "nosy gland" sounds pretty cute. "Beep-beep."

523
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:15,870
How about this? I'll treat you to a meal to pay you back for eating all of the popcorn.

524
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,612
Treating me to a meal? I'm not eating!

525
00:35:18,612 --> 00:35:21,223
But the thing that you promised me.

526
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:23,432
You said you want to see my dog giving birth.

527
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:25,678
The dog at your house... I'm not going!

528
00:35:25,678 --> 00:35:30,718
At this moment, Ai'Ae's story is more exciting than your dog giving birth or whatever.

529
00:35:30,718 --> 00:35:33,000
- I'm not going! I'm not going.
- Let's go.

530
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,948
You're hungry. I remember! And my dog is about to give birth.

531
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:36,999
- I'm not hungry!
- It's going to give birth. Ai'Ae, Good luck.

532
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:38,749
- Good luck to you, too, Ai'Pete.
- I wasn't nosy!

533
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,326
- Bye-bye.
- Let go of me!

534
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:44,369
Are you hungry? Let's find something to eat.

535
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:47,770
I'm not hungry yet. Another thing, I'm supposed to meet my mom at 7:00 p.m.

536
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,806
It's almost evening, you know. Are you going to make it?

537
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:53,560
You don't have to drive me back. I'll take the bus.

538
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,437
Please let me take you back. It's pretty close.

539
00:35:57,437 --> 00:36:00,220
Okay, don't try to be cute.

540
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,860
Let's go.

541
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:05,933
Hey, Ai'Can.

542
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,309
Hey, Ai'Ae!

543
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,790
And...

544
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,741
Right... That guy that got beaten-up the other day, right?

545
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:14,137
How are you? Feel better? Did you catch the guy who did it?

546
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:16,502
I'm the one who helped you in front of the IC Building.

547
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:18,509
It's a good thing that you're Ai'Ae's friend.

548
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,979
Otherwise, it would've been a problem. I would have thought Ai'Ae beat you up.

549
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:25,889
You just kept saying, "Ae Engineer... Ae Engineer..."

550
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,956
Stop and take a breath, would you?

551
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:29,857
Pete can't catch up.

552
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:33,157
Why? Because I'm alert! I'm alert! I'm alert!

553
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,175
Thank you so much, uhh...

554
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:38,926
Can, for your help that night.

555
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:42,460
Hey, no problem. Ae's friend is also my friend.

556
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,596
Anyway, did you find that person who did it?

557
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:46,141
I'll gather some friends to beat him up for you.

558
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:47,702
No need to involve Ae.

559
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:49,574
Okay. But what are you doing here?

560
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,554
Right. You just reminded me.

561
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:53,022
I'm came here to buy something.

562
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:55,622
So, I'm going to leave now. Bye-bye.

563
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:59,687
I have to go that way. Bye-bye.

564
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,360
Bye now.

565
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,972
Bye-bye...

566
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,820
He's quite talkative.

567
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,490
Yes.

568
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,991
Let's get going. You have to go home.

569
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:09,451
Okay.

570
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,432
Thanks for the ride.

571
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:26,260
Sure.

572
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,610
Get back home safely.

573
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,530
Hold on, Ae.

574
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,985
My aunt just came back from Europe. She bought lots of snacks.

575
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,741
You have a niece. Can I give her some snacks?

576
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,380
♫ I travel with a nervous heart, ♫

577

♫ I don't know where this road will end ♫

578
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,510
♫ Will there be love waiting for me? ♫

579
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,030
♫ Will there be? ♫

580
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,670
♫ Someone who searches for love like me ♫

581
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,000
♫ who searches for the meaning of love ♫

582
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,430
♫ As if I am lost in a desperate world ♫

583

♫ The stars I've seen have disappeared ♫

584
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,990
Maybe...

585
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,040
I like you more than just a friend.

586
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,720
With me? More than a friend?

587
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,780
I don't know.

588
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:49,976
For so many days, I felt really confused.

589
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,240
I always think of you.

590
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,680
I'm worried about you.

591
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,710
I want to see you every day.

592
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,670
How to explain this...

593
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,980
I like to hold your hand.

594
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,000
I like your face.

595
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,990
I like your cheeks.

596
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:14,870
They are really soft.

597
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,083
They make me want to touch or kiss them.

598
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:19,990
I don't know where these feelings came from.

599
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,580
I've never been close to anyone or felt anything like this before.

600
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,860
I'm so confused right now.

601
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,700
I don't know,

602
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,066
what kind of like I feel for you.

603
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,840
A friend...

604
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,874
A little brother...

605
00:39:42,595 --> 00:39:44,493
Or...

606
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,860
Are you mad at me?

607
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,190
I...

608
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,780
Why would I be mad at you?

609
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,578
You didn't do anything wrong.

610
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:03,865
Because you see me as a friend.

611
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:07,080
But I'm doing something like this to verify my own feelings.

612
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,760
You verified it, so how do you feel then?

613
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:14,816
I don't know.

614
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:19,239
I only know your lips are so soft, and I want to kiss you again.

615
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,460
Pete, what's the matter?

616
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,500
Pete, look at me.

617
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,180
Don't make me use force.

I...

624
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,340
I don't know.

625
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,320
Can I kiss you again?

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,170
These are for Nong Yim, right.

637
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,052
Yes.

638
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:13,482
My niece will probably be really happy.

639
00:43:13,482 --> 00:43:16,833
You should quickly go back home. Your mother is waiting.

640
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,800
Yes.

641
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,280
Just now, that was my first kiss.

642
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,000
♫ As we get closer I can feel your warmth ♫

643
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,610
♫ I don't need anyone else except you ♫

644
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,160
♫ As we don't speak a word I can still read
your mind as our eyes meet ♫

645
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,830
♫ From now on we have each other ♫

646
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,420
♫ Even if the road in front of us is long ♫

647
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,890
♫ Even if the road is harsh on us ♫

648
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:56,510
♫ If we have our downtime afterward, we will hold hands again ♫

649
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,800
♫ I'll never let that hand go ♫

650
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,840
♫ Our love will be forever and it will never end ♫

651
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,660
What am I feeling?

652
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:12,420
♫ However things will be. If the universe is destroyed ♫

653
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,140
♫ Just having you still walking right here, regardless of the day♫

654
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,580
♫ Whatever I must face, I'm unshaken ♫

655
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,610
♫ Just to still have you walking beside me ♫

656
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,230
Do you think it's possible I like someone?

657
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:32,079
I've finally found you.

658
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,582
My hero.

659
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,990
I think she likes you.

660
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,370
♫ From now on we have each other ♫

661

665

♫ Our love will be forever and it will never end ♫
