Do you usually have friends sleep over your house sometimes, Ae?

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,550
No.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,240
My house is really far away.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,440
No one wants to come this far out.

31
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,960
What are you smiling at?

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,910
I'm glad.

33
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,810
That I'm the first one who's slept over your house.

34
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,360
And you're the only one, too.

35
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,280
Sometimes... I even feel envious of myself.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,730
Yes?

37
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,660
Others will be envious,

38
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,850
since I'm able to have you as mine.

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,900
I don't see how that's enviable.

40
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,640
Because I tend to be a bit stupid.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,570
Who said that you were stupid, huh?

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,600
So what time do you have class tomorrow?

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
I have a class in the afternoon.

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,070
Then you should quickly go to sleep already.

45
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,920
By the time you're able to drive to the university, it'll take an hour.

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,900
Then... sweet dreams.

47
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,150
Ae, can you hug me like this all night?

48
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,410
Of course, Ai'Koon Chai.

49
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,060
Oh wow... Is this the home of a person or a giant?

50
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,460
The doors are so damn big.

51
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,810
So are you here to watch a movie or take a look at my house?

52
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,850
Uncle Tin! Uncle Tin!

53
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,300
Isn't this that guy's son?

54
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,870
I saw his picture from an interview.

55
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,940
My name is Nong Phu... Not "that-guy's-son"

56
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,020
Yeah, you're that guy's son.

57
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,730
Do you also have a bad personality like your dad?

58
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,750
My dad has a good personality! Really good, too!

59
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,570
You can't insult my dad!

60
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,570
I'll just say...

61
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,595
Did you know that your dad is a terrible person?

62
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:24,000
The worst of the worst.

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,810
Don't insult my dad!

64
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,770
You're crying now?

65
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,670
Oh, kids...

66
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,970
Well... his dad hurt you though...

67
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,230
You won't let me take it out on the dad.

68
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,350
So I'm taking it out on his son.

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,510
Nong Phu hasn't done anything wrong.

70
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,750
The one who hurt me isn't PhuPha.

71
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,850
It's not PhuPha's mom.

72
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,140
If I wanted payback,

73
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,810
I would definitely not want payback on these two.

74
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,930
Do you know?

75
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,080
These two, they're like my family.

76
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,450
Even more so than those other people.

77
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,140
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

78
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,270
This is no fun.

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,040
Are we good?

80
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,600
You insulted Dad! I'm mad at you!

81
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:40,205
Let's make up. Aren't you a good kid?

82
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:42,460
If you're a good kid, then you have to be good back.

83
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,620
Quickly.

84
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,370
So just who is it that's the kid?

85
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,480
Hey! If you say that, it'll tick me off!

86
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,700
Didn't you want to watch a movie?

87
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,320
Let's go then.

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,840
Let's go.

89
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,140
Wow... It looks damn tasty...

90
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,040
Can I eat it?

91
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,900
Go ahead and try it.

92
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,750
I thought you said you'd let me eat it?

93
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,840
If you want to eat... then you have to pay.

94
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,060
Pay what, dude?

95
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,680
Kissing again, dude?

96
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,581
Open your eyes.

97
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,325
Open your mouth, Can.

98
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:25,677
No! I'm going to keep my mouth shut like this. If you really want it, then just kis...

99
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:09,497
Was it delicious?

100
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:16,138
It was delicious...

101
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,316
Can we do it one more time?

102
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,384
P... P'Tum, why are you in front of my room?

103
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:54,053
I came to apologize for the other day.

104
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:58,245
If I did something to upset you...

105
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,967
I'm sorry.

106
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:04,473
Don't mind it. It's already in the past.

107
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:09,843
Then... should we go out to eat today?

108
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:13,731
I noticed that you've only been staying in your room. It must be stifling.

109
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,118
You can go ahead, P'Tum. I... just wanted to stay home.

110
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:23,204
- But...
- I have a small matter to take care of.

111
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,879
Oh...

112
00:11:30,217 --> 00:11:33,176
P'Tum, let go.

113
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:41,460
I'm sorry... Then... you're not mad anymore?

114
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,010
♫  But I still hope, even though I know I’ll be disappointed ♫

115
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,950
♫ I still hope in my uncertain wait ♫

116
00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:01,640
♫ just one time, just once ♫

117
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,470
♫  Only for a fraction of a minute ♫

118
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,580
♫  Let me not have to be lonely ♫

119
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,150
♫ I can only keep praying ♫

120
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,200
Why are you in such a good mood today, huh? To be able to come out and drink with me.

121
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,770
Well, I heard you say you felt lonely, so I'm keeping you company.

122
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,080
Oh, that's right.

123
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,120
Because I don't have anyone like you do.

124
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,850
Then go find someone. That way you don't have to complain to me.

125
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,000
Geez, you've known me for so long. What girl would want me?

126
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,240
Only my little brother at home is waiting for me.

127
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,020
Look, today my mom and dad went out of town again.

128
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,880
Ever since Ai'Nic found out that I was coming out to eat with you...

129
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,580
Damn, he keeps calling me to quickly come back home since this morning.

130
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,560
That Ai'Nic, he tends to feel lonely.

131
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,370
Why? Are you jealous of me for having a younger brother that's worried about me?

132
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,060
Hey, let's toast.

133
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:11,075
All right. Bottoms up. Drink fast. Get drunk fast. And quickly go back. So I can sleep comfortably.

134
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:25,525
Can you handle it? Can you handle it, dude?

135
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:27,000
I can handle it... But can YOU handle it?

136
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,258
- Of course, I can handle it. Another one?
- Another one!

137
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:34,951
- Here, straight up.
- Whoa...

138
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,666
Hey, I'm starting to feel dizzy now, Ai'Type.

139
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,771
Come on, dude. What dizzy? Let's go!

140
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:42,330
All right, all right. Let's go, let's go. Again!

141
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:20,460
Hey...

142
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:23,116
Hey...

143
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,879
Are you okay?

144
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,214
Didn't you say you don't get drunk?

145
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:31,339
Of course, I'm okay, dude. It's just this much.

146
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,949
I'll take you upstairs.

147
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:37,567
- Where are we going?
- Your room, of course!

148
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:41,344
But this is my room right here...

149
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:48,375
Ouch! Ouch! What the... Ouch!

150
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:54,411
Geez, Ai'Tharn. What's up?

151
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,761
I'm with a friend.

152
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,619
Ai'No.

153
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,895
Yeah, sure. I'll go back soon.

154
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,557
Okay... See you.

155
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:17,951
Are you sure you are okay?

156
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,346
Fine...

157
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:20,581
You're going to sleep here, right?

158
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:23,369
Right here... This is my room...

159
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:25,671
Yeah... Your room is right here...

160
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,261
Don't forget to "lock" up the house, too.

161
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,096
I'm already about "rock."

162
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,096
Not rock, geez!

163
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,969
Right! Thanks for dropping me off, Ai'Type!

164
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:52,297
Type... oh, Type... Why didn't you just drop me there?

165
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:16,742
I'm here... This is my room...

166
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:21,308
Who the hell is that? Is that Ai'Nic?

167
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:25,085
Hey, there! Scooch over... I want to sleep... Let me sleep with you.

168
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:28,956
P'No... It's me...

169
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:37,367
Who's that?

170
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,231
Oh... Ai'Kla, is that you?

171
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,126
Ai'Kla, where'd you come from? I'm going to sleep, all right?

172
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:07,787
Lovely like this...

173
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:09,836
You need to be rewarded.

174
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,190
What reward?

175
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,740
What is it, dude? What reward am I getting?

176
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:33,790
P', you seem damn tasty.

177
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,910
I can't hold back anymore.

178
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,740
HEY! OUCH! My butt... My butt... My butt...

179
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,498
Good morning.

180
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,430
Why are you... making that kind of face?

181
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,730
P'No, are you mad at me?

182
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:40,116
Even though you...

183
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,648
You took advantage of me.

184
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:46,742
Took advantage?!

185
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,520
I took advantage of you?!

186
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,910
Woah!

187
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:02,534
I must have disappointed you, right?

188
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:08,197
You probably don't want to see my face anymore...

189
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,682
Hey...

190
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:15,160
I... I'm not...

191
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,880
Disappointed or anything...

192
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:23,950
Hey... Don't make such a sad face. You're not a man for nothing, right?

193
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,450
You're not going to leave me, right?

194
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,730
N-N-No-No-No, I'm not leaving you.

195
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,890
I won't leave you.

196
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:52,191
Especially since we...

197
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,620
already did it.

198
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,070
Hey, I think... we... we should forget it?

199
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,480
It's already passed, right?

200
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,080
Shall... Shall we just let it go?

201
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,835
Is that good?

202
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,916
It's also... my first time...

203
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:30,237
and... I had to sleep with a man...

204
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:36,309
And most importantly,

205
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,418
you've already made me go on a path of no return...

206
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:49,210
The thing is I also just realized... that it would be this good, too.

207
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:54,156
And... you're really cute, too.

208
00:21:55,615 --> 00:22:01,873
I can remember it. I remember your kisses.

209
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:08,185
I can remember what you said. I remember what you asked of me.

210
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:14,238
And... I can remember you putting yourself over me.

211
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,899
And as you moved on me, too.

212
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:24,321
P', you'll take responsibility for me, right?

213
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,711
I think that...

214
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:29,716
P'No...

215
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:35,777
I know that you are a very responsible guy.

216
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:40,867
Be my boyfriend, please.

217
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:43,822
B-Boyfriend!?!?!

218
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:48,110
P'No...

219
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:52,223
I promise.

220
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:55,334
I'll be a good younger boyfriend.

221
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,130
A younger boyfriend that's sweet.

222
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:10,308
P', would you be my boyfriend, please?

223
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,910
What time will you be leaving Bangkok tomorrow, Ae?

224
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,800
We made plans to meet at 7:00 a.m.

225
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,470
But they're always late. So we should be heading out around 8:00 a.m.

226
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,960
Oh... Then I shouldn't bother you anymore, that way you can rest.

227
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,015
It's not late yet. We can still talk.

228
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:00,540
What are you doing right now?

229
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,100
Well, talking to you, of course.

230
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,300
Did you get Ai'Pond's disease or something? Really trying to test me, huh?

231
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,370
♫ I traveled with a nervous heart ♫

232
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,280
♫ I don't know where this road will end ♫

233
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,570
♫ Will there be love waiting for me? ♫

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,980
♫ Will there be? ♫

235
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:30,270
♫ Someone who searches for love like me ♫

236
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:35,070
♫ Who searches for the meaning of love ♫

237
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,470
♫ As if I am lost in a desperate world ♫

238
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,370
♫ The stars I've seen have disappeared ♫

239
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:50,110
♫ Until I found you holding my hands  ♫

240
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,870
♫ And took me to the whole new world ♫

♫ To a distant land that I’ve never seen before ♫

242
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,650
Then I'm going to go to sleep now, all right?

243
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,150
Okay, Ae.

244
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:10,110

[Between Ae and I... This must be "LOVE"]

254
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,510
Tar?

255
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,150
I'm coming in, all right?

256
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,440
P'Tum! What are you doing in here?

257
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,210
What does this mean?

258
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,420
All this stuff... What does this mean?

259
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,060
I already called and asked Mom.

260
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,570
She told me that you're going to go back to France this Sunday!

261
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,270
What does this mean?!

262
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,950
Didn't you say that you were coming back for a while?!

263
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,070
So what is this?!

264
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,980
That's right. I'm going back to France!

265
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:35,220
So, why didn't you tell me?

266
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,750
Because if I told you, you'd be like this!

267
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,100
Either way, I already made my decision.

268
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm going back to study in France.

269
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,910
P'Tum, you should just leave.

270
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,720
Tar!

271
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,810
If you're not going to leave, then I'll leave myself.

272
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,210
I love you, Tar.

273
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,760
Not like siblings.

274
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,185
Not like family.

275
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:26,268
But we're siblings.

276
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,280
I don't care.

277
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,370
I'm going to love you.

278
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,780
And I'll love only you, too.

279
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,540
P'Tum, please don't love me.

280
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,270
Why can't I love you?

281
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,770
Is it because we're siblings?

282
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,110
Because of someone like me...

283
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,380
doesn't suit someone like you, P'Tum.

284
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,370
Who decided that, Tar?

285
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,810
I'm not suitable for anyone.

286
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,370
Give me a chance, please.

287
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,880
Please don't run away from me.

288
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,310
I can't live if I don't have you, Tar.

289
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:37,200
Let go...

290
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,770
No.

291
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,130
I'm not letting go.

292
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,470
There's no way I'm letting you go off somewhere ever again.

293
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,330
P'Tum, you really want to know, right?

294
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,920
About what happened to me.

295
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,510
I was ganged up on.

296
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,610
I was raped.

297
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,120
P'Tum, did you hear that? That I was raped.

298
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:10,360
Someone like me... isn't suitable for you.

No.

I was drugged.

314
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,880
I was raped.

315
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,760
Because it was my own fault.

316
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,420
Because I was the one who was stupid.

317
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,680
Do you hear me? It's because I was the stupid one.

318

That's enough, Tar...

You don't have to be hurt about anything anymore...

320

I only ask for one thing...

321
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,560
Please stop crying.

322
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,940
I'm begging you...

323
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,230
Didn't you want to know?

324
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,440
What happened to me...

325
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,720
I have philophobia.
 (T/N: Fear of falling in love)

326
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,750
I'm scared of guys.

327
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,000
Scared of sex.

328
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,220
P'Tum, please don't get involved with someone dirty like me.

329
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,350
No, Tar!

330
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,930
For me...

331
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,120
No matter what, you're still my Tar. Always.

332
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,220
I'm okay now.

333
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,110
I'm sorry, P'Tum.

334
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,530
I don't see why you have to apologize to me.

335
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,840
I'm the one...

336
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,920
I didn't know anything at all.

337
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,660
I'm sorry.

338
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,040
Since...

339
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,050
you know everything already,

340
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,070
please don't get involved with me.

341
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,970
I can't love you.

342
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,770
I'm also not asking you to love me back.

343
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,810
But can you let me continue to love you like this?

344
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,350
P'Tum.

345
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,410
Tar, you don't have to love me.

346
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,670
You don't even have to think or care about me.

347
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,220
But I'm only asking for one thing.

348
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,460
Tar, can you please not push me away again?

349
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,010
P'Tum, please don't do this.

350
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,080
I already told you...

351
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,800
That's right.

352
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,600
You told me already.

353
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,800
That you are scared of love.

354
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,020
But I never asked you to love me either.

355
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,910
I only ask for one thing...

356
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,620
Can you let me continue to take care of you like this?

357
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,460
Do you know, P'Tum?

358
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,930
Just how stupid you are?

359
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,330
That's right. I'm stupid.

360
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,080
I'm willing to be an idiot for the rest of my life, too.

361
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,480
Even if you just let me take care of you.

362
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,570
One day you won't be able to stand me anymore.

363
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,660
That will never happen.

364
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,660
I love you, Tar.

365
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,440
Thank you... P'Tum.

366
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,100
♫ It must be love that changed my life ♫

367
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,540
♫ So I’ve heard and seen its meaning ♫

368
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,610
♫ It must be love ♫

369
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:36,040
♫ That’s making me wait, it’s easy ♫

370
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,020
♫ Although there is no chance ♫

371
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,730
♫ Though I'll miss a lot of things in my life  ♫

372
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,430
♫ But it's worth to wait ♫

373
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,150
We've finally reached the beach!

374
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,055
When you're with him, don't you ever get tired?

375
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,835
I'm already used to it.

376
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,600
♫ I only beg for you to be with me forever ♫

377
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,890
♫ You're the only one I'm asking for ♫

378
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,640
♫ I want you to be my sky when I fly ♫

379
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,450
♫ Be my guiding star when I'm lost ♫

380
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,520
♫ I only beg for you to embrace me in the deep cold night ♫

381
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,640
♫ Hug me a little longer ♫

382
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,310
♫  Hold me more tightly than yesterday ♫

383
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,380
♫ I won’t ask for anyone to understand it ♫

384
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,090
♫ I won’t ask for other precious things ♫

385
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:11,913
P'Can... P'Can... I told him to ask for a picture. And even now, I still haven't gotten it.

386
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:14,004
He's so mean.

387
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:18,988
Oh! Here comes my dream man.

388
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:24,095
Do you want to go straight home now?

389
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:27,729
I think I'm not going to go back today. I'm thinking of sleeping in the dorm.

390
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:31,832
Dorm? I'm thinking of getting one, too.

391
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:34,745
Tin, you're going to move to a dorm?

392
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:38,367
I think that my dorm is pretty okay. Tin, do you want to take a look?

393
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:42,498
Your dorm? Staying with you would be pretty good, too.

394
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:46,509
Lemon!

395
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:55,107
You remember me?

396
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:59,907
Perfect. I was thinking of giving you something to give to your mom.

397
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:02,626
My mom?

398
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:15,007
Come on... Help me out...

399
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,512
Attack already!

400
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,758
Brother Can...

401
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,465
Brother Can.

402
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:29,595
Huh? What's up?

403
00:38:29,595 --> 00:38:32,570
P'Tin and P'Pete... They're boyfriends, right?

404
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,330
What!?!?

405
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,200
Well... today I saw them talking together.

406
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,120
They were like... It was really cute!

407
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,810
And... it seemed like they're moving to the same dorm, too.

408
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,730
And when they were talking, their faces were this close. Any closer and they could have been kissing their cheeks!

409
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,960
I have pictures, too. I'll show you.

410
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,070
Here... See?

411
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,800
That's not the only thing either!

412
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,430
P'Tin had a gift to give to Mom, too.

413
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,680
At first, I was thinking of not accepting it.

414
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,720
But P'Pete! He kept trying to convince me.

415
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,530
Looking at P'Tin's eyes... It was like they were sparkling as they looked into each other's eyes.

416
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:17,160
Looking as if they could read each other's minds with just a glance. It was too freaking cute.

417
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,120
So I... gave in and accepted the bags.

418
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,020
Those two bags?!

419
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,370
Yes. Yes.

420
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,570
They're so freaking beautiful. Even I freaking liked it. I've been wanting it for such a long time.

421
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,280
But... I still haven't given it to Mom yet.

422
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,120
I know that either way, Mom will have me return it to him.

423
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,550
But P'Pete! He made me promise him already.

424
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,770
He said to just convince Mom no matter what.

425
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,780
Otherwise, P'Tin... what he gave us will just go to waste...

426
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,660
You see? Helping each other and speaking like that... They must be boyfriends for sure!

427
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,110
Return it to him right now, all right?! Those bags!

428
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,580
Why? P'Tin especially gave them to us.

429
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,340
Our family can't be bought with money, all right?!

430
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,570
And what about that phone that you're using? Was that not bought with money or something?

431
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,100
But I'm repaying him back in installments...

432
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,950
So what?

433
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,480
Either way, you still used P'Tin's money to buy it.

434
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,520
I don't know. I like that bag.

435
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:18,000
So I'm going to keep it. And I'm going to find a way to get Mom to accept that bag no matter what.

436
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,130
As for you,

437
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,450
go find out if P'Tin and P'Pete are boyfriends or not.

438
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:28,500
Because... I really freaking love this ship. If they're a real couple...

439
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,820
So cute... So totally Fin!
(T/N: Fin= Slang from "Finish"; It means totally satisfying/good to the point that it's orgasmic)

440
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,540
Whatever. Leave already. I want to continue playing my game.

441
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,880
Leave already.

442
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,220
What about my phone?

443
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,720
Here.

444
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,580
Find out for your little sister, all right?

445
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,960
Yeah... Just go already.

446
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,830
Why is Ai'Tin messing with Ai'Pete, huh?

447
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:35,079
Ai'Tin! What are you doing messing with Ai'Pete?

448
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,598
You can't do that!

449
00:41:36,598 --> 00:41:38,760
Ai'Pete already has Ai'Ae!

450
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,030
Because my little sister said that you're Ai'Pete's boyfriend!

451
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:45,740
How is that possible? You were always with me!

452
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,110
When did you have time to flirt with him?

453
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,707
And... don't tell me that...

454
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:55,385
you and Ai'Pete also... kissed already?!

455
00:41:55,385 --> 00:41:58,830
You can't! You already kissed me!

456
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,160
And you also said that you were hitting on me!

457
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,560
You can't do this!

458
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,510
Don't let me find out that you're messing with Ai'Pete again.

459
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,625
If I find out, I'll find you and I'll stomp your mouth in real bad!

460
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,480
I'm so irritated!

461
00:42:16,854 --> 00:42:20,980
Hey! If you have something to say, say it! Quickly try to give an excuse already!

462
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,450
Why are you being quiet for?

463
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,310
Or you want me to knock at your house right now?

464
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,730
I know where you live.

465
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,395
Is this you being jealous?

466
00:42:30,395 --> 00:42:33,000
What jealous? I'm not jealous.

467
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,103
You're just imagining it!

468
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:37,478
You don't want me to mess with Ai'Pete.

469
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:39,767
That's right...

470
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,200
Why?

471
00:42:41,718 --> 00:42:44,308
Because you're hitting on me right now.

472
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:48,018
You chose to ask if I'm messing with Thai program kids.

473
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,800
But you're asking me if I'm messing with Pete,

474
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,500
even though I'm hitting on you.

475
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,950
Doesn't that mean you're jealous?

476
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:03,659
That's all for now, dude.

477
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:19,776
You've stopped being stupid... Ai'Cantaloupe.

478
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:24,946
This is...

479
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:28,261
Me being jealous over him!?!?

480
00:43:29,246 --> 00:43:31,546
Brother Can!

481
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:33,605
Ai'Crazy Brother!

482
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:35,188
What did you do to my cell phone?

483
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:37,203
I don't know!

484
00:43:37,203 --> 00:43:39,846
I'm using my brain right now!

485
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:43,811
Fine... I'm jealous over you...

486
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:47,007
I'm not thinking anymore! I don't want to think!

487
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:19,100
Hey! Ai'Ae! Who are you talking to?

488
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:24,258
Nosey bastard.

489
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:27,154
If I wasn't nosey then I wouldn't be Ai'Pond, would I?

490
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:31,054
So what is this? Did you miss Ai'Pete so bad that

491
00:44:31,054 --> 00:44:35,926
you're hiding in a corner to talk to him here? I told you to bring Ai'Pete with you.

492
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:38,986
So you don't have to sit here missing him like this.

493
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:41,404
Let me seriously ask you, Ai'Pond.

494
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:44,272
When are you going to stop sticking your nose in my business?

495
00:44:44,272 --> 00:44:47,087
What?

496
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:49,612
But what you said...

497
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:51,900
I think you're right.

498
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,826
What did you say?!

499
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,826
I think that I really do miss Ai'Pete.

500
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:03,553
Wow! My friend has had some growth lately!

501
00:45:03,553 --> 00:45:06,789
Hey! Let me be nosey first!

502
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:10,792
Wait for me! So what were you guys talking about?

503
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,547
Come on!

504
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,980
♫  I don’t know what it would be like without you here  ♫

505
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,780
♫  How many times must I say thank you?
Billions of times isn’t enough  ♫

506
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,630
♫  Even in the coldest place and the hottest place,
I won’t be scared ♫

507
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:03,960
♫  As long as you are there with me, that is all I’m asking for ♫

508
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:19,578
I miss you too, Ae.

509
00:46:47,992 --> 00:46:50,006
Can, what are you doing here?

510
00:46:50,006 --> 00:46:51,753
Oh!

511
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:54,298
I just happen to be waiting for P'Type to bring me my soccer jersey.

512
00:46:54,298 --> 00:46:56,733
And I saw that the IC was pretty close by. So I came here.

513
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:57,461
Oh, I see.

514
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:59,598
I also stopped by to see you!

515
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:06,201
- Ai'Pete! Let me ask you something.
- Yes?

516
00:47:07,795 --> 00:47:10,448
You and Ai'Tin... what kind of relationship do you have?

517
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,967
Tin and I are friends.

518
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:15,390
Why do you want to know, Can?

519
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:18,098
Ai'Ley said that...

520
00:47:18,098 --> 00:47:20,228
you and Ai'Tin are boyfriends.

521
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:22,995
Me... and Tin?

522
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:27,706
Not at all. Tin and I are friends.

523
00:47:27,706 --> 00:47:32,042
That day, I said those things to Nong Ley because I wanted her to accept the bags.

524
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:37,556
I'm a bit relieved then.

525
00:47:37,556 --> 00:47:42,129
It was on my mind for so long. I thought Ai'Tin still hadn't given up on getting in between you.

526
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:45,415
And I thought Ai'Tin was someone trying to catch two fish.
(T/N: Can thought he was trying to catch two guys at the same time)

527
00:47:45,415 --> 00:47:49,017
One person is busy. And this one is flirting.

528
00:47:49,812 --> 00:47:52,879
But after talking with you, I feel so much better.

529
00:47:55,051 --> 00:47:57,151
Can, are you jealous over Tin?

530
00:47:57,151 --> 00:47:58,537
Huh?

531
00:47:58,537 --> 00:48:02,025
This. Can, you're jealous over Tin.

532
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:06,572
I think... you're misunderstanding it.

533
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,061
My phone is vibrating.

534
00:48:10,584 --> 00:48:12,114
- It's really vibrating.
- It's vibrating...

535
00:48:12,114 --> 00:48:14,893
P'Type! P'-P'Type is-is sending a LINE message...

536
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:18,592
- T-The soccer jersey... Right, right...
- The soccer jersey. Yes, the soccer jersey...

537
00:48:18,592 --> 00:48:21,620
- He wants me to go get by soccer jersey. I'm going to head out, all right? Thanks a lot.
- Yes. Yes, yes.

538
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,640
I'm off.

539
00:48:26,983 --> 00:48:30,548
- The soccer jersey... Okay, I'm off now. Thanks a lot!
- Sure.

540
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,133
Here, take this. Next time,

541
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:42,288
don't get it so dirty again.

542
00:48:42,288 --> 00:48:44,993
Next time, I'll make you buy a new one.

543
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,700
It's not like I played and got it really dirty. It's my mom. She likes to wash the clothes together with the colored clothes.

544
00:48:57,429 --> 00:48:59,194
Ai'Can.

545
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,792
What's the matter?

546
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:04,468
It's nothing.

547
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:09,672
I just can't understand myself.

548
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,809
I think that you

549
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:20,947
are in the stage of falling in love it seems.

550
00:49:20,947 --> 00:49:22,460
No!

551
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,690
No, P'!

552
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,403
What love? I don't have that.

553
00:49:26,403 --> 00:49:27,670
Why would I have that?

554
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:31,180
If I had that, it would be like... worrying and sticking to each other.

555
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,000
Being unable to be separated from each other and such.

556
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,020
That I can be alert like this is good already.

557
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,960
Why?

558
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,257
You're chasing me to go get a boyfriend/girlfriend.

559
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:42,267
Don't you love your younger brother?

560
00:49:42,795 --> 00:49:45,295
Go ahead and try making a pitiful cutesy face at me.

561
00:49:45,295 --> 00:49:47,730
Did I ever say that I love you or something?

562
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,372
Geez... You really are damn...

563
00:49:50,372 --> 00:49:52,352
Damn what?

564
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:56,735
Damn... So damn straightforward when speaking...

565
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,603
Can't even say you love your younger brother a bit...

566
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:03,326
If you want someone to tell you they love you,

567
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,550
over there.

568
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,300
Your guy has arrived now.

569
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,390
He's not "my guy," P'.

570
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,320
I'm just teasing you.

571
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,490
Why are you getting so worked up?

572
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,450
I know already that you and he had some punches before.

573
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,081
And you told me before that you absolutely hated him.

574
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,930
And that in this lifetime, you never wanted to see his face again.

575
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,930
So why is it that suddenly,

576
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:44,200
you and he have been together so often lately?

577
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:49,348
But it's not really any of my business.

578
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:51,988
I'll leave these two people

579
00:50:51,988 --> 00:50:54,020
to confess their love... Oh wait!

580
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,410
People who hate each other

581
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,546
to talk to each other.

582
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:03,928
I'm off.

583
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,792
He's not my guy or anything.

584
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:19,221
What are you doing here?

585
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:22,197
Why are you avoiding me?

586
00:51:22,197 --> 00:51:24,536
Not at all. Who's avoiding you?

587
00:51:24,536 --> 00:51:26,416
I'm not avoiding you at all.

588
00:51:27,571 --> 00:51:29,631
What are you smiling at?

589
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:32,296
I'm just glad

590
00:51:32,296 --> 00:51:34,466
that you've started to think.

591
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,150
Think what?

592
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,800
Thinking about me.

593
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,921
Why would I think about you?

594
00:51:44,842 --> 00:51:46,942
Where are you going to take me?

595
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,536
I'm sweating a lot.

596
00:51:55,536 --> 00:51:57,769
And I'm dirty, too.

597
00:51:57,769 --> 00:51:59,327
Let go already.

598
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:01,245
I can go myself.

599
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:30,271
Get in.

600
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,660
I'm not getting in. Where are you going?

601
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,494
I have to go back home.

602
00:52:39,745 --> 00:52:41,915
It's just finding a quiet place to talk.

603
00:52:46,383 --> 00:52:48,343
Didn't you say you weren't afraid?

604
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,058
Then let's just talk here.

605
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:09,335
Be my boyfriend, Can.

606
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,220
Why are you making that face?

607
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,633
What the fuck are you talking about?

608
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:21,189
You already know... that I like you.

609
00:53:21,189 --> 00:53:24,848
Whether it's sooner or later, I have to say it anyway.

610
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:27,176
Oi! Ai'Tin.

611
00:53:27,687 --> 00:53:29,847
Change the question, please.

612
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,790
Okay.

613
00:53:38,469 --> 00:53:41,070
Will you date me, Can?

614
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:45,124
Hey, I told you to change the question, not to change the wording.

615
00:53:47,164 --> 00:53:48,924
There's no difference though.

616
00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:50,854
And why are you stalling for time?

617
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:53,457
Ai'Pete said that I'm jealous over you.

618
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:59,840
P'Type, my senior, said that I'm in the stage of falling in love.

619
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,055
So?

620
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,380
I don't understand it at all.

621
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:05,224
What does that mean?

622
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:08,669
"I don't understand" means I don't understand.

623
00:54:08,669 --> 00:54:11,841
I don't know if I'm really jealous over you or not.

624
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:16,807
And I don't know... if I can hold you to an important level more than other people or not.

625
00:54:17,669 --> 00:54:19,799
And the most important thing,

626
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:27,061
I don't know... If I love you or not.

627
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:30,142
I don't even know what "love" is.

628
00:54:32,777 --> 00:54:35,057
And why the hell do you like me anyway?

629
00:54:39,698 --> 00:54:43,978
Because when I'm with you... I feel at ease.

630
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:53,955
When I'm with Ai'Ae, Ai'Pete, Ai'Pond, or my friends at my department...

631
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:56,597
You make me feel like I have air to breathe.

632
00:54:57,821 --> 00:55:01,081
I'm a human being, not oxygen.

633
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:03,583
When I exhale, it's carbon dioxide.

634
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:06,518
If you inhale too much, you can die you know.

635
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:14,665
I just know that... I like you.

636
00:55:20,486 --> 00:55:22,966
I don't like it at all.

637
00:55:22,966 --> 00:55:25,062
This kind of feeling.

638
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:31,283
What does that mean? What don't you like?

639
00:55:34,572 --> 00:55:37,248
Well, the feeling like when...

640
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,490
Ai'Ley said you and Ai'Pete were dating.

641
00:55:41,962 --> 00:55:45,010
And if I agree to dating you,

642
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,840
then I'd have to sit there and think of you.

643
00:55:48,547 --> 00:55:50,550
Eating food won't taste delicious.

644
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,445
I won't be able to fall asleep.

645
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:57,048
And each day I'd have to think of where you are

646
00:55:57,048 --> 00:55:58,975
and with who.

647
00:56:04,368 --> 00:56:06,838
Can't we be friends, dude?

648
00:56:11,193 --> 00:56:13,903
Can't we be friends like...

649
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,845
when you're free, you come to see me.

650
00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:19,590
When I'm free, I'll go see you.

651
00:56:20,278 --> 00:56:22,105
Go on walks,

652
00:56:22,105 --> 00:56:26,605
eat meals, and watch movies together.

653
00:56:26,605 --> 00:56:29,170
Isn't that enough for you?

654
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,160
Ai'Tin...?

655
00:56:46,313 --> 00:56:50,113
I don't need friendship from you.

656
00:57:01,702 --> 00:57:04,892
But I still want to be your friend, Ai'Tin.

657
00:57:13,756 --> 00:57:16,516
But I don't want to be "just friends."

658
00:57:27,883 --> 00:57:29,533
Ai'Tin...

659
00:57:31,575 --> 00:57:33,125

Let's go! I'll take this!

713
01:03:25,629 --> 01:03:27,241
Two of them!

714
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:33,560
Right here!

715
01:03:37,005 --> 01:03:38,888
I have this.

716
01:03:38,888 --> 01:03:42,558
- A lighter. How do you have one?
- I have one, too!

717
01:03:42,558 --> 01:03:44,833
Ai'Ae! You're not going to play with us?

718
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:46,358
Go ahead. I'll just sit and watch.

719
01:03:46,358 --> 01:03:48,258
All right, suit yourself then.

720
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:51,398
- Did it work?
- Hey! It's not working.

721
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:54,160
Light it for me, too.

722
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,590
- Hey, close this. Do this first, hurry.
- Light it for me... Okay, close it, close it...

723
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:05,940
Hello?

724
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,838
Hello, Ai'Pete?

725
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:09,640
Turn on your camera for a bit.

726
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:19,347
Yes, Ae?

727
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:24,759
Whenever I see your face, I miss you so damn much.

728
01:04:24,797 --> 01:04:26,837
It's a good thing you didn't come, too.

729
01:04:26,837 --> 01:04:29,503
Is that so?

730
01:04:29,503 --> 01:04:31,072
Listen to me first, Ai'Pete.

731
01:04:31,072 --> 01:04:33,297
The reason why I didn't want you to come with me

732
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:36,299
was because I wouldn't be able to hold myself back from hugging you.

733
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:39,852
Just now, we were singing love songs together.

734
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:42,427
It made me think of you very much.

735
01:04:42,427 --> 01:04:45,878
So... did you sing, too, Ae?

736
01:04:45,878 --> 01:04:49,441
I can't sing. I don't even know the name of the song.

737
01:04:50,543 --> 01:04:54,293
Then, Ae, can you sing a song for me?

738
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:58,875
I already told you that I can't sing.

739
01:05:02,887 --> 01:05:08,827
All right... If there's a song I have to sing for you, it would probably be this song.

740
01:05:08,827 --> 01:05:10,673
Which song is it?

741
01:05:14,235 --> 01:05:16,185
Maybe I shouldn't.

742
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,500
Your ears might just end up bursting.

743
01:05:19,009 --> 01:05:21,429
Ae, sing for me. Please?

744
01:05:22,187 --> 01:05:23,707
Please?

745
01:05:23,707 --> 01:05:25,420
Please...

746
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,359
All right, fine.

747
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,952
I'll sing for you only one time. You better really listen to it, too.

748
01:05:29,952 --> 01:05:31,542
Okay.

01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:56,980
♫ On that day turn and look, I’ll be standing right here ♫

793
01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:01,470
♫ To give to you until you take it ♫

794
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:06,680
♫ To tell you I love you until you accept ♫

795
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,010
♫ You are my happiness ♫

796
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:15,740
♫ If you don't take my love I'm ready to start again ♫

797
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:19,810
♫ If in the end, you don't change your mind ♫

798
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:22,250
♫  It's okay because my heart won't change  ♫

799
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,520
Thank you.
♫  It's okay because my heart won't change  ♫

800
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,450
♫  It's okay because my heart won't change  ♫

801
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:32,170
♫  You would have to wait for the world to stop spinning
before my heart would stop beating for you  ♫

802
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,810
♫ It must be love that changed my life ♫

803
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:41,450
♫ So I’ve heard and seen its meaning ♫

804
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:43,560
♫ It must be love ♫

805
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:50,460
♫ That’s making me wait, it’s easy ♫

806
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:54,480
♫ Although there is no chance ♫

807
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,490
♫ Though I'll miss a lot of things in my life  ♫

808
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,000
♫ But it's worth to wait because you're my destination ♫

809
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:04,940
♫ But it's worth to wait because you're my destination ♫

810
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:09,430
♫ To give to you until you take it ♫

811
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:14,720
♫ To tell you I love you until you accept ♫

812
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,170
♫ You are my happiness ♫

813
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:23,570
♫ If you don't take my love I'm ready to start again ♫

814
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:27,780
♫ If in the end, you don't change your mind ♫

815
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:32,040
♫  It's okay because my heart won't change  ♫

816
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,240
♫  You would have to wait for the world to stop spinning ♫

817
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,570
♫ before my heart would stop beating for you  ♫

818
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,870
