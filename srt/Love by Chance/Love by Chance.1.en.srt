00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:44,218
Did you forget how you became the captain?

166
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:46,858
Because I'm a good player, of course.

167
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:49,756
- That's how I became the team leader.
- Really?

168
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:52,794
Isn't it because Type refused to accept?

169
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:56,150
Hey, hey, hey. Who's asking for your opinion, Ai'Champ?

170
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,141
What? Look at your arms and mine.

171
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:01,238
Are you sure you want to fight?

172
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:03,136
Okay... That's enough.

173
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:07,716
You two are always getting me off topic.

174
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:13,288
Hey... What's going on here?

175
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:15,571
Where is everyone else?

176
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:18,551
I was quite clear last time we'll have practice today.

177
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,898
Go get them here now.

178
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,945
P'Type, what's wrong with P'No?

179
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:30,446
Did someone step on your tail?

180
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:32,817
You're so in trouble, Albino Monkey.

181
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,995
Where have you been, Ai' Can and Ai' Good?

182
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:37,378
Get in line now.

183
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:39,278
Yes, Sir!

184
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,318
Hold on. Hold on.

185
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:46,698
Your mouth. Clean it first.

186
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:52,931
An army marches on its stomach,

187
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:54,707
just like soccer practice.

188
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,484
So I filled my stomach up first.

189
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,550
Two hot dogs, French fries, then two Chinese steamed buns.

190
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,331
I'm so full right now. But I didn't eat too slow.

191
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:06,332
I was late because Auntie told me about her family issue.

192
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,922
Husband disappeared. Kids skip school.

193
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,485
- Her daughter...
- Stop, stop, stop.

194
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:15,005
I just wanted you to wipe your mouth.

195
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:18,584
I didn't even ask how many husbands you got involved with.

196
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:19,745
Get that?

197
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,025
Damn. You give me a headache.

198
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,705
Headache? Pills?

199
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,807
Good, got some pills? Give him one.

200
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,545
One pill? Is it enough?

201
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:30,415
For P'Techno, he probably needs a whole pack.

202
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:32,645
Want the whole pack?

203
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,654
I'm mad at you. Remember?

204
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:37,964
What did we do?

205
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,855
No idea...

206
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:43,885
Come on, please. Don't be mad at me.

207
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,945
The sun's quite strong. You should stay cool.

208
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:49,356
- Don't be a hot-head like the weather.
- Champ, wait and see.

209
00:13:49,357 --> 00:13:51,885
Ai'No will forgive him really fast.

210
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:54,724
Enough. Enough!

211
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:56,555
Were you a gecko in your last life?

212
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:58,150
Get in line.

213
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,045
Don't be late next time.

214
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,810
I'm not weak.

215
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,411
I'm just trying to be a kind captain.

216
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:09,637
Okay.

217
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:11,778
I believe you.

218
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:15,558
Okay. Okay.

219
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,391
I won't try to argue with you again.

220
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,887
Where is Ae?

221
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,398
Hello?

222
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,963
Hold on. Hold on. Wait!

223
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:37,575
Hey, guys...

224
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,478
Ae can't come today.

225
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,967
He has something to do.

226
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:43,908
What are you looking at?

227
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:46,335
Give me three rounds of running. Go!

228
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:47,597
Why?

229
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:50,633
Ae can't come, and you're okay.

230
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:53,670
You're so biased.

231
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,540
Yeah... Right, I'm biased.

232
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,300
I'm not taking someone's side,

233
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,789
- but my leg is about to kick you.
- Okay, I'll go now.

234
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:03,319
You guys, too! Go. Warm up!

235
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,680
- Three laps! Go!
- Captain is so biased.

236
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,104
Yes, I agree.

237
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:09,865
Extremely biased.

238
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:12,552
Hey, you two. I'm not biased.

239
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:14,876
No, I'm not.

240
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:19,213
Everyone is running now. What are you doing here?

241
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:21,273
Go! Now!

242
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:23,233
- Yes, you. Run!
- Okay.

243
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,054
Run now!

244
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:29,680
Is this going to work?

245
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,438
One is as fast as a monkey,

246
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,089
and the other one is as slow as a sloth.

247
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,169
How can these two be friends?

248
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,789
What about you? Is this going to work?

249
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:42,226
Of course. I'm the team captain.

250
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,810
I told you, thanks to my abilities.

251
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,480
Right, I forgot.

252
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,810
Uh-oh...

253
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,880
The car owner has arrived.

254
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,847
I was waiting for you, Pete.

255
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:10,766
Where is my money?

256
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:13,222
What money?

257
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,764
Right. You may have forgotten...

258
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:21,617
that I still have the clip.

259
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:26,595
If you don't want your mother to see it...

260
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:27,686
Give me the money.

261
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,655
I won't give you the money.

262
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,430
What's going to happen?

263
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,625
If your mother knows that her only son...

264
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,755
is "gay."

265
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:47,452
If you don't want her to know,

266
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:50,269
give me the money.

267
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:54,239
Why are you doing this, Trump?

268
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:55,766
Why?

269
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,175
Because of the money, Pete!

270
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:59,243
Money!

271
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:01,333
Give me the money, Pete.

272
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,714
Come on!

273
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:04,544
I'm not giving any to you.

274
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,053
Are you messing with me?

275
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:09,714
Hey, Pete!

276
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,867
Fine!

277
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:13,697
Pete, are you okay?

278
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,582
What's your problem?

279
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:24,830
Is this your new husband?

280
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,691
Your preference is...

281
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:29,514
pathetically terrible.

282
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,250
And you!

283
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,212
Got a problem with me, Ai'shorty? Huh?

284
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,964
If you dare, go ahead. Don't just bark.

285
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:39,036
Such a big talker.

286
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:45,134
A shorty like me can bite your face off.

287
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:48,479
I'll get back to you next time.

288
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,609
Nong Pete!
(T/N: N' or "nong" means "younger brother or sister")

289
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,583
Your mother will see that clip tonight.

290
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,460
Are you okay?

291
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:05,440
What's going on?

292
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,947
Hey! Don't cry.

293
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,410
You're not a baby anymore. Stop crying.

294
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:15,874
Thank you.

295
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:20,754
Whenever I see you, you're always in trouble.

296
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,770
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,039
You always want to thank me or say sorry.

298
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:32,379
Can you stop crying first?

299
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,121
I don't know how to comfort someone who's crying.

300
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,530
Ae, please go ahead and leave.

301
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,735
I'm okay.

302
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:44,115
I just want to sit here and cry for a while.

303
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:46,360
I'll stop crying eventually.

304
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,584
Hello, P' No.

305
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:04,060
I can't join the practice today.

306
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,940
Something came up.

307
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,697
Should I leave you like this?

308
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,944
I can't do that.

309
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:23,105
Also, if that jerk comes back, what will you do?

310
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:25,540
Don't you worry...

311
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,744
that other people might think we are...

312
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,874
There's nothing between us.

313
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:34,431
Why should I care about what they say?

314
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:37,141
Whatever they want to think, let them be.

315
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,800
But I'm gay.

316
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,277
So what? Isn't a gay person also a human?

317
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:46,214
Gay is not a contagious disease.

318
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:49,020
I will sit here with you.

319
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,036
Thank you, Ae.

320
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,430
And sorry.

321
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,003
Stop thanking me. I'm not a bleeding heart.

322
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,750
So... What's the problem between him and you?

323
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:13,413
I was...

324
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,649
Thank you so much, P'Trump.

325
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,426
Hmm? What are you thanking me for?

326
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,984
For asking me to be your boyfriend?

327
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,694
Thinking about your family again?

328
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,487
I don't want my mother to know that I'm gay.

329
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:33,768
Come on.

330
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:35,907
Don't be like this when you're with me.

331
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:37,852
I want you to be happy.

332
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,433
Okay.

333
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,144
What are you doing, P'Trump?

334
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,184
P'Trump, what's that?

335
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,860
You said that...

336
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,466
You don't want your mother to know you're gay, right?

337
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,916
Too bad...

338
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:35,360
Because I'll send this clip to your mother.

339
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,429
If you don't want your mother to see it,

340
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:43,035
give me 50,000 baht to trade with this clip.

341
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:47,938
I believe you have enough money for me to spend, right?

342
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:51,556
Why are you doing this to me?

343
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:53,384
You told me that...

344
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,833
That I love you?

345
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,484
Are you stupid?

346
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,178
But...

347
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,239
You really think I love you for real?

348
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,754
Let me tell something, Nong Pete.

349
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,819
If you were not this rich...

350
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,332
I wouldn't even flirt,

351
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,378
hug, or kiss you.

352
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,530
What I did here,

353
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:21,581
is giving me the creeps already.

354
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:31,610
Even sharing the air you breathe in the same room is

355
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,409
enough to disgust me!

356
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,940
Put this into your mind.

357
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,326
You're only good because of the money.

358
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:42,096
Faggot.

359
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:54,360
I'm a total idiot.

360
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,487
A person like me...

361
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,783
Nobody will love me for real.

362
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:01,230
You're not an idiot.

363
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,553
That jerk is a douchebag.

364
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:06,109
So, you should stop crying now.

365
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,740
Are you going to cry until you die?

366
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,207
Don't you feel disgusted?

367
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,482
Why do I have to think like that?

368
00:23:12,482 --> 00:23:14,462
If I get disgusted by anyone,

369
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:16,804
it's not because of you, but that bastard.

370
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:18,874
He's a piece of trash.

371
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:23,499
And if you're in trouble again...

372
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,356
see me right away, at the Engineering Buildings or the soccer field.

373
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,757
Let's go.

374
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:35,558
I have to attend practice. Get up!

375
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:49,184
Can you go back home?

376
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,058
I can. This is my car.

377
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:58,408
Such a Koon-Chai.

378
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:06,111
I want you to tell your mother.

379
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,406
You're her son, after all.

380
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:10,822
She won't be mad at you.

381
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:12,347
She will be okay eventually.

382
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:17,845
More importantly, I want her to know from you, not from someone else.

383
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:22,238
I know everything will be all right.

384
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:24,448
Thank you, Ae.

385
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:26,919
Shall I drive you to the Engineering Building?

386
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:29,310
That's okay. I can go back by myself.

387
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,561
Good luck.

388
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,961
Thanks.

389
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:50,519
Mother, I want to talk to you about something.

390
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,196
Oh... You're home.

391
00:25:54,196 --> 00:25:56,437
Give me a few minutes.

392
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:58,554
Dinner will be ready.

393
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:10,873
If I did something wrong,

394
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:13,379
will you be mad at me?

395
00:26:15,602 --> 00:26:18,199
It depends on what you did.

396
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:22,905
Since you're asking, I won't be mad.

397
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:27,109
Have I ever gotten mad at you?

398
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:33,370
Before I tell you,

399
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,145
can I ask you something?

400
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,357
Could you...

401
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,749
please not hate me?

402
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:47,491
You can get angry at me.

403
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:53,119
But please don't hate me.

404
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:57,196
What's wrong with you today?

405
00:26:58,748 --> 00:27:01,270
Pete, you're my son.

406
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,336
I will never hate my own son.

407
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:36,069
Mother,

408
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:42,255
what if...

409
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:45,002
if I'm different...

410
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,253
Would you be okay?

411
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:59,216
If... I don't like women,

412
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:06,189
but like men...

413
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,059
Will you hate me?

414
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,620
I...

415
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,969
I never wanted to be like this.

416
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,449
I want to like women like the other guys.

417
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,509
But... I...

418
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,559
I don't know why I am like this.

419
00:29:21,332 --> 00:29:22,979
Are you hungry?

420
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:25,069
Did you eat before coming home?

421
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:29,765
I'm making your favorite today.

422
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,019
Pete, listen to me.

423
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:08,245
No matter whom you like.

424
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,779
Whom you love.

425
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,383
Any gender.

426
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:22,769
You're always my child that I love.

427
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,999
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,049
I told you.

429
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,540
No matter whom you like,

430
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:48,289
whom you love.

431
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,379
No matter what gender they are.

432
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,249
You are who you are.

433
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,579
My child whom I love with my whole heart. Always.

434
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,069
And I will always be here for you.

435
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,379
Always here.

436
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,129
No matter what you want to be.

437
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,089
It's okay.

438
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:09,515
[Thanks, Ae. I was brave enough to tell Mother the truth.]

439
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:11,366
[Will we meet again by chance?]

440
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,339
I know everything will be all right.

441
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:50,452
That's it for me tonight.

442
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:56,653
There will be another singer coming up. Good night.

443
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,549
Hey, can you do me a favor?

444
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:03,278
When I talk to those freshmen, like I did today,

445
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,605
don't interrupt me.

446
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:07,019
When you speak, they won't listen to me.

447
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,439
It's not entirely my fault. You're too weak.

448
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:13,432
I'm not weak. I'm the captain of the team!

449
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,639
And how can you be the captain?

450
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:17,609
Okay, that's what you'll say, huh?

451
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:20,209
Fine. When you have a fight with your husband,

452
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,864
- who always helps you get back...
- Ai'No!

453
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:25,935
Why? Can't accept the truth now?

454
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:28,755
Ai'Tum.

455
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:31,158
Ai'Tum!

456
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:33,349
Are you in a hurry?

457
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:34,698
Sort of.

458
00:33:34,698 --> 00:33:37,411
Hey. Don't be like this. Join me first, would you?

459
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:39,407
There are only two of us.

460
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:41,278
We are all friends.

461
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:43,175
But Ai'Tum might not want to befriend me.

462
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:45,086
Don't start a fight.

463
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,799
Hey, you... Easy, please. Come on.

464
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,602
Having troubles with Type's boyfriend

465
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:52,753
doesn't mean you have a problem with Type.

466
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:55,115
Your little brother's close to Type.

467
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,305
When will he return to Thailand?

468
00:33:57,975 --> 00:34:00,068
Type, you're too straightforward.

469
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:02,088
Can't you talk about something else?

470
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:05,666
So? When will he come back?

471
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:07,345
Next month.

472
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:14,649
So... Why don't you tell your younger brother

473
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,901
that you love him?

474
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:20,752
- Ai'Type!
- Easy, you two.

475
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,924
Tum, I'm really sorry about this.

476
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,688
I'm leaving.

477
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,169
Tum.

478
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,068
Ai'Type!

479
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:39,148
You're teasing him too hard again.

480
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:40,436
I wasn't teasing him.

481
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:44,936
I'm serious. I think he should move on.

482
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:50,001
Not everyone can be as strong-minded as you're.

483
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:52,724
Forget it. Let's drink.

484
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,699
Okay.

485
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,334
You chased him away and left us here drinking.

486
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:59,014
I feel kind of lonely.

487
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,820
It's okay.

488
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,481
Ai'Nic, where is P'No?

489
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:26,601
He's not coming home tonight.

490
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:28,260
Probably staying at P'Type's place.

491
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,039
Oh, I should go then.

492
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,799
Wait a second.

493
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,622
Why are you in such a hurry?

494
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:38,210
I have this.

495
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,063
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

496
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:47,454
You have to be patient.

497
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,081
Okay.

498
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,262
What do you want this time?

499
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:57,690
I want to borrow your car. I have a date with a college girl.

500
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:00,805
I'm sorry, pal.

501
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:03,017
You don't have a driver's license yet.

502
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:05,567
And I don't want P'No to look down on me.

503
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:07,687
You can't be worse than what you're now,

504
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:09,528
Khun Kengkla.
(T/N: Khun is a respectful title - similar to Mr./Mrs.)

505
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:16,318
Well, as long as he doesn't know.

506
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:19,637
My older brother is so stupid!

507
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:22,824
So stupid to think of you as a good kid.

508
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:30,441
Anyway, I passed the driver's license test yesterday.

509
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:34,732
Okay. Fine.

510
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:43,388
After the picture's sent,

511
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:45,225
the keys can go.

512
00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:53,241
Hurry up.

513
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:55,261
Check your phone.

514
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:02,559
Okay.

515
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,030
Let me know when your date will be.

516
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,159
And...

517
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:15,382
The only person I will pretend to lose for is P'No.

518
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:16,965
Bye.

519
00:37:31,426 --> 00:37:34,326
My friend is extremely tricky.

520
00:37:34,326 --> 00:37:36,140
Who am I to blame?

521
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,820
I'm selling my older brother for a car.

522
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,896
Forget it.

523
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:43,366
It's P'No's ass, not mine.

524
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:11,815
Ai'Ae, can you go faster?

525
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:14,605
We're really late now, you know?

526
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:15,891
Faster!

527
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:19,099
I got detention from playing games in class last time.

528
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,527
If I'm late today, Uncle Glasses will kill me.

529
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:22,623
Shut up!

530
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:25,304
Don't call Professor "Uncle Glasses" again.

531
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:29,125
Shut up and go faster. Hurry up!

532
00:38:29,986 --> 00:38:32,026
- See you in class!
- Ai'Pond!

533
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:33,846
Bye-bye! Woo-hoo!

534
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,216
Jerk!

535
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,585
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

536
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,188
A stranger.

537
00:39:44,188 --> 00:39:47,856
Are you new here, Beautiful?

538
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:49,035
What will you order?

539
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:52,080
Ouch. So fierce.

540
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,600
How can a beautiful girl like you be this fierce to me?

541
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,700
Ah. I'll stop teasing you.

542
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,810
I'll have a cocoa smoothie.

543
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,570
Extra dark.

544
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,940
No cream, no sugar. Don't put anything in it.

545
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,100
No sweetener at all.

546
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,472
I repeat, no sweetener at all. Strong and thick.

547
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:14,209
I want something that can make you drop dead after a sip.

548
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:16,770
Are you joking?

549
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,767
I order this for real!

550
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:23,834
Or... can you not do it?

551
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:24,731
I can.

552
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:28,522
Ouch. Such a dry speaker.

553
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:31,401
I'll make a complaint to the shop owner.

554
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:33,189
Hey, Beautiful.

555
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:36,414
For another cup, I need a strawberry smoothie.

556
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:39,880
This one, I need it sweet.

557
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,672
As sweet as your face.

558
00:40:43,672 --> 00:40:47,281
Yes. Very sweet, right?

559
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,579
Asshole Pond.

560
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,786
What takes you so long to buy a drink?

561
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:53,244
I dropped by the dorm already.

562
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,698
Right.

563
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:56,536
They're kind of very slow here.

564
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,877
What?

565
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:08,054
Hey, Koon-Chai Pete.

566
00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:10,469
What brought you here?

567
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,060
Right. What about that scumbag?

568
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,058
Is he still coming to bother you?

569
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,389
He's been quiet.

570
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,068
Thank you very much, Ae.

571
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:19,690
What's that for?

572
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,487
You always say "Thank you" every time we meet.

573
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:25,191
Thank you for the other day.

574
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,284
Enough talking about that.

575
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,786
Oh.

576
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,406
Did you talk to your mom?

577
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,040
I did.

578
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,840
Hey, Ae. Who's this?

579
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,552
Your friend?

580
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,593
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, hello.

581
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:43,323
Never seen you around here.

582
00:41:43,323 --> 00:41:46,153
- From the soccer team?
- How nosy, Ai'Pond!

583
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:48,480
That's kind of all over my face.

584
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,773
Right. What are you doing here?

585
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:55,660
Isn't there a canteen in the International Building?

586
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,239
I couldn't find a parking spot, so I had to park near here.

587
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,532
Wow, that's quite far.

588
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:04,510
One cocoa smoothie.

589
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,220
Here. It's yours.

590
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,733
- Ae'Khrab—
- Shh!

591
00:42:22,265 --> 00:42:25,251
You're the one who ordered this. You can have the first sip.

592
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,998
Come on. We're good friends.

593
00:42:28,998 --> 00:42:30,341
This is just a drink.

594
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:32,683
Don't mind me. You go ahead.

595
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,683
I said, drink it.

596
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:42,000
This is good, shitty good.

597
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,405
It's actually good.

598
00:42:49,406 --> 00:42:53,039
What? It's that bitter and you say it's good?

599
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,527
I thought she put wormwood instead of sugar.

600
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:02,730
Right, Pete. Have you had lunch yet?

601
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,749
Here. A sandwich.

602
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,719
For me, that's just an appetizer.

603
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,968
It takes ten minutes to burn those calories.

604
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:13,442
Want to go? I'll treat you to a real lunch.

605
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:16,913
I don't want to bother you. You're with your friend.

606
00:43:17,946 --> 00:43:19,750
Ai'Pond?

607
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,980
Chat with him for a few minutes and you'll become friends.

608
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:25,163
- Want to go?
- Sure.

609
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:27,148
What on earth brought you two together?

610
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:29,593
Grassroots Shorty and

611
00:43:29,593 --> 00:43:32,143
Koon-Chai meeting each other.

612
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,331
The Sa-tor-berry smoothie is here.

613
00:43:34,332 --> 00:43:35,801
(T/N : Sa-tor: Slang for "liar")

614
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:38,928
Thank you. I can drink something sweet now.

615
00:43:41,634 --> 00:43:43,578
This one's way too sweet!

616
00:43:43,578 --> 00:43:45,361
Didn't you order a very sweet one?

617
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:47,447
So, here you are.

618
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:50,154
After drinking, the sugar will reach your brain cells.

619
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:54,082
After that, you'll know what to say and what not to say.

620
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:56,813
Thank you very much.

621
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:03,962
- Ai'Pete, let's go.
- Sure.

622
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,739
Want to have lunch with me, Beautiful?

623
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:13,040
Reserve your mouth for eating only.

624
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,031
Can I reserve it for eating with you?

625
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:19,088
Okay. I'll go.

626
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:22,005
I'll return it. It's too sweet to drink.

627
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:24,534
- How much?
- 100 baht.

628
00:44:24,535 --> 00:44:26,722
What? So expensive.

629
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:29,754
This is all I have.

630
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:32,007
Only for you.

631
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:39,990
How was it? Are you full?

632
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,470
Can you eat this type of food?

633
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,280
Yes, I can.

634
00:44:45,238 --> 00:44:46,814
Are you sure?

635
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:49,207
You were so funny.

636
00:44:49,207 --> 00:44:52,647
I noticed you couldn't get in line.

637
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:55,948
You're really good at it.

638
00:44:55,948 --> 00:44:58,424
So many people, but you still got through.

639
00:44:58,424 --> 00:44:59,866
I'm not good.

640
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,603
I should be the one to ask.

641
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:04,733
Why don't you know how to buy food from the canteen?

642
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,868
You don't have to frown like that.

643
00:45:11,868 --> 00:45:14,338
I'm not scolding you or anything.

644
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:18,181
I know you're a kind person.

645
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,324
Why compliment me all of a sudden?

646
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:22,764
The shuttle bus is here.

647
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:27,978
Aren't you coming?

648
00:45:28,714 --> 00:45:32,294
Don't tell me you've never used the shuttle bus.

649
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:34,167
Never.

650
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:36,566
You're such a Koon-Chai.

651
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,278
Hey, Ae! Where are you going?

652
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,101
Wait for me!

653
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,957
What should I do now?

654
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,790
Is it too hot?

655
00:46:04,363 --> 00:46:06,110
The sunlight's coming this way.

656
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,402
I'll block it for you.

657
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:10,904
It's not that bad. I'm okay.

658
00:46:12,098 --> 00:46:15,018
You're sweating. Why did you say you're okay?

659
00:46:15,018 --> 00:46:16,943
Unbelievable.

660
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:24,068
- I want to meet...
- Huh?

661
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:25,693
What did you say?

662
00:46:25,693 --> 00:46:28,612
Nothing. Never mind.

663
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,220

♫ I don't need anyone else except you ♫

665

671
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:12,476
Why did you get off here?

672
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:15,127
Isn't the Engineering Building on the other side of the campus?

673
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:16,654
Listen to me, Pete.

674
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:18,538
The next time you get on a bus,

675
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:20,518
check its direction first.

676
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:24,070
So when you park far from here, you can take the bus here.

677
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,263
Don't tell me you were...

678
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:28,490
Right. I rode along to send you off.

679
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,432
I thought you didn't know how to use the bus.

680
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:32,713
Thanks.

681
00:47:32,713 --> 00:47:34,820
I'll get going. I don't want you to be late.

682
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,097
- Thanks.
- See you.

I'm afraid you'll hate me.

689
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:17,386
You may have forgotten, but I'm...

690
00:48:17,386 --> 00:48:19,503
Gay?

691
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:26,573
Many manly guys like you... were easily converted.

692
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:29,944
If you don't know him, you better shut up.

00:48:32,445 --> 00:48:34,963
What's up, Ai'Pete?
