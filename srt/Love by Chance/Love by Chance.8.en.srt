26
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,862
You can just sit over there.

27
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:51,412
Ae, please don't take Tin's words to heart.

28
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,572
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:02,712
Ae, why are you apologizing to me?

30
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:07,052
You haven't done anything wrong.

31
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:11,012
It was wrong. I was wrong.

32
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:15,712
I'm not just mad because he told us to stop seeing each other.

33
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:22,752
But I'm mad at myself that I suddenly realized that I'm just an ordinary student.

34
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:27,878
I cannot find out about Trump or where he went.

35
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:33,862
I can't find and buy back your beloved items for you.

36
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,725
Even though I just told you to rely on me more...

37
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:41,512
In the end, I couldn't help you at all.

38
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:44,622
That's not true.

39
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:47,128
That's not the least bit true.

40
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:51,142
You helped me so many times.

41
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:55,342
Isn't that because I just happened to be there at the right time?

42
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:57,232
That's not it.

43
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:03,429
It's not only when P'Trump suddenly appeared.

44
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:05,852
But you helped me every time.

45
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:10,492
Today, for example, I was so terrified.

46
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:15,422
I was so afraid that I'd know the truth

47
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,572
about what P'Trump has been doing.

48
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:21,132
But then I had you by my side,

49
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,325
that's why I wasn't afraid.

50
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:28,082
I know that you won't leave me.

51
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:32,552
I know that you'll protect me.

52
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,770
That's why I'm not afraid.

53
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:52,532
Ae, did you know?

54
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:57,984
Ae, you're my support.
(T/N: "Teepeung" means supporter, but can also mean sanctuary)

55
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:03,444
You might not know it.

56
00:05:21,262 --> 00:05:23,912
Thank you, Ai'Koon-Chai.

57
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:31,922
Ae, why are you thanking me?

58
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,948
I still haven't done anything for you.

59
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:39,642
Thank you for bringing me back to my senses.

60

♫ It must be love that makes me stand right here ♫

61

♫ But Love still asks me to do this ♫

66
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,630
♫ to give to you until you take it ♫

67

♫ to tell you I love you until you accept ♫

♫ You are my happiness ♫

69

70

♫ If in the end, you don't change your mind ♫

71
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,290
♫ It's okay because my heart won't change ♫

72
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,242
Asshole, the walls are so fucking thin.

73
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,910
Why can't you be careful to not bang something on it?

♫ You would have to wait for the world to stop spinning ♫

75

I'm going to put my stuff away first.

76
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,692
Okay.

77
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:08,240
♫ On the day this world abandons you ♫

78
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,040
♫ On that day turn and look, I’ll be standing right here ♫

79
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,660
♫ to give to you until you take it ♫

80
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,319
♫ to tell you I love you until you accept ♫

81
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,694
I think you should move to a dorm outside.

82
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,624
Why?

83
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:29,226
Uhh... Never mind. It's nothing.

84
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:33,562
Speaking of dorms, I planned on moving to a dorm next month.

85
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,981
This Friday, I was thinking of taking a look at dorms. Ae, would you be available?

86
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:38,615
I was thinking of inviting you to accompany me.

87
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:41,832
But if you are busy then that's alright.

88
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:47,172
I'm your boyfriend. When are you going to stop being so considerate towards me?

89
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:50,552
I'm free. I'll go with you.

90
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:54,662
Could you stop being so cute to me?

91
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:56,562
I won't be able to control myself.

92
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:58,862
I didn't do anything.

93
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,862
Let's go.

94
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:27,082
Hey. Even if you were to stare until you die, your face will never be like Tom Cruise, Ai'Pond.

95
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:31,925
What the hell is with you, dude? I'm gathering up all of my confidence here.

96
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:33,090
What for?

97
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,584
Are you looking for the seven dragon balls, so you can ask the dragon to help you pass the exam?

98
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,305
What the hell is with you, dude?

99
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:42,515
Today's an important day for your friend, you know!

100
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:46,122
An important day? What day is it?

101
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:49,075
You'll find out.

102
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:54,012
Oi! Ping!!! HEY!!!

103
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:00,957
Even though I got teased, I'm still this handsome.

104
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,452
How can you be hot as hell like this?

105
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:07,667
Truly and wonderfully handsome.

106
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:11,607
Flawless and ceaselessly handsome.

107
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:14,719
Can I hit on myself?

108
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,210
I can't anymore. I should get going.

109
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,292
Princess, I've come to pick you up.

110
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,312
Please hop on your carriage.

111
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:38,972
What are you playing at? It's embarrassing...

112
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:40,624
No can do. My friend said that,

113
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:44,194
if I like someone, I have to move quickly. Otherwise, I won't get to eat.
(TN: Early bird gets the worm)

114
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:47,732
So, then, let me send you off to the bus stop, please?

115
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:51,418
Please! Let me send you off to the bus stop, please?

116
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:53,112
- Keep it down.
- Please!

117
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:54,162
Fine. I'll go with you.

118
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:55,742
After you.

119
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,382
Oh! Hold on.

120
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:58,482
I have something to tell you.

121
00:09:58,482 --> 00:09:59,812
What is it?

122
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:01,022
Listen carefully, all right?

123
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:04,122
Can you not take your time?

124
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:06,042
- Be my girlfriend, alright?
- Okay, sure.

125
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,942
Hey!

126
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,442
Why are you that surprised?

127
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,882
I haven't used the joke I prepared yet.

128
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:15,092
All right. What did you prepare?

129
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:19,042
Well... Typical lines like, "I have a heart problem."

130
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,742
or even "My grandma ordered me to get a girlfriend.

131
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:23,962
Otherwise, she'll cut me out of her will."

132
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,612
If it's like that, you could've just asked me nicely.

133
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:29,112
- Really?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:30,812
Then I've asked you nicely already, right?

135
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:32,642
Yeah.

136
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:39,412
Would you please be my girlfriend?

137
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:42,362
Is this asking nicely?

138
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,422
It's nice.

139
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:46,717
Yeah.

140
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,157
Yay!

141
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,822
Hey!

142
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,707
If you hug me, I'll freaking slap you.

143
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:53,917
You always know right away.

144
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:57,184
Being your girlfriend, of course, I'd have to know right away.

145
00:10:57,184 --> 00:11:00,292
About that... Why were you willing so easily?

146
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,082
Then I won't anymore.

147
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:03,032
Oh! I won't ask anymore. I won't ask anymore.

148
00:11:03,032 --> 00:11:04,892
You should get on your carriage first, right?

149
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:06,652
Hold on.

150
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:10,109
Eat this flower first.

151
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:11,082
What?

152
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,112
Eat the flower.

153
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,982
- It... doesn't seem to smell that lovely...
- You're the one that chose it though.

154
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:20,254
It smells nice. I can eat it.

155
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:22,672
- Are you for real? I'm going to eat it now.
- Go ahead and eat it.

156
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:26,052
- The whole thing.
- 1-2—

157
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:31,842
- Who would let you bite such a beautiful flower like this?
- It was almost tasty though.

158
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,132
- Or did you want to eat it?
- Don't want to. Shall we go?

159
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:37,412
- Right this, we—
- Don't touch me at all...
- Can't do this either...

160
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,112
I'll just go then...

161
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:41,742
Ride carefully, all right?

162
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,532
After you.

163
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:44,232
You won't fall down again, right?

164
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:47,572
I'm not sure... I mean, I don't know. Let's go.

165
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:51,182
Geez, there's nothing to step on either. I have to hold on, right?

166
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:52,662
If you don't hold on, you fall off. So hold on properly.

167
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:54,482
Geez! Seizing the opportunity!

168
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:55,982
I'm not arguing that.

169
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,432
I'll squeeze your belly then.

170
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:58,952
Let's go.

171
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,912
- Wow. Your belly has fat rolls.
- I don't have any!

172
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,972
Right here!

173
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,148
This is a dorm?

174
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,698
It's like a condo. It looks expensive.

175
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:19,368
I think that they're the same. Aren't they?

176
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:22,738
The same? Really?

177
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:25,228
Fine. They are the same. They're the same...

178
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:29,838
Then... shall we try to go up and check out the room first?

179
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:53,611
Should we go take a look at the living room, Ae?

180
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:54,891
Okay.

181
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:11,108
Ae, what do you think so far?

182
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:14,098
It's your dorm. You should decide for yourself.

183
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:18,158
But if you ask me, it's way more than necessary.

184
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:21,638
Let me ask you for real. Is this a freaking dorm or hotel?

185
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:24,758
Then... shall we go look at the other dorms, Ae?

186
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:29,098
Ai'Pete, you don't have to believe everything I say, you know.

187
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:32,558
But I also think it's really more than necessary.

188
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:36,838
It's too much for me. But it might be perfect for you.

189
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:40,245
If you like it, then just take it.

190
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,858
Then... I'll take this one. Okay?

191
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,168
It's up to you then.

192
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:48,180
If you move, I'll come and help you bring your things.

193
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:59,588
Ae, do you want to say something?

194
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,330
♫ I only beg for you to be with me forever ♫

195
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,690
♫ You're the only one I'm asking for ♫

196
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:12,628
Pete,

197
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:14,948
if I accidentally...

198
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:18,387
Accidentally, what?

199
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:23,730
♫ I want you to be my sky when I fly ♫

200
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,130
♫ Be my guiding star when I'm lost ♫

201
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,620
♫ I only beg for you to embrace me in the deep cold night ♫

202
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,120
Never mind... It's nothing.

203
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,270
♫ Hold me more tightly than yesterday ♫

204
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,330
I think I should leave.

205
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,738
What!? What did you say?

206
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:58,258
Can you try and repeat that for me again?

207
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:02,438
Why? Why does everyone I tell go all, "What? What? What?" to me?

208
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,458
You guys listen to me carefully.

209
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:09,038
I - finally - have - a - girlfriend.

210
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,418
Who the hell has such low standards to grab someone like you?

211
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:14,909
Well, her name is ChaAim.

212
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:16,688
Do you know her?

213
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:20,445
She's my first love from the coffee shop you know!

214
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:24,338
Oh! That really pretty one from that coffee shop?

215
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:28,328
Don't tell me... You better confess right now! Did you do some sort of black voodoo on her or something?

216
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,708
Why would such a pretty person like that grab onto a degenerate like you?

217
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,738
There's absolutely no way.

218
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:33,858
Why the hell not?

219
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,288
No way. No way.

220
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:38,088
Why are there people who won't believe me?

221
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:41,618
I'm a handsome guy with proper manners.

222
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:44,418
And I have quarter Italian blood, too.

223
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:49,318
Who's also nosy, a jerk, and a pervert, right?

224
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,148
I totally agree with that.

225
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:54,928
Of course, I'm a nosy, jerk, and... Hey! Ai'Ae!

226
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:57,348
Why are you insulting me?

227
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:02,038
But that's fine. Today, I don't mind.

228
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:08,598
Because I'm in a good mood and happy. I'm in love.

229
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:11,448
Ai'Ping, you don't need to mind this fucker.

230
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:14,408
Just let him be fucking crazy.

231
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:20,058
Well, aren't you also in love, too, Ai'Ae?

232
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,557
No need to be shy.

233
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,738
Ai'Ae,

234
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:47,058
if you have any problems, you can ask me. You know?

235
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:51,048
My slogan is "I know, I see, I can answer it."

236
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:53,498
Since when did you become a psychic? Asshole.

237
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:55,088
Want to try?

238
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:56,428
You're really making my feet itch.
(T/N: Itchy feet; Annoyed enough to have the urge to kick.)

239
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:59,818
Come on. I just saw that you seemed stuck on something.

240
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,308
So, I was just going to be a good friend.

241
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:04,318
I don't need it.

242
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,608
Fine.

243
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:12,008
If you ever want me to open my clinic to hear about your life problems, just let me know.

244
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:14,248
I'm going back to watching my video clips.

245
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,448
Ai'Pon,

246
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,068
when you had your first time, how did you do it?

247
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,273
What?!

248
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:34,588
Just think that I never asked then.

249
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:38,868
No way! No way! No way! I've already heard it both times, friend.

250
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:41,398
Or is it...

251
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:43,618
You're going to have sex with Ai'Pete, right?

252
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:45,348
This asshole...

253
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:49,218
Hey! For you, you need to get him drunk, then drag him to bed, Ai'Ae!

254
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:53,630
You don't know how to sweet-talk or do a romantic fuck. Believe me. Hey!

255
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:07,008
What's up, P'Oh?

256
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:12,354
Sure, P'Oh.

257
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:22,965
[Ae: Do you have time tomorrow?]

258
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,120
Have you been waiting for long? I told you that I could've met you at the mall.

259
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,170
That's okay. Either way, it was on my way.

260
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,270
What are you looking at?

261
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,950
Did I dress weird or something?

262
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,140
This is the best I can do. I'm not that handsome.

263
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,375
I... just want to let you know that...

264
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,580
Today, you look really handsome.

265
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,290
Don't compliment on your own and get shy on your own.

266
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,770
You're going to make me all shy too.

267
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,370
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

268
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,780
We also have to buy a present for N'Yim, too.

269
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,270
Ae? Would this suit Nong Yim?

270
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,570
That one is for big kids.

271
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,750
Then, how about this one?

272
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,000
I forgot to tell you, P'Oh is surprising Nong Yim with a bicycle.

273
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,540
But I saw that you were picking out toys, so I didn't want to bother you.

274
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,380
Then, can I buy a gift for Nong Yim? Is that all right?

275
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,930
No thanks. I don't want to trouble you.

276
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,150
But I want to give it to Nong Yim.

277
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,160
Then I can let you pick out one thing.

278
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,350
But we'll split the payment in half, all right?

279
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,180
Why?

280
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,500
Because as a couple. One gift is enough.

281
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:00,059
Do you want to go see Nong Yim with me?

282
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,200
- Can I go?
- Of course, you can go.

283
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,920
Then I'll go. Nong Yim in the pictures looks really cute. So the real thing must be even cuter, right?

284
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,970
When you talk about Nong Yim, you look like a kid, too.

285
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,700
I'm sorry.

286
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,290
That you have to take care of a big kid like me.

287
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,550
Why are you apologizing to me? It's actually a good thing.

288
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,050
That I can see your childish side.

289
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,740
Well, I want you to see the good sides of me, too.

290
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,770
It's already good that you've let me seen each and every one of your sides.

291
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,260
You're the first person to make me jealous, you know.

292
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,180
I'm... the first person?

293
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,950
You're my first one for so many things.

294
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,130
You're the first one whose cheeks I've played with.

295
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,150
The first one whose hair I've touched.

296
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,230
And you're also the first person... that I've kissed, too.

297
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,730
And you're also my first boyfriend.

298
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:13,580
And you are... my first time, too.

299
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,170
Let's go see Nong Yim.

300
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,820
Okay.

301
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,020
You can get out already. Don't be afraid. My parents aren't scary.

302
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm... just nervous, Ae.

303
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,240
You've got me right here. You don't need to be afraid.

304
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,730
Okay.

305
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,260
Mom! I'm back!

306
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,337
Oh! Ae! You came back at the right time. Help with this. Hurry up.

307
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,030
Hello.

308
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,375
Oh... you should save your Wai for the monks, dear.
(T/N: Wai is the greeting to show respect.)

309
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,300
Is this... your friend?

310
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,330
Oh, wow...

311
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,460
Every one of your friends,

312
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,540
really outshine you; every one of them.

313
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,060
Hey, do you have anyone at all? Just one person that's less handsome than you, just a bit?

314
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,740
Isn't it because Mom only gave me this much?

315
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,660
Oh... Yeah, yeah. All right. Help me out a bit.

316
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,451
Because your dad took your niece to make merit (at the temple), and they haven't come back yet.

317
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:43,790
Geez, this is about to go bad already.

318
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,650
So, what's his name?

319
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,180
My name is Pete.

320
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,840
Pete.

321
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,380
Do you know how to separate the rice noodles?

322
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,230
Rice noodles?

323
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,100
Separate the rice noodles for me. And then help me prepare some things, all right?

324
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,940
These vegetables, too. Pick them carefully and take out the bad ones.

325
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm going to make food for the customers first. The whole restaurant is waiting.

326
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,150
- I'll leave it to you.
- Of course, Mom.
- Yes.

327
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,590
I'm sorry. This is all I have.

328
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,545
It's a bit hot, right?

329
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,150
Not at all. I think... it's pretty cool.

330
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,730
I'm sorry about today. My mom really put you to work.

331
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,130
That's okay.
I think it's kind of fun.

332
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,460
And it was my first time separating rice noodles, too.

333
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,328
Did I bring Koon-Chai to face some hardships or something?

334
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,490
I'm... really having fun.

335
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,460
And... your mom is really kind, too.

336
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,000
These soft hands of yours... They're going to get ruined because of working at my house.

337
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,630
No matter how many times I touch them, they're so soft.

338
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,807
They're not like my hands at all. They're rough as hell.

339
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,120
But...

340
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,840
I like your hands.

341
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:29,335
The hands that help your family.

342
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,230
The hands that help other people.

343
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,040
The hands that can do anything.

344
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,630
Stop flattering me.

345
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,740
Not at all.

346
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,950
Ai'Pete.

347
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,120
Ae, your mom is downstairs.

348
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,700
I know, but I want to hug you.

349
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,670
What would you have me do?

350
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,830
I'm sorry that I keep thinking about you.

351
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,020
Only missing you. I really don't know what to do.

352
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,770
I also... miss you, too.

353
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,790
Uncle Ae... Uncle Ae...

354
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,990
Uncle Ae...

355
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,770
Uncle Ae, who is he?

356
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,240
This is Uncle Pete.

357
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:25,800
He is Uncle Ae's friend. Don't you remember?

358
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,709
The one that I told you about when I said that if you don't let me kiss your cheeks,

359
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,418
I'm going to go kiss this person's cheeks instead.

360
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:33,903
You can't.

361
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,840
You met Uncle Pete, so what do you have to do first?

362
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,380
Hello.

363
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,390
Hello.

364
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,220
So, why did you come up? Why don't you stay downstairs?

365
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,170
Uncle Ae, come down, too.

366
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,330
I'll follow you in a bit. You go down first.

367
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,100
- You too, Uncle Pete.
- Okay.

368
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,060
Uncle Ae will bring Uncle Pete downstairs, okay?

369
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,440
Come here first.

370
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,280
Let me kiss you once.

371
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,000
The other side.

372
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,440
Do you want to eat some ice?

373
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,770
That's all right, Ae.

374
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,320
- It's dripping all over you.
- That's okay.

375
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,230
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

376
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,680

- Blow... Blow...
- Help her... Help her...

381
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,500
- Help again. One more time.
- Are you tired?

382
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,830
Yim, once more.

383
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,590
Yay!

384
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,820
Happy birthday to you...

385
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,870
Nong Yim, this is a birthday present.

386
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,240
- Wow... Say thank you.
- Thank you

387
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,930
Go ahead and hug it. Hug it.

388
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,820
- Like it, sweetie? Do you like it?
-They really know you.

389
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,320
- She's so happy.
- You're like a princess, right? Princess Ariel.

You ended up leaving so late.

404
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,090
Nong Yim was throwing a fuss not letting you leave at all.

405
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,970
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

406
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,970
For bringing me to get to know your family.

407
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,085
I'm really happy.

408
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,620
You're not mad at me, right?

409
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,020
That I didn't tell my family about us.

410
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,650
Not at all.

411
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,190
I know that something like this isn't something you can just tell your family.

412
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,120
I totally understand.

413
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,180
But if you want me to tell them. I'm always ready to tell them, all right?

414
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,980
Thank you, Ae.

415
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,370
But just this, already makes me happy.

416
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,670
Get home safely.

417
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,230
Okay.

418
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,840
Thank you so much for today.

419
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,300
On the day you move to the dorm, I'll help you move your stuff.

420
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Okay, Ae.

421

Pad-Thai Shrimp?

433
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:31,424
Ai'Ae!

434
00:32:31,424 --> 00:32:33,304
Hey, Ai'Ae! Let's go to eat together, all right?

435
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:35,714
P'No is even treating, dude. He usually doesn't treat us.

436
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:38,398
I don't know what's with him today. He said he was going to treat all the first years!

437
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,028
That guy is always so freaking stingy.

438
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:44,174
Let me seriously ask you. When you talk, do you ever think of taking a breath sometimes or something?

439
00:32:44,174 --> 00:32:45,754
Listening to you makes me exhausted instead.

440
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:47,994
I'm alert. I'm alert!

441
00:32:47,994 --> 00:32:50,394
I have plans today. Sorry.

442
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:52,944
Geez. Go eat with me, please, Ae.

443
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:55,644
P'No is treating us to a meal!

444
00:32:55,644 --> 00:32:57,784
Don't bother begging him.

445
00:32:57,784 --> 00:33:02,054
Because tonight, Ai'Ae has to go to the dorm.

446
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:04,074
What dorm?

447
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:06,119
I guess what I said was too short.

448
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,854
I should've said that he's helping a friend move his stuff into a dorm.

449
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,364
Nosy bastard. I'm leaving.

450
00:33:12,364 --> 00:33:14,244
What dorm??

451
00:33:16,964 --> 00:33:19,164
His friend... Is it Ai'Pete?

452
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,844
Oh, you know him, too?

453
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:24,594
Yeah. I met him once before.

454
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:27,944
His looks are good. And his personality is good.

455
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:32,164
It's a shame... that he has a lousy friend.

456
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:34,914
It (spit) splattered on my face...

457
00:33:34,914 --> 00:33:38,424
So do you also know his friend? The one that's also in IC.

458
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,794
His personality is like a total fucking asshole.

459
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:42,804
Did you know? As if insulting me wasn't enough,

460
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,804
he even went on to insult Ai'Ae and Ai'Pete.

461
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:46,694
What kind of friends are they?

462
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,614
Such a fucking asshole.

463
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:52,564
Too bad. Last time, I was only able to punch him once.

464
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,754
I should've thrown three to four punches.

465
00:33:55,754 --> 00:33:58,404
His face really fucking pisses me off

466
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,864
And his personality is also so shitty. He's both shitty and an ass.

467
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:04,324
Like... a damn motherfucker, dude.

468
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:07,862
Are you being pissed off at him or pissed off at me??

469
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:10,563
Stop constantly bringing up that you're my mom,

470
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:13,962
when you've never done anything like a mother should.

471
00:34:13,962 --> 00:34:17,364
And that stupid banquet of yours or whatever. For me, it's just ridiculous.

472
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:20,794
I was in a good mood and I ran into him again.

473
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:25,344
Mom, if you want to show off your favorite son, then go ahead and show off to the fullest.

474
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:28,224
But for me, it's just disgusting to see.

475
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,784
Hey! How can speak so rudely and disrespectfully to your mom like that?

476
00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:33,884
Terrible son.

477
00:34:37,614 --> 00:34:40,454
Don't ignore me. I'm talking to you.

478
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,574
Don't meddle in other people's business.

479
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:45,024
Fine. I didn't really want to meddle in your business.

480
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:47,474
You unloved child.

481
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:52,204
What did you just say?

482
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:53,774
I just said...

483
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:55,121
That you are...

484
00:34:55,146 --> 00:34:57,546
an "unloved child."

485
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:14,227
It'd be nice if you'd shut your mouth sometimes.

486
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:23,485
Kissing a guy is not that bad.

487
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,644
Auntie, would you like me to help you?

488
00:35:51,644 --> 00:35:53,724
Oh, dear. Thank you so much.

489
00:35:53,724 --> 00:35:56,389
I thought I would've been able to do it by myself.

490
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:03,894
Is there anything else I can help you with?

491
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:05,994
Nothing, dear. Thank you so much.

492
00:36:05,994 --> 00:36:07,674
But do you live here?

493
00:36:07,674 --> 00:36:10,654
Oh, no. I just happen to be helping my friend carry his things into his dorm.

494
00:36:10,654 --> 00:36:12,824
Oh... Geez, we're the same then.

495
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:15,454
I'm also helping Koon-Noo bring his things into his room.
 (T/N: Koon-Noo = Young Master)

496
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:18,054
Letting him set up his room alone makes me worried.

497
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:22,844
He's never lived by himself, this one.

498
00:36:22,844 --> 00:36:25,724
Oh, Jiew. Did you take out all of these by yourself?

499
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:27,574
Ae.

500
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,384
Is this "Ae" that you always talk about?

501
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:35,504
Yes, Mom.

502
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:39,024
- Hello.
- Hello.

503
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:41,224
We finally meet, right?

504
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:50,474
Where do you want me to put this?

505
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,894
You can leave it on the table, Ae.

506
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,184
This is the last box, Koon-Noo.

507
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,314
Thank you so much, Auntie.

508
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:02,924
Of course.

509
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,314
Right, I was about to ask.

510
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:10,584
Is this stuff you're bringing into a dorm, or are you moving homes? It's so fucking much.

511
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:12,474
Yes?

512
00:37:12,494 --> 00:37:14,824
Let's unpack them.

513
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:16,314
Okay.

514
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,883
What's the matter?

515
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,601
You...

516
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:38,644
You and my mother finally met. I feel strange.

517
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,021
I think that Mom has to know for sure.

518
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:44,384
You didn't want me to meet her?

519
00:37:44,384 --> 00:37:46,374
Not at all.

520
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:49,384
Ai'Pete,

521
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:56,589
I'm not someone good at dealing with elders or making elders favor me.

522
00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:00,694
I also don't know if your mom is going to like me or not.

523
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:03,784
But...

524
00:38:19,452 --> 00:38:22,402
I'm going to give it my all to make your mom like me for sure.

525
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:26,344
Yes. Thank you so much, Ae.

526
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:29,804
Don't smile like that. Unpack already.

527
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:36,894
Right, and another thing, Ai'Pete. You moved and you're living alone now.

528
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:39,017
You should try to do somethings by yourself sometimes.

529
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,504
Don't just rely on adults.

530
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:44,104
That way your mom won't have to worry.

531
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:48,444
If I don't know how to do something, you'll teach me, right?

532
00:38:55,337 --> 00:38:57,767
I'll be really strict then.

533
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:03,804
But before that... Just unpack your stuff first.

534
00:39:03,804 --> 00:39:05,454
Okay.

535
00:39:29,354 --> 00:39:33,014
I have to really thank you for helping us move things today.

536
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:35,744
Not at all. I'm glad I can help.

537
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,884
I know that Pete has a good friend.

538
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:45,852
Anyhow, I'll leave him in your care, all right?

539
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:49,219
Because this guy here has never lived alone.

540
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:53,974
I rented out this dorm for him, but I was worried that

541
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,294
he'll use it as a storage room and come back to sleep at home.

542
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,984
Geez... Mom...

543
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,984
But once I saw you,

544
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:04,204
I felt relieved.

545
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:10,104
He's really matured a lot.

546
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:12,143
Before... geez...

547
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:16,107
Making shrimp rice soup just once was enough to make him happy all day.

548
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:19,284
When he peeled his first shrimp, he ran all over the house.

549
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:22,899
Even though the shrimp was really torn up and only this big.

550
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:26,553
Geez, Mom, you just want to tease me.

551
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,420
Do you want me to teach you?

552
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,904
When it comes to peeling shrimp, I'm a pro.

553
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:37,794
Ae.

554
00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:39,174
Yes?

555
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:45,924
Either way... Could I ask you to look after Pete?

556
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:51,573
I'll take good care of him.

557
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:00,074
Hearing you say that, I'm really thankful to you.

558
00:41:18,794 --> 00:41:20,314
Are you sleeping here tonight?

559
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:21,974
I want to sleep here to get used to it, Ae.

560
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:24,364
And lock your door too, okay? I'm going to go back to the dorm.

561
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:26,894
Ae, can you not go back yet?

562
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:31,574
If you make that face, of course I wouldn't want to go!

563
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:35,024
Then can I go take a shower first? I feel so sticky.

564
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:38,244
I'll grab a towel for you.

565
00:41:50,994 --> 00:41:53,894
Ae, did you need some clothes, too?

566
00:41:56,204 --> 00:42:00,444
Thank you. Hey, let me borrow a shirt, too.

567
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:02,144
Okay.

568
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:26,514
Ai'Pete, where are the clothes?

569
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:30,704
Uhh... Uhh

570
00:42:30,704 --> 00:42:34,384
Ae... Ae, you can go ahead and choose.

571
00:42:36,004 --> 00:42:38,624
What's the matter with him?

572
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:42,144
How am I going to be able to pick it myself?

573
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:02,215
Ae, how could you do that and not worry about my heart?

574
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:10,037
I'm a guy, too.

575
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:19,798
Pete, are you asleep already?

576
00:43:25,474 --> 00:43:28,714
If you sleep like that, you won't be able to breathe.

577
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,900
Then I'll turn off the lights, all right?

578
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:51,279
Before you came out of the bathroom,

579
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,679
your body was so red like a shrimp.

580
00:43:55,456 --> 00:43:59,116
Taking hot showers too often, it's not good for you.

581
00:44:03,686 --> 00:44:06,956
Then next time, I'll be careful, Ae.

582
00:44:06,956 --> 00:44:08,795
Ai'Pete.

583
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:15,204
I have to confess to you.

584
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:19,264
Just now when I said I wanted to peel shrimp,

585
00:44:19,894 --> 00:44:22,874
I've actually been wanting to unwrap you.
(T/N: peel/unwrap is the same word)

586
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:25,764
Ae!!

587
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:35,394
Forget it... Let's just go to sleep.

588
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:37,204
Sweet dreams.

589
