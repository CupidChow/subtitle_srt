Talking to the Thai Program...

30

Why do you want to be friends with him?

31
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,874
Why did you get off here?

32
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:21,492
Isn't the Engineering Building on the other side?

33
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:23,083
Listen to me, Pete.

34
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,976
The next time you get on a bus, check its direction first.

35
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:30,510
So when you park far from here, you can take the bus here.

Don't tell me you were...

37
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,920
Right. I rode along to send you off.

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,830
I thought you didn't know how to use the bus.

Mercedes-Benz? So what? I can still ban them.

Hey, you! Is this your car?

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,383
It is my car. I'm sorry.

58
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:20,022
I didn't know. I'll move it right now.

59
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:23,237
Didn't know or didn't care? Can't you see it's a no-parking spot?

60
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:26,299
Don't you think being rich means you can do whatever you want?

61
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,500
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,020
What exactly do you want? Have him move his car or bully him?

63
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,189
He apologized. What do you want him to do?

64
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,880
Lie down right in front of you?

65
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,567
You can just warn him and walk away, so he can move his car.

66
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,530
As for you, don't ever park here again.

67

I won't.

68
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,172

69
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:50,859

84

Your hand.

85
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:04,213
If I release your hand, you won't hold on. I'd rather grip like this.

86

88
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,104

95

96
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:33,166

99
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,309
you're quite fragile

100
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:44,670

101

104
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,950

105
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,598
How much is it?

106
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:01,840
If you finish this you can pay me.

107
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,460
Sure.

108
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,599
Aren't you hungry? Why aren't you eating?

109
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,801
Do you always run in the morning?

110
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:15,682
Yes. I always wake up at 5:00 a.m. to run.

111
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,020
If there's time, I offer food to the monks,

112
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,501
take a shower, and come here for breakfast.

113
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,320
You come pretty early, too.

114
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,785
Next time you come early, join me and eat breakfast here.

115
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:32,277
It will help you gain more weight.

116
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,745
Ae,

117
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:39,478

118
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,845
"Abnormal?"

119
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,449
Pete, I think the people around you

120
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:55,370
judge you with their old, conservative social standards.

121
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,473
But that's not how I think of you.

122
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,410
Do you think I'm short?

123
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:03,827
In my case, I never think I'm short.

124
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:05,395
Everyone else is just taller.

125
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:09,051
Likewise, if you think you're "normal"

126
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,171
and everyone else says you're "abnormal,"

127
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,400
you're still "normal."

128
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,106
I don't know if you understand.

129
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,640
I'm not good at explaining.

130
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,551
But listen, I never look at you and think you're not normal.

131
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,080
Thank you, Ae.

132
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,265

133
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,400
Pay for the noodles.

134
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,010
Forget it, Koon-Chai.

135
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,180
Thank you.

136
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,261
I'll get going.

137
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:02,141
If you're early tomorrow, see me on the football field.

138
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,047
Thanks.

139
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,204

140

141

142
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,995
Never mind.

143
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:15,200

164
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:46,065
I guarantee. This is delicious.

165
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:49,222
Shrimp rice soup? I love shrimp.

166
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:51,572
But I haven't taken a shower yet.

167
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,062
Can you wait in my dorm room?

168
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:55,185
Your dorm room?

169
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:58,766
Yeah. I have some bowls there.

170
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:04,856
Come on. Let's go.

171
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:06,386
Sure.

172
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:13,742
This is normal for the campus dorm.

173
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:15,655
Especially for men. The buildings are quite old.

174
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:17,372
Luckily, I got a room here.

175
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,662
- The other rooms are older.
- I see.

176
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:21,972
If someone's loud, the neighbors can hear it.

177
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,522
The walls are very thin.

178
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:27,292
Last night, I almost didn't fall asleep.

179
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:30,692
What happened? Was someone making noise?

180
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:34,976
The jerk who's sleeping in my room turned on Miyabi's clip loudly.

181
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:37,087
- Imagine it!
- Huh?

182
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,288
The neighbors came to listen to our room.

183
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:42,882
They thought we brought some girls into our room.

184
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:47,142
Oh...

185
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:49,372
Hell, yeah!

186
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:51,209
- Hey!
- Here, here.

187
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,870
- Good stuff.
- Hurry up.

188
00:11:57,232 --> 00:12:00,032
But then they heard some Japanese.

189
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:03,768
They came into my room.

190
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:06,629
- Buddy, open the door!
- Open it!

191
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,610
It's opening.

192
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,369
Miyabi's new movie.

193
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,643
He's the jerk I meant.

194
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,372
It's a little messy.

195
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,142
- Sit here.
- Thanks.

196
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,418
Ai'Pond.

197
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:26,938
Ai'Pond!

198
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,482
Pond?

199
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:32,501
I'll break all of your DVDs.

200
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,952
What? What did you say?

201
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,555
You lied to me again.

202
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:40,616
That day, you said you stepped on my DVDs.

203
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,723
Another day, a virus deleted all of my porn.

204
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,655
When will you stop freaking me out with such jokes?

205
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:48,476
I'll stop when you stop going crazy about it.

206
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,475
Shit!

207
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:52,965
How the heck did he get in?

208
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,205
I invited him.

209
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:55,966
What a stupid question.

210
00:13:55,967 --> 00:14:00,427
What? Don't tell me that...

211
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,592
Are you and Ai'Pete...

212
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,482
Can your brain only think of dirty stuff?

213
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:06,800
Doesn't it make sense?

214
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,219
If you don't have something going on,

215
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:11,544
the two of you wouldn't meet each other.

216
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:14,905
Look at him. Such a Koon-Chai.

217
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:16,615
And look at you.

218
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:18,852
A son of a beast?

219
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:21,797
Pete, admit it now.

220
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,514
You're fond of my friend, right?

221
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:24,612
Ai'Pond!

222
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:26,970
What? I'm still talking to him.

223
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:28,937
I'll stop threatening you about your DVDs,

224
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:30,328
if you stop doing 3S.

225
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,021
3S?

226
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,269
What's 3S?

227
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,988
Don't be suak (nosy), prasad (silly)...

228
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:39,145
No, no, no... That starts with a "P," not an "S."

229
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,476
Or be sarm (perverted).

230
00:14:40,476 --> 00:14:42,527
Now, go take a shower...

231
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,272
Before I rub my feet on your face.

232
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:46,432
Fine. I will.

233
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:49,462
But don't let me know the two of you are...

234
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:50,522
- Jerk!
- I'm leaving.

235
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,515
He's just like that. Don't mind him.

236
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,136
Okay.

237
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,781
Where did you buy these from, Koon-Chai? They look yummy.

238
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:24,146
I didn't buy them.

239
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:28,551
We made them at home so I brought some for you.

240
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:31,592
- Thanks, Koon-Chai.
- You're welcome.

241
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,392
Your hair is so soft.

242
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:59,762
Your skin is soft, too.

243
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,802
Give me your hand.

244
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,282
Your hand is soft, too.

245
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:27,735
Are you sure you're a man?

246
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:31,792
Touching you makes me worry I might bruise you.

247
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:46,092
Am I making you uncomfortable?

248
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:49,275
No, I'm just...

249
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,705
I'm afraid you'll hate me.

250
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:54,942
You may have forgotten, but I'm...

251
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:56,912
Gay?

252
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:59,050
Would I do this if I hate you?

253
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,740
♫ I only beg for you to be with me forever ♫

254
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,460
♫ You're the only one I'm asking for ♫

255
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,810
♫ I want you to be my sky when I fly ♫

256
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,120
♫ Be my guiding star when I'm lost ♫

257
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,630
♫ I only beg for you to embrace me in the deep cold night ♫

258
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,030
♫ Hug me a little longer ♫

259
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,450
♫ Hold me more tightly than yesterday ♫

260
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,432
Shit!

261
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,382
My friend is turning gay.

262
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:43,686
What the hell did you say?

263
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:46,467
Don't pretend to be mad and change the subject.

264
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:47,807
I saw that.

265
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:49,832
What did you see?

266
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,165
You were holding his face up!

267
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:53,202
And?

268
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,902
You two were about to...

269
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,392
Ugh!

270
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,648
If that means I'm kissing him,

271
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,554
I must have kissed Nong Yim a million times.

272
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:03,068
Nong Yim?

273
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:05,022
My niece.

274
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:07,023
Oh, that's your niece.

275
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:08,454
How's that different?

276
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,994
Pond, nothing's going on. I'm serious.

277
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:14,732
You don't need to explain to this pervert. You're wasting your time.

278
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:19,053
I'm nosy, I'm silly, and I'm a pervert.

279
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:21,882
Fine. From now on...

280
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:26,639
I'll keep my eyes on both of you.

281
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,809
Can you stop staring at us?

282
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:45,022
Okay, I'll stop.

283
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:47,684
- Where is my bowl?
- There's none.

284
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:51,123
Don't act like this! I'm hungry, too.

285
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:53,062
Pond, you can have mine.

286
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,813
No. Eat your soup.

287
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:57,394
See? You're protecting him again.

288
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:58,695
Buy your own food!

289
00:18:58,695 --> 00:19:01,896
I'll tell everyone you have something going on with an IC.

290
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:02,618
Shut up!

291
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:03,848
Scolding me again.

292
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:06,114
Share with me.

293
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:08,788
Don't you know anything about manners?

294
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:10,772
You're such a hog!

295
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:13,625
Hey, Ae. Someone's knocking on the door.

296
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:19,132
Pond, you asshole!

297
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:21,362
So mean.

298
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:22,413
Are you full?

299
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:24,193
I'm full.

300
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:25,481
May I?

301
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:27,212
Sure.

302
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,353
Shut up.

303
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:39,649
- It's yummy.
- Thanks.

304
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,405
Done. Take care of this.

305
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:47,438
You should learn how to clean up.

306
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,778
- Pete.
- Yes?

307
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:00,135
Who's your favorite AV star?
(T/N: Adult Video)

308
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:02,225
What is an AV star?

309
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:05,816
What? Don't you know any AV stars?

310
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,246
No, I don't.

311
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,527
Do you...

312
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:14,572
really like Ae?

313
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:22,218
I...

314
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,952
I... I should leave now.

315
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:27,073
I have a class in the morning.

316
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,120
Need a ride?

317
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,380
No, it's okay. I can go back by myself.

318
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,801
- See you.
- Sure.

319
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:37,182
Well, well.... Someone is offering a ride.

320
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:39,512
- Wow!
- Offer, my foot.

321
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,108
Where are you going now?

322
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,809
To shower.

323
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,190
Showering.

324
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:59,709
Pete likes you.

325
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,469
Nonsense.

326
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:05,451
Keep insisting. I'm pretty sure.

327
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:07,317
He's obviously targeting you.

328
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:09,008
I saw he was shy because of you.

329
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:10,677
When you were washing the dishes,

330
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:13,878
I asked him about his favorite AV actresses.

331
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:16,179
Do you know what he said?

332
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:20,179
Who's your favorite AV star?

333
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,262
What is an AV star?

334
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:25,926
What? Don't you know any AV stars?

335
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,057
No, I don't.

336
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:28,297
Nonsense.

337
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,839
What do you mean, "nonsense?"

338
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,119
Why are you guys together like two peas in a pod?

339
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,726
He has no friends.

340
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:37,673
He likes you.

341
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,446
You better be careful.

342
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:42,439
Many manly guys like you... were easily converted.

343
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,841
If you don't know him, you better shut up.

344
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:47,141
Just watch out for your ass.

345
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,439
Do you want to go to class or talk nonsense?

346
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,692
Oh, right. Wait for me!

347
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:59,289
Ai'Ae! Wait for me!

348
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:13,089
P'Pete?

349
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:17,204
Do you know if the Professor is assigning a group project of quartets?

350
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:20,834
A senior student told me. Do you want to join our group?

351
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:25,678
Yes, join us. We won't give you too much work.

352
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:29,685
Fucking annoying.

353
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,624
Such a shame. Good looks, potty mouth.

354
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,150
Chasing others away with mean words.

355
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:40,451
Tin, you shouldn't say that.

356
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,294
Why?

357
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,575
Did I say something wrong?

358
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,535
No, you didn't.

359
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:47,390
But you shouldn't say such things.

360
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,513
Everyone used to like you.

361
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:52,999
Because I'm rich and because of my last name.

362
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,946
Not everyone thinks that way, Tin.

363
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:56,446
Why?

364
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:58,676
What did you hear from those Thai programs?

365
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:01,358
What do you mean?

366
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:05,889
Lately, I have seen you hanging out with those Thai program people.

367
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:10,509
Rich people like us should only befriend those of our own kind.

368
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,380
Don't be friends with lower people.

369
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,681
Tin!

370
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:15,755
Did I say something wrong?

371
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,043
Tin!

372
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:44,092
Tin, wait.

373
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:48,914
Now what?

374
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:50,836
What we talked about earlier...

375
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:51,696
No comment.

376
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,308
Not everyone is like that.

377
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:56,771
Ae isn't like that.

378
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:59,544
Ae really wants to help me.

379
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,471
Sure.

380
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:05,099
But I don't believe you.

381
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:07,790
Just like that...

382
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,539
See you.

383
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:11,929
I have something to do.

384
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,549
Tin, can you give me a ride?

385
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,952
My place isn't far from yours.

386
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:44,479
Please... Give me a ride, please.

387
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:48,905
Wow, Ai'Good.

388
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:52,479
Look! She's pretty.

389
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:54,162
How lucky is he?

390
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:58,772
He has a nice car and a pretty girl like her.

391
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:04,748
Shall I offer candy to God so I can get lucky, too?

392
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:07,669
So I can be rich in my next life, at least.

393
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:11,289
I'll buy everything I want to eat. How about that?

394
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,978
Let's go, Can.

395
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:18,142
P'No will be angry at us.

396
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,771
I feel sorry for her now!

397
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,039
Damn. I want to see his face.

398
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,715
How handsome do you have to be to reject a pretty girl like that?

399
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,369
This is so not my business...

400
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,869
Let's get a free meal from P'No.

401
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,817
Oh my goodness, Ai'Good!

402
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:42,499
Why did you stand that close? You freaked me out.

403
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,038
Let's go. Why did you stand that close?

404
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,877
Hurry up! Before No changes his mind.

405
00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:53,858
I hate Calculus!

406
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:55,999
I never understand this class!

407
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,850
Hey, Ai'Pond. Which subject do you understand?

408
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,652
Right.

409
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:05,068
Guys, it's almost lunchtime. Where should we eat today?

410
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,216
The IC canteen?

411
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:10,736
There again. You two surely have something going on.

412
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,420
What do you guys say?

413
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,146
Hey, Ai'Ae! You can't just ignore me like that.

414
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:19,140
No, too far. I'll eat something around here.

415
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:24,031
Same here. I have an afternoon class. It's too far away.

416
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:25,682
- Okay. I'll go now.
- Sure. Bye.

417
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:26,709
See you.

418
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:29,934
Okay... I have to stick my nose in his business.

419
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:32,128
I'll keep you guys updated. Later.

420
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:34,502
Hey, Ae! Wait for me!

421
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:36,715
So?

422
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:39,042
This is interesting. Pond is extremely nosy.

423
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:41,426
Ae ignores everything.

424
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:42,815
How can they be roommates?

425
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,415
Yeah... He ignores us, too.

426
00:26:45,415 --> 00:26:47,752
- He didn't even want to join us!
- Let's go.

427
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:49,519
Who should I have lunch with now?

428
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,751
- Who will have lunch with me?
- Me. I'm here. Let's just go.

429
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:56,521
Hello, Auntie Jiew. This is Pete.

430
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:58,534
My class ended early today.

431
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,645
Can you teach me how to cook shrimp rice soup?

432
00:27:01,645 --> 00:27:05,605
I can cook it for you, Young Master. Why do you have to make it yourself?

433
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:08,189
I want to cook it by myself for someone.

434
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:10,584
Please, please. Teach me, please...

435
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:13,778
Of course. I always lose when you beg like that.

436
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:16,939
I'll get the ingredients ready when you get home.

437
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:21,359
Thank you so much. Please get the biggest shrimps.

438
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:23,988
Thank you.

439
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:50,801
P'Trump.

440
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:53,457
What's up, Ai'Pete?

441
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,515
I'll go with you.

442
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,790
Has anybody ever told you how shameless you are?

443
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,670
Of course! You keep saying that.

444
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,013
Come on. A shorty like you

445
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:53,504
should be proud to have a handsome friend like me.

446
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:57,079
You should be the rider instead of me, Asshole Pond.

447
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,865
Well... You're such a strong friend.

448
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:04,076
I'm not being lazy at all.

449
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,343
Right. Is Pete not picking up your call?

450
00:29:07,343 --> 00:29:10,233
He might be in a class... If I remember correctly.

451
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:11,661
Wait a minute...

452
00:29:11,661 --> 00:29:14,423
Since when did you remember his schedule?

453
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:19,735
The Ae I know never pays attention to such things.

454
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:20,769
Hey...

455
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:23,459
That's such nonsense.

456
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,551
- Come here.
- P'Trump, let me go.

457
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:26,625
I said come here!

458
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,517
Trump, let go of me. Let me go. Stop.

459
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,079
- Come here!
- P'Trump.

460
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,795
You thought I wanted to touch you that much, huh?

461
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:36,745
I told you, right? You're disgusting.

462
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:38,486
Let me go, then.

463
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:41,369
Give me the money. Then, I'll let you go.

464
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:45,720
I won't. Not a single baht.

465
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,538
- Let me go!
- If you try to move again, I'll punch you down.

466
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,969
Then, do it.

467
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,547
We're in the middle of the campus.

468
00:29:52,547 --> 00:29:55,653
If you want them to see, punch me. Go ahead.

469
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:57,087
Are you threatening me?

470
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,777
Hey, Ae. Isn't that Pete?

471
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:00,864
Fine.

472
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:02,409
Give me the money.

473
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:03,709
No.

474
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:04,764
Give me the money!

475
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:06,585
No!

476
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,288
If you dare, fight with me.

477
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:10,720
You again? Shorty.

478
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,928
You again? Scumbag.

479
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:13,940
Go away. This is between me and him.

480
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,341
I only want to talk to Pete.

481
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:17,696
If you talk nicely, I'm okay with it.

482
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:22,010
But what I see, is you threatening him and bullying him.

483
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,303
Are you all right?

484
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:25,964
I'm okay.

485
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:30,796
You're one of them, too, aren't you?

486
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:33,990
Expecting some money from him.

487
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,589
What else does he have?

488
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:37,841
Only the money in his bank account.

489
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:42,473
A guy like you? I bet he doesn't have to pay much.

490
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,801
Hey! What are you saying?

491
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:48,039
Are you insulting him? How dare you? Huh?

492
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,214
Are you ganging up on me? Such a dirty fight.

493
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,127
It's a "dirty fight" for you.

494
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:54,993
But for good guys like us, it's a "team fight."

495
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:56,439
Pond, step aside.

496
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,179
I can take him down by myself.

497
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,379
You want to beat me, right?

498
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:01,942
Come on.

499
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:03,519
You can punch me first.

500
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,417
But if you start, this won't end easily.

501
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,459
I can't believe you're fighting with me.

502
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:12,379
Remember this. It won't end like this!

503
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,659
Especially you, Pete!

504
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:20,169
Are you okay?

505
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,979
I'm okay.

506
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,069
Ai'Ae, why did you let him go?

507
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:26,949
Why didn't you throw a few punches?

508
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:29,789
Use your brain, Pond. We are on campus.

509
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:32,119
Do you want to get detention?

510
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,335
How about you? Are you sure?

511
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:37,258
I'm really okay.

512
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,128
Pond, take my bicycle.

513
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:42,469
I don't want to eat now.

514
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:44,359
What? Where are you going?

515
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,917
Skipping class.

516
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:49,179
Also, I need to talk to him.

517
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:16,269
Ae.

518
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,427
So...

519
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:23,549
Thank you,

520
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:27,719
for helping me again.

521
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:34,263
I'm sorry for almost getting you into trouble.

522
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:39,283
You can get mad at me.

523
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,890
You're so...

524
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,209
I told you several times,

525
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:50,449
to call me when you're in trouble.

526
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:53,289
Am I only an acquaintance to you?

527
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:56,361
Right now, you're my friend.

528
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,909
Do you know what friends are for?

529
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:03,850
For me, no matter what difficulties,

530
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,947
what trouble they're in,

531
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:08,759
I'm ready to move a mountain for them.

532
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,471
Understood?

533
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:14,190
Hey...

534
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:17,069
Don't cry.

535
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:19,100
I'm...

536
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:23,559
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

537
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,650
I'm just happy.

538
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,009
I'm so happy, I want to cry.

539
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:42,009
From now on, I won't let anyone hurt you.

540
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:44,115
I'll look after you.

541
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,840
♫ Even if the road in front of us is long ♫

542
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,410
♫ Even if the road is harsh on us ♫

543
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:00,820
♫ If we have our downtime afterward, we will hold hands again ♫

544
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,170
♫ I'll never let that hand go ♫

545
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,530
♫ Our love will be forever and it will never end ♫

546
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,970
Ah... Right on time.

547
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,626
Is your watch dead?

548
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:20,057
They've been doing the quiz for 30 minutes, and you say you're "right on time?"

549
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:21,786
Please, Professor.

550
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:24,706
I had the wrong time on my schedule.

551
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:26,515
Please forgive me this time.

552
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:28,736
- Please, beautiful professor.
- Sit down!

553
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,721
Yes, Ma'am.

554
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:39,352
Hey... The wormwood girl.

555
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:42,301
What "wormwood?"

556
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:45,758
Wow. What a coincidence.

557
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:48,746
I never thought we'd run into each other in class.

558
00:34:48,746 --> 00:34:49,738
Hello?

559
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:50,886
Hey!

560
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:53,186
Damn, too bad.

561
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:56,115
Beautiful, but mute.

562
00:34:56,115 --> 00:34:57,519
Hey!

563
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:08,826
What are you doing?

564
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:10,312
My lunch.

565
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:11,623
Why are you eating it here?

566
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:14,786
Why? I'm hungry.

567
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:16,476
You!

568
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:19,356
What's your major?

569
00:35:19,356 --> 00:35:21,876
Engineering, Professor.

570
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:27,429
Are you falling in love with a one-quarter Italian guy like me?

571
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,616
Didn't they teach you basic social manners?

572
00:35:30,616 --> 00:35:32,988
Do you have any?

573
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:36,427
And you...

574
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:40,342
You should stop your friend next time.

575
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:42,666
- But, Professor, he's...
- Shh.

576
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:46,379
I'm sorry, Professor.

577
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,321
See what you did? Put it back in your backpack now.

578
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:51,507
But I'm hungry.

579
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:55,079
And a guy like you can't be one-quarter Italian.

580
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,546
What, then? One-quarter angel?

581
00:35:56,546 --> 00:35:57,756
One-quarter ghost. The rest isn't human, either.

582
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:01,125
Are you from hell or what?

583
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,051
Speaking non-stop.

584
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:03,657
Why do you have to blame me?

585
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,355
Can't you just shut up?

586
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:08,066
I'm eating. Can't you see?

587
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,336
Both of you. Come here.

588
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,926
Boat? Boat what? A ship?

589
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:15,956
Both of you! Now!

590
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,736
Nonstop chatter.

591
00:36:25,736 --> 00:36:27,616
Good.

592
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:34,076
You want me to check the size of... Really?

593
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:36,626
Such a daredevil.

594
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:39,086
You don't fear speaking to me like this, so...

595
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:41,086
Hold this in your mouth.

596
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:43,206
Both of you.

597
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:45,196
Until the end of class.

598
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,636
Go!

599
00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:35,264
Ai'Ae!

600
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:37,416
Why didn't you tell me you were skipping practice?

601
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:39,595
I did, you asshole.

602
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:42,106
Did you know today was my unlucky day?

603
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:44,766
After we separated, I went to grab a bite.

604
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:47,526
But it was already late for the afternoon class.

605
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,850
So, I took my lunch to the lecture room.

606
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,106
You know what? The professor smelled it.

607
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:53,756
I was scolded terribly.

608
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:56,640
Also, do you remember the girl from the coffee shop?

609
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,356
The very beautiful one.

610
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:00,726
But she speaks so rudely.

611
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:02,226
You're even worse.

612
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:06,084
You... She called me a quarter ghost!

613
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:08,906
Shit. Most people adore me over my good looks.

614
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:10,446
How dare she say that to me?

615
00:38:10,446 --> 00:38:12,186
Hey, Ae! Are you listening to me?

616
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:13,565
I think she's right.

617
00:38:13,565 --> 00:38:15,716
You never take my side.

618
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:18,256
She said that I'm a troublemaker.

619
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:20,456
I think she's still right.

620
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:25,250
You asshole. You never take my side.

621
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,266
I wish you to get fucked in your ass.

622
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:30,516
- Up your ass, Pond!
- You jerk...

623
00:38:33,086 --> 00:38:34,966
Enough about me.

624
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:38,389
How about Pete?

625
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:41,919
I don't know. He must be scared.

626
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,548
At first, I thought Pete was a top.

627
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:48,456
But after seeing him hurled to the wall like that,

628
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:50,989
I think... he's a bottom.

629
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:52,893
What the heck are a top and bottom?

630
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:55,835
Come on! The active and passive gay.

631
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,256
The active one is the top.

632
00:38:58,256 --> 00:39:00,626
The passive one is the bottom.

633
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:02,556
But sometimes they switch.

634
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,246
You know? On top.

635
00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:06,426
Perverted jerk. I should take a shower.

636
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:08,684
Enjoy topping and bottoming your ass alone.

637
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:12,166
But I think you two are actually perfect for each other.

638
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:15,576
A fragile one like Pete... and...

639
00:39:15,576 --> 00:39:17,806
a "tiny" one like you suit each other.

640
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:20,146
Pond, you asshole!

641
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:25,176
Why do you always kick me like that? Shit.

642
00:39:30,907 --> 00:39:32,437
[Coming for breakfast?]

643
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:33,921
[I can't go today.]

644
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,391
[I'm at the IC Building.]

645
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:36,856
[I woke up late today.]

646
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,700
[Tomorrow, then.]

647
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,827
You guys...

648
00:39:40,827 --> 00:39:44,047
Pete is actually quite handsome.

649
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:47,599
Sis, why don't you ask him to join us?

650
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,177
He's going to stay late at least once a week with us.

651
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:54,032
Good idea.

652
00:39:54,032 --> 00:39:58,627
I can't believe your brain can think of something useful.

653
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:28,166
[I'll be late. Want to have dinner?]

654
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,853
Even his text are so "Koon-Chai."

655
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,200
[I'll call you after practice.]

656
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,076
What are you doing, Ae?

657
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:37,447
Taking a lazy break? I want one, too.

658
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:42,579
P'No's playing Keep Away. He thinks I'm "it." He's having fun. I'm so bored.

659
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:44,519
Hungry? I'm starving.

660
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,326
Let's grab a bite. But it's on you.

661
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:49,787
I have no money. I'm out of money this month. Please...

662
00:40:49,787 --> 00:40:53,017
Slow down and take a breath. I can hardly keep up.

663
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,721
As for you... Speak up.

664
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:56,603
I almost thought you were mute.

665
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,977
Well, I'm alert.

666
00:40:58,977 --> 00:41:01,907
Alert, alert, alert!

667
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:03,846
Really?

668
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:05,286
You call that alert?

669
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:07,497
In your case, I believe it's called ADHD.

670
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,108
I prefer "hyperactive."

671
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:10,537
I'm sad now.

672
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:12,764
P'No, Ae's skipping practice for dinner.

673
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:15,646
I'll go with him. I'm hungry enough to eat a cow.

674
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:18,587
Hold on. What are you trying to say?

675
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:20,407
I'm using the wrong word...

676
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:23,007
Ae is skipping practice, or you'll eat a whole cow?

677
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:25,835
Eat dinner! I'm hungry.

678
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,987
You understood. Why do you want me to repeat?

679
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:31,614
You jerk... And you...

680
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:35,717
Stop skipping practice, Albino Monkey. Understand?

681
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:38,438
All of you, listen.

682
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:41,807
You can't use the privilege of the football team to skip practice.

683
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:45,992
Don't you know the student presidents are blaming me because of that?

684
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:48,254
Please... I beg you to join the practice first.

685
00:41:48,254 --> 00:41:50,287
Then, I won't care what you eat.

686
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:52,537
Just don't ruin the team's reputation, okay?

687
00:41:52,537 --> 00:41:54,331
- Hey.
- Huh?

688
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:56,426
My name is Can, not Albino Monkey.

689
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:59,077
Are you really my senior? You can't remember my name.

690
00:41:59,077 --> 00:42:03,526
Right. His name is Can, not Albino Monkey.

691
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:08,751
Off-topic again! I'm telling you not to skip practice,

692
00:42:08,752 --> 00:42:11,057
not talking about your nickname.

693
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:14,837
Huh? Damn it!

694
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:30,497
What do you want?

695
00:42:33,628 --> 00:42:35,818
That's all you want?

696
00:42:56,946 --> 00:42:58,568
Guys, I'm hungry.

697
00:42:58,568 --> 00:43:00,319
Let's eat noodles in front of the campus.

698
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,380
Sure.

699
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,887
Okay. Let's eat, then.

700
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:08,592
You guys go ahead.

701
00:43:08,592 --> 00:43:10,523
I'll pick up my friend first.

702
00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:16,363
See? So obvious.

703
00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:17,702
How?

704
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:20,943
Do you want to bet who he's going to pick up?

705
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:24,531
No. I don't want to lose.

706
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:26,537
Wait, wait, wait.

707
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:31,814
This means... I'm finally going to meet that IC kid.

708
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,900

709
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,744
Pete.

710
00:43:45,744 --> 00:43:46,523
Yes?

711
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,624
Am I annoying you?

712
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:50,527
I'm hanging around you too much.

713
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,147
You never ask for help.

714
00:43:52,147 --> 00:43:55,120
But I'm the nosy one.
[Tar: Tum, can I call you tonight?]

715
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,017
If you don't want to sit here,

716
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,477
you can sit somewhere else.

717
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,578
I really don't have any.

718
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:08,877
I don't believe you!

719
00:44:08,877 --> 00:44:10,310
