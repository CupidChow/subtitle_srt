[Episode 5]

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,726
At times...

29
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:31,093
I might just think of you as more than a friend.

30
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,460
I like you, Ae.

31
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:43,203
In the end, no matter what

32
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:45,370
you decide you want me to be to you.

33
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,860
But I... already like you.

34
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,220
Sometimes you are kind of mean

35
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,920
to give me some hope like this.

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,320
But it's not wrong if I have some hope, right?

37
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,120
Ai'Ping, I don't want to blame our friend.

38
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,500
But Ai'Ae is such an amateur.

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,250
What are you talking about? Didn't you see them in the theater?

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,830
They were even holding hands.

41
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,270
I saw that.

42
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,010
But can't you see them being like...

43
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,540
When I see it, it bothers me.

44
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,930
Right, I forgot you're a nosy bastard.

45
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,650
You are nosy, too. I know you saw it, but you wouldn't say it.

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,090
Wrong. Someone like me is what you call someone who knows how to read the atmosphere.

47
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,350
I can read it, too. I know how to spell it, too.

48
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,930
W... h... e...

49
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,310
Enough, enough. You asshole.

50
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,370
What do you think we should do about those two?

51
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,540
One of them is so fucking shy.

52
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,140
The other one only cares about kicking a ball all day.

53
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,190
Yeah.

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,790
Should I just put them together in a room, drug them, and lock them up?

55
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,760
That's too extreme. Too much.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,670
Or should I train him on how to be a good Casanova?

57
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,830
So he knows what he should do.

58
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,870
You're all talk, Ai'Pond.

59
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,070
Just Ai'Ae glaring at you,

60
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,770
is enough to make you trip over yourself.

61
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,910
Someone like me being afraid of Ai'Ae? I'm not scared of him at all.

62
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,740
He's like a kindergartner with puppy love. Wait. No. No.

63
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,520
Even kindergartners are better at flirting with girls than he is.

64
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,750
Enough. Just open it already.

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,690
Oh, right.

66
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,190
Fuck me.

67
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,940
Ai'Ping.

68
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,160
I think...

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,720
I should go see my mom. The thing is...

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,620
I forgot that I'm supposed to meet my mom.

71
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,240
I'll... see you later, man.

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,496
Ai'Pond... Fighting!

73
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,857
- Fighting!
- Ai'Ping! Hey!

74
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,840
Ai'Ae, the thing is I just remembered that I forgot to buy detergent.

75
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm... going to go buy detergent really quick, buddy.

76
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,420
Ai'Pond!

77
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,500
What is it, sir?

78
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,850
Is there something you'd like your pal Pond to do for you? Ai'Ae, pal...

79
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,410
Just now...

80
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,140
What? What about just now? I didn't say anything.

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,550
I was just talking to Ai'Ping about the movie we watched this evening. Remember?

82
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,040
It's like the villain was a freaking amateur.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,250
He said he would shoot that actor or whatever the fuck, but

84
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,320
I... wasn't talking about you at all. All clear, right?

85
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,820
No!

86
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,960
I'm so fucking dead...

87
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:47,820
Do you think it could be possible... if I were to like someone?

88
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,090
What?

89
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,030
The thing you wanted to ask me was just this?

90
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,930
Are you fucking yelling for your dad or something?

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,870
I just thought that you were going to ask me about...

92
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,430
Never mind. All right. Lay it on me.

93
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,110
What did you need my advice on?

94
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,800
Am I really that desperate that I have to ask this, asshole Pond?

95
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,570
Hey... I'm a love doctor.

96
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,250
An amateur like you, it's only right that you'd ask me.

97
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,240
Forget it.

98
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,110
Hey. You can't forget it. Otherwise, I won't get to be nosy.

99
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,660
How about this? Just now, you asked if a guy like you can like someone, right?

100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,570
Why does it have to be "yes" or "no"?

101
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,210
If you like someone... then go ahead and like them. Just go for it.

102
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,270
But did you forget that... I'm not handsome at all.

103
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,740
Yeah, I know about that.

104
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,330
You are not as handsome as I am.

105
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,960
Don't look at me like that, friend.

106
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,500
Come on... Just trust me.

107
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,490
There are sure to be people who have peculiar tastes.

108
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,040
Your spring season is probably around the corner, friend.

109
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,560
If you think...

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,210
Hey!

111
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,010
Or...

112
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,270
Ai'Pete confessed his love to you already?

113
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,830
There... There...

114
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,300
Asshole Pond.

115
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,070
You asshole!

116
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,790
Why the hell did you kick me?

117
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,190
I'm helping you, you know.

118
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,610
Such a snake in my bosom.

119
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,790
Don't even think that I didn't hear what you said about me in the hallway. You asshole, Ai'Pond.

120
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:23,930
Damn... He heard it.

121
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,040
But... I got away with it already.

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,520
I'm going to call Ai'Ping first, all right?

123
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,450
Hello, Ai'Ping.

124
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,870
He didn't say anything.

125
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,210
Chompoo.

126
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:03,350
Chompoo!

127
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,200
Wha.. What?

128
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,290
What's the matter with you?

129
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,820
I... I'm sick in love.

130
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,730
What did you say?

131
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,960
Ley, I've finally found him.

132
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,830
- Found what exactly?
- The man of my dreams.

133
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,570
What?

134
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,650
I got goosebumps...

135
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,360
What the heck?

136
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,220
Did you arrive already?

137
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,340
Yeah. Just wait there.

138
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,610
That's okay.

139
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,590
I told you I'm sincere about picking you up to go eat. Okay.

140
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,810
Okay. Okay. I'll see you.

141
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,670
Ouch... Ouch... Ouch...

142
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,820
What's with you now?

143
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,920
Your smile is hurting my eyes.

144
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,020
"I'm sincere about picking you up to go eat together."

145
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,710
Geez... How about next time you be sincere about waking me up, too?

146
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,390
You asshole, you're fucking annoying me man.

147
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,640
Ai'Ae, that was pretty hard man.

148
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,100
You asshole, Pond. What the fuck are you playing at now?

149
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,940
I've finally found you.

150
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,560
My hero.

151
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,460
Pond?

152
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,390
Ae, didn't come with you?

153
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,570
I'm not telling. You should see it yourself.

154
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,040
Okay.

155
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,600
What? You don't need to look all suspicious. Hurry and get on.

156
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,930
Right now. Ai'Ae is dealing with...

157
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,260
It's better if I don't say anything.

158
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,620
Come here. Get on. Hurry.

159
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,300
Okay.

160
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,220
Ae the hero...

161
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,950
Pond, do you know if right now there's something that Ae wants?

162
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,500
- That he wants?
- Yes.

163
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,140
It seems like there is.

164
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,190
You, of course.

165
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,360
I'm kidding.

166
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,710
I want to repay him, really.

167
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,600
Ae helped me so many times.

168
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,110
You don't need to.

169
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,000
You already know that Ae does good things without expecting anything in return.

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,320
I know that, but I still want to repay Ae.

171
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,010
This one, too? Why do you guys want to repay each other so much?

172
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm a good guy, too.

173
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,250
I don't see anyone wanting to repay me at all.

174
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,130
Pond, is there something you'd like?

175
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,820
I'm kidding, Ai'Koon-Chai.

176
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,600
And if you actually buy me something, Ai'Ae would kill me.

177
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,330
Okay.

178
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,600
About Ai'Ae, right,

179
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,250
I saw that... lately, he seems to be wanting some new soccer cleats.

180
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,300
I saw that he's been looking at them for a month now.

181
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,100
But he just won't ever buy them.

182
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,230
Oh... and...

183
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,600
Do you think... Ai'Ae is a hero?

184
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,210
He is!

185
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,040
Ae is a hero.

186
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,190
You answered it without having to think about it, Ai'Koon-Chai.

187
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,460
Let's go. Then I'll give you a ride to see your Hero Ae.

188
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,690
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

189
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,570
Hold on tight.

190
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,960
Good morning, Ae.

191
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,870
Good morning.

192
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,660
Ai Pond didn't do anything to you, right?

193
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,990
Geez. You're slandering me, Ai'Hero.

194
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,020
I followed every single one of your instructions you know.

195
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,290
I went to pick up Ai'Pete at parking,

196
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,040
and I even brought him to his destination, Mr. Hero.

197
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,250
Hero? No matter how many times I say it, it's hilarious.

198
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,500
Hero, krab. Hero, ka.

199
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,220
Hey... What are you laughing at?

200
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,790
Because P'Ae really is my hero.

201
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,310
All right. I wasn't saying anything about that.

202
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,490
I was just curious is all.

203
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,340
Why nowadays is the hero so short?

204
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,040
The reason I helped was that I wanted to help.

205
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,320
I didn't want to be a hero or anything like that.

206
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,860
You don't need to repay me, all right? I don't need it.

207
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,450
Right, Ai'Pete. You want to eat the usual?

208
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,540
Yes. And this girl...

209
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,670
I helped her to pick up her bag. So she came to thank me.

210
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,930
If there isn't anything else, I'm going to go buy food for my friend, all right?

211
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,220
P'Ae! But I really want to thank you.

212
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,910
And I also really like you. Even if your friend doesn't believe me.

213
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,340
But I've been looking for you for a week now.

214
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,040
Including around where you helped me, the canteen, the university...

215
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,570
And... destiny finally made us meet each other again.

216
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,520
These several days that passed by made me realize that I like you.

217
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:51,977
Would you be my boyfriend?

218
00:12:56,926 --> 00:13:01,336
Ai'Ae... You? Geez. My stomach hurts.

219
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:02,696
It's so fucking hilarious.

220
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:05,976
Your cherry blossom season has arrived, buddy.

221
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:09,856
This is so hilarious. Somebody help me.

222
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,156
It's still funny.

223
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,226
Are you joking with me?

224
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:15,076
P'Ae! It's not a joke or anything of that sort!

225
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:17,126
I really like you.

226
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:19,346
Please be my boyfriend.

227
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:21,036
I... I think that...

228
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:23,026
Just a moment.

229
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:27,416
Hello. Oh, really?

230
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,686
All right, all right. I'll head over soon.

231
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:32,586
Okay, okay, okay.

232
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:35,256
P', I have to go now. My friend called me.

233
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:38,426
I'll come back for the answer another day. Goodbye.

234
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:40,276
Bye-bye.

235
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:45,616
Ai'Pond, you're pranking me, right?

236
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,556
Not at all! This time I didn't do anything!

237
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,616
Ae, don't you think that she might actually like you?

238
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,826
Now, it's become a family issue.

239
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:57,866
I'd rather not be involved.

240
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:00,536
I'm leaving now. I'm going to borrow your bike, all right?

241
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:02,146
See you.

242
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:11,166
Why do you think that?

243
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:18,766
So, why do you think that it's a joke?

244
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,886
I even think that...

245
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,946
You have a lot of things about you

246
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:27,836
that make so many people like you.

247
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:32,026
And that girl,

248
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:37,126
she has her reasons for liking you.

249
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,026
And she seems to suit you, too.

250
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,176
What about you then, Ai'Pete?

251
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,286
I...

252
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:52,566
I think that that girl likes you.

253
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,946
I'm not talking about Chompoo.

254
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:57,116
I'm talking about you, Ai'Pete.

255
00:14:58,396 --> 00:14:59,936
What about me?

256
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,586
Ai'Pete!

257
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:05,886
I don't know what you mean.

258
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:11,936
You want the usual, right?

259
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:13,936
Wait right here.

260
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:29,166
I don't like it when you push me to like somebody else, Ai'Pete.

261
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,150
♫ However many mornings ♫

262
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,410
♫ however cold it gets ♫

263
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,590
♫ The stories still circulate like this ♫

264
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,276
I don't even want to push you away.

265
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:46,086
But what right do I have to hold you back?

266
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,170
♫ however long ago ♫

267
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:58,090
♫ I’ve never had anyone right here ♫

268
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,410
♫ There’s only me and my lonely heart ♫

269
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:10,620
♫ Will there be a day that I meet you? ♫

270
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,196
Hello, Beautiful.

271
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,846
Hey, watch out!

272
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,496
Ouch... I'm so fucked.

273
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,646
Is it not enough that Ae's been giving me a hard time lately?

274
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:34,386
Now the bicycle crash. Ouch!

275
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:36,886
That totally ruined my image.

276
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:39,326
How can I look at her now?

277
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:42,176
She's going to laugh at me for sure.

278
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:48,356
Serves you right. You all right?

279
00:16:48,356 --> 00:16:50,476
I'm human, of course. How could you even ask?

280
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,916
Oh, but... ChaAim doesn't see me as a human being anyway.

281
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,866
Then I could be a ghost for you instead.

282
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:02,816
Then you'd probably be a ghost that's stupid, insane, and really clumsy for sure.

283
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:08,076
Go ahead. Find it funny. Go ahead all you want. Mr. Pond is ready.

284
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:11,056
It's not funny. I don't like laughing at others.

285
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:13,186
But look, you're finding it funny. I saw it.

286
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:15,936
I didn't find it funny. This is a smile.

287
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:20,146
It's just funny to see someone hurt and still talking so much.

288
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,846
Let me see the wound.

289
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,746
Ouch... That hurts.

290
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:36,536
Exaggerated.

291
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:38,776
It hurts. Can't you see?

292
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:55,416
It hurts!

293
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,216
Just that and it's all better.

294
00:17:57,216 --> 00:18:00,656
It's not better... It still hurts. Right here hurts, too.

295
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:04,986
My leg also hurts. My butt hurts, too. I guess I must've fallen and hit it really hard.

296
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:08,276
- Take me to the clinic, please?
- I'm not going.

297
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:09,876
Just this and you're acting like you're dying from the heart.

298
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:13,210
And... how did you know?

299
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:18,646
I might have a wound on my heart, too.

300
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:25,946
- Just this hurts already. And you're pinching me?
- You deserve it.

301
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,476
I even helped you, and you're still playing around.

302
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:33,256
What if... I'm not playing anymore.

303
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:37,356
Nonsense.

304
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:39,605
Hey. Where are you going?

305
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:41,326
I'm busy.

306
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:45,176
So cute I'm going crazy.

307
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:53,066
I guess, my heart might really be wounded after all.

308
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:02,916
Ai'Ae!

309
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,211
Today, the most amazing thing happened to me.

310
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,043
Do you remember ChaAim? The girl who scolded me.

311
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:12,121
Well... Today, I rode your bike, right?

312
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:14,765
But I crashed and Cha'Aim saw it, man.

313
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:17,896
Would you believe it? I thought that she would laugh at me.

314
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:23,300
But that wasn't the case. That girl walked over and brought me a band-aid. I was like... "Wow!"

315
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,574
She even told me that I'm stupid and clumsy.

316
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:30,532
You must be wondering why I'm still smiling, even though she insulted me.

317
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:33,143
It's the first time I've seen her smile too, man.

318
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:35,636
It was like, the most adorable smile ever.

319
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,986
So, I acted like I hurt my arm.

320
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:42,269
And look, that girl even put the band-aid on my arm for me.

321
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,752
When she put this band-aid on like... she was like this.

322
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,702
And I was also like...

323
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:49,533
She smells really nice, buddy.

324
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:52,199
I was like I can't take it anymore. She's so adorable.

325
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,944
Yeah.

326
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:57,976
You're not going to be even a little bit happy for me or anything?

327
00:19:57,976 --> 00:19:59,846
I'm so happy for you.

328
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:02,687
What the hell is with you?

329
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,995
Don't be too mad at Ai'Pete.

330
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,154
I'm not mad.

331
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:11,336
Geez. Sitting there with such a grumpy face. And you still want to say you're not mad?

332
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,543
He probably hasn't been able to eat with you lately, right?

333
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:16,088
So you're mad at him, isn't that right?

334
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,681
Come on.

335
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:22,168
As someone who's been through more things before,

336
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:23,863
I have more experience than you too.

337
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:27,578
I'm telling you, man, that what you're feeling right now is mad.

338
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:30,331
Especially when he says something to push you away to somebody else. Right?

339
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:33,226
So then you feel even worse and get into a bad mood.

340
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:35,157
And then you end up even more upset.

341
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:38,124
So if you let him continue to be like this any longer,

342
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:41,356
you're going to be the one to lose it for sure, Ai'Ae.

343
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,236
And it's going to be really drawn out. Trust me.

344
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:46,254
Just shut your mouth. I'm not fucking mad or anything.

345
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:51,979
Geez. Sitting all mad and being so gay, and you still want to say you're not mad?

346
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,510
Ae, I'm giving you advice you know!

347
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,035
Why the hell did you throw stuff at me?

348
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:03,432
I didn't ask you. I'm going to go downstairs to buy stuff.

349
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:06,402
Don't act so stubborn.

350
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:08,924
Ai'Rookie.

351
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:10,201
My friend...

352
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:15,299
Is your first love going to make it?

353
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:25,946
Next time, I should fall on her lap.

354
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,226
I'm not mad at you or anything!

355
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:44,236
I just don't like it.

356
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,216
I don't like it when you talk as if you want me to be with Chompoo.

357
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,646
Damn it!

358
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,736
If you're just going to sit there and sigh like this,

359
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,626
it's best if you'd just go home.

360
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:07,446
I'm sorry, Tin.

361
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:09,786
I... was a bit distracted.

362
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,986
You finally got in a fight with the Ai'Thai Program kids then.

363
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:15,396
That's not it. I'm not—

364
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:20,196
Oh my! Two of the hottest young guys are sitting together again.

365
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:22,786
This one is hot like the popular type.

366
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:25,766
As for the other one... Hot like everyone wants to slap your face.

367
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:27,686
You have such a cruel mouth.

368
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:29,166
Stop, N'Tin.

369
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,496
You don't need to get up.

370
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:33,056
I'm not staying long enough to give you diarrhea to the point of dying or anything.

371
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:35,036
Nong Pete, you see,

372
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:37,796
I want to ask you about attending the cheering competition.

373
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:39,626
Nong Pete, are you available?

374
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:42,326
It's all about fun and enjoying ourselves. Our group that is.

375
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:46,946
Mainly focusing on beauty. No need to be worried about the rules.

376
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:48,436
I think that...

377
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:52,726
But Nong Pete didn't you tell me before that you wanted to see the stands from the other departments.

378
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:55,696
Especially, the stand from the engineering school of that Dark Stocky Short dude.

379
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:57,966
I bet it will be quite amazing.

380
00:22:57,966 --> 00:22:59,626
Please. You'll go, right?

381
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:01,866
For the stand, please?

382
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,016
You'll go?

383
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,466
You are such a sweetheart.

384
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,456
Let's talk about the details later.

385
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,046
Okay.

386
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:15,576
N'Tin, you don't have to look like you're going to poke my eyes out like that. I'm leaving now.

387
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:17,496
Before I go...

388
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:20,986
I'll be leaving now, all right?

389
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,616
If you didn't want to do it,

390
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:32,546
why didn't you refuse?

391
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:35,376
I want to join them in the stands.

392
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:39,079
I want to see the stands from other schools.

393
00:24:09,268 --> 00:24:13,298
Ae, what's the matter? Are you hungry?

394
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:15,244
I'm not always hungry like you, Ai'Can.

395
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:17,654
Geez... I just saw that you looked exhausted.

396
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:19,474
Being exhausted means that you're hungry.

397
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,464
You've been standing still for a while already.

398
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,214
You can tell me anything.

399
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:25,174
Nothing. It's nothing.

400
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,824
If it's nothing then that's good.

401
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:28,624
You need to try to be more alert.

402
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:29,754
Look at me as an example.

403
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:33,594
Look how alert I am. I ran three laps around the field, and I'm still not tired.

404
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:35,936
Not to brag.

405
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:38,204
What did you say? I think you should say that again.

406
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:40,454
Like you? Running three laps and still not exhausted?

407
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:42,914
I heard that after just one lap, your battery was already drained.

408
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,230
If my battery is gone. Then, why don't you change it for me?

409
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,044
Treat me to some food.

410
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:49,824
Geez. He can't seem to pass up opportunities, this dude.

411
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:52,154
My name is Can, not "this dude."

412
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:54,554
You seem to have a really short memory, P'No.

413
00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:56,464
I'll kick you if you want to say something like that.

414
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,874
I'm not scared.

415
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:02,207
Hey! As expected of No's dear little bro, for real.

416
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:03,624
They're exactly the same, no doubt.

417
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:07,054
Who are you insulting, Ai Type? I'm not a birdbrain like Ai'Can or anything.

418
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:11,424
Geez, I'm not a birdbrain or anything. I'm just crazy.

419
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,234
Yeah. Exactly. That's why I'm saying you're incredibly alike.

420
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:18,014
Hey! I'm not crazy, man!

421
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:19,134
You guys are free right now, right?

422
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:21,134
Go buy some water for me, all right?

423
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:23,404
Hey! Ai'Type! I haven't finished talking.

424
00:25:23,404 --> 00:25:25,404
But I finished my business with you already.

425
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:28,074
You can just tell the drink stall that it's for the soccer team.

426
00:25:28,074 --> 00:25:30,274
Ignoring me as always.

427
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:35,554
Don't forget that the reason you're able to have a girlfriend to this day is because of a certain someone.

428
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:37,794
P'Type has a girlfriend!? Who is it, P'No?

429
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:41,354
- Well...
- I'll count to 3.

430
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:45,164
If you guys still haven't gone, I'll make you guys run around the field three times.

431
00:25:45,164 --> 00:25:48,954
But P', the drink stall is far from here.

432
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:51,364
Whatever. Just think of it as running practice.

433
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:53,654
And you'll be able to build up your leg muscles, too.

434
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:56,654
In case you might finally become a real player, Ai'Can.

435
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,294
I'm not stupid enough for you guys to trick me.

436
00:25:58,294 --> 00:26:01,214
Let's go, Ae. Let's go build up our leg muscles.

437
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:03,124
Let's go and buy water together.

438
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,114
How is it? Your little bro.

439
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:11,824
Hey, Ae! Ae! Don't let Ai'Can make any more trouble.

440
00:26:11,824 --> 00:26:13,014
I'm too lazy to deal with it!

441
00:26:13,014 --> 00:26:15,914
Damn! Whether it's something good or bad, he's always using my name...

442
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:17,304
That's enough. He heard it.

443
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:19,214
How come you're not ignoring me now?

444
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:21,814
Hey, Ai'Type!

445
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,024
Go.

446
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:26,044
Ai'Damn friend.

447
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:29,529
Right, Ae. It's almost the cheering competition day.

448
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:30,904
How's your school doing?

449
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:33,404
It's pretty usual. There's nothing special.

450
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:35,144
Just you wait and see my school.

451
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:37,434
They're really trying to go out with it.

452
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:38,924
Okay, okay.

453
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:40,934
I'll wait and see.

454
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:44,344
Right. How's your IC friend?

455
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:47,744
Fortunately that he's your friend. Otherwise, I would hate him already.

456
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:50,244
The other day, I was almost hit in the ass by an IC guy's car.

457
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:54,064
Just talking about it has my fists really itching. I'd really like to punch him just once.

458
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:56,504
But are you sure that your IC friend is really a nice guy?

459
00:26:56,504 --> 00:26:59,404
If I say so, you'd believe me. You shouldn't trust people so easily.

460
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:01,524
You need to learn to make up your own mind and decisions, too.

461
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:03,874
Geez... But I trust my friends.

462
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:06,834
If you say he's good then I say he's good, too.

463
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:09,363
Ai'Pete is good.

464
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:11,643
In fact, he's too good.

465
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:14,428
Sometimes, I really want him to be bad a little bit more.

466
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:16,134
You are so strange.

467
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,614
Him being good is a good thing.

468
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:21,104
So have you seen Ai'Pond?

469
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:25,724
He told me that he would let me borrow his "limited edition" movie or whatever. He said it's superb, too.

470
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:28,793
Do you know what movie it is? Is it Ironman?

471
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:31,605
But Ironman doesn't have any limited edition, right?

472
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:33,605
I hope it's a superhero movie.

473
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,600
I really like watching those kinds of movies.

474
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:40,304
Or is it going to be a thriller?

475
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,382
I just remembered something.

476
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:46,324
I'll be right back. I have to see my friend at the IC building.

477
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:47,970
Ae!

478
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,725
Hey!

479
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:53,277
So, how am I supposed to carry these?

480
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,399
Pete, can I talk to you for a bit?

481
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:07,608
Could you let me talk to him a moment, Tin?

482
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:14,418
It's been several days already. Why won't you eat with me?

483
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:17,505
It's nothing.

484
00:28:18,124 --> 00:28:21,884
But your face isn't saying that it's nothing.

485
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:26,634
So... you haven't been seeing Nong Chompoo?

486
00:28:26,634 --> 00:28:28,034
What does it have to do with Nong Chompoo?

487
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:29,994
I want to eat with you. Not with N'Chompoo.

488
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:31,964
But that girl, she...

489
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,027
But what?

490
00:28:34,027 --> 00:28:36,399
There's nothing going on between me and Chompoo.

491
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,934
And another thing, I told you that I'd be taking care of you.

492
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,364
If you don't let me take care of you,

493
00:28:40,364 --> 00:28:42,724
who else am I supposed to take care of?

494
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,625
I'm not a complicated guy, Ai'Pete.

495
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:51,815
I don't know why you are mad at me.

496
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,715
But I want to eat with you.

497
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:59,389
I'm not mad at you.

498
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:00,904
I'm just...

499
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:02,734
Just what?

500
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:06,514
If you have something, just tell it to me straight.

501
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,842
If you don't like something, I won't do it.

502
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:10,777
What a fake.

503
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,284
Be careful of getting fooled.

504
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:16,969
People can be fake and have hundreds of faces.

505
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:20,504
By the time you know it, you'll have been taken advantage of already.

506
00:29:20,504 --> 00:29:21,914
But Ae is not that type of person.

507
00:29:21,914 --> 00:29:24,064
You might know his face, but you don't know his thoughts.

508
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:27,714
Even siblings will kill each other fighting over money.

509
00:29:27,714 --> 00:29:31,934
So that can easily happen between a rich person... and a poor one.

510
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:34,874
Tin! Ae is not like that.

511
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,794
It's okay, Pete.

512
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,964
But Ae you're really not someone like that.

513
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:41,624
It's because I'm not.

514
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:44,264
So, why do I have to be bothered by his words?

515
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,244
Ai'Ae!

516
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:51,974
You mean friend!

517
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:57,997
How could you let me carry all the water by myself?

518
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:04,452
What are you guys doing?

519
00:30:04,452 --> 00:30:07,367
Are you having a staring contest? Can I play, too?

520
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,134
Wait.

521
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:12,929
You're... Aren't you that IC kid?

522
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:14,934
No wonder. Ai'Ae said he was coming to see a friend.

523
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:16,104
I was wondering which friend it was.

524
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:17,124
Do you have a car?

525
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:19,624
Can you give me a ride to the soccer field?

526
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:23,494
I carried this water from the canteen alone.

527
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:25,494
I'm so tired and it's so very hot, too.

528
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:28,934
Right. Why did I have to carry them while following after you?

529
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:31,944
Why didn't I just carry them to the soccer field?

530
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,230
Yes, of course.

531
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,309
See? What did I just say?

532
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:41,605
Someone you don't even know, just suddenly asks to use you.

533
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:44,045
And to get in the car in that state?

534
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:45,606
Dirty.

535
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:48,444
Hey... Why are saying something rude like that?

536
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:50,104
Don't you have any compassion?

537
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:53,254
Damn. I was just asking to hitch a little ride.

538
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:54,368
Can't even say anything.

539
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:56,693
If the soccer field really is not that far,

540
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,023
why don't you run over there by yourself?

541
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:03,614
As for what you asked for. If there's an update, I'll let you know.

542
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:05,024
Okay.

543
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:06,414
Oh!

544
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,579
And you really shouldn't let these guys get into your car.

545
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:11,924
It would get dirty for nothing.

546
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:15,234
Ai...

547
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:16,104
Calm down, Ai'Can.

548
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:17,454
Let go of me, Ae.

549
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,794
I'll beat the dog out of his damn mouth.

550
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,814
How could he say something so rude?

551
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:23,944
We were just asking to hitch a little ride was all.

552
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:26,074
Did he really have to say something like that?

553
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:27,994
See? Fucking assholes, just like I told you.

554
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:29,064
I told you to calm down, Ai'Can.

555
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,324
But he was looking down on you.

556
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:31,774
Are you going to go make him right, then?

557
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:36,124
Don't stoop to his level. At least Pete isn't like you said.

558
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:39,244
I'm sorry.

559
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:42,154
I didn't mean to insult you, Ai'Pete.

560
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,074
But he really is a dogmouth.

561
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:46,024
Ai'Can!

562
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:49,344
That's all right. My friend really didn't say anything nice either.

563
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:51,324
See? Ai'Pete even agrees with me, too.

564
00:31:51,324 --> 00:31:55,554
Are you a kid or something? Once someone sides with you just a bit, you go all out.

565
00:31:55,554 --> 00:31:57,214
Let's go back to the field.

566
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:59,714
P'No must be waiting to death already.

567
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:01,294
Are we really going to carry these back?

568
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,134
Building up your leg muscles, remember?

569
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:05,464
Let me give you guys a ride.

570
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:08,204
Don't worry. I don't want your car to get dirty for nothing.

571
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:11,804
I don't mind that. I want to give you and Can a ride there, really.

572
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:15,614
And also, there is nothing to do with advantages either.

573
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:19,304
Let's go. I'm so lucky to finally be able to sit in a Mercedes-Benz.

574
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,964
Thank you for believing in me.

[Criminal Records Division: Physical Assault/ Fraud]

576
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:08,444
How can a person like Pete know this type of person?

577
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:19,854
What's up, Ai'Tharn?

578
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:24,322
I'm under the College of Music building.

579
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,593
I came to wait for Ai'Tum.

580
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:32,354
What's with you?

581
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,976
Jealous of me?

582
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:40,641
Hey... Don't be jealous.

583
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:46,335
Then... I'll go pick you up at the practice room then.

584
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:50,115
When you're done, we can go and eat afterward.

585
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:54,833
That's all.

586
00:34:04,884 --> 00:34:06,484
Ai'Tum.

587
00:34:07,693 --> 00:34:10,433
Your brother sent me an email.

588
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:17,156
What are you talking to my little brother about?

589
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:22,624
Well, I just talked to him about... his cowardly older brother, of course.

590
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:24,404
Ai'Type!

591
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:26,971
I'm kidding.

592
00:34:26,971 --> 00:34:30,682
I just asked how he's been doing.

593
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:32,806
And what else did you talk to him about?

594
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:39,156
It's probably about how your brother still hasn't forgotten about my boyfriend.

595
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,539
And another thing, too.

596
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,424
I'm telling you exactly as I told your brother.

597
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:50,819
Whatever you do, just don't regret it later.

598
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,471
I'm leaving.

599
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:08,187
Do you see the one I sent you?

600
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:10,527
Ai'Ae has been looking at that one for a month now.

601
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:11,567
I see it, Pond.

602
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:17,227
If you really want to buy them for him, I'll help you find out his shoe size.

603
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:18,727
Thank you, Pond.

604
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:22,867
Geez. It's not a big deal. It looks like Ai'Ae is coming. That's all for now, all right?

605
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,697
Okay, Pond.

606
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:45,707
Sleep yet, sweetie?

607
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:48,757
Not yet, Mom. Did you need something, Mom?

608
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:56,247
Hey. You're 18 already. You're still acting like a child.

609
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:59,097
It's because I'm still a child for you.

610
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:04,572
Lately, you've been coming back home pretty late.

611
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:10,057
Look at your face. I haven't accused you of anything yet.

612
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:16,047
I'm just worried when you have to drive back home late at night.

613
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:17,727
So, I just wanted to ask you.

614
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:20,017
Ask me what, Mom?

615
00:36:21,504 --> 00:36:24,847
Pete, do you want to stay in the dorms?

616
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:26,097
Yes?

617
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:28,747
I'm not kicking you out to stay outside, sweetie.

618
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:33,117
I was just thinking... That way you'd have a place to sleep

619
00:36:33,117 --> 00:36:35,772
whenever you have to stay on campus really late.

620
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:40,607
And another thing. You're always having to drive back and forth like this every day.

621
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:44,097
I'm afraid you might be exhausted. And I'm also worried.

622
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:45,827
And another thing.

623
00:36:46,762 --> 00:36:51,527
I think that... you might want to have your own personal space.

624
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:55,007
Like any other adults have.

625
00:36:56,742 --> 00:36:57,932
And another thing.

626
00:36:57,932 --> 00:36:59,187
So many things, Mom.

627
00:36:59,187 --> 00:37:01,387
This really is the last thing,

628
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:05,257
You might want to go out late at night with Ae.

629
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:07,657
And might not want me to know.

630
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:11,897
I haven't gone out late at night with Ae at all. I really haven't.

631
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,647
If that's the case... you don't want the dorm anymore then?

632
00:37:14,647 --> 00:37:16,667
No, I want it.

633
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,157
But I don't go out late at night with Ae you know.

634
00:37:19,157 --> 00:37:22,397
But I want it because that way I don't have to drive so late at night.

635
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:24,350
That way you don't have to worry, Mom.

636
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:27,887
I'll try to believe you, Pete.

637
00:37:27,887 --> 00:37:29,807
Mom...

638
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:46,037
Hey, hold it properly. I can't see the driver's face.

639
00:37:46,037 --> 00:37:47,547
Asshole, I'm working like a criminal

640
00:37:47,547 --> 00:37:50,107
and you still dare to boss me around?

641
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:53,097
I paid for it already. So I should make full use out of it then.

642
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:55,957
I still can't see the driver's face. Could you move it to the right a bit?

643
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:56,957
Kla, you asshole.

644
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:59,503
I think if you want to be so precise, you should just come and take a look yourself.

645
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:00,953
If I could've gone, I would've gone already.

646
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:03,444
I go to your house so often that P'No can tell if I'm up to something now.

647
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:06,847
Dude, my older brother isn't that smart.

648
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:09,187
Where is it?

649
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,907
You have to find out for me who gave P'No a ride back home.

650
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:13,787
Okay, okay, okay.

651
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:15,797
I'll ask for you.

652
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:18,347
What are you looking at, Ai'Nic?

653
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:19,947
No... No... Nothing, P'.

654
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:24,527
Hey, why are you so jumpy? It's only your brother.

655
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:30,447
So, why are you here so late at night?

656
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:33,297
I'm looking for a snail. It's for tomorrow's lab.

657
00:38:33,297 --> 00:38:35,287
I saw some around here earlier.

658
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:36,357
A snail?

659
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:39,797
Yeah. But like... Shit. They move too fast.

660
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:40,687
Where? Where are they?

661
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,137
Here, here. Right around here.

662
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:45,387
Yeah? Do you want me to help look? It's already late.

663
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:49,237
It's alright. I'll... I'll find one by myself.

664
00:38:49,237 --> 00:38:51,917
Are you sure?

665
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:56,007
It's late now. Once you find one, quickly come inside. I'm worried you know.

666
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:07,897
Dude, it's a good thing my brother is stupid.

667
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:10,227
Don't insult my wife.

668
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:14,047
But you can say that he's less smart and looks yummy instead.

669
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,837
Annoying.

670
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:23,897
Come on, P'. Why am I the only one being used to buy stuff all alone?

671
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:26,417
Damn. If I hadn't met you,

672
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,317
I would've had to buy it by myself.

673
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,927
Such bias.

674
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:38,007
Also, isn't it the sophomores' job, isn't it? To have to buy stuff for the stands.

675
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,697
Well, if a first-year around here hadn't messed around and missed out on being a regular player,

676
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:42,597
they probably wouldn't have kicked you out.

677
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,317
What messing around did I do?

678
00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:45,937
I was just singing off-key is all.

679
00:39:45,937 --> 00:39:47,817
Just singing off-key?

680
00:39:47,817 --> 00:39:50,917
Dude, you got to a point where you changed the school's song to a song with a bunch of animals.

681
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:56,117
If the dean hadn't heard it, I'd be one of the people who would've thought you wouldn't make it, Ai'Can.

682
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:59,997
P', maybe I just don't want my friends to be stressed.

683
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,887
Isn't it that asshole?

684
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,887
Hey! You!

685
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:08,237
We need to talk.

686
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:10,587
We didn't finish talking last time.

687
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:13,567
Are you deaf-mute?

688
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:14,657
Answer me.

689
00:40:14,657 --> 00:40:15,407
Let go.

690
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:17,007
I'm not letting go.

691
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:19,507
Not until you answer me.

692
00:40:22,857 --> 00:40:26,097
I don't have to talk to you, Thai Program.

693
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,817
And next time, don't talk to me.

694
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:31,057
Because I don't know you.

695
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:32,807
And I don't even want to know you.

696
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:35,287
Who is lower than me?

697
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,759
You asshole!

698
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:43,516
Fucker!

699
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:46,438
This kid sure likes to stir up shit.

700
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:48,222
I know, right?

701
00:40:48,222 --> 00:40:50,437
He's such a fucking asshole.

702
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:52,957
He also calls me a leech, too.

703
00:40:52,957 --> 00:40:56,237
No, he didn't really call you a leech. He just said that you are "inferior."

704
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:57,707
They are the same.

705
00:40:57,707 --> 00:41:01,637
If I see him again, I'll punch him to the point that his eyes burst.

706
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:03,417
What do you mean punching him until his eyes burst?

707
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:06,487
Just him saying one thing, and you turned into a stuffed monkey.

708
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,937
Just you wait and see.

709
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:13,217
If I see him again, this Can right here will draw some blood from his mouth for you to see.

710
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,637
Let's go, let's go. Let's go buy stuff.

711
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:17,837
Do you know about it? A crocodile's tail?

712
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:18,817
All right. Let's go.

713
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:21,947
Watch, this crocodile's going to get you! You asshole!

714
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:27,249
Damn! I'll kick you! I'll punch you...

715
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:31,544
Just you watch. Next time I see you, I'll mess up your face, Ai'Tin.

716
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:33,559
I'll punch! I'll punch you first!

717
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:37,594
P'Can, be quiet! I'm trying to study!

718
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,130
Fine. I'll sleep.

719
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,515
Good. Make sure you just sleep. When you're awake, you're bothering everyone else.

720
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,757
I'm so pissed! I'm so pissed!

721
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:56,807
P'Can! I already told you to go to sleep.

722
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:01,317
I'm not sleeping. I'm not sleeping. I'm pissed. I'm not going to sleep. I want to punch...

723
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:05,787
I'll punch... I'll kick... I'm pissed!

724
00:42:05,787 --> 00:42:10,627
Will you sleep peacefully or do I have to force you?

725
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:12,687
Okay, sleep peacefully, then.

726
00:42:12,687 --> 00:42:14,317
Therefore, just go to sleep already.

727
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:17,417
And you better not make another sound or peep either.

728
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:20,617
No word. Stop pointing it at me.

729
00:42:20,617 --> 00:42:24,997
Otherwise, I will stab it all the way in.

730
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:33,147
- You're going to sleep?
- I'm sleeping already. I'm sleeping with my eyes closed.

731
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,595
Do I have a little sister or a witch?

732
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:39,050
I heard that.

733
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,295
Do you want the knife to go flying in there?

734
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:42,727
I won't say anything anymore.

735
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,147
All the way in, I promise you. Now to go to bed.
