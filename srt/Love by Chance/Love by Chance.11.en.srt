So that must mean that Ae got to know Pete at university.

26
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,081
That's right.

27
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,251
I see... I'm so envious.

28
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:11,191
If I were there, then I probably would've gotten to know you around the same time Pete did.

29
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,281
Let's go.

30
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:16,421
Here they are.

31
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:17,531
Thank you, dear.

32
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:18,571
- Here, son.
- Yes.

33
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,491
Thank you.

34
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:27,841
Oh, wow. Pete, you know how to peel shrimp now?

35
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:28,621
Yeah.

36
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:32,431
Geez. Before you used to still throw a fit for me to peel them for you.

37
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:34,641
Mother, you're teasing me again.

38
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:37,471
And you still remember that I don't know how to peel shrimp.

39
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:38,711
Do you want more shrimp?

40
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:41,351
Sure, I'll take some. Since you're peeling it.

41
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,971
Here.

42
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:48,991
You should eat some, too.

43
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,681
Don't just peel for others.

44
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,631
Thank you, Ae.

45
00:02:54,621 --> 00:03:00,331
Well... Pete and Ae seem very close, right? How envious.

46
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:05,111
Well, they are at the same university, dear.

47
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,081
Right. I don't see you peeling any for me.

48
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,351
Of course, I love you, Mom. So, of course, I can always give them to you.,

49
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,141
Thank you.

50
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,491
So how is it? Is school hard?

51
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:25,011
Well... Right now, it's not too difficult.

52
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:28,241
It's more like I've been attending more activities.

53
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,191
Pete, can I have more shrimp?

54
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:33,191
Of course!

55
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,771
- This one right here.
- You are so kind.

56
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,921
Here.

57
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:39,091
Yay.

58
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:08,611
Then I'll have to excuse myself and leave first, Auntie. Someone from home is already here to pick me up.

59
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:11,581
Okay, dear. Thank you so much for today.

60
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:14,341
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

61
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:15,431
Bye-byeye, Pete.

62
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,941
Bye-bye, Ae.

63
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,541
I'm leaving.

64
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:25,091
Then I'll excuse myself and go back. Before there aren't any buses back to the dorms.

65
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,351
Oh! That's all right, dear. It's late. Just stay here.

66
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,521
But...

67
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,941
It's very late now. And I'm worried.

68
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,761
Just sleep here. It's okay. You don't need to be considerate.

69
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,951
Then, thank you. I'll stay here for a night.

70
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:41,141
Of course, make yourself a home.

71
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,171
- Let's go, son.
- Yes

72
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:02,691
Are you already asleep?

73
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:09,341
Not yet, Ae. Is something wrong, Ae?

74
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,561
Do you hate your dad?

75
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,021
I... don't hate my dad.

76
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:21,931
Despite all the bad he did... I don't hate my dad.

77
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:27,161
If I hate my dad, my mom would probably be very sad.

78
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,841
And...

79
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,721
does DeLi know about your family?

80
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:34,531
Ae... Why are you asking about DeLi?

81
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,451
I just want to know.

82
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:40,581
She knows. DeLi knows just about everything regarding our family.

83
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,121
Why are you asking?

84
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:44,221
I just wanted to know.

85
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,421
Ae, are you jealous?

86
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,911
I don't like that your friend knows more about you than I do.

87
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:57,191
Ae!?

88
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,261
Ae...

89
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:01,521
Ae, are you jealous?

90
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,581
Ae? Ae... Ae!?!?

91
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:06,891
- Ae...
- Yeah! I'm jealous!

92
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,031
I don't like that your friend knows everything about you!

93
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:11,631
I don't like that DeLi is close to your mother.

94
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,971
I don't like...

95
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,961
that DeLi acts like she's one of your family.

96
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,621
Especially, when you peeled shrimp for DeLi.

97
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:22,581
I was so jealous to the point of going crazy.

98
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:25,911
But... I don't like women, Ae.

99
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,371
Ae, you know that.

100
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:29,151
What if that's wrong?

101
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:32,261
I never saw you close to any girls as you are with this one.

102
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:36,251
But... I think of DeLi in that way.

103
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:39,461
Ae, rather, it's you that likes DeLi.

104
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,011
Because DeLi is a girl that's like...

105
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:44,211
any guy would like.

106
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,251
So, I thought...

107
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,911
Stop every thought that you have.

108
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,371
Wait a minute.

109
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:57,411
When I was jealous because of you, you were being jealous because of me?

110
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:01,951
Is it wrong to be jealous because of my own boyfriend?

111
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:04,371
It's not wrong.

112
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,891
I'm not interested in your friend either.

113
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:12,961
I'm so happy. Ae was jealous because of me, too.

114
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:14,851
Don't keep repeating it...

115
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,431
I know how to be shy, too...

116
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:19,261
But I'm happy.

117
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:20,751
You want to tease me so bad, right?

118
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,271
Ae, no

119
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:23,731
I'm really not.

120
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:25,131
Then, why are you smiling so wide like that?

121
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,511
Ae, don't.

122
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:29,421
Ae...

123
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:30,531
See?

124
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,891
We are both jealous of one another.

125
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,911
You can be quiet now.

126
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:38,021
Because I'm going to kiss you.

127
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,031
We shouldn't do it here.

128
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,571
Ae,

129
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:17,951
please do it.

130
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,061
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

131
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:25,661
Don't worry. I have lotion.

132
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,641
Man, this sucks.

133
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,691
Why is that?

134
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:05,991
Look... I don't have enough money to eat now.

135
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,541
Why's that?

136
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,461
Because of Ai'Can.

137
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:13,561
That albino monkey freakin' uses my money to eat food every day.

138
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,391
Since he's a junior, of course, I have to treat him.

139
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:18,351
And no matter how much he eats, he's never full!

140
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,651
I have a headache because of it.

141
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:22,921
Come on now. Just treat your junior.

142
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,531
- Give me.
- Hey!

143
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,261
I just said I don't have money.

144
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,981
And you're still going to steal from me?

145
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,561
What a jerk!

146
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:32,321
You never offer help to me.

147
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:43,521
Who's that?

148
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:45,221
Is that Ai'Tharn?

149
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:56,881
No.

150
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,891
I'll be right back.

151
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,691
It can't wait?

152
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,791
Yeah. What's with him?

153
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,741
- Ai' Champ.
- What is it?

154
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:13,651
- Could I have a bite of grilled pork?
- No.

155
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:16,971
But it looks so tasty, dude. Give me some, please? I really want to eat pork.

156
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,431
Geez, just eat yours.

157
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:21,141
But it doesn't have any pork. And he just stole some of my food, too.

158
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,511
- There's plenty...
- Just a bite of pork. Just give me a bite of pork.

159
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,461
- You are unbelievable.
- Come on. It's just a bite.

160
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,341
Where did you get my number?

161
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,421
Where I got it isn't important.

162
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:44,461
I have something I wanted to ask you.

163
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,411
Say it.

164
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,851
Do you know what's up with Tar?

165
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:52,251
About what?

166
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:57,441
Is it about your little brother being the ex-boyfriend of my boyfriend?

167
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:59,541
Could you not be a jackass?

168
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,921
I know that there's something with you guys.

169
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:04,571
But you guys are hiding it from me.

170
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:08,751
Is this the tone of voice from someone who's asking for help?

171
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:14,771
It's been several days already.

172
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:16,831
That Tar has had nightmares.

173
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:20,491
But whenever I ask, he says that it is nothing.

174
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:24,031
Then it's probably nothing like your little brother said.

175
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:26,221
You know something, right?

176
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,411
- Tell me.
- Tum.

177
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,471
I really don't know anything.

178
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:34,441
But if you want to know, then just ask your little brother yourself then.

179
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:36,221
It's because Tar won't tell me.

180
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:38,611
Here... Let me ask you something.

181
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:41,241
What right do I even have to tell you?

182
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,881
I think you should go home and talk it out with your little brother.

183
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:46,391
I still haven't even finished eating my food.

184
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:48,281
I'm leaving now.

185
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:19,756
Hey... Just how long are you going to just lay there?

186
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:22,646
All from just losing a little football game?

187
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,116
Ma, you don't understand.

188
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:28,156
It hurts my feelings.

189
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:31,206
Yeah. I don't understand.

190
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:33,146
But if you don't get up,

191
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:36,016
I'm going to use this stick to poke you.

192
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,666
Hurry up. Get up already.

193
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,446
And put Gucci into the car already.

194
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:41,266
What?

195
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:43,226
Mom, are you going to let go (abandon) of Gucci?

196
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,956
You can't Mom!

197
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,956
I've raised him with my own hands!

198
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:49,466
Is that so? Raised him with your own hands, you say?

199
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:54,026
And did you know that's been over a month since he was supposed to get vaccinated?

200
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:56,686
Go now. Quickly.

201
00:12:56,686 --> 00:13:00,676
Otherwise, I'll have you take Gucci to the vet by yourself by bus.

202
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,126
Okay.

203
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,406
I'll get up then.

204
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:16,106
Can't even give me a bit of time to grieve.

205
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,166
Hey, who do you think you're talking to?

206
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,176
I'm talking to myself, Ma.

207
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,896
Fine. Whatever.

208
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:27,226
There... You don't need to be afraid.

209
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,826
You'll be able to see the vet soon.

210
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:35,956
Brother, just how much are you going to spoil him?

211
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:38,016
It's just for a vaccination shot.

212
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,416
What spoiling?

213
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,406
The vet's syringe is like this...

214
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:42,406
Is that so?

215
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,986
You don't need to be afraid, Gucci.

216
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:48,706
P'Can is right here to accompany you!

217
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:50,746
You're so stupid

218
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,686
Go! Go! Let's go already.

219
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:57,496
- Yeah, let's go already.
- Gucci is just sitting and resting right now.

220
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:00,326
Take Gucci and quickly put him in the car.

221
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:01,846
Come on, Gucci. Hurry, let's go.

222
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,526
Hurry up. Otherwise, I'll have you take the bus, Gucci.

223
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:06,726
Gucci. come here. Hurry.

224
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,596
The women in this house are so naggy.

225
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:11,006
Who's naggy?

226
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,056
- I'll let you take the bus by yourself.
- Gucci, come this way.

227
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:14,646
Don't steal her seat.

228
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,966
Here, Gucci. Let's go, quickly.

229
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:18,316
Let's go.

230
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,866
Good boy.

231
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:34,896
Can, you get off first. I'm going to find a parking spot.

232
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:36,826
All right, Ma.

233
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:41,006
Gucci!

234
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,826
Gucci!!!

235
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:44,896
Gucci!

236
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:46,476
Thank you very much for...

237
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:48,316
help—

238
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:51,966
Ai...

239
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:54,486
Gucci!

240
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:56,006
Gucci, come here, quickly.

241
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,876
Gucci!

242
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,846
You, uncute dog!

243
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,276
What are you smiling at?

244
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,366
Gucci!

245
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:27,416
Where did Can go off to?

246
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:32,086
Can, where have you been?

247
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:34,226
It's Gucci's fault, Ma.

248
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,426
He just ran off.

249
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:39,326
So... how did you get here, P'Tin?

250
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:44,310
I just happened to see that he ran loose. So I helped out.

251
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,996
What a coincidence.

252
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:49,686
I hate coincidences.

253
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:52,306
P'Can, how could you say something like that?

254
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:54,406
P'Tin even helped us.

255
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:57,786
You only met him once and it's already like you accepted him as family, calling him "Brother" already.

256
00:15:57,786 --> 00:16:01,546
Can! Why are you speaking like that? It's not nice.

257
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:03,466
Ma!

258
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,176
Thank you for helping.

259
00:16:05,176 --> 00:16:06,366
You're welcome.

260
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:10,016
It seems like he likes me.

261
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:12,726
Then should we go inside?

262
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:14,576
Gucci, come here.

263
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,986
Come, quickly.

264
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:20,146
"It seems like he likes me."

265
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,796
So freaking two-faced.

266
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:51,646
All done, dear.

267
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:54,086
Very good!

268
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:02,966
Here you are.

269
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:04,496
Thank you so much, Tin.

270
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:08,456
I never thought that Gucci would be so attached to you, Tin.

271
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,286
You're welcome.

272
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:14,876
Right, have you had lunch yet? Would you like to eat with us?

273
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:17,616
Can I?

274
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,716
Of course, dear.

275
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:21,716
But I'm not letting you join!

276
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:25,686
Wherever you came from, whatever hole you came from, just go back already!

277
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:29,956
And another thing, just the thought of having to eat at the same table as you...

278
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:32,666
I won't be able to eat!

279
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,896
Aren't you a gentleman?

280
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,976
Let me seriously ask you. Do you really not know?

281
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:38,746
She's just inviting you out of manners.

282
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:41,256
Ouch... Ma!

283
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:43,156
Ma!

284
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:47,116
Don't listen to Can, dear. He's just babbling.

285
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:51,486
That's right. Please come with us, P'Tin.

286
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:57,456
Then... I'll be imposing on you.

287
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:18,276
I can't believe that Can would have such a handsome friend like this. Right?

288
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:20,316
That's right, Mama.

289
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:24,966
I don't know how someone like P'Can could have a friend like this.

290
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:26,886
Thank you.

291
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:29,016
I just want to throw up.

292
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:31,976
Tin, are you studying at the same school as Can, dear?

293
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,916
Not at all. I'm studying at the International College.

294
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,816
Wow!

295
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:39,496
So... then... how did you get to know P'Can?

296
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:42,796
Yeah. I've been wondering that too, Ai'Ley.

297
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:46,456
Because for an IC kid like you, tuition per trimester is 100k.

298
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:48,286
Your last name is also famous,

299
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:49,806
you're eating Som Tum on the side of the road.
(T/N: Som Tum = Green papaya salad; It's a common/cheap food)

300
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,926
You're not going to end up with diarrhea?

301
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:56,676
This is a 40 baht (approx. $1.27 USD) dish. Not like the 4,000 baht (approx. $218 USD) dish you always eat every day.

302
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,166
- Stupid.
- Ai!!!

303
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,856
Can!!!

304
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,506
Just go back wherever you came from.

305
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:07,416
CANTALOUPE!!!

306
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,516
Geez! Ma!!

307
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,506
I told you not to call me by my full name.

308
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,106
Can...

309
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:18,966
comes from "Cantaloupe"?

310
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:24,786
Why? Do you have a problem with my name?

311
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:28,556
That's right. P'Can's name comes from "Cantaloupe."

312
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:31,526
As for my name, Ley, it comes from "Lemon."

313
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:34,446
Look. When he was a kid he loved being called that.

314
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,346
But once he grew up, his friends teased him.

315
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,646
So he never let us call him Cantaloupe again.

316
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:39,956
Isn't that right? Cantaloupe

317
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:42,626
- Cantaloupe.
- Cantaloupe.

318
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:46,816
This family is really cute.

319
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:52,596
Ma, I'm leaving first. I probably won't be eating anymore.

320
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,916
Then... I'll excuse myself.

321
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:03,376
Okay, dear.

322
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:08,656
What is it?

323
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:11,646
What is it, dear?

324
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:12,806
Go ahead and eat.

325
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:15,806
- I can eat now, right?
- Hungry? You're hungry, right? I know.

326
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:18,506
Can I order more?

327
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:25,056
Cantaloupe.

328
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:27,466
Who said you could use my name?

329
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,566
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

330
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:32,806
That's all right. I can go back by myself.

331
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,446
Why?

332
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,876
Are you still mad about that kiss from last time?

333
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:40,586
Are you trying to piss me off?

334
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:43,626
I'm not though.

335
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:46,046
So, why are you being nice to me?

336
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,546
I see!

337
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,676
You're just trying to trick me into helping you with Ai'Pete, right?

338
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:54,016
I'll tell you right now. NOT. A. CHANCE.

339
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:04,966
So what if I were to tell you that I gave up thinking of interfering with your friend?

340
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:09,186
Someone like you can think?

341
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,886
What if I said, "Yes"?

342
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,866
I don't believe it.

343
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:19,366
You're just someone who likes to speak down on others.

344
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:22,266
In my eyes,

345
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:26,946
you're just someone no one wants to associate with.

346
00:21:42,206 --> 00:21:44,256
Fine. I'm sorry.

347
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:48,396
I probably spoke too harshly.

348
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:54,446
Right.

349
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:57,926
No one associates with me.

350
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:00,566
I have no friends.

351
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:04,126
My family has no interest in me.

352
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:06,946
Do you know?

353
00:22:07,516 --> 00:22:09,156
My mother...

354
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:11,276
She's just a second wife.

355
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:14,746
The reason she had to marry my dad...

356
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:21,086
is because they wanted my dad's wife to be more of a befitting status than the first wife.

357
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:27,396
Even my name... they didn't even have a thought of wanting to choose it.

358
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:32,986
They just wanted me to have something similar to my older half-brother,

359
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:36,556
who is the first heir of the entire family.

360
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,446
Therefore,

361
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:45,526
I still don't trust anyone.

362
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,756
But I want to trust you.

363
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:03,676
Tin, I'm sorry.

364
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:08,016
The thing is, I didn't mean to insult you.

365
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:12,556
But before, you really were awful.

366
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:17,366
And another thing, who would've thought

367
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:20,376
that your issues happened to be because of your family.

368
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:25,806
I'm really sorry.

369
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:29,466
I probably spoke too harshly, for real.

370
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:42,476
You think...

371
00:23:42,476 --> 00:23:46,666
that what I just told you was a true story?

372
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,356
What?!?!

373
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:53,926
I just said a bit and you believed it so easily.

374
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,496
How damn stupid.

375
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:05,716
Did you trick me?

376
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:09,416
So why are you stupid enough to believe me then?

377
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:17,986
Just go away.

378
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:20,896
And never let me see your face again!

379
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:56,057
You came home, but you're not even thinking of greeting your older brother at all?

380
00:25:00,437 --> 00:25:02,667
You're really good at acting.

381
00:25:05,977 --> 00:25:08,387
Should we eat together today?

382
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:11,287
I was thinking of taking our family out to eat together.

383
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:13,367
No.

384
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,317
I don't have an appetite.

385
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:18,277
Wait!

386
00:25:20,724 --> 00:25:23,047
How have you been lately?

387
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,760
I feel like I haven't really seen your face around.

388
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:59,077
Even someone in my family can't be trusted.

389
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:03,577
So, why should I believe in the words of someone else?

390
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:07,137
Why would you think of him?

391
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,147
Gucci.

392
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:15,917
You bad dog.

393
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,767
A dog that doesn't love his owner.

394
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,567
So bad.

395
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:20,607
Huh?

396
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:22,607
A too trusting dog.

397
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:24,607
A dog that likes to be fooled.

398
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:28,047
How could you let him fool you?

399
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:35,037
Brother can't you stop being so stupid talking to a dog?

400
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:37,097
I'm not being stupid.

401
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:40,107
But dogs are animals that are quite smart.

402
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:41,657
Haven't you heard on the news?

403
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:45,337
That dogs can speak and understand people. They understand their owner's feelings.

404
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:49,037
Where the dog was waiting in front of the house while the owner was in the hospital for months.

405
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:50,547
It was really touching to hear.

406
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:52,617
And this doesn't include in the mountains...

407
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:55,857
That's enough. Don't go off the topic.

408
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:58,317
I'll get right to the point then.

409
00:26:59,937 --> 00:27:02,547
Brother Can-ja~
(T/N: -ja, is a flowery speech particle used within the family/lover. It shows more tenderness)

410
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:06,617
Brother Can, would you be able to find some pictures of P'Tin for your little sister?

411
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:09,517
Tin's pictures? No Way!

412
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:13,847
Brother Can, but you have to help me.

413
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:17,197
Well... There is a bully in my school.

414
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:19,657
And she really likes P'Tin a lot!

415
00:27:19,657 --> 00:27:23,067
So she told me that if I can't find her P'Tin's pictures,

416
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:24,907
she'll beat me up.

417
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:26,877
That far?

418
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:32,777
And also, if you're not able to find pictures of P'Tin for me,

419
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,897
I might have to ask for it myself—

420
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:36,847
You can't!

421
00:27:39,587 --> 00:27:42,347
If I don't go ask, then my little sister will get bullied.

422
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:45,847
She won't go to school. In the end, she'll drop out.

423
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:48,107
But if she asks him herself,

424
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,107
Ai'Tin will set a condition in exchange.

425
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:52,107
He even kisses a guy...

426
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:54,087
For a girl, he'd probably rape her,

427
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:55,217
record a blackmail video,

428
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:56,407
Ai'Ley kills herself,

429
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:59,087
and it'd be my fault!

430
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:01,407
What should I do?

431
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:02,807
Fine. I'll ask him for you myself.

432
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:07,207
Really? You're amazing, Brother. Thank you!

433
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:11,307
You are the best older brother ever.

434
00:28:23,987 --> 00:28:26,537
It's all your fault, Gucci.

435
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,967
Always looking for trouble...

436
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:31,417
You shouldn't have gone to Ai'Tin at all!

437
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,817
This unloving dog.

438
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:38,737
What should I do now? Help me think.

439
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:42,737
Cantaloupe, come here.

440
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:46,497
Geez, Ma. Don't call me by my full name.

441
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:48,167
Why? It's pretty cute.

442
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,167
I even put thought into picking it.

443
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:51,477
Hey!

444
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,477
Come here quickly!

445
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:55,947
I know, Ma. I'm coming.

446
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:59,257
Stay here for now, okay?

447
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:04,397
Sit right here.

448
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:10,307
What is it now, Ma?

449
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:13,987
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

450
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,077
You weren't acting very nice today!

451
00:29:16,077 --> 00:29:17,977
If you're like this, your friends will all stop associating with you.

452
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:20,347
But we're not even friends.

453
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:23,267
And I don't really understand rich people either.

454
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:24,717
But I understand.

455
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:26,637
How, Ma?

456
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:30,037
Well, here! It's so pitiful! Just look.

457
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:32,167
Siblings fighting each other over money.

458
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,437
His mother doesn't even love him.

459
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:34,877
His father never understands him.

460
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:36,457
No one cares about him.

461
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:38,457
He can't even trust anyone.

462
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:41,407
Geez... Just looking into his eyes,

463
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:43,907
I already feel pity for him.

464
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,387
That bad, Ma?

465
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:47,787
Yeah, that bad.

466
00:29:52,197 --> 00:29:55,317
Or is what he told me the truth?

467
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,017
Then that means I spoke too harshly...

468
00:29:57,017 --> 00:29:59,077
"Gu," "Gur," again. Who do you think your speaking to?
(T/N: Can used an informal/rude form of "I/Me" )

469
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,367
Didn't I tell you not to use impolite words?

470
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:04,137
Ma!!

471
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:08,847
*I... I... am going up to my room then.
(T/N: Can uses "Gu" again for the first "I")

472
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:19,787
What's with your eyes? That's the second time for today.

473
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:21,047
Are you going to die today or something?

474
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:23,287
Oi!

475
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,317
Oi!!!

476
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:28,337
Oh boy...

477
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:29,587
Look at him.

478
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:32,317
The male lead is so incredibly pitiful.

479
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:35,717
Rich for nothing if the parents don't love him.

480
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,087
Ai'Pete.

481
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:07,917
Is something wrong, Can? You came all the way to my school to see me.

482
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,767
Can I have Ai'Tin's phone number?

483
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,497
What?

484
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:13,557
No, no, no, no!

485
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:15,807
If I use my phone to call him,

486
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,337
then wouldn't my number pop up then?

487
00:31:20,217 --> 00:31:23,397
Right, do you know where Tin likes to park his car?

488
00:31:23,397 --> 00:31:26,137
Please... Please tell me... Please... Please...

489
00:31:26,137 --> 00:31:30,137
Normally... Normally, Tin parks his car at the science building.

490
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,237
At the science building parking.

491
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,057
The science building parking?

492
00:31:37,537 --> 00:31:39,487
What's "parking"?

493
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:42,347
"PARKING" is the car parking lot.

494
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,597
"PARKING"... means car parking lot?

495
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:47,257
Yes

496
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:53,817
Can you... do me another favor?

497
00:31:53,817 --> 00:31:56,107
What do you need, Can?

498
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:58,807
Can you not tell Tin?

499
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:01,237
About what I asked.

500
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:02,447
Okay.

501
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:03,777
Promise?

502
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:05,877
Okay... I promise.

503
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:07,857
Thanks so much. I'm leaving.

504
00:32:07,857 --> 00:32:09,437
- "PARKING."
- "PARKING."

505
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:12,577
- The car parking lot.
- Science buildings.

506
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:40,247
This should be fine...

507
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:43,467
This is all I can do anyway.

508
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:48,257
I'm sorry that my very dirty note is touching your car.

509
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:53,157
But if I don't do this, then I won't feel at ease.

510
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,500
[I didn't want to apologize to you, Ai'Tin, but I it was stuck on my mind. Stop. Don't call me stupid. Yeah, I'm the stupid one for apologizing late.]

511
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
[But that day I went too far. Forget about you tricking me. If you want to trick me then trick me. But I don't want to owe an apology. So I'm sorry.]

512
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:26,537
Stupid.

513
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:35,737
You're just stupid.

514
00:33:36,697 --> 00:33:39,837
To care about someone like me, Cantaloupe.

515
00:33:40,947 --> 00:33:44,257
[...that I insulted you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Oh! You still owe me an apology too, asshole.]

516
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,357
Or maybe truthfully,

517
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:51,317
I just needed someone to care about me?

518
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:55,577
Like this.

519
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:20,857
Just receiving an apology...

520
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:23,367
Even if you're being deceived, it's all right?

521
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:26,087
How incredibly stupid.

522
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:49,377
What is it?

523
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,887
Does there have to be a reason for a big brother to talk to his little brother?

524
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:57,677
No one around here wants to hear your lies.

525
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:01,837
That's too bad then.

526
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,287
Before, you were actually a really cute kid.

527
00:35:07,177 --> 00:35:09,407
Wait.

528
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:13,997
Nong Phu said that he wants to have dinner with Uncle Tin.

529
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:17,437
So either way tomorrow, come back home a bit earlier. All right?

530
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:19,257
I'm busy.

531
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:24,277
But this is a favor from your lovely big brother.

532
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,607
There's no one around here to see.

533
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:30,467
You don't have to pretend to be such a good big brother.

534
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:32,277
I don't need that.

535
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:35,087
But if you want to be a good father,

536
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:36,817
do it elsewhere.

537
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:38,917
Not here.

538
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:45,797
I'm already a good father.

539
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:48,647
If you don't believe it, try asking Nong Phu then.

540
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:54,617
Anyway, about tomorrow, just try to come back early then.

541
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:56,197
All right?

542
00:35:56,837 --> 00:36:00,147
PhuPha is a love that's strong and solid,

543
00:36:00,147 --> 00:36:02,817
that the father gives to someone.

544
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:04,917
How do you feel about that?

545
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:09,147
That you have to lie to both your child and your wife without batting an eye.

546
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:12,687
So how am I supposed to feel then?

547
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:14,907
When I've said the truth.

548
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:20,487
Let's just say that you'll come back early and not forget our plans.

549
00:36:22,287 --> 00:36:24,167
Do you know what?

550
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:27,717
Even if you can fool the whole world,

551
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:30,477
there will never be a day where you can fool me again.

552
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:53,507
I can really trust your words, right?

553
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:13,347
Ai'Pond, keep it down. I'm trying to study.

554
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:15,487
What's with you?

555
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:31,977
Fuck, this is so damn funny.

556
00:37:31,977 --> 00:37:34,677
Pond, you asshole!

557
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:36,707
What? Did you say something?

558
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,007
I already had earbuds in. See?

559
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,707
Do you even realize that you're about to have an exam?

560
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:45,687
Ai'Bow gave the exam schedule to me already. I know it already.

561
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:48,187
Are you not thinking of trying to study at all?

562
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,067
Would I make it if I do it right in front of the exam room?

563
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:55,987
Yeah... Yeah... I know that already...

564
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:58,837
I just want to finish this really quickly. Once I'm done, I'll study.

565
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:00,557
Whatever, that's your problem.

566
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:03,087
Don't get an F and come crying to me then.

567
00:38:03,087 --> 00:38:04,887
I keep kicking your ass, bastard.

568
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:08,307
Okay, okay. Look. I'm just going to watch it really quickly. My books are right here.

569
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:10,207
Once I finish this, I'll study right away.

570
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,007
Really quick.

571
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,697
Hello?

572
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:23,297
What? Going on a trip, dude?

573
00:38:23,297 --> 00:38:24,767
Yeah! I'll go! I'll go!

574
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,717
Don't we already go on a trip together every year?

575
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:29,357
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

576
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,837
Hey, of course Ai'Ae is coming. No need to ask.

577
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:35,457
Asshole Pond, you should say something and ask me first, you asshole.

578
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:38,157
So what do you say? Are you coming?

579
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:41,157
See? Of course, he's coming since he didn't answer.

580
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:43,157
For us, wherever we go, we go together.

581
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:46,287
Where and when? Just name it, buddy.

582
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:49,677
Sure, buddy. I'll see you.

583
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,407
Okay.

584
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:08,177
You should watch this. It's hilarious. You can watch it first.

585
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:21,932
Hey!

586
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:23,932
What are you playing at?

587
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:25,392
I was really startled!

588
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:27,312
I wasn't playing...

589
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:30,582
It's called "looking for an opportunity to touch your girlfriend."

590
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:32,712
Should I smack you just once?

591
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:36,262
I'm so scared, my sweetest lady.

592
00:39:36,262 --> 00:39:38,452
What sweetest lady?

593
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:41,422
So why are you here? Didn't we plan to meet at your building?

594
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,632
Well, I missed my girlfriend.

595
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,452
Can't I come see you?

596
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:47,152
Come on. I'll help carry your things.

597
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,992
What about Ae?

598
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,282
Come on.

599
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:53,432
Asking about another guy right in front of your boyfriend?

600
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,742
I'm clearly being cheated on.

601
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:57,992
Oops!!!

602
00:39:57,992 --> 00:40:00,082
Fine, I won't mess around anymore.

603
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:04,602
Ae? Way over there! Being stubborn somewhere over there.

604
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,052
What does that mean?

605
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:08,092
Want to know?

606
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:09,622
Go see for yourself.

607
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:11,752
Geez. Always so extra.

608
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:15,152
Of course. Let's go!

609
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:23,562
Ae, I can help you if you'd like.

610
00:40:23,562 --> 00:40:25,102
No.

611
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:28,282
Please let me help you.

612
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:31,022
Let me help, please. Please?

613
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:33,162
No means no.

614
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:35,102
Please.

615
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,862
Ai'Ae still won't let you tutor him, Ai'Pete?

616
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:44,462
Ae, just let your boyfriend help tutor you already.

617
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:47,412
You never heard it before? If you have a boy/girlfriend, you should use them to the fullest.

618
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:50,122
Was it to the fullest then?

619
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:53,292
With that mouth of yours, do you even want it? The cheat sheet?

620
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:56,232
Whether you do or not, it's already in my hands.

621
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:57,542
Is that so?

622
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:59,722
I give in. I give in...

623
00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:02,322
You should know just who is who.

624
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:06,232
So, Ae, you're going to have Pete tutor you, right?

625
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:08,692
I don't need to tutor you anymore, right?

626
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:13,722
Ae wanted Aim to tutor him?

627
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,952
Yes, Ae didn't tell you?

628
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,542
Ai'Ae wouldn't tell him. He's afraid of losing face.

629
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,402
Before, he would just say things up front.

630
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:27,132
But now, he's afraid to tell his boyfriend that he's stupid in English.

631
00:41:27,132 --> 00:41:29,532
I'm not worried about losing face.

632
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:36,342
Then, why don't you tell me the reason? Why is it that you're not letting the IC kid tutor you in English?

633
00:41:39,282 --> 00:41:41,092
You're always butting into every single one of their matters...

634
00:41:41,092 --> 00:41:42,392
Let's go already.

635
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:44,152
Then, why don't you go ahead and talk first?

636
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:46,082
We'll be leaving now.

637
00:41:46,082 --> 00:41:49,332
Where are we going? Are we going to the 7th Heaven, my love?

638
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:51,282
We're going to hell.

639
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:53,992
Geez. I was talking about 7 (Eleven).
(T/N: Thai just shorten and refer to 7 Eleven as just 7)

640
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:56,482
- What are you thinking?
- We're going to 7 Eleven. Do you want anything?

641
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:57,782
No, thank you.

642
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,282
I do. I want something.

643
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:04,162
- Just getting snacks and you're overthinking. How perverted.
- Be quiet...

644
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:12,642
The reason why I didn't want you to tutor me is because I saw that you had a lot of work. I just felt bad.

645
00:42:12,642 --> 00:42:15,462
But doesn't Aim have an exam, too?

646
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:17,992
Well, she's taking the same class.

647
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:22,792
But I asked Aim before. Aim is studying level 3. Ae, you're studying level 1.

648
00:42:23,812 --> 00:42:25,482
Come on. You don't need to tutor me.

649
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:26,742
Ae, you're being unreasonable.

650
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:29,142
Do you want Chompoo to come and tutor me then?

651
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,162
I'm...

652
00:42:40,922 --> 00:42:44,822
I'm sorry. I'm going to go to the bathroom now.

653
00:43:27,222 --> 00:43:30,552
Have Aim and Pond not come back yet, Ae?

654
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:32,852
Pete, look up.

655
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:37,062
Ae...

656
00:43:37,522 --> 00:43:39,902
Ae, you should go and study.

657
00:43:42,742 --> 00:43:44,082
I'm sorry.

658
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:46,632
Ae, what are you doing? Someone might see us.

659
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:48,452
Never mind them.

660
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:51,952
I'm really sorry.

661
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:54,502
I'm sorry for being the stupid one.

662
00:43:55,692 --> 00:43:59,522
That's okay. I understand.

663
00:44:00,242 --> 00:44:03,692
I... I won't ask for anything from you anymore.

664
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:06,492
You shut up and listen to me, all right?

665
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:09,442
I don't want you to see my lousy flaws.

666
00:44:10,402 --> 00:44:13,462
I also don't know why I've become someone like this.

667
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:19,112
Before, if I was stupid, I'd just admit I was stupid. If I was lousy, I'd admitted that I was lousy.

668
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:21,512
But after you...

669
00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:24,202
I really don't want you to see my flaws.

670
00:44:26,342 --> 00:44:28,732
I don't want to disappoint you.

671
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:32,822
I just want to be the best in your eyes.

672
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:41,862
But for me... Ae, you're already the best.

673
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:48,652
You don't need to praise me...

674
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:52,102
Let's go. We need to study.

675
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:54,862
Ae,

676
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:59,922
since I know already... Ae, won't you let me tutor you?

677
00:44:59,922 --> 00:45:01,522
Don't hope for it.

678
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:16,632
I'm sorry, ChaAim.

679
00:45:16,682 --> 00:45:18,922
English just doesn't really stick in my head.

680
00:45:18,922 --> 00:45:22,322
That's okay. At least you are trying.

681
00:45:22,322 --> 00:45:25,932
Unlike someone. He's about to have an exam, and he's still just sitting there playing with his phone...

682
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:29,342
Hey. What does the beach have to do with your exam?

683
00:45:29,342 --> 00:45:33,682
Come on, Aim. Traveling is more important than the exam.

684
00:45:33,682 --> 00:45:37,792
What I was going to say is, traveling is just as important as the exam.

685
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:41,162
But this time, our entire group of friends from high school is going.

686
00:45:41,162 --> 00:45:42,612
Just ask, Ai'Ae. Right?

687
00:45:42,612 --> 00:45:45,582
Don't ask me. I'll think about it after I finish the exam.

688
00:45:45,582 --> 00:45:47,482
Not siding with me... I'll remember this, dude...

689
00:45:47,482 --> 00:45:49,312
Who's the one that should remember?

690
00:45:50,422 --> 00:45:53,092
If this time around you end up with an F... we're over.

691
00:45:53,092 --> 00:45:55,732
Oh! I studying... I'm studying.

692
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:58,312
Fine, I'll study....

693
00:46:01,502 --> 00:46:04,442
Are you also going to the beach when the semester is over, Pete?

694
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:07,332
No. Ai'Pete's not going.

695
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:13,832
I... won't go then...

696
00:46:13,832 --> 00:46:18,452
Another thing is... I don't know Ae and Pond's friends either.

697
00:46:18,452 --> 00:46:21,692
It's not because I don't want you to go with me, Ai'Pete.

698
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:23,202
What the hell?

699
00:46:23,202 --> 00:46:24,882
You've got such a handsome boyfriend like this,

700
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,882
you should reveal him to our friends.

701
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:30,542
Having a handsome angel to be your wife.

702
00:46:30,562 --> 00:46:32,402
You should reveal him already.

703
00:46:32,402 --> 00:46:36,582
Why don't you give me three reasons why you won't let Ai'Pete go?

704
00:46:36,582 --> 00:46:38,052
Three reasons?

705
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:40,482
Ai'Sun, Ai'Sun, and Ai'Sun.

706
00:46:40,482 --> 00:46:42,202
Why?

707
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:44,302
I'll tell Aim myself.

708
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,352
You see, Ai'Sun is our high school friend

709
00:46:47,352 --> 00:46:49,022
And he's incredibly handsome.

710
00:46:49,022 --> 00:46:53,302
Handsome like... wherever he walks, everyone is always asking for his number or LINE account.

711
00:46:53,302 --> 00:46:56,392
And right now he's the Campus Moon of his university, too.

712
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:59,262
You don't want Ai Pete to meet a handsome guy, do you?

713
00:46:59,262 --> 00:47:01,542
Worried that you'll get cheated on, right?

714
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:04,092
Your mouth is really too much, Ai'Pond.

715
00:47:04,092 --> 00:47:06,702
So, Ae, do you not trust Pete?

716
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:10,332
I trust Pete.

717
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:13,242
But I don't trust Ai'Sun.

718
00:47:13,242 --> 00:47:15,802
It's not that Ai'Sun is going to take Ai'Pete...

719
00:47:15,802 --> 00:47:17,752
But I'm afraid he'll tease me and piss me off.

720
00:47:17,812 --> 00:47:23,642
So, Pete, if you were to meet someone more handsome than Ae, what would you do?

721
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:30,782
I wouldn't do anything. Because Ae is already the best for me.

722
00:47:51,612 --> 00:47:53,702
Ae?

723
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:57,012
Do you usually take out of town trips with your friends often?

724
00:47:57,012 --> 00:48:00,762
Well, every semester break. Ever since Grade 11.

725
00:48:00,762 --> 00:48:02,882
So it's just become a tradition.

726
00:48:02,882 --> 00:48:05,112
Why? Did you want to go, too?

727
00:48:05,112 --> 00:48:06,712
Not at all.

728
00:48:06,712 --> 00:48:13,352
I was just curious about how you are when you go somewhere with friends who aren't Pond, what you're like.

729
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,452
I'm just like this.

730
00:48:16,452 --> 00:48:18,732
All of my friends are assholes.

731
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,552
Foul-mouthed.

732
00:48:20,552 --> 00:48:23,542
When we're together, it's a big headache.

733
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:27,182
Right. If you're sleepy, you can just go in and sleep first.

734
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:28,942
I'll sleep out here tonight.

735
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,062
No.

736
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,012
Just let me sleep here.

737
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:40,522
Otherwise, I'll end up doing something more than sleeping.

738
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:52,732
Ae! Just keep studying. Don't look at me.

739
00:49:26,352 --> 00:49:29,612
Pete... Pete...

740
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:32,512
If you're sleepy, then go sleep.

741
00:49:35,812 --> 00:49:39,442
Did I fall asleep, Ae?

742
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:54,122
After I come back from the trip with Ai'Pond and the guys,

743
00:49:54,122 --> 00:49:56,482
should the two of us go on a trip?

744
00:49:57,792 --> 00:49:59,962
Ae, just the two of us?

745
00:49:59,962 --> 00:50:02,162
Yeah... You want to go?

746
00:50:02,162 --> 00:50:04,862
I'll go. I'll go for sure.

747
00:50:06,142 --> 00:50:08,582
But right now, you should go to sleep already.

748
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:10,592
And we'll discuss it tomorrow.

749
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:12,612
Okay.

750
00:50:21,502 --> 00:50:23,810
Sweet dreams, Ae.

He asked me for your phone number.

761
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:08,652
And... he also asked me where you parked your car.

762

Why should we be so stressed for?
