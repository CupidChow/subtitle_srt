26
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,993
That practice really wore me out.

27
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:57,888
I'm starving, too. Damn it.

28
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,388
We should skip it today.

29
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,229
Right.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,146
P'No!

31
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,109
P'No!

32
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:12,969
What the heck, Can?

33
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,823
Stop right there!

34
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:20,637
I know what you're up to, Ai'Good.

35
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:22,433
Sit here!

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,465
No... I'm hungry...

37
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:30,047
What does your hunger have to do with me?

38
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:33,872
What are you laughing at? Help me. He's not letting me go.

39
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:35,370
You said Can's your favorite.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,431
When did I say that?

41
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:43,295
P'Type, I'm hungry.

42
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,929
Right?

43
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,951
P'No! You're so mean.

44
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,959
Don't you know you're hurting my feelings?

45
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,633
See? P'No and P'Type

46
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,801
both of you broke my little heart.

47
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,091
You have to make it up by buying us dinner.

48
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,849
Let's go, Good. Dinner. In front of campus.

49
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,509
Stop! Stop, you two.

50
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,879
Who said we're buying you dinner?

51
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,523
And shut up, would you?

52
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:10,074
That's not a smooth trick at all.

53
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:12,480
There's no way you can coax me into dinner.

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,942
Don't be such a baby.

55
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:16,761
But I'm hungry. Do you know?

56
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:19,825
I'm attending practice because of your orders.

57
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,123
And now I'm starving.

58
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,425
You don't believe me, right?

59
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,570
P'Type, touch my stomach.

60
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,922
See? It's growling like a toilet flushing.

61
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,914
Gurgle-gurgle. Can't you hear?

62
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:33,225
You're taking his side now, aren't you?

63
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:38,108
Don't you feel sorry for poor little kids like us?

64
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,873
Buy me dinner, pretty please...

65
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,502
Hey. Buy him dinner.

66
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,833
Fine.

67
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,813
Yeah! Right, Good.

68
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:49,869
What shall we have?

69
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,159
Five-spice stewed pork legs are yummy.

70
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Fried rice from Jae Dao is good, too.

71
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,761
Or seafood Pad See Ew?
(T/N: stir-fried soy sauce noodles, with egg and meat.)

72
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:57,765
Lard Na is especially irresistible.
(T/N: Stir-fried wide rice noodles and either meat or tofu.)

73
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:59,232
Stone-oven pizza?

74
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:00,963
Crispy pork with basil?

75
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:02,324
Dim sum, of course.
(T/N: large range of small dishes served with tea)

76
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:05,283
Shabu-shabu? Barbeque?
(T/N: Shabu-shabu - a Japanese hotpot dish of thinly sliced meat and vegetables boiled in water and served with dipping sauces.)

77
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:07,999
Good, help me think of what I should eat tonight.

78
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,759
I can't decide.

79
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,685
I... want... to... have... oyster...

80
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,177
Right! Oyster omelet. Very good idea!

81
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:20,108
Whatever. That's the cheapest one.

82
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,919
Don't be such a cheap captain.

83
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,820
Yeah. You buy them dinner, then.

84
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:31,203
Can? What are you looking at?

85
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,903
I'm just curious.

86
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,905
He was frowning as if tomorrow's doomsday.

87
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:38,316
We can choose to live our life.

88
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:40,129
Why isn't he happy about it?

89
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,491
My mom said, "We should be optimistic."

90
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:47,025
Look at me. Nothing can stress me out.

91
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,047
Chill-chill!

92
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:53,680
Damn. His philosophy gives me a headache.

93
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,243
Let's go. Do you still want dinner?

94
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:59,263
Move your asses. Hurry up.

95
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:02,558
Here, listen to me.

96
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:05,291
"Chill" and "no brain" has no difference for you.

97
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,443
Aren't you coming?

98
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:09,533
Good, were they insulting me?

99
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,102
No...

100
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:14,933
If not, why are you nodding? Hurry up! Dinner!

101
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,719
Before they change their minds!

102
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,749
Call him.

103
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,390
No.

104
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,591
Call him.

105
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,783
No!

106
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,182
- Call him!
- No!

107
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:30,562
- I said, call him!
- No!

108
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:40,456
You said you wanted Nim's phone number.

109
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,031
You know this damn well.

110
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:46,660
If you want her number.

111
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,063
What do you have to do?

112
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:52,372
Fine.

113
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:57,281
Seriously, what's so good about my brother

114
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:00,438
to make you spend this much effort?

115
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:03,458
He's good for me. That's enough.

116
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,823
Work your magic faster.

117
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,286
Can't you see I'm calling him?

118
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:12,767
P'No! What are you doing?

119
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,759
Having dinner.

120
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,431
Dinner? With whom?

121
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:18,745
Type, of course. And two other freshmen.

122
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,550
Which freshmen?

123
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,112
Hold on, are they girls?

124
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:24,230
Come on!

125
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,950
Which girls would want to have dinner with your brother?

126
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:28,864
I'm not as handsome as you.

127
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:30,442
Why do you want to know, anyway?

128
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,769
You're not my wife, you jerk!

129
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:35,317
Never mind! Just curious.

130
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:38,124
Can't I be worried about my older brother?

131
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:42,416
Just in case someone kidnaps you because you look dumb and slow.

132
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,460
Shut up.

133
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,910
I'm hanging up now, asshole.

134
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:47,042
I'll call you when I go back.

135
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:50,592
Happy now?

136
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:52,192
Yeah.

137
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:57,783
Your brother's strange. He's checking up on you lately.

138
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,600
Jealous much?

139
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:03,022
I have a lovely little brother who cares about his wonderful brother.

140
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:06,024
Why should I be jealous? My boyfriend has my back.

141
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,531
But you're right. Nic is acting weird lately.

142
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:13,497
He always calls to check where I am or who I'm with.

143
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:15,131
More often than my mom.

144
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:17,221
He might be telling someone else.

145
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:20,109
Who? My parents?

146
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:21,716
No way.

147
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:25,955
I went home the next morning. They said nothing. They didn't even call me.

148
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:30,020
Or...

149
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:34,013
Technic has...

150
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:35,887
Has?

151
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,288
A crush on P'Techno?

152
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:42,043
Such a waste of my time!

153
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:46,954
Here, you. Think with this head, not with the other head. Understand?

154
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:49,769
The other head?

155
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,523
Yuck! P'No, you pervert!

156
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:55,064
What "other head?" I lost my appetite.

157
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,452
Such a pervert.

158
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:59,910
How can you say that? Yuck!

159
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:10,006
Never knew a Koon-Chai like you could dress improperly.

160
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,893
Hey, I'm joking.

161
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:13,514
You look good. No matter what.

162
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,815
Let's go. My friends are waiting.

163
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:20,483
Ae is... very trendy-looking.

164
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:25,870
You're the only one who says stuff like this.

165
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:31,050
Right. The next time you wait for me, find a brighter spot.

166
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,550
It's dangerous to wait in the dark.

167
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:35,571
Somebody might attack you.

168
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,873
Come on. Let's have dinner.

169
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,881
When is Ae coming?

170
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:47,941
What is he doing?

171
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:50,546
There.

172
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:51,860
Is he the IC kid you mentioned?

173
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,525
- Where?
- Damn!

174
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,503
Freaking handsome.

175
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,757
Pond. Don't sit close to him. You'll look ugly.

176
00:08:57,757 --> 00:09:01,020
No way. A handsome guy like me. Not a chance.

177
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,870
- Even Ae looks better than you.
- What?

178
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:06,031
No. I'm just hungry.

179
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:14,808
You, why are you so handsome?

180
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:18,772
Do you have a girlfriend yet? I'm single.

181
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,376
Completely available.

182
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,136
Hey, Ping.

183
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:24,342
Why are you befriending this "Borny?"

184
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:27,293
"Borny?" What the heck is "Borny?"

185
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:29,985
"Bitchy" plus "horny!"

186
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:33,485
You jerk! Don't call me "Bitchy and Horny."

187
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,968
It's the description of your species. You shouldn't even ask.

188
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:38,485
I'm not that bad.

189
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:42,565
Actually, I'm sweet, polite, adorable,

190
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:46,325
and once again, available!

191
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:47,894
Bow, Shut it.

192
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:49,909
You are so unacceptable now.

193
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,954
What? Why? I want him.

194
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,775
Has anybody told you?

195
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,765
You are a lady, so you should act like one.

196
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,805
No one. My mom once said:

197
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:00,525
"You snooze, you lose!"

198
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:03,190
Because a real gentleman is hard to find these days.

199
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,054
And there are so many females.

200
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:06,955
If I don't adjust.

201
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:09,875
I will be hung up there alone forever...

202
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,045
So, I can't lose.

203
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:15,635
I will never let you three meet my niece.

204
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:18,634
Excuse me! We'd like to order.

205
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:22,458
Dry egg noodles with BBQ pork,

206
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,605
two servings of wontons and a cup of soup, please.

207
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:30,146
There! You order for him, how sweet...

208
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:31,318
Nosy, you jerk!

209
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,695
Damn! Nosy! Jerk!

210
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:37,445
Can't you think of something else to call me?

211
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:39,125
The rest of you? Order or leave?

212
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,725
Hurry up! I'm busy.

213
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:43,782
I'll have rice noodle soup.

214
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:46,095
Vegetable soup for me.

215
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,655
What should I order? Help.

216
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:48,855
What?

217
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:50,755
- The same with him.
- Yes, the same.

218
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:53,125
- The same?
- I'll have two.

219
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,905
You. Two dry-E-B-1-special with soup.

220
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:57,875
Why's she so mad?

221
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,164
2-R-soup and Veg?

222
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,950
Yes, veg. Yes.

223
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,295
One Veg.

224
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,324
A few minutes, please. Coming soon.

225
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:16,795
Oops! I'm sorry.

226
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:20,061
Sit closer. Stay away.

227
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,845
Thanks.

228
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:27,574
- Pond.
- Hmm?

229
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:30,025
I'm not going back to the room.

230
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:31,635
There.

231
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:33,906
Are you two going to...

232
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:35,245
Why is that all you think of?

233
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:36,435
I'm going home.

234
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:38,495
Don't be a pervert.

235
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,306
What are you laughing at?

236
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:46,660
Why? Can't we laugh?

237
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:59,205
Does this look yummy for you?

238
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:04,680
See? She's scarier than me.

239
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,155
- Here, Pete.
- Thank you.

240
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:10,775
See? You prepare those only for Pete. What about us?

241
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,600
You have your own hands. Use them.

242
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,654
Bow can help herself. Ping, too.

243
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,101
But Pete has hands, too.

244
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:19,100
Yet you still do it for him.

245
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,735
What's going on between you two? Tell me.

246
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,345
I'm tired of being nosy.

247
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:24,825
Stop it, then, idiot.

248
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:28,855
How can I, about your story? It's so much fun.

249
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:32,835
Right. Pete, you are sweating.

250
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,809
I have a handkerchief. Here.

251
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,710
That's okay. I'm really okay.

252
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,835
Err...

253
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,375
Thank you.

254
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,605
- Sorry, if you're disgusted.
- Not at all.

255
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:47,835
Who wants a handkerchief? Use your hand like this.

256
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:50,145
- Ae...
- Yikes! Dirty!

257
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,455
Did I ever say I'm clean?

258
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,367
What are you laughing at?

259
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:58,785
Nothing. I understand Pond now. He said you're busy taking care of an IC.

260
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:01,058
Don't tell me you believe what he says.

261
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:02,479
I'm just saying. Right, Pond?

262
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:05,864
Told you. You can ask me anything.

263
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:10,005
I know everything. I'm Google Man. Ask me anything.

264
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:12,622
Hold on.

265
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,492
Your arm.

266
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:18,415
Take it away from him. Sitting too close, too.

267
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:21,355
Don't let him touch you. He's dirty.

268
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,505
Right, you're so clean.

269
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:25,060
Go ahead. I have one here.

270
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,690
Right. You have so many left. I'll help you.

271
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,511
Okay.

272
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:34,855
Take his fish ball, Bow.

273
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:37,785
- Are you full?
- Yes, I am.

274
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:40,875
Told you, that noodle shop was good.

275
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:43,835
I agree with you.

276
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,281
I should leave now, Ae.

277
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:51,276
Thanks for walking me here.

278
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:58,695
Pete.

279
00:13:58,695 --> 00:13:59,507
Yes?

280
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:01,718
Am I annoying you?

281
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:04,535
No. Why do you think so?

282
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:09,025
I just think I'm meddling too much in your life.

283
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:10,781
You never asked for it.

284
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,256
But I'm jumping right into your life.

285
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:16,377
I might be doing too much and annoying you.

286
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:19,605
I never think like that really, Ae.

287
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,530
In fact,

288
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,165
I should be thanking you because I always need your help.

289
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,095
And I'm worried you might be annoyed.

290
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:34,343
Because of a person like me.

291
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,365
So we're both concerned for each other.

292
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,359
That's a relief.

293
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,903
You are not annoyed by me, and vice versa.

294
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,961
Go home.

295
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,495
Thanks.

296
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:58,325
Good night, Koon-Chai.

297
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,475
Good night, Ae.

00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:46,088
When did you return home last night?

315
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,076
Quite late, Mom.

316
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:51,165
Really late. Yim had to go to bed before you came home.

317
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:53,205
Come here.

318
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:55,045
Hey, Ae.

319
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,191
Hello.

320
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,005
Have you greeted Uncle Ae yet?

321
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:00,928
Say, "Hello."

322
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:04,699
I haven't come home for weeks. Did you miss me?

323
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,475
Give me a kiss.

324
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:09,784
She's still mad at you.

325
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:13,590
She waited for you last night.

326
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,101
If you don't let Uncle Ae kiss you, I'll kiss someone else.

327
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,284
I found someone with softer cheeks than you.

328
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:20,695
Wait, what?

329
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:23,703
Hold on. Stand up here now, Ae. Hold on.

330
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:26,980
You were in college for a few months, and you already found someone to kiss?

331
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,740
No, just a friend.

332
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,971
What? A friend?

333
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:33,396
- To touch and kiss on the cheeks?
- Right.

334
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,198
- Is it strange, P'Nat?
- What?

335
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:38,958
It's normal for your generation, but nobody did that when we were young.

336
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,926
Seriously? Who lets you touch their cheeks easily like that?

337
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:44,065
So true. So true.

338
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:46,578
If he said it's not strange we have to talk.

339
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:49,458
The monk's here.

340
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,500
Please.

341
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,206
Please.

342
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:53,807
Here.

343
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,465
Go ahead, sweetheart.

344
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,095
Put this in that black bowl.

345
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:59,555
Spread the good deed.

346
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,869
Like this.

347
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:05,005
Put these in there.

348
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:09,135
Put in there, sweetie. Yes, like that.

349
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:15,380
Come here, sweetie. Sit here with Daddy.

350
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,470
Sit properly.

351
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:24,400
(The monk is chanting and blessing)

352
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,794
(The monk is chanting and blessing)

353
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:32,575
(The monk is chanting and blessing)

354
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:35,348
Did you say your blessings?

355
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,465
Good job, sweetie.

356
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,770
Look after her for a while, would you?

357
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,643
Sure, Mom.

358
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:44,225
I have to prepare food in the kitchen.

359
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,274
Look after your niece.

360
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:49,485
You weren't home for weeks. Have fun with her.

361
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:51,267
Stay with your uncle!

362
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,674
I missed you so much.

363
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,675
Come and sit here.

364
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:59,593
If I kiss a guy's cheeks, is it weird, Nong Yim?

365
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:00,778
Of course.

366
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:03,888
Do you really know what we're talking about?

367
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:06,852
Uncle Ae, Nong Yim missed you so much.

368
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:10,056
Uncle Ae missed Nong Yim, too.

369
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:14,415
My friend's cheeks are soft like yours.

370
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:17,105
Light skin, red lips.

371
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:19,565
Soft cheeks, too.

372
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:22,442
Actually, I miss him, too.

373
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:26,335
Shall we call him now?

374
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:02,945
Hello?

375
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:05,812
Hey. Did you wake up?
(T/N: Ae always uses 'mung' (you, informal) with Pete)

376
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:08,119
Uncle Ae is speaking impolitely. I'll tell Daddy.

377
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,794
Who's that, Ae?

378
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:11,238
My niece.

379
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:13,663
Hold on. I'll turn the camera on.

380
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,095
Done.

381
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:19,584
Turn your camera on.

382
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,852
I shouldn't.

383
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:24,525
I haven't showered yet.

384
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:25,930
Okay, never mind.

385
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,574
This is Nong Yim, my niece.

386
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:29,275
Nong Yim, say hi.

387
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:34,064
Again, Uncle Ae is impolite.
Mommy said no gu (I) or mung (you).

388
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,587
What should I do? I'm so sorry.

389
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:40,198
Slap your mouth. I'll slap it for you. Here!

390
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:41,975
What are you laughing at?

391
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,226
Again, Uncle Ae is speaking impolitely.

392
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:48,686
Sorry, I'm sorry. Uncle Ae is sorry.

393
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:53,934
Nong Yim, I'm talking to my friend.

394
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:58,070
Hello. My name is Yim, the daughter of Nat and Oh.

395
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,561
Hello. My name is Pete.

396
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,627
Pete.

397
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:05,194
No. you can't just call his name. He's my friend.

398
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:06,834
You have to call him Uncle Pete.

399
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,635
Uncle Pete,

400
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,516
Uncle Ae said he misses Uncle Pete.

401
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:12,396
Hey!

402
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,735
Uncle Ae misses Uncle Pete a lot.

403
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:17,856
Nong Yim, when did I say that?

404
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:20,487
Before we called him.

405
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,555
I'm hanging up now.

406
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:30,223
Ae...

407
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:32,555
misses me.

408
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:39,450
- Such a tattletale, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

409
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,814
Yes, you are!

410
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:43,655
Where are you going?

411
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:46,746
You are, you are.

412
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,955
Mommy! Uncle Ae is tickling me.

413
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:08,145
Hey. What's up?

414
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:12,055
Ae, can I join you for breakfast today?

415
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:15,032
Of course. I'll take a shower and pick you up.

416
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:16,673
Wait for me in the parking lot.

417
00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:20,500
Okay. See you.

418
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:31,895
Nong Pete!

419
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:33,895
Nong Pete!

420
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,095
Hello, Er... P'...

421
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:37,396
Money!

422
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:39,720
Or you can call me P'Money,

423
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,768
Beautiful Lady, or Sis is fine, too.

424
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:46,047
Oh, I see. P'Money, what can I do for you?

425
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:49,365
Oh, for me? What do you want to do with me?

426
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:51,049
I'm shy, you know!

427
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:52,242
Oh.

428
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:55,765
Oh, I'm sorry. I have something to tell you.

429
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:58,456
Do you have some time to talk?

430
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:00,217
What are you doing to Pete?

431
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:03,191
What are you doing? Why did you push me?

432
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:06,569
I'm a lady. Can't you see?

433
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh. A KaToey.
(T/N: KaToy: lady boy.)

434
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,148
Right, am I a ladyboy on your mom's head?

435
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:12,737
I'm so sorry.

436
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:15,445
I thought you were bullying him.

437
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:21,405
Nong Pete, I'll ask you directly then.

438
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:24,949
I want you to join our practice every Thursday night.

439
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,949
So, I'm here to ask you if you would like to join us.

440
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:31,964
But I never thought there would be a barbarian,

441
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:35,975
coming to push me and attack me like this.

442
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:39,492
Since your small, stocky friend hurt me,

443
00:23:39,492 --> 00:23:41,812
I will use my seniority privilege to

444
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:45,752
force you to join the cheering practice.

445
00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:47,249
That's a dictatorship!

446
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:48,490
That's okay, Ae.

447
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,181
Actually, I wanted to join in the first place.

448
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,420
Oh, my god!

449
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:55,275
Thanks, P'Money, for asking in person.

450
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:57,636
I'm so glad to hear that.

451
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,186
I'll see you on Thursday.

452
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,354
- I have to go now.
- Sure.

453
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:04,143
I have to spread this good news to those coward girls,

454
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,814
who want a guy but never try to approach.

455
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:11,286
Just thinking about their envious faces is enough for my satisfaction!

456
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:12,879
- Got to go.
- Bye.

457
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:14,725
See you.

458
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:19,655
Who names their child "Money?"

459
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:22,315
If she doesn't have that level of confidence, she can't pull that name off.

460
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:23,575
Come on, Ae.

461
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,473
P'Money is a really nice person.

462
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:27,475
I'm not criticizing her.

463
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:29,735
- Let's have breakfast.
- Sure.

464
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:34,455
Thursday, right?

465
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:51,598
If you don't want to sit here,

466
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:52,945
you can sit somewhere else.

467
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:55,155
It's not like that, Tin.

468
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:07,101
What's wrong?

469
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:10,104
Still mad at me for saying bad things about those Thai programs?

470
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:13,645
I don't think we should talk about this.

471
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,515
Fine.

472
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,875
No matter what, I'll never change my mind about them.

473
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:25,165
But someday, someone might change your mind.

474
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:27,465
Never.

475
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:30,605
You don't know the future.

476
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:33,855
I write my own future.

477
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:40,000
Good afternoon class. How are you all today?

478
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,358
Today we'll be doing something really basic in business. Okay?

479
00:25:43,358 --> 00:25:45,756
We'll be learning about the differences between...

480
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:48,437
private limited company, public limited company,

481
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:50,244
sole trader, and partnership.

482
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:51,673
Okay? So...

483
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:55,611
For sole trader, it is the business that has a single owner.

484
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:59,555
For partnership, it has to be more than one owner.

485
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:12,228
Why don't you tell him you love your own brother?

486
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:14,971
How can I say that?

487
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:18,098
You guys might have forgotten...

488
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:20,952
Tar and I...

489
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:25,105
We're brothers.

490
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:32,379
[Tar: Tum, can I call you tonight?]

491
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,455
Nong Pete!

492
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:50,515
Yes?

493
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:53,178
If you can't remember the song, you can tell me.

494
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,088
I'll give you a private session.

495
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,535
Thank you very much, P'Money.

496
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,829
Nong Pete! Nong Pete!

497
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,545
Yes?

498
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:06,033
Well, calling you "Nong Pete" isn't convenient for me.

499
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:09,584
Can I call you "Honey" instead?

500
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:12,155
There she goes again.

501
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:16,381
Damn, damn, damn!

502
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:17,518
So inappropriate.

503
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:19,405
Mine is better.

504
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:23,716
Oh dear, Honey! I want you to be my hubby!

505
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:25,915
As cheesy as my line. Blech!

506
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:29,105
I want to use it on him. What's wrong with that?

507
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,384
Unlike you, saving him for yourself.

508
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:35,305
It's hard to find a handsome guy now. You better share him with the public.

509
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:36,915
He's right, Sis.

510
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:41,219
Err, well... I have to leave now.

511
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,310
What? Why's that?

512
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:43,324
See you.

513
00:27:43,324 --> 00:27:44,754
See you.

514
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:46,618
- We haven't talked today.
- See you.

515
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:48,328
See you.

516
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:51,014
It's because of you two. See?

517
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:53,059
He's leaving now.

518
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,747
What? You can't blame us.

519
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:58,518
He left because he's scared of you.

520
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,083
Scared of me?

521
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,233
I have nothing to be scared of.

522
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:05,749
Are all the mirrors at your house broken?

523
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:16,725
I guess the Engineering team is practicing late today.

524
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,528
You!

525
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:40,066
P'Trump, what do you want from me?

526
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,509
Don't play dumb!

527
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:44,530
I want money.

528
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,030
No.

529
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,040
No?

530
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:55,829
Nong Pete.

531
00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:00,536
Don't lie to me, sweetheart.

532
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:11,843
I really don't have any.

533
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:17,831
Oh, please.

534
00:29:17,831 --> 00:29:20,084
I'm sorry for what happened between us.

535
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,785
I really need that money.

536
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:26,870
Please. I'll stop bothering you.

537
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,260
Please, Pete.

538
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,334
You already took too much from me.

539
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,814
I don't have any more for you.

540
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,274
200,000 baht!
 (T/N: $6,400)

541
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,292
Only 200,000 baht, Pete!

542
00:29:39,293 --> 00:29:40,405
Please!

543
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,350
- I don't have any.
- The last 200,000 baht!

544
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,250
- Give it to me.
- I don't have any.

545
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,292
- Please.
- I don't have any.

546
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:48,453
Really. I don't have any.

547
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,667
I don't believe you!

548
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,707
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

549
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:55,485
It's my family's money,

550
00:29:55,486 --> 00:29:56,612
but I don't have any.

551
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:58,813
I know you have some in your savings account!

552
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,060
No... No...

553
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:05,653
Are you going to give it or not? Huh?

554
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:06,750
Give it to me!

555
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,250
No.

556
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,970
No?

557
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,709
Fine!

558
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:27,403
Give me the money!

559
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,213
Give me the money!

560
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,640
Give me the money!

561
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:40,116
Give it to me!

562
00:30:41,396 --> 00:30:43,496
Give me the money!

563
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,070
Give me the money!

564
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:01,743
Give it to me!

565
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:23,448
You said you don't have money!

566
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,300
But what's this?

567
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,890
This too.

568
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,730
Don't you dare tell the police!

569
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,272
If you don't want to see me again in your life.

570
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:48,156
Hear me?

571
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:23,696
Ai'Ping, where is Ai'Bow?

572
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:25,997
Why isn't she joining the practice today?

573
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:27,488
Why are you asking me?

574
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,869
She can't be far from here, hunting some handsome guys nearby.

575
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:33,555
Damn, I don't know how many she has eaten. She's like this fat.

576
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:34,456
Right, I forgot.

577
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,392
If she ate more, she might burst.

578
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:37,613
True.

579
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,830
Talking about eating makes me hungry.

580
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,340
- Let's grab a bite.
- Sure.

581
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,289
- Same place.
- You got it.

582
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:46,439
- Let's go.
- Ae! Are you coming?

583
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,801
Go ahead. I'm not going.

584
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,276
What's the matter now?

585
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:51,139
Shut up, asshole.

586
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,560
Scolding me again.

587
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Fine, go wherever you want to go.

588
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,548
- See you at the dorm.
- See you.

589
00:32:56,548 --> 00:32:58,496
He's not even listening to us.

590
00:32:58,496 --> 00:33:01,390
Hold on. It's raining.

591
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,892
How can we go? Who are you standing with?

592
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:06,061
You, of course. Who else is here?

593
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:07,499
I have my magic bag here.

594
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,850
What's in that bag?

595
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,240
It's raining. Hurry.

596
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
Ta-da!

597
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:14,579
- Your magic?
- Yeah.

598
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:16,810
- Why?
- Just an umbrella.

599
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,729
And how's the weather now?

600
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:19,690
Raining.

601
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,136
What's the umbrella for?

602
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:22,380
Blocking the sunlight?

603
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,770
Whatever. It's the rain for me. I'm leaving.

604
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,770
Wait for me!

605
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,230
Hello, Can.

606
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,530
I can't speak right now.

607
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,960
Ae, I have something to tell you.

608
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,970
What's the matter? Hurry up.

609
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,430
Will you be mad at me if I ask you this?

610
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,153
Well, did you just beat up an IC kid?

611
00:34:03,153 --> 00:34:05,295
I'm at the IC Building.

612
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:07,578
Someone here got beaten up badly.

613
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,798
He keeps repeating "Ae, Engineering."

614
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,140
Pete!

615
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,950
Who is Pete?

616
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,607
Hey, Can. Look after him for me.

617
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:17,896
Don't leave him there.

618
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,196
I'll be there as soon as I can.

619
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:32,158
Are you okay?

620
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:48,623
Pete's over there.

621
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:53,236
Pete?

622
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:54,929
Pete!

623
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,790
Pete.

624
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:03,753
Are you okay?

625
00:35:10,126 --> 00:35:11,916
Are you all right?

626
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:22,389
I'm here. No need to be scared now.

627
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:25,551
No one can harm you anymore.

628
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,233
Are you okay?

629
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:29,633
Pete?

630
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:32,556
Why don't you tell me?

631
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:35,200
Why don't you tell me?

632
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,590
You'll be all right.

633
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,670
I'm right here.

634
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,810
Don't be scared anymore.

635
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:28,940
Hey, Tar!

636
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,884
How are you? How have you been?

637
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,316
Is it cold yet?

638
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:34,504
Are you done with your exams?

639
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:37,690
You look skinnier. Skipping meals again?

640
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,170
Don't do that. Don't make me worry about you.

641
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,090
Okay...

642
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,995
P'Tum! One at a time I can't answer them all at once.

643
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:48,490
I'm sorry. It's been a while since we've talked.

644
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,180
Mmm... Sorry.

645
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,229
I've been quite busy with my classes.

646
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,740
That's okay. I understand.

647
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,230
I just want to let you know...

648
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:06,740
I miss you.

649
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,640
Okay.

650
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,990
Brother, this little brother rogers that.

651
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:18,544
What's the special occasion today?

652
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,690
Right. I called because

653
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,500
I want to know if you want any special gifts from here,

654
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,540
So I can buy them. Please ask Dad and Mom, too.

655
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,893
I'll ask them for you. But for me...

656
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,790
I don't want anything.

657
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,500
Having you back home is good enough.

658
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,470
Okay.

659
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:47,340
Well... I'll hang up now.

660
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,070
In Thailand, I should be saying "Good night," right?

661
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,080
Mm-hmm.

662
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,730
Good night, Tum.

663
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,500
You, too.

664
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,879
I'm sorry, Tum.

665
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:27,070
Sorry for making you worry all the time.

666
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,170
I'm truly sorry.

667
00:38:56,236 --> 00:38:57,500
I'm sorry.

668
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,160
Ae, why do you have to apologize?

669
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:04,977
I'm sorry about...

670
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:08,473
I promised to look after you.

671
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:11,742
To protect you.

672
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,450
But I was too late.

673
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:18,230
I'm sorry this happened to you.

674
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:23,640
No. You don't need to apologize.

675
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,960
I should be the one who should apologize.

676
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,123
I always cause you trouble.

677
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,790
Why? Do you think I'm dirty?

678
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,949
No.

679
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:55,382
I just think...

680
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:57,860
This is so you.

681
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,527
So me? How's that?

682
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,431
Well...

683
00:40:03,512 --> 00:40:09,190
You never use a napkin or a handkerchief.

684
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,270
You can smile now.

685
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,908
That's a relief.

686
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:16,130
Yes.

687
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,510
What happened today?

688
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,950
Can you tell me what happened?

689
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:29,408
Right. Where's your phone?

690
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:31,303
Why did you turn it off?

691
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:35,800
He took my phone.

692
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,630
What?

693
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:42,939
Don't tell me he took your watch, too?

694
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:44,040
What else did he do?

695
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,210
Why were you on the ground like that?

696
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,910
It's okay, Ae.

697
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,910
I was just shocked.

698
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,310
Tell me what he did to you.

699
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:58,050
He just kicked and punched me.

700
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,930
Pete, you need to report this to the police.

701
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,814
No, Ae, please. I don't want to.

702
00:41:02,815 --> 00:41:06,541
Pete, that bastard did this to you. You need to report it.

703
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:10,300
That scumbag needs to stay in jail.

704
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,660
It's okay, Ae. Just think of it as an accident.

705
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,870
Accident?

706
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,680
I don't know how much he took from you.

707
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:21,300
But I can't let him do this to you.

708
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,656
No.

709
00:41:22,656 --> 00:41:24,200
Please don't, Ae.

710
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,510
Please don't tell the police.

711
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:41,870
I forgot it's not my business.

712
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:46,190
If you still love him, that's not my business, either.

713
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,450
No, Ae. I don't love him anymore.

714
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,256
Then why don't you tell the police?

715
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:55,040
Because this isn't about him.

716
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,990
It's because of... my family.

717
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,802
I'm worried about my mother.

718
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:04,713
I don't want her to know about this and worry about me.

719
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:07,796
I beg you, Ae.

720
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,839
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:16,457 --> 00:42:18,505
I was angry.

722
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,312
I thought you still loved him.

723
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:24,852
No. Not anymore.

724
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:26,833
Never.

725
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,145
Okay. I believe you.

726
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,370
Call your mom.

727
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:43,262
And tell her you'll sleep here,

728
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:45,593
so you don't make her worry.

729
00:42:46,923 --> 00:42:49,489
Thank you, Ae.

730
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:56,650
Don't cry, Pete.

Do you think it's possible I suddenly got aroused?
