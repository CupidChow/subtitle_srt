What's with you?

27
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:29,559
Ai'Ley, you gotta help your big brother!

28
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:33,889
Geez! Let go! Let go! This is so gross! You're so annoying!

29
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,889
Ai'Ley, help your brother, please...

30
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:40,919
Geez! Let go! You stink!

31
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,289
You got into an argument with someone and lost again, didn't you?

32
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,049
I'm not helping you.

33
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,069
And you stink, too.

34
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,539
If I had fought with someone, I wouldn't be like this.

35
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,759
But this...! Your older brother is losing it, you know!

36
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,159
You're my little sister, so you're supposed to comfort me!

37
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,229
Comfort me, please!

38
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:03,139
Comfort me a bit...

39
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,829
Come on...

40
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,609
Eat this and calm yourself down.

41
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:09,319
I'm going to watch my series!

42
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,609
How annoying.

43
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,329
Just sucking on one lollipop...

44
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:16,769
Isn't going to help me at all.

45
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,449
Chupa Chups!

46
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,500
Chup!!!
 (T/N: Chup sounds like "kiss" in Thai)

47
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:38,039
What the heck is with him??

48
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,579
I only have one older brother, but he's not all there...

49
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,579
So handsome.

50
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:02,769
This isn't what you'd call a kiss, right?!

51
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:11,709
Ai'Tin, why the hell did you kiss me?

52
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:17,489
My mouth was still a virgin! It was still a virgin!

53
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,139
No, not to him, Ai'Can.

54
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,680
I was going to save these lips for a beautiful girl with big boobs only.

55
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,659
Go away!

56
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:30,369
Ai'Tin, you jerk!

57
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,979
It still has his scent.

58
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:53,411
Next time, just stop being all talk.

59
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:10,889
So deluded.

60
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,669
Love is just nonsense. It's all in your head.

61
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:42,133
Good morning, Tin.

62
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:52,242
Tin, did you have something to say?

63
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:55,184
You still haven't answered my question.

64
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:57,695
Answer what question?

65
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:06,293
I thought you were joking with me.

66
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:09,974
I never do anything as a joke.

67
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:12,574
Let me ask you one more time.

68
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:14,694
Wouldn't it be better to be with me?

69
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:18,462
I don't understand what you're saying, Tin.

70
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,521
I don't see how it's difficult to understand.

71
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,161
What's even good about that Thai Program?

72
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:28,321
His status can't even compare to ours.

73
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,511
If you keep dating him, he'll eventually try and take all your money.

74
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:36,476
Like I said if you want to date a guy,

75
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,236
it's better if you date me.

76
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,959
I don't know how you see Ae.

77
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,859
But Ae isn't someone like that.

78
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:54,596
Ae doesn't see me as only money.

79
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:57,954
Ae has never leeched off me.

80
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:02,409
Rather, it's me that's a burden to Ae.

81
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:07,507
I don't know why or what made you think like that.

82
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:11,538
But not everyone sees only money.

83
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,488
Ae doesn't.

84
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:23,193
Tin, you might think that you're great at everything.

85
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:26,534
As for me,

86
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:30,380
many people might think that you're better than Ae.

87
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,550
But Ae is the best one for me.

88
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:37,402
No matter how people see him.

89
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:44,016
Have you been brainwashed?

90
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:47,037
No, I haven't been brainwashed.

91
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:53,064
I know... that you don't think that way.

92
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:55,766
Tin, you don't like me in that way.

93
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,964
"Liking" is just "suitability."

94
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,090
Whatever you might say, I won't change my mind.

95
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:10,082
So incurable.

96
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:11,437
Tin.

97
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,559
So are you joining the "Freshy games" with me or not? The seniors are asking already.

98
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,139
I think that... you alone are more than enough.

99
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,469
If someone like me joins, the other faculty will say that it's cheating.

100
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:48,189
(Spitting)
(T/N: Making a spitting sound is the Thai equivalent of yelling "Bullshit!")

101
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:50,809
Hey, Ai'Ae! Your spit is all over my drink!

102
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:51,769
Ai'Pond, seriously.

103
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:55,029
Geez! I'm not joining! Why would I join just to get tired?

104
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:58,429
How about I... do go-go dancing waiting for you on the side of the field, okay?

105
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:00,629
Ai'Pete, want to dance with me?

106
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:06,409
If you dance, Ai'Ae's spirit will definitely be lifted and popping for sure!

107
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:09,259
Pete.

108
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,139
Pete!

109
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,889
Is something wrong?

110
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,189
There's nothing wrong with me at all...

111
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,029
Ai'Ae, here you are.

112
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,339
The seniors are looking for you. It looks like they want to talk about the Freshy games.

113
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,559
It looks really urgent, too. You should hurry. They're sitting way over there.

114
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,467
Yeah... Sure... Sure...

115
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,297
Then I'll be back, all right?

116
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,289
Ai'Ae's gone now.

117
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,219
So I can be nosey.

118
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:40,269
Pete!

119
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,959
So... did you do it with Ai'Ae yet?

120
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:46,229
Why the hell did you smack my head?

121
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:47,379
I smacked it for Ai'Ae!

122
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,719
If you're going to be nosy about his stuff, then have some limits.

123
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,689
Don't be so nosy all the way to their kitchen!
(T/N: Home analogy to show he doesn't know boundaries)

124
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:54,869
You'll end up being hanged by the homeowner before you know it!  (T/N: Dude, Ae will kill you before you know it)

125
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:57,559
But without my help. They won't be able to do it.

126
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,659
I don't know anymore. And I didn't hear it either.

127
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:01,290
But if Ai'Ae asks,

128
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:04,139
I'll be the witness and tell him you said it.

129
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,919
I have to go. I have to help Ai'Bow check the list with the athletes' names.

130
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,919
Pete, don't listen to Ai'Pond too much.

131
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,539
See you.

132
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:16,549
If I had listened to his warnings, how would I have been such a Casanova?

133
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,609
Ai'Pete, have you done it with Ai'Ae yet?

134
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:23,809
What kind of question is that?

135
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:26,862
Hey! Where are you going? Pete!

136
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:28,082
Pete!!!

137
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:30,669
Wait for me!!!

138
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:33,379
Hey, are you really not going to tell me? I can help you, you know!

139
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,489
But I don't have anything to tell you.

140
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:39,159
Oh... Come on... You guys are so stingy!

141
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,209
P'Pond and P'Pete, hello.

142
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,019
- Hi.
- Hi.

143
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,319
Where is P'Ae?

144
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,869
Ai'Ae is being forced to talk with the seniors.

145
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,189
He's joining the competition for the Freshy games.

146
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:53,739
Anyway, where have you been? Lately, I haven't seen you at all.

147
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,739
- P'Ae is joining the Freshy games!?!?
- Yes.

148
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,465
Wow! Then I have to prepare an LED board,

149
00:10:57,465 --> 00:11:00,714
a banner, and pompoms to cheer him on!

150
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:03,729
That's enough. That's enough. Just shouting your cheers is enough for Ai'Ae.

151
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,179
Would you do that? It's a waste (of money).

152
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:09,059
Hey! No way! Not when P'Ae is going to look so cool!

153
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,429
And today, I didn't even get a chance to see P'Ae.

154
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:14,049
So then I'm going to head back and work on the banner instead.

155
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,979
Goodbye. Bye-bye...

156
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,529
Do you want me to help?

157
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:21,809
Pond... I'm not...

158
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,653
Hey, if you're late you'll miss out, you know.

159
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:27,053
There... There... There...

160
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,892
Hey, Pete.

161
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,432
Hi, Ae.

162
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:53,639
Pete, you forgot something.

163
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,310
I'm going to go get something really quick. All right, Ae?

164
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,377
Come on, follow me.

165
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:18,019
Ai'Ae, are you done yet?

166
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,739
What's the matter?

167
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,734
That guy? Ai'Pete's friend that Ai'Can hates?

168
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,759
Geez, dude.

169
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,679
Are all the IC kids good looking or something?

170
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:34,604
Or could it be...?

171
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,166
The reason why he has an issue with you is because...

172
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,519
Does he like Ai'Pete??

173
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,289
Ai'Pond, you asshole. Shut up.

174
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:43,974
Geez... I'm only warning you with good intentions.

175
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:46,249
There... Look over there...

176
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:49,659
They look so damn good together.

177
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,169
A softy like you?

178
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,339
You never go for it.

179
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,579
Be careful of dogs snatching him away.

180
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,805
Tomorrow, I'm going to host a porn party.

181
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:17,825
What the heck did you say?

182
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:21,325
Come on, dude... I just got something new.

183
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:24,205
The Uncensored Limited Edition one, dude!

184
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:26,120
They are like... Mmm...

185
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,215
Fucking yummy.

186
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,735
If you want to watch it, go ahead and watch it.

187
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,825
Just put headphones on.

188
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:36,205
Didn't you hear me? I said I'm hosting a party.

189
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:39,005
How could you expect me to watch it alone in silence??

190
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:41,515
Look. I've already invited the entire floor.

191
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,515
What the hell did you say?

192
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:46,825
Do you want to die or something?

193
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,575
If you host that stupid fucking party, I won't get to fucking sleep at all.

194
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:58,105
Then you... don't have to sleep...?

195
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,715
Want to play with us?

196
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:01,465
You fucker, Pond. This isn't funny.

197
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,495
I have to wake up early in the morning, too!

198
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:04,525
Oh come on, dude.

199
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,865
I just got something new.

200
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:11,645
And another thing, I sent the viewing invitations to all our friends on this floor already!

201
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:15,845
Aren't you the one who told me, that I shouldn't go back on my word?

202
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,665
Where do you expect me to sleep then?

203
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:22,495
You could...

204
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:26,215
go to sleep at your boyfriend's place.

205
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:31,335
Come on... Come on... Come on...

206
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:33,155
Go stay over at your boyfriend's.

207
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:36,215
That way you can use this opportunity to... unwrap some shrimp.

208
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:39,425
Or quickly do whatever you want.

209
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:44,235
If you are too slow, you'll lose out to that IC kid, dude.

210
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,505
I didn't really want to say it, you know

211
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:53,215
But that dude is really handsome, has a rich dad, and just maybe...

212
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:55,875
his might be bigger than yours, too.

213
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,535
A tiny one like yours.

214
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,115
If you don't quickly make a move, you won't get to eat him!

215
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:03,135
You asshole.

216
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,845
You're going to hurt me and then just walk away?

217
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:07,625
So, what are you going to do?

218
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,935
Do I have any other choice?

219
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,775
I have to stay at Ai'Pete's place, of course.

220
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,555
Enjoy yourself, buddy.

221
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:41,855
- Fucking asshole, Ai'Pond.
- Ai'Ae! Calm down!

222
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:45,195
I meant well, dude! Hey! Listen to me, first!

223
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:47,465
I said that I meant well!

224
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,375
Thai men, we're proud and always carry condoms, of course!
(T/N: It's a slogan from a Thai campaign advocating being prepared)

225
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,915
What the fuck, you asshole!

226
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:55,045
You're going to use them. Believe me!

227
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:08,555
What's... with... you?

228
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,595
Yeah... right, Ai'Good?

229
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,665
Can, what's with you?

230
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:15,695
P'No!

231
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:17,155
What should I do?

232
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:18,445
I can't forget it!

233
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:20,505
Either way, I can't forget it, P'!

234
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:22,115
Calm down first... Calm down first...

235
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:23,555
What can't you forget this time?

236
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:27,875
Your lunch? Sausage? Grilled Liver? Roast Chicken?

237
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,495
Now tell me. Forget what?

238
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:33,415
I'm not being funny today.

239
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:38,875
Geez, dude... If you say it like that, I don't know how to follow up.

240
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:42,500
Here. I have something that will help you.

241
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,400
Here it is. A lollipop.

242
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,630
Take it. You need some sugar.

243
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,925
Seeing your face like this, I thought that a sloth could run a 4x100 relay race.

244
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,875
Chupa Chups again? I don't want it, P'!

245
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,495
I'm not kissing anyone.

246
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:58,005
I'm not eating or devouring it.

247
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:01,410
Take it far away. I don't want to see it.

248
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,405
What the hell is with you?

249
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:07,915
Fine, I'll leave then. Ai'Good, take care of Ai'Can for me.

250
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:09,575
I'm leaving now.

251
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:21,875
Ai Good, what should I do? I can't forget it!

252
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,095
Ai Good, answer me!

253
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,225
What's... wrong...? It's all right...

254
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:28,964
No! Answer me. The image is stuck in my head.

255
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:31,379
I can't forget it!

256
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:34,575
There... There...

257
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:47,918
Come on in, Ae.

258
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,868
What did you buy? There's so much.

259
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,045
I bought something for you. Did you eat yet?

260
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:55,235
I ate already.

261
00:18:57,065 --> 00:19:00,025
I'm sorry that I asked to stay over on such short notice.

262
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:03,975
It's not a problem, Ae. You can stay over anytime you want.

263
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,040
You shouldn't spoil me too much.

264
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,090
I'm starting to get used to it, you know?

265
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:11,682
But I want to spoil you.

266
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:19,598
- Ai'Pete.
- Yes.

267
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,978
What I'm asking might be repetitive,

268
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,605
but you're not thinking of anything with your friend for sure. Right?

269
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:30,855
Not at all. I didn't think anything of Tin, really.

270
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:33,145
Otherwise, tonight we wouldn't...

271
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:34,525
Wouldn't what?

272
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:36,035
It's nothing, Ae.

273
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:40,700
Ae, you must be hungry already. I'll go put everything on a plate for you.

274
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:52,515
What should I do?

275
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,315
Ae, did you say something?

276
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:56,515
Nothing... I'll help you.

277
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:48,465
[I'm really falling in love with moments like these]

278
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,795
I'm not fucking doing this anymore.

279
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:09,245
Why aren't you going to do it anymore, Ae?

280
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:12,025
I have to ask Ai'Ping about it tomorrow.

281
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:13,645
Okay.

282
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:25,215
You smell so lovely tonight.

283
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,935
- Pete.
- Yes.

284
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:38,465
Let me ask for this instead.

285
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:06,775
- Pete.
- Yes?

286
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:13,225
I'm hard already.

287
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:20,095
But there are classes tomorrow.

288
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:21,935
I'm going to take a shower first, all right?

289
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:26,155
Ae!?

290
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:43,953
Ai'Pete, are you asleep already?

291
00:22:48,328 --> 00:22:50,448
Are you mad at me or something?

292
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:56,578
Ae, you're so cruel.

293
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:58,603
What did I do?

294
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:02,333
Ae, you don't know that you're cruel?

295
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:06,368
If you don't tell me, how the hell would I know?

296
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,275
Well, when you did that...

297
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:16,984
Ae, do you realize just how excited I got,

298
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,851
to know that you were coming to stay over.

299
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,210
I even especially cleaned up.

300
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,850
Never mind. I'm going to sleep.

301
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,395
Hold on...

302
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:27,317
What did you just say?

303
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:31,103
Well... you told me that there would be a "next time."

304
00:23:31,103 --> 00:23:33,400
So I waited.

305
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,635
When I knew you were coming, I prepared myself.

306
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:39,904
Do you have any idea how nervous I've been?

307
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:43,575
But you just kept saying,

308
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:46,555
"There is class tomorrow... There is class tomorrow... "

309
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,098
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,343
Don't... Don't make that face.

311
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:57,251
I just thought that I was the only one who desperately wanted to do it with you.

312
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:03,548
You probably don't even know how I feel and how badly I want to do it with you.

313
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,585
But the reason I don't do it...

314
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,745
is because of one thing only.

315
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:19,293
I'm afraid that you'll get hurt.

316
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm sorry that I keep getting cold feet like this.

317
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,509
Ae, won't you ask how I feel?

318
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,607
If it's you,

319
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,500
even if it hurts, I'll be all right.

320
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,255
Are you sure about this?

321
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,870
Ae, please don't ask me.

322
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,310
You know, that I'm really shy right now.

323
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:41,441
Ae, you have such a nice body.

324
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:43,701
Don't be such a sweet talker.

325
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:45,310
I won't be able to hold back.

326
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,930
♫ As we don't speak a word I can still read your mind as our eyes meet ♫

327
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,570
♫ From now on we have each other ♫

331
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:13,490
Pete, I'm sorry... if I hurt you.

332
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,510
But I can't take it anymore.

333
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,680
I... also didn't tell you to hold back you know.

353
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,810
This is the best I've ever felt in the past 18 years.

354
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,980
Same here, Ae.

355
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:55,536
Are you being shy?

356
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,060
Of course, I'm shy, Ae.

357
00:28:01,506 --> 00:28:02,920
And are you still hurting?

358
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,520
You can't ask that, Ae.

359
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:09,109
You're so damn adorably cute.

360
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:11,764
Go to sleep.

361
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:15,954
I can go to sleep, but you have to hold me.

362
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:19,634
Even if you tell me to let go, I wouldn't let go.

363
00:29:03,314 --> 00:29:06,104
Don't... Get out...

364
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,070
Get out...

365
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,940
Don't come any closer...

366
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,910
Get out... Don't...

367
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,270
Don't...

368
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:21,353
Don't...

369
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,825
Don't!

370
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,820
- Tar...
- Don't! Don't come in...

371
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,370
- Tar!
- Get out!

372
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,240
- Tar!
- Don't come any closer!

373
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,540
- Tar...
- Get out!

374
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,236
-Tar!!! Tar!!! Tar!!! It's me, P'Tum!!!
- Don't!

375
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:41,420
Tar... This is P'Tum.

376
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,950
P'Tum?

377
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,150
P'Tum, help me, please.

378
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,250
Help me...

379
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,332
It's all right now, Tar.

380
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,070
Tar, you were just having a nightmare.

381
00:30:14,924 --> 00:30:16,914
You are okay, my dear.

382
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:48,242
Tar, is there something you want to tell me?

383
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,430
There isn't, P'Tum. I was just having a nightmare is all.

384
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:00,013
- But...
- I was just having a nightmare. Really.

385
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,920
Tar.

386
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:14,764
Tar, if you ever want to let it out... You know,

387
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:18,921
that your big brother is always here.

388
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,889
I know. I'm just having a nightmare. Really.

389
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,057
Then... I'll excuse myself to go sleep upstairs, all right?

390
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:36,947
Good night, P'Tum.

391
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,010
How many years have passed already?

392
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:20,517
Why can't I seem to ever forget it?

393
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:37,007
I really can't tell you about this, P'Tum.

394
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:40,658
I'm sorry.

395
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,038
I'm really sorry.

396
00:32:50,648 --> 00:32:52,838
I'm so sorry, P'Tum.

397
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,304
Ai'Pond said I have to do all of his damn assignments!?!?

398
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:10,930
Call him over to talk right now, Ai'Ping.

399
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,300
He doesn't want to talk, dude.

400
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,180
He wanted me to say that you need to repay him since you were finally able to eat shrimp.

401
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,819
So you can repay him by

402
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:19,233
doing his assignments this semester.

403
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:20,332
That fucker.

404
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,615
Not me. Go tell him yourself.

405
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,841
I'm just a messenger.

406
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:26,860
But you know, what kind of damn expensive shrimp was it? To make you do his assignments for a whole semester.

407
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,635
How could you believe him?

408
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:31,022
He's such a damn dimwit!

409
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:32,857
Yeah, yeah. I don't want to know about that.

410
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,000
Let's just say that I completed my task. That's all I'm going to say for now, all right?

411
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:41,115
That damn asshole.

412
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,070
Did I wake you up?

413
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,610
Not at all. I've been awake for a while.

414
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,600
And are you... still hurting?

415
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,800
Ae, who asks each other that?

416
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,180
I won't ask then.

417
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,370
Are you hungry? I'll make something for you to eat.

418
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:17,200
Okay. Then I'll excuse myself and take a shower first, all right?

419
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,210
- Right, Ai'Pete.
- Yes?

420
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,410
Can I borrow your computer to go on Facebook?

421
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,730

We're going to compete already?

437
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,810
This year, our department have to be the champs!

00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,320
Yay...

439
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:16,630
Did you... forget... to charge your battery or something?

440

Hey there, Albino Monkey.

441

Do your best, all right?

442

This year, we have to take the Champ(ionship) for sure!

Are you going to "take" me, Ai'No?

444

But I don't want to "take" you.

445
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,200
What a dumbass joke. Who uses that?

446
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,600
That International DOG!!!

447
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,670
Again?

448
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,380
What fight did you have with him this time?

449
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,060
I didn't fight, P'!

450
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,070
It was him who—

451
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,360
GEEZ!

452
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,850
You guys can go away already!

453
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,850
This is the area for the athletes, isn't it?

454
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,730
I'm losing all of my concentration.

455
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,810
Me too? But I'm the captain you know...

456
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,370
All of you guys.

457
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,900
Go already!

458
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,870
Okay, okay, okay. Hey, let's go, Ai'Champ, before he punches you.

459
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,870
- Fine, I'll leave.
- Yeah.

460
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,300
Hey, do your best. Don't—

461
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,520
Just go, P'!

462
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,040
Fine!

463
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,720
Stop thinking about it, Ai'Can.

464
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,500
Focus on playing football instead.

465
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,810
Do you think something is up with Ai'Can or something?

466
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,830
Did you scold him about something?

467
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,370
Gosh. With a face like mine?

468
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,960
- What kid would be afraid?
- Not at all, sir...

469
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,560
Hey! Ai'Can! Ai' Good!

470
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,530
Do your best!

471
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,635
Don't ruin my reputation as Captain Techno, you know!

472
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:13,189
And you two don't "fall down and kiss the floor."

473
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:15,470
Otherwise, I'll chase and kick every one of your asses.

474
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,540
I didn't kiss him!!!

475
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,830
Ai'Can, duck!

476
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,180
Is he okay?

477
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,850
Is he going to be okay?

478
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,470
Are you okay?

479
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,880
Ai'Can, can you go on?

480
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,900
I can... I can go on.

481
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,060
Let's take him inside first.

482
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,520
Move... I can still go on.

483
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,940
You can...

484
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,760
But your state is a total mess, you Albino Monkey.

485
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,210
Don't make it worse on the kid.

486
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,580
That's okay, Ai'Can. You can try again next time.

487
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,380
But if our faculty loses in the first round, it's all your fault.

488
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,530
Only one minute?

489
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,100
And you told me not to make it worse for him.

490
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,800
You jerk.

491
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,140
Oh, hey! "Ai'Can 90 seconds."

492
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,140
You asshole.

493
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,500
Ai' 90 seconds!

494
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,856
Did you know? You're really famous now!

495
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,670
I'm begging you, please. Don't tease me.

496
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,970
Just this and it's already reached the nursing school.

497
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,735
What nurse is going to want me as a hubby, dude?

498
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,230
Geez, what's with you.

499
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,230
Your nickname is extremely cool.

500
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,830
Just look at me...

501
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,920
I'm "The Lord of Pornography."

502
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,980
But yours is still cool.

503
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,250
P'Type, too. Damn it.

504
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,650
The whole university knows now.

505
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,030
Right. Have you seen Ai'Ae at all?

506
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:27,920
There he is. Ai'Pete, over here.

507
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
Hey! I was asking about Ai'Ae. How did Ai'Pete get here?

508
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,270
You're so out of the loop.

509
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,670
From now on, if you are looking for Ai'Ae, you need to look for Ai'Pete, too.

510
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,100
Ai'Pete is tall. You can easily spot him.

511
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,900
Ai'Ae so short and stubby like this.

512
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,860
Your dad is short!

513
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,530
Right, Ai'Can. I heard the news that...

514
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,860
If you want to laugh just go ahead and laugh...

515
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,010
I've been teased since this morning.

516
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,810
Just me going onto the field,

517
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,530
I wasn't even there for a minute.

518
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,240
And I got hit by a ball directly in the face.

519
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,120
And I even passed out and was carried off the field.

520
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,880
The team is teasing me. Everyone from our faculty is blaming me.

521
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,540
Just do whatever you want.

522
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,820
I'm getting over it. Damn!

523
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,430
I just wanted to say I'm happy that your team got through the first round.

524
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,980
Ae, Buddy. You're my dearest friend.

525
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,050
I love you, dude.

526
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,140
What the hell is with you? Ai'Can.

527
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,780
Ai'Ae!!!

528
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,430
Ai'Can...

529
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,240
What food do you want? I'll go buy it for you.

530
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,670
I'll go get the drinks then.

531
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,960
I'll go, too!

532
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,170
I was just getting thirsty. Be right back.

533
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:38,240
H-H-Hold on, Can. We haven't asked Ae about his drink yet.

534
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,305
Hey! Ai'Can wouldn't think of stealing your boyfriend.

535
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:42,680
Mister Ex-Virgin.

536
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,610
Pond, you asshole.

537
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,100
Why did you bring me here, Can? Didn't you say you wanted to buy a drink?

538
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,330
Yeah, just forget about the drink for now.

539
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,680
I have something to ask you.

540
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,030
But... if I ask you, you can't say that I'm crazy. All right?

541
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,500
Okay.

542
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,580
Is your friend gay?

543
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
My friend? Which one?

544
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,780
Don't act like you don't know...

545
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:19,617
Ai'Tin.

546
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:22,110
Tin, my friend from IC?

547
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,000
I don't think he is because he dates girls.

548
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,450
Is he a bisexual then?

549
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:33,680
Well... I don't think so either. Because Tin comes off a bit homophobic actually.

550
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:36,060
So...

551
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:40,670
For a guy who is not gay, how can he kiss another guy?

552
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,580
Can, you're speaking as if you've seen Tin kiss a guy.

553
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,740
No! No! Not at all! I didn't see anything at all.

554
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,420
Don't jump to conclusions.

555
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,560
I'm just trying to prove my hypothesis...

556
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
That a guy who's good looking,

557
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,270
drives a cool car... uh... for the most part, what they're like...

558
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,352
Well, your friend kind of fits that.

559
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:03,225
Well, he's got an asshole personality.

560
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:06,080
His looks are also... pretty good shit.

561
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,360
and also a terrible driver.

562
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,680
Just like a street junkie.

563
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,650
He-He just seemed to fit those. That's why I asked.

564
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,160
That's all. It wasn't anything.

565
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:16,995
Oh! My stomach hurts... My stomach suddenly hurts. Yeah! I'll see you later!

566
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,225
Are we not buying drinks anymore?

568
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:32,676
Pond, could you please tell Can to reserve a seat for me, too?

569
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,260
Thank you very much.

570
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,970
Where are you off to in a hurry?

571
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,870
I'm rushing off to the football field.

572
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,100
So sorry.

573
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:41,880
So clumsy.

574
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,520
Come talk with me.

575
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,030
So you must really like Ae, right?
