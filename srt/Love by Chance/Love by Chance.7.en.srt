[Love by Chance]
[Episode 7]

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,130
Tar... you don't need to.

27
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,810
Thank you, P'Tum.

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,430
I can carry it.

29
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,540
I really missed this house.

30
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,830
If you miss it, then come back and stay here.

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,680
How could I do that, P'Tum?

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,030
I still have to go to school for several more years.

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,060
I've finally set a goal that I'll be a French chef for sure!

34
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,750
Is it because Ai'Tharn likes eating French food?

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,370
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,737
It's... I tend to say things without thinking.

37
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:08,192
Then... I'll go take your stuff upstairs to your room.

38
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:09,900
You can just sit and relax for now.

39
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,230
By the time mom and dad get back, it'll be pretty late in the evening.

40
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,370
Damn this mouth...

41
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm glad that you're finally able to come back home.

42
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:21,299
Tar, you're the best thing in my life.

43
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm glad I'm home, too, P'Tum.

44
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,147
Why the hell does the Thai language have to have so many difficult words?

45
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:12,253
I can't even try to remember these anymore.

46
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:13,968
Why are you complaining?

47
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:15,531
Who begged to study together

48
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:18,802
and said that he would do everything?

49
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:19,993
Don't be mad at me.

50
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:20,948
Who's mad?

51
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,421
You are.

52
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:25,988
You have to understand that I'm not truly Thai.

53
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:27,816
If this was Italian, that's another story.

54
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:29,165
Italian, your dad!

55
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,492
You were born in Thailand. Your parents are Thai.

56
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,172
You only have an Italian grandpa.

57
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:35,752
ChaAim, you should try asking him what "Hello" is in Italian.

58
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,330
He doesn't have a clue.

59
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,160
Well... it's Bonjour!

60
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,520
I know it.

61
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,469
You're crazy. That's French.

62
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,904
They're the same thing.

63
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,222
You're too hung up on the details.

64
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:48,922
Hey... Isn't that P'Pete?

65
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,910
Pete!

66
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,150
Hi, I'm ChaAim. Pond's friend.

67
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,590
In the future, she won't just be a friend.

68
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,870
What "not just a friend"?

69
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,160
What? Don't act like you don't know.

70
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,580
I've been hitting on you, you know.

71
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,980
And hitting on you very seriously, too.

72
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,050
"Seriously"? You should try to study seriously then.

73
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,560
Why is N'Chompoo helping you study English?

74
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,421
I'm really weak in the English language.

75
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:30,737
Super weak, too.

76
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:33,947
Asshole. Focus on yourself first, then you can insult me.

77
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,245
Actually, I can help you with that.

78
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,815
I am studying in the International Program.

79
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:41,985
I don't want to bother you. You have your own exams now, too.

80
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,124
With just studying, there's already not even enough time to sleep.

81
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:47,934
You two look very close.

82
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,580
Chompoo, what's this tense?

83
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,672
Ahh... Yes. Let me take a look at it for you.

84
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:55,217
Which one?

85
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,470
Should I just leave?

86
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,658
What are you doing out here?

87
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,800
Let's go get something to eat after studying.

88
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,330
I'll make sure you get enough nutrition for your brain.

89
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,090
During these exams, make sure you find something to eat. All right?

90
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,240
Ae, could you let me help you study instead?

91
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,050
- I've already told you that...
- That's okay.

92
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,230
Please let me tutor you instead of N'Chompoo.

93
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,180
Are you being jealous over me?

94
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,167
Uhh... I...

95
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,755
I...

96
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,800
I'm sorry. That I'm not being very lovely.

97
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,290
Geez, you...

98
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,540
Wherever you go, you're already pretty lovely.

99
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,030
Next time, I'll have you tutor me. Okay?

100
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,510
Okay.

101
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,740
The exams are almost done!

102
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,430
Once I'm done with exams, I'll be free!

103
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,430
Then I'll freaking eat everything in sight.

104
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,237
Lately, I keep running into unfortunate things.

105
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,075
Especially that bastard.

106
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,900
Why was he insulting Ai'Ae and Ai'Pete?

107
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,240
But whatever. I was able to throw in one punch. I'm pretty satisfied.

108
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,870
You're in the way.

109
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:59,181
What the fuck are you doing here?

110
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,630
This area is the area around the International College.

111
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:07,558
What's a Thai Program kid like you doing around here?

112
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:10,670
That's right... This is around the IC isn't it...

113
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,230
But, so what? I can walk wherever I want.

114
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,470
Why? Does your dad own the university or something?

115
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,950
Do you really not know who my dad is?

116
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,410
No. I don't know.

117
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,983
Why? Is your dad the prime minister?

118
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:29,756
Even if your dad was the PM, I still wouldn't know him.

119
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,750
I failed Social Science.

120
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,290
My last name is "Medthanan."

121
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:38,580
So what?

122
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,480
Talking to someone stupid is pointless.

123
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,070
You're calling me stupid again?

124
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,170
Fine. I might be stupid,

125
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,070
but you can't insult Ai'Pete.

126
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,000
Because Ai'Pete is a friend of Ai'Ae.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,740
Ai'Ae is my friend. Therefore, Ai'Pete is also my friend.

128
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,700
Are you done talking?

129
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,560
When I talk to him, I always get so fucking annoyed.

130
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,910
When we talk, I never understand him.

131
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,160
He didn't even tell me who his dad was.

132
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,940
Weirdo.

133
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,170
Yes? Tin.

134
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,000
Where are you?

135
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,450
I'm on my way to the soccer field now.

136
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,010
Did you need something, Tin?

137
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,170
Then I'll see you at the field.

138
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,960
Okay.

139
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm dead... I'm dead... I'm so dead...

140
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,630
You guys. I'm so fucking dead for sure.

141
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,550
I don't think I can pass the mean score in the Midterm Exam.

142
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,710
I couldn't do it either!

143
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,600
Ai'Pond, what about you?

144
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,930
You guys... Why are you being so serious?

145
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,270
Exams are done. It's over already.

146
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,620
No way. You... you were able to do it?!

147
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,980
Someone like me?

148
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,270
Of course, I couldn't do it.

149
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,030
You weirdo. I almost stopped breathing.

150
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,920
Look... If I end up scoring lower than you, I'm willing to not insult you for a whole week!

151
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,460
See? This is why I was willing to be the nice one. Randomly answering so I could score lower than you.

152
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,960
I care about you.

153
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,040
I was afraid your mouth would be free.
 (T/N: That she wouldn't be able to say anything)

154
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,330
Tears are coming. Are you going to make it, Ai'Pond?

155
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,430
You can be babbling about me nonstop. Isn't it nice?

156
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,570
Good... Good... I hope you prosper, dude.

157
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,195
Sathu!
(T/N: For Buddhism, Sathu: Amen, Hallelujah, Bless you)

158
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:56,195
You have a sure future, my friend.

159
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,060
Ai'Ae! Ai'Ae!

160
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,880
What about you? How'd you do?

161
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,347
I think I was able to do somewhat.

162
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:04,675
Then... I'm headed off to the soccer field.

163
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:06,276
Sure.

164
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:07,997
He's smiling as if he got full scores.

165
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,670
He... Where is he off to in such a hurry?

166
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,700
Ask me. I know everything.

167
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:15,730
Come in closer.

168
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,370
Talk.

169
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,010
Today... The IC kids have finished with their exams, too.

170
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:24,869
Oh, no!

171
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,720
So... So this means that I really can't get Pete then?

172
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,355
- Yeah.
- Oh!

173
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:34,045
See, about this...

174
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:36,530
Bitch, you're a bird for sure.
 (T/N: It means you're someone who didn't even have a chance)

175
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,030
Especially a bitch with such a stinky mouth like you.

176
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,620
You're a bird for sure.

177
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,820
I'm hurt... I'm so hurt... I want to go home.

178
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,660
- Ai'Bow! Come this way!
- What?

179
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,460
- Which way?
- This way.

180
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,250
Chirp... Chirp... Let's go.

181
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,820
I hate you, Ai'Ae!

182
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,980
Ai'Ae!

183
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,420
Oh... P'.

184
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,810
Where are you rushing off to? We don't have practice today, you know.

185
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,150
Yeah, I know.

186
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,950
I'm meeting Ai'Pete around the soccer field.

187
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,041
The IC kids also happened to finish exams, so we made plans to eat together.

188
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,416
So, you're trying to make the most of your time then.

189
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,951
Before those kids go on a long break.

190
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:19,215
Me eating with Ai'Pete is a pretty normal thing, P'.

191
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:20,803
I also just realized,

192
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:25,148
that "friends" spend so much time after exams hanging out together.

193
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,995
What do you mean?

194
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:34,101
And what about you? What do you think?

195
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:41,260
Don't think too much.

196
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,460
Just follow your heart.

197
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,006
I'm leaving.

198
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:49,732
Hurry up. He's probably waited pretty long. That IC kid.

199
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,462
I'm leaving.

200
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:03,626
When "I always want to be with you," is that not a normal thing or something?

201
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:14,149
Pete.

202
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,135
Yes?

203
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:18,729
I'd like to talk to you.

204
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:20,689
Okay.

205
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,700
Tin, what did you want to talk about?

206
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,250
I know... About you and that Thai Program kid,

207
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,775
just how close you really are.

208
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:39,605
His name is Ae.

209
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,075
Whatever his name is. I don't care.

210
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,050
Just know that I know about

211
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,990
just what kind of relationship you guys have.

212
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,440
Tin, what are you doing?

213
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,430
I have an offer.

214
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,930
This is not funny, Tin.

215
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,880
I'm also not kidding.

216
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:25,731
If you're going to date that Thai program kid,

217
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:27,861
date me instead.

218
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:33,527
What the hell are you doing with my guy?!

219
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,755
Your guy, you say?

220
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:40,900
Yeah. Ai'Pete is my guy.

221
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,540
Ae.

222
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:47,287
Since you know now, then don't be brazen and mess with my guy again.

223
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:54,243
Wait...

224
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,245
What did he do to you?

225
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:12,415
Tin, he really didn't do anything to me.

226
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,617
Then, why did he bring his face so close to you like that?

227
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:19,223
Tin probably just wanted to tease me.

228
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:27,765
Don't get close to others like you're close to me.

229
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:31,495
Why? Why are you saying that?

230
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,595
Won't you date me, Ai'Pete?

231
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,246
Don't let me wait any longer than this.

232
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,846
Ae?!

233
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,492
Just wait, Ae.

234
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,670
No more waiting.

235
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:48,614
Don't make a face like that.

236
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,130
I won't be able to hold back.

237
00:18:53,410 --> 00:19:01,780
♫ It must be love that makes me stand right here ♫

238
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:11,070
♫ It's love that makes my heart want to keep holding on ♫

239
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,240
♫ Although there is no chance ♫

240
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,020
♫ Even if I have to miss again ♫

241
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:25,540
♫ But Love still asks me to do this ♫

242
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,380
♫ to give to you until you take it ♫

243
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,620
♫ to tell you I love you until you accept ♫

244
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,590
♫ You are my happiness ♫

245
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:44,150
♫ If you don't take my love, I'm ready to start again ♫

246
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,210
♫ If in the end, you don't change your mind ♫

247
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:49,177
Date me, all right?

248
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:52,282
Be my boyfriend, please.

249
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:55,394
Ae, are you teasing me right now?

250
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,314
Ai'Pete! I wouldn't joke about something like this.

251
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:02,783
I really can't believe it,

252
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:05,973
that you would date me.

253
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,644
Please tell me this is true.

254
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,384
I'm saying the truth.

255
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:14,909
I don't like it when you are close to someone else.

256
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:18,701
And I hate that I cannot say or do anything about it.

257
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,651
I'm jealous!

258
00:20:26,294 --> 00:20:28,814
I hate when you are with Ai'Tin.

259
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,844
It makes me want to punch his face so bad.

260
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:43,384
So...

261
00:20:48,184 --> 00:20:50,334
Could you date me then?

262
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:55,954
Yes, Ae.

263
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,104
So, that means you're dating me then?

264
00:20:58,104 --> 00:20:59,664
Yeah.

265
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:02,934
This means... You are my boyfriend now, right?!

266
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,484
Yeah.

267
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,714
And I'm your boyfriend?!

268
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,714
Yes.

269
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:11,494
We are... boyfriends now, right?

270
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:13,044
Yeah.

271
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:21,384
We're boyfriends now. No need to put your head on your knees.

272
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:25,864
Since your boyfriend has a shoulder for you to lean on.

273
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,220
Why did your friend come and find you?

274
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,567
It was nothing, Ae.

275
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,727
What if I don't believe you?

276
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:46,627
I never thought of Tin in that way.

277
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:49,104
I only think of Tin as a friend, really.

278
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:50,864
I know.

279
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:55,259
I know that way you look at me is so much different from the way you look at him.

280
00:21:56,224 --> 00:21:58,784
But don't I have any right to be jealous?

281
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:03,483
Well... I asked him to investigate something.

282
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:07,504
It's about P'Trump.

283
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:08,914
Do you still love him?

284
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:10,594
Not at all.

285
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:13,504
Ae, you already know who I love.

286
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:17,685
So, what the hell does it have to do with him?

287
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,864
I asked Tin to find out what P'Trump is doing.

288
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:29,090
So that I'd know about the money he took, and what he did with it.

289
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:32,194
So that I can protect myself, too.

290
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:34,264
So, why the hell didn't you tell me?

291
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:36,684
I didn't want to bother you.

292
00:22:36,684 --> 00:22:39,534
I want to depend on myself.

293
00:22:40,824 --> 00:22:44,514
But while you try to depend on yourself, it's making you depend on someone else.

294
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:47,234
And you're not even depending on me.

295
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,844
I didn't want to bother you back there.

296
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:54,004
Back then, we weren't in a relationship yet.

297
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:57,184
But now we're finally dating.

298
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:01,104
I can bother you now, right?

299
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,294
How can you be this adorable?

300
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:16,784
Depend on me more than you do now.

301
00:23:16,784 --> 00:23:19,294
Bother me more than you do now.

302
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:23,754
I want to protect you, Ai'Koon-Chai.

303
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,490
♫ Even if the road in front of us is long ♫

304
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,090
♫ Even if the road is harsh on us ♫

305
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,450
♫ If we have our downtime afterward, we will hold hands again ♫

306
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,760
♫ I'll never let that hand go ♫

307
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,370
♫ Our love will be forever and it will never end ♫

308
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,050
♫ Wish this love could be forever and our love will be forever ♫

309
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:56,260
♫ Wish this love could be forever and ever and ever ♫

310
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,180
♫ Wish this love could be forever and our love will be forever ♫

311
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,020
♫ Wish this love could be forever and ever and ever ♫

312
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,960
♫ Our love will last for eternity and will never die ♫

313
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:16,262
What are you doing around here?

314
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,144
Don't ignore me.

315
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:22,434
I'm asking what you are doing around my zone.

316
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:26,054
Let go.

317
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,594
It's dirty.

318
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:29,724
Whoa! I'm instantly ticked off.

319
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:33,504
Are you calling me dirty? I shower every day dammit. It's just...

320
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:37,484
I went to the bathroom and forgot to wash my hands...

321
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,309
What about you? What you are doing here?

322
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,029
What are you going to bother my friend with now?

323
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:42,954
Get out of the way.

324
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:45,124
Or do you want me to call security?

325
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:48,614
Go ahead and call them then.

326
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,204
You called me dirty, right?

327
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:52,584
How is it? is it dirty yet?

328
00:24:55,356 --> 00:24:57,896
Listen to me carefully.

329
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,227
I have never thought of being associated

330
00:25:00,227 --> 00:25:03,555
with those who don't even have the means to buy good shoes.

331
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:10,064
It's because your friend is inferior, so you're inferior like that, too.

332
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:16,284
I'm hurt.

333
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:18,984
Ouch!

334
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,434
Now my shirt is dirty, too. I'm too lazy to wash it, dammit!

335
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:24,109
Where are you going?

336
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:27,604
Where are you going? Wait for me!

337
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,994
Hey! Get out!

338
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:35,264
Get out and fight with me!

339
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,384
This is not a race... Gently, gently...

340
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:42,804
Gently, gently, gently, gently...

341
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:45,584
Ouch, Okay. I'm slowing.

342
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,354
Is that Can?

343
00:25:48,134 --> 00:25:50,730
Geez. Why are you honking...

344
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,844
I saw your face and was startled.

345
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,404
P'No... P'Type...

346
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:57,554
P'!

347
00:25:57,554 --> 00:25:58,714
What the hell's with you?

348
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:01,204
Didn't you just say that you were going to kick the ball and relieve some stress?

349
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:04,694
It's because of Ai'Good and his group. They're said that they have their final exams tomorrow.

350
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:05,784
They have to study.

351
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:07,724
They won't eat with me.

352
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:10,224
The exam is tomorrow. Studying right now won't stick to their brains.

353
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:11,294
Look at me.

354
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:15,384
Kicking the ball to relieve stress is the most correct answer!

355
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:18,504
Hold on. I'm curious. You said you came to kick the ball to relieve stress...

356
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:22,124
So, what are you doing standing around here then?

357
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:23,184
That's right.

358
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:25,264
And where did your ball go?

359
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,554
Geez... The ball.

360
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:30,524
I guess I just suddenly threw it at that guy.

361
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:35,154
I swear! He's the person I hate the most in the world.

362
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:37,084
Huh?

363
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:39,004
What's his deal?

364
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:41,254
I think you should go check up on him.

365
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:43,444
What about you then?

366
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:44,494
How are you going to leave?

367
00:26:44,494 --> 00:26:46,204
I can walk back by myself.

368
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,444
Are you sure about that?

369
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:48,294
Yeah.

370
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:49,134
You can do it?

371
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,264
Of course, I can do it.

372
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:53,064
Fine. I'll go find Ai'Can then.

373
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:58,614
Yeah. I'm leaving then.

374
00:26:58,614 --> 00:26:59,964
Go.

375
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:01,424
Carefully now.

376
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:05,224
Ai'Can! Hey, Can...

377
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,444
Hey!

378
00:27:07,014 --> 00:27:08,794
Is he going to be all right?

379
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,647
What's up?

380
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:22,987
P'Type.

381
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:26,768
What's going on?

382
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:29,294
I brought you something.

383
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:32,914
And can you give this to P'Tharn, too?

384
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:34,554
Thank you.

385
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:45,263
What's going on between you and Tum?

386
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:51,644
There's not a single thing that I can hide from you, P'Type.

387
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:54,704
Just looking at your face and I can already tell.

388
00:27:56,824 --> 00:28:02,354
P'Type, have you told P'Tum about... the thing where I was...

389
00:28:02,354 --> 00:28:04,164
I never told him.

390
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:07,694
And I never thought of telling him either.

391
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:11,654
And for Ai'Tharn, he's also never told anyone.

392
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:13,724
Why?

393
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:16,014
Does Tum know about it now?

394
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:19,614
No.

395
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,644
I've never told P'Tum.

396
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:25,884
P'Tum only knows that many years ago...

397
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:29,094
I had Clinical Depression because I broke up with P'Tharn.

398
00:28:29,094 --> 00:28:31,594
But... he never knew that...

399
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:36,064
I was...

400
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:41,464
raped.

401
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:46,914
And the reason why you came is that you wanted to ask my opinion, right?

402
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:49,404
Whether you should tell him or not?

403
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,554
I really don't know, P'Type.

404
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:56,214
I seriously don't know.

405
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:59,394
If I should tell him that...

406
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:04,114
I have... Philophobia.
(Fear of falling in love)

407
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,554
When I was in France,

408
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:13,304
whenever someone tried to hit on me,

409
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,524
I was so scared.

410
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:20,094
I was scared of even having their arms around my shoulder or touching my hand.

411
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:24,154
There were so many times I had to lock myself in my room.

412
00:29:24,154 --> 00:29:26,254
And also cry.

413
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:34,462
When I was there at first, I really thought I was going to die.

414
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:37,524
Are you even scared of Ai'Tum now?

415
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:39,454
No, P'Type.

416
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,804
I've never been scared of P'Tum.

417
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:48,104
But that might just be because P'Tum is my older brother, and that's why...

418
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:51,194
Ai'Tum is your older brother,

419
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:53,954
or is it that he's the only guy that you trust?

420
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:58,024
And you also probably think that he would never ever hurt you.

421
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:01,664
Tar,

422
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:04,534
you're all grown up now.

423
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:06,234
You can decide for yourself now,

424
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:08,544
what it is that you want with your life.

425
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:11,644
Your life is your own,

426
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,644
it's not anyone else's.

427
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:33,278
I'm so pissed! Pissed!

428
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,384
I should have bitten his head off.

429
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,654
You can be pissed at whoever you want.

430
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:42,702
But could you please also take a look
at the money in my wallet.

431
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:43,982
See?

432
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:47,164
It's because I'm pissed.

433
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:49,834
I keep getting angry. The angrier I get, the more I eat.

434
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:50,934
It makes sense.

435
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:51,694
(Spit)

436
00:30:51,694 --> 00:30:52,824
Geez...

437
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:56,884
Someone like you? Don't you always stuff your face all the time, Ai'Can?

438
00:30:56,884 --> 00:31:01,104
Hey, did you have another fight with that IC kid again?

439
00:31:01,114 --> 00:31:03,554
You should try to control your temper sometimes, Ai'Can.

440
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:05,504
Look, you already punched him once.

441
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:08,494
The fact that he didn't report you is already pretty lucky.

442
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:11,464
Just looking at him, and you can tell that he's richer than you are.

443
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:14,204
Is being rich or poor important?

444
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:16,714
Does being rich mean you can look down on others?

445
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:18,624
Just looking down on me wasn't enough,

446
00:31:18,624 --> 00:31:21,264
but he also looked down on everyone around me, too.

447
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:23,424
Yeah, I know...

448
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,994
You don't like anyone talking bad about your friends.

449
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:29,844
But if you hate something too much, you should just be careful.

450
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:32,754
Be careful? Be careful of what?

451
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:36,554
Ai'Type also used to hate something too much, just like you.

452
00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:39,184
So, did he beat that person up?

453
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:41,584
To the point that they broke the bed, I'd say...

454
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:43,044
What?

455
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:44,844
It's nothing at all.

456
00:31:44,844 --> 00:31:47,364
Did you stuff your face until you were full now?

457
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,854
If you're feeling better, then go back home.

458
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:51,624
I just got my motorcycle back.

459
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:54,714
I'll give you a ride home. Come on. Let's get going.

460
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:57,894
- P'No! I'm not full yet.
- What?

461
00:31:57,894 --> 00:31:59,534
Can I eat a bit more?

462
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:02,494
"A bit." How many skewers is it today?

463
00:32:02,494 --> 00:32:05,444
Just one skewer then? Okay.

464
00:32:05,444 --> 00:32:08,044
Uncle, 10 skewers of grilled pork.

465
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,134
Sure.

466
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,794
You asshole. Didn't you say just one skewer?

467
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:13,584
Yeah, this is one.

468
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:14,624
And this!

469
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:15,454
[Zero]

470
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,714
Ten skewers exactly.

471
00:32:19,744 --> 00:32:22,534
Come here you little bastard...

472
00:32:22,534 --> 00:32:24,094
- P'No!
- Why do you eat so much??

473
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:26,124
How can you eat so much?

474
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:56,294
Tar.

475
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:59,164
Tar, where did you go?

476
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,404
I came back and didn't see you.

477
00:33:01,404 --> 00:33:03,684
Do you know how worried I was?

478
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:05,894
I'm sorry, P'Tum.

479
00:33:05,894 --> 00:33:08,634
I just happened to go see a friend.

480
00:33:09,494 --> 00:33:10,944
Next time, if you're going somewhere,

481
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:12,684
can you please let me know, at least?

482
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:14,954
You haven't been back in Thailand for so long.

483
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:17,204
What if you got lost, what would I do?

484
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,504
Geez, P'Tum.

485
00:33:19,504 --> 00:33:21,964
Although I studied in France for many years...

486
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:24,384
But Thailand? I've lived here for more than 10 years you know.

487
00:33:24,384 --> 00:33:26,334
I wouldn't get lost.

488
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:31,324
I was just worried.

489
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:35,904
I went to see P'Type.

490
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:37,404
Why the hell did you go see him?

491
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:42,334
Are you still mad about the thing with P'Tharn and P'Type?

492
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,134
I already told you.

493
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:47,024
They weren't cause that led me to be like this.

494
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,434
Tar, are you siding with them?

495
00:33:49,434 --> 00:33:52,314
I'm not taking anyone's side.

496
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:53,584
Don't be mad, all right?

497
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,304
Here.

498
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:58,094
Here. I brought some sweets for you.

499
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,573
Next time, if you are going somewhere,

500
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,553
can you please tell me?

501
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:18,204
I was worried.

502
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:20,764
I will.

503
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,504
Then I'll go put these sweets on a plate for you, all right?

504
00:34:25,554 --> 00:34:29,164
You came back all tired. So go sit and rest.

505
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:39,293
Thank you, P'Tum.

506
00:35:13,272 --> 00:35:15,119
[Ae: What day are you coming to school?]

507
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,378
[Pete: Why? Did you need something?]

508
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:27,398
[Ae: I miss you from every part of my heart]

509
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:41,378
Ai'Pond, have you seen my phone?

510
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,700
Ai'Pond, you asshole!

511
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,010
Ai'Ae, don't choke me!

512
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,680
I meant well.

513
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Ai'Ae...

514
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,410
[Ae is calling.]

515
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,030
Yes?

516
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,390
Hello, Pete. Just now, Ai'Pond took my phone to text.

517
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,480
[Pond: You didn't have the guts to say it. So I said it for you.]

518
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,730
[Ae: Let me take care of this asshole, Ai'Pond, first.]

519
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,970
Okay.

520
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,220
I'm going to head off to class, all right?

521
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,930
Don't hurt your friend!

522
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,770
[Ae: But Ai'Pond is right about one thing. I do miss you.]

523
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:08,860
[Tin: See you at the Lavita restaurant tomorrow.]

524
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,010
Hey, you. I haven't seen you for so many days.

525
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,200
Hey there, Ae.

526
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,260
Stop blushing.

527
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,480
You're going to make me shy, too.

528
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,150
I just realized that picking up my boyfriend for the first time would make me this nervous.

529
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,450
Well... I...

530
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,466
My heart is beating faster than yours.

531
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:12,376
Can I feel it?

532
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,450
Maybe I shouldn't...

533
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,990
I'm afraid that if I touch you, I won't be able to stop myself.

534
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,170
Ae...

535
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:38,610
I have a meeting with Tin today.

536
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,480
Where? I'll go with you.

537
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
But...

538
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,930
No "buts." Let's go. I'm so hungry.

539
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,320
Okay.

540
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,610
What's with you guys?

541
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,670
Acting like you two just had a scene together.
 (T/N: "Having sex")

542
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,410
Was yesterday not enough for you, Ai'Pond?

543
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,830
It was enough already... It still hurts.

544
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,880
Next time, stop being nosy then.

545
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,410
You want me to stop being nosy?

546
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,060
Wouldn't it be easier to have me stop being addicted to porn?

547
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,320
Just look then.

548
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,630
Normally, you two walk side by side like you're leaning on one another.

549
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,010
But look at you today.

550
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,520
Excuse me.

551
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,043
A truck can drive between you two.

552
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:31,455
Walking so far away from each other.

553
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:34,495
Are you going to die if you don't get into my business for at least a day, Ai'Pond?

554
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:36,935
I'm not being nosy about you.

555
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:38,635
I'm being nosy about Pete.

556
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:40,425
Right, Pete? Right?

557
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:43,915
You're smacking my head again?

558
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,405
You smack me in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

559
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:48,845
I'm so stupid that I can't catch up with everyone else in class.

560
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,675
You want to know it so badly?

561
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:52,785
The person whose shoulder you are touching...

562
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:54,475
That's my boyfriend.

563
00:39:54,475 --> 00:40:00,425
Oh... Wow... You said it yourself and you're embarrassed by yourself, friend?

564
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:03,345
Your face is all red now!

565
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:06,925
But for you, it's not blushing red. More like maroon red.

566
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,239
So, I'd rather...

567
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,459
Go...

568
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:18,333
People with partners really do get super shy!

569
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:19,878
Later!

570
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:24,515
Shall we go?

571
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:25,935
Okay.

572
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,195
If you don't want to see him, I can go by myself.

573
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:41,475
No.

574
00:40:41,475 --> 00:40:43,645
I will never let you and him be alone with just the two of you.

575
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:45,045
Let's go.

576
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,714
Have a seat first.

577
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:56,174
I've already wasted a lot of time.

578
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:02,385
I'm so sorry, Tin. For never being able to finally talk about this.

579
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,148
Rather, it's because of your friend.

580
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:10,476
Anyway...

581
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:15,111
Before I tell you... what he's done,

582
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:17,416
will you finally tell me

583
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:20,172
how it is that you and he know each other?

584
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:22,907
I can only tell you he's been threatening me.

585
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:25,207
That's really all I can tell you.

586
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,211
He has a debt from gambling.

587
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:32,144
How much?

588
00:41:32,144 --> 00:41:36,255
About 10K baht ($318 USD) at first.
After a while it became several 100K baht ($3,185 USD).

589
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:37,855
It's not just one table (one debt).

590
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:40,253
But he owes several places.

591
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:41,803
The dealers are looking for him now.

592
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:43,548
That bastard!

593
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:46,715
And right now, he's a drug addict.

594
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:48,315
What was that?

595
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:55,935
This is yours, right?

596
00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:58,995
It's mine. How were you able to find it?

597
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:04,796
The people I used to investigate for me found it in a pawn shop.

598
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:07,636
I saw that it had a "P" and "I" engraved on the back.

599
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,461
I thought it was yours.

600
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:11,840
So, I asked them to buy it back.

601
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,495
Fortunately, the pawnshop owner hadn't sold it yet.

602
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:17,525
Because he knew it was from a thief.

603
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:22,067
How much did you spend? I'll pay you back.

604
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:23,647
That's okay.

605
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:26,128
Let's just say that you owe me then.

606
00:42:26,153 --> 00:42:28,505
Please let me pay it back with money, Tin.

607
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,657
I'd rather that you owe me a favor instead.

608
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:35,337
Then, how do you want me to repay you?

609
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:39,133
How about...?

610
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:42,585
Stop meeting with your friend.

611
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:44,155
What do you mean?

612
00:42:44,155 --> 00:42:45,715
Do you not understand the human language?

613
00:42:45,715 --> 00:42:47,810
There will never be a day where I end things with Ai'Pete.

614
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,310
Because of money?

615
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:52,645
- What the hell do you mean?
- Ae! Tin... Tin... Tin...

616
00:42:52,645 --> 00:42:54,155
Tin was just kidding, right? Tin.

617
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,505
Tin, you were joking. Right?

618
00:42:56,505 --> 00:43:00,455
You really are a fucking asshole like Ai'Can said.

619
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:02,585
Ae...

620
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:07,385
Ae...

621
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:10,885
Even if I'm an asshole,

622
00:43:10,885 --> 00:43:14,005
but I still have the means to return something to its owner

623
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,830
which you would never be able to do.

624
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:20,155
The money you've been saving your whole life,

625
00:43:20,155 --> 00:43:22,715
is only enough to buy a hand on that dial.

626
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:25,315
I'm leaving.

627
00:43:25,315 --> 00:43:27,625
Just be careful of who you meet with.

628
00:43:28,255 --> 00:43:29,525
Bye.

629
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:39,737
Ae, please don't think too much about what Tin said.

630
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,105
But he's...

631
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:45,205
Forget it.

632
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,275
I'm going back to the dorm.

633
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:47,755
But you have a class.

634
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:48,985
I'll skip it.

635
00:43:48,985 --> 00:43:50,425
Hold on, Ae.

636
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:51,885
Ae!

637
00:43:57,855 --> 00:44:01,015
What's going on, Ae?

638
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:04,785
Pete, what if I happen to...

639
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,935
Ai'Pond, how was your first time?

640
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:10,825
What?!

641
00:44:10,825 --> 00:44:12,415
Hello.

642
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,115
Oh, hello... Save your greetings for Buddha/monks, dear.

643
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:16,675
If you don't let me kiss your cheeks,

644
00:44:16,675 --> 00:44:18,415
I'll kiss his cheeks instead.

645
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:20,515
You can't do that!

646
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:25,096
What did you just say?
