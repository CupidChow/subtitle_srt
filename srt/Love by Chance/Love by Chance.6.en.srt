00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:19,968
Just now, that was my first kiss.

27
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:23,928
Thank you for believing in me.

28
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,838
P'Pete,

29
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:49,938
there's something I'd like to talk to you about.

30
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,138
With me?

31
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:54,408
Yes, it's about P'Ae.

32
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,378
P'Pete.

33
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:11,238
Yes?

34
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:13,698
I like P'Ae.

35
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:16,798
So, why are you telling me that?

36
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:18,858
Why don't you tell P'Ae yourself?

37
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:22,998
Well, I've already told him that, but P'Ae doesn't believe me.

38
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:25,508
I saw that you and P'Ae were close friends.

39
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:29,368
So, I wanted to ask you for your advice.

40
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:31,158
Friends?

41
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:35,738
Oh! Are the two of you not friends?

42
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:37,038
Yes, we are friends.

43
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:40,188
Do you happen to know what type of woman he likes?

44
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:42,598
If I have to change something, I can change everything.

45
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,138
Be it a sassy girl, a sweet girl,

46
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:48,938
or a spicy one. I can change anything if it's for P'Ae.

47
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,998
Why is it that you're able to like Ae this much?

48
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:56,378
Well, P'Ae is cool.

49
00:03:56,378 --> 00:04:00,738
He's also so kind, generous, and charitable.

50
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:04,038
Look. I even just received some help from him.

51
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:08,728
I don't care if P'Pond calls him short or not handsome.

52
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:13,048
Because in my eyes, P'Ae is already the most handsome.

53
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:17,168
I honestly don't know the type of woman he likes.

54
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:19,348
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:22,498
You don't know? Well, that's all right.

56
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:27,338
Anyway, could I ask you to help cheer me on?

57
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:30,408
I... will try.

58
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:34,208
That's all. Then I'm going to go find P'Ae first, all right? Bye-bye.

59
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:38,458
Uhh... Chompoo? Can I please ask you to tell Ae

60
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:42,798
that lately I haven't been able to eat with him because I've been stuck studying.

61
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:44,858
Sure, I'll tell him for you. Bye-bye.

62
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:46,488
Okay.

63
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:03,898
You guys, I'm so nervous. It's almost the competition day.

64
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:06,088
I'm afraid I'm going to put on the wrong colored gloves.

65
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:09,128
Look, Ai'Bow! Your thing isn't as worrisome as Ai'Pond's!

66
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,048
Damn, he's still singing the song off-key.

67
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:14,578
Hey. Hold on, hold on. Someone like me isn't off-key, man!

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,100
You just need some "aesthetic" to listen to.

69

- Bullshit! You'll end up with the seniors smacking your head again.
- Bam!

70
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:25,478
- A handsome dude like me? Who would dare? Geez.
- I would.

I'm heading back to the dorm first.

Huh? Hey! And how am I supposed to get back then?

74
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:33,598
Hey, guys, I'm going to leave first.

75
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,958
Ai'Ae! Wait for me!

76
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:40,848
Do you think lately, Ai'Ae's seems... kind of moody?

77
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:43,758
Yeah. Super moody, too.

78
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,898

Why the hell have you been avoiding me?

150

There's nothing. Really.

151

You're not going to tell me?

If you won't tell me, I'll kiss you.

00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,502
You should do this with a really cute girl.

155
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:44,802
Not a guy like me.

156
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,800
What the hell are you talking about?

157
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,973
You should be doing something like this with N'Chompoo.

158
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:55,052
Not me.

159
00:11:55,052 --> 00:12:01,492
But me and Chompoo... There's nothing between us!

160
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:06,782
But the two of us...we're also nothing.

161
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,779
Pete.

162
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:12,092
Didn't I already tell you?

163
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,917
That I think of you as more than just a friend.

164
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,537
Do you not understand human words or something?

165
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:26,312
Ae, don't say something like this.

166
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:31,352
Everything...

167
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:35,142
It's been just because of the closeness.

168
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:44,242
You should like girls.

169
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,062
Not a gay guy like me.

170
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,520
You should like N'Chompoo.

171
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,822
Don't like me.

172
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:04,062
You should kiss her.

173
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,602
Don't kiss me.

174
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:12,922
You should take care of her.

175
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:16,482
Don't take care of me.

176
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,402
You are just confused.

177
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,182
Ae, you shouldn't let anyone tell you...

178
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,553
that you're the wrong gender.

179
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,742
Like they do to me.

180
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:52,642
Stupid, I want to kill you right now.

181
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:57,712
You thought this out before saying anything, right?

182
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:07,832
I don't know what you have been through in the past.

183
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,632
True.

184
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:19,362
I should be a guy that likes girls.

185
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:25,922
But if I like you, it's because you are you.

186
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:29,822
Not because you're a girl or a guy.

187
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:36,792
Remember it in your head, Ai'Koon-Chai.

188
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:27,702
I'm so envious of N'Chompoo.

189
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:35,012
Why are you envious?

190
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:43,032
Well... I'm envious because she can tell you straightforwardly that she likes you.

191
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:45,322
But I don't even have the guts to.

192
00:15:57,592 --> 00:16:00,042
Ai'Pete... The thing is...

193
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:04,332
I like you, Ae. What should I do?

194
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:13,742
I've liked you since the first time you helped me.

195
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:16,102
You are my hero.

196
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,452
You make me brave.

197
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:22,642
Brave enough to say no.

198
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:26,752
You make me into someone who's not weak.

199
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:30,222
Made me to not just run away.

200
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,141
And I've also had so much happiness.

201

When I'm with you,

202
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:41,401
I have so much happiness... to the point that I'm scared that I'll lose you.

203
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:47,402

- Sure.
- Well... My balcony door got stuck

00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:59,338
and I wanted to hang my laundry. Can you help me push?

the executive work is for him, but the labor work is for you.

I didn't think you wanted to know how to fuck a male ass...

Have you been counting?

277
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:40,168
Of course, I've been counting. I count because it's about you.

P'Ae! Come sit here. I reserved this table already.

283
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:09,198
I already told you that you don't need to sit and wait for me.

Why are scolding me?

285
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:15,778
I really meant well. See? P'Pond is right here, too.

286
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,458
Either way, you were going to come here anyway.

287
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,728
And what if I didn't come? Were you just going to sit here and wait for me until you were late for class?

288
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:24,278
Also, sitting and waiting for a guy like this is not appropriate.

289
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:26,278
Why are you smiling? I'm scolding you here.

290
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:28,678
I'm smiling because you're scolding me.

291
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:33,058
You are scolding me because you care about me, so I'm even happier.

292
00:25:34,998 --> 00:25:39,128
Ai'Pete, this seems like...

293
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:41,358
Ai'Ae hasn't tried "it" yet.

294
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:43,118
Ai'Pond, shut up.

295
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:45,028
What are you talking about, P'Pond?

296
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:48,838
Well, Ai'Ae has been doing some research lately.

297
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,128
Ouch... That hurts.

298
00:25:51,128 --> 00:25:56,278
Researching about... how to stretch properly before going onto the field or something.

299
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:58,278
Hey! That's perfect.

300
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:02,828
Lately, I've been playing badminton and I feel so sore right after.

301
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,818

302

Hey... No. No...

303
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:09,788
Because for this kind of thing, Ai'Ae can only teach it to Pete.

304
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:13,338
- Too bad.
- Shut your mouth.

305
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:17,528
Don't pay attention to Ai'Pond. It's all nonsense, N'Chompoo.

306
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:19,998
Nonsense? Really?

307
00:26:19,998 --> 00:26:22,398
Fine. Maybe it's not nonsense.

308
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:25,518
I'll teach Pete myself. Happy?

309
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:29,568
Teaching Ai'Pete? Talking as if you know how to do it.

310
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:35,598
Finally, there's a day I gain a victory over Ai'Shorty.

311
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,868
Don't you need to go line up? It's 7:30 a.m. already.
(T/N: High school students line up for the Thai national anthem at 8:00 a.m.)

312
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:41,978
Right. I have to go line up!

313
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:44,598
College is great, huh? You don't even have to line up.

314
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:48,208
I have to leave now. Hello, everyone. Hello.

315
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:53,478
I have to say, Ai'Pete.

316
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,358
You are kind of pitiful.

317
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:58,925
I don't think he'll be able to get it in.

318
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:00,538
Pond, get over here!

319
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:04,438
I'd be stupid if I went. I'm going to go and buy food instead.

320
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:08,028
Ae, what was he talking about?

321
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:11,678
Nothing... I'm going to go buy food. Just wait here.

322
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:13,298
Okay.

323
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,338
Thank you.

324
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:36,598
Right. I was going to ask you this morning. Whose birthday is it?

325
00:27:36,598 --> 00:27:39,978
I brought this for you.

326
00:27:39,978 --> 00:27:43,278
Hey! Why'd you bring it for me? It's not even my birthday.

327
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,838
I... didn't bring it for your birthday,

328
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:48,408
But I wanted to give you something in return,

329
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:50,718
for always helping me.

330
00:27:50,718 --> 00:27:55,708
When I help you, I never expect anything in return.

331
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,568
I...

332
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:03,028
Just accept it already. Ai'Khun-Chai bought this especially for you.

333
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:04,558
He'll feel discouraged.

334
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,438
Just look at his face. He's losing it now.

335
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:08,498
I didn't ask.

336
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:11,218
You are so cold-hearted to me.

337
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:16,238
Should I talk about... what you were searching yesterday?

338
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,698
All right... All right...

339
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:20,408
What did Ai'Pete buy you? Open it. Open it. I want to know already.

340
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,228
Hurry up!

341
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:34,986
Wow. Aren't these the football cleats that you wanted?

342
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:38,488
Wow. Ai'Pete. You really know him!
(T/N: Literally "Your hearts are aligned")

343
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:40,388
How did you even know?

344
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:44,898
If you didn't tell me, I would have thought you were psychic.

345
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:50,078
Do you like them?

346
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:51,198
Ai'Pete.

347
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:52,198
Yes?

348
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,938
Who told you to buy something expensive like this for me?

349
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,405
Uhh... I...

350
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,118
I helped you because I wanted to help.

351
00:29:02,118 --> 00:29:04,868
I don't need anything like this at all!

352
00:29:06,438 --> 00:29:09,438
I don't know how people around you buy a gift for someone.

353
00:29:09,438 --> 00:29:12,168
If it's just a small gift, then I could accept it.

354
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,468
But these are too expensive.

355
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:18,738
Also, I don't want a friend to have to buy me anything expensive either.

356
00:29:18,738 --> 00:29:23,173
Hey... Ai'Ae. Easy, buddy.

357
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:25,578
Ai'Pete intended to get something for you.

358
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:29,368
Those shoes are your size. If you give them back, he can't even wear them.

359
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,888
Just keep them.

360
00:29:30,888 --> 00:29:33,368
Shut the fuck up. I'll deal with you later.

361
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:35,518
Fine, I won't say anything.

362
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:39,558
These shoes, I'll pay you back for them.

363
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:40,978
Do you understand?

364
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:43,438
But I...

365
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:47,128
Got it.

366
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:51,078
If you understand, then that's good. Let's continue eating.

367
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:58,628
Ai Pond, next time, please. Don't butt in.

368
00:29:58,628 --> 00:30:00,138
Fine. I won't butt in then.

369
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:24,768
I knew that you would be sitting and overthinking by yourself.

370
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,208
It's a good thing that I followed you.

371
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:32,758
Thank you, Pond, but I'm okay.

372
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:36,708
Thank me for what? Our plan just failed.

373
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:39,898
Do you know something, Ai'Pete? Overthinking is good.

374
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:44,198
But it could be a disadvantage if you use it with Ai'Ae.

375
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:48,538
Listen to me carefully. Ai'Ae is not a complicated guy.

376
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,678
If he were a street, he's a straight path. There's no turning left or turning right.

377
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:56,608
And if you are standing in a small sub-street. Would he even see you?

378
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:58,498
Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?

379
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:02,328
If you are upset at him about something, just go ahead and tell him.

380
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,308
Or if you don't understand why he's scolding or being mad at you about something,

381
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,028
just ask him.

382
00:31:07,028 --> 00:31:08,818
He'll tell you himself.

383
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:11,758
Like just now. If it were me, I would've already said it.

384
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:16,268
"Hey, Asshole Shorty, I even bought this for you. Why are you being so fussy?"

385
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:21,558
That's all. If you want to be with him, you just need to know what kind of person he is.

386
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:23,928
I'm not telling you to change yourself for him.

387
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,968
Just understand him. That's enough.

388
00:31:27,658 --> 00:31:30,178
Thank you, Pond.

389
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,800
If you want to thank me...

390
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:36,978
I'd like it to be... a PlayStation 4, all right?

391
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,158
I don't mind expensive gifts.

392
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:42,885
Then... I'll excuse myself and get going first.

393
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:44,438
Okay.

394
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,578
One person overthinks too much.

395
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:58,768
While the other person doesn't think of anything at all.

396
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:01,158
Without a love doctor like me,

397
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:03,758
would you guys be able to make it?

398
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:08,518
So you know how to say nice things, too.

399
00:32:08,518 --> 00:32:11,008
Hey, were you secretly listening in?

400
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,468
I wasn't hiding, but you were speaking loudly.

401
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,998
But what you said was good.

402
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:22,838
But... I'm not only good at speaking.

403
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,868
I'm good at other things, too. Want to try?

404
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:30,178
Oh, wow.

405
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:34,718
What's your name? You're really cute.

406
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:36,778
Her name is NaMean.

407
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:39,358
What was your name? I couldn't hear it, since you didn't answer me.

408
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,218
- NaMean.
- NaMean?

409
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:45,378
What a cute name compared to other people around here.

410
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:47,238
Ouch.

411
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:50,488
NaMean, let's leave. If you get too close, you'll get pimples.

412
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:52,598
I get pimples because I wear a lot of makeup.

413
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:55,878
- People around here are harsh. Don't leave. Stay with me.
- Let's go. Let's go.

414
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:57,668
- Get up. Get up. Get up.
- We haven't learned anything.

415
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:59,968
Wash with some alcohol when you get back.

416
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:02,978
You forgot your phone.

417
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:04,602
- You can leave it with me.
- No, thanks.

418
00:33:04,602 --> 00:33:06,892
So you can come back to get it later.

419
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:09,665
Let her have it to call her boyfriend.

420
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:11,971
Bye-bye.

421
00:33:25,664 --> 00:33:29,085
I'm in the stands next to the football field.

422
00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:32,584
Okay.

423
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:13,382
You said you got some information.

424
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:21,058
Before you know what you want to know,

425
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:23,654
tell me first.

426
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:27,299
How are you involved with this kind of garbage?

427
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:32,564
He's my senior from high school.

428
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:41,539
In my life, I have met so many two-faced people.

429
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,569
But with such kindergarten-like lies like yours,

430
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:46,776
how would I not be able to see through them?

431
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:49,237
There's nothing. Really.

432
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,630
I hate people who want to take advantage of me.

433
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,490
As much as people who are hiding things that I want to know from me.

434
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,009
Now, tell me.

435
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:08,194
How are you involved with him?

436
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:10,474
There's nothing. Really.

437
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:14,154
What are going to do to Ai'Pete?

438
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,334
It's nothing, Ae.

439
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,264
Come here. I have something to say to you.

440
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:20,131
Ae... Ae...

441
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:20,781
Ae!

442
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:24,184
Ae, hold on. Ae. Ae, please.

443
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:25,214
Please.

444
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:40,744
Ae.

445
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,514
Ae, please. Hold on.

446
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,089
What business do you have with him?

447
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,970
I didn't have anything. Really.

448
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,154
Do you have anything you want to tell me?

449
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:59,324
Yesterday, Ai'Pond said I spoke too harshly.

450
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:03,199
So, I came to ask you. Do you have anything to say to me?

451
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,890
I was just upset.

452
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:07,424
What?!

453
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:11,784
I was upset that you scolded me.

454
00:36:11,784 --> 00:36:15,514
I just wanted to give you something.

455
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,789
Of course, I had to scold you.

456
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,484
I know you are rich, Ai'Pete.

457
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:22,294
But I want you to appreciate the value of money.

458
00:36:22,294 --> 00:36:25,314
7,000 baht (Approx. $225 USD) might be nothing to you, but it's a lot to me.

459
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:27,244
And another thing, I don't want you to get into a bad habit.

460
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:31,314
When someone helps you, you repay them with a gift?

461
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,364
I don't know who you will meet in the future.

462
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:36,764
They might approach you for some benefits.

463
00:36:36,764 --> 00:36:38,763
The reason I scolded you...

464
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,469
is because I care about you. Do you understand?

465
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:43,494
You care about me?

466
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:46,434
Yeah, I care.

467
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:48,294
Next time, if you want to repay me.

468
00:36:48,294 --> 00:36:50,764
Just bring me Shrimp Rice Soup. That's enough.

469
00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:53,154
Do you understand, Koon-Chai?

470
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,854
I understand.

471
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:59,144
If you understand, that's good. Don't listen to Ai'Pond anymore.

472
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:01,224
You know that he's a bad influence.

473
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:03,494
But Pond always wishes the best for you.

474
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:05,774
Are you saying that he's better than me?

475
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:09,614
Not at all! I didn't think he was better than you at all.

476
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:14,564
I know that I'm the best for you.

477
00:37:25,747 --> 00:37:28,297
Faster... Faster...

478
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:34,207
You!

479
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:40,314
You!

480
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:44,114
You are a friend of Ai'Ae, right?

481
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:47,834
Why? What kind of trouble are you trying to give to my friend this time?

482
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,961
How close is he to Pete?

483
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:54,724
Ah. Now, I get it.

484
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:58,154
Someone with no friends like yourself must be really jealous of him.

485
00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:01,424
To see Ai'Ae and Ai'Pete this close.

486
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:03,694
I don't know how close they are.

487
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:05,694
But someone told me,

488
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:09,364
Ai'Ae and Ai'Pete always have breakfast together.

489
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:13,364
And... Ai'Ae gives Ai'Pete a ride every day.

490
00:38:13,364 --> 00:38:16,374
And... when they watch a movie or go shopping,

491
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:18,524
they always like to go together.

492
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:22,074
To the point that if someone didn't know them,

493
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:24,114
they probably wouldn't know that they were in different majors.

494
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:25,784
Right?

495
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:29,614
Why? Jealous much?

496
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:38,073
Disgusting.

497
00:38:39,102 --> 00:38:40,772
What are you saying?

498
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:47,769
I said their relationship is disgusting.

499
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:59,284
You can say insult me but don't insult my friends. Understand?

500
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:00,594
Do you understand?

501
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:04,894
Ai'Can... Ai'Can...

502
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:07,064
- Ai'Can... Hey... Ai'Can...
- P' Let go of me.

503
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:09,854
- Ai'Can... Stop...
- You remember this.

504
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:15,194
You can insult me, but don't insult my friend! Do you understand?!

505
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:18,594
You jealous son of the bitch. You unloved asshole!

506
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:20,014
You friendless asshole!

507
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:23,714
P', let go of me. Don't you dare walk away from me!

508
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:26,094
- P', I'm going to punch him.
- You punched him already.

509
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:28,514
- Come back here.
- Ai'Can, that's enough.

510
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:32,514
You think that makes you look cool, asshole? Nobody wants to be friends with you.

511
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:36,324
Why? Jealous? You are just a jealous fuck.

512
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:38,144
Can, enough.

513
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:41,164
P', ah...

514
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,024
You shouldn't stop me.

515
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:50,014
Easy... You have already punched him. That should be enough.

516
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:51,914
Stop.

517
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:05,028
So overprotective that it's funny.

518
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,010
You said your friends are important.

519
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,525
Without money, they are useless.

520
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,960
I'll prove it to you.

521
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,645
That relationships between people, just how fragile they can be.

522
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:51,147
@*&@(#&... @#Y@I#YI...

523
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:53,059
$#*&*@&*#&@#!!!!

524
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:56,914
Ai'Tin, I hope you suddenly get salty... Suddenly get burning hot.

525
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,244
I hope you get cavities.

526
00:40:59,244 --> 00:41:02,654
P'Can! What the heck are you doing?

527
00:41:02,654 --> 00:41:05,424
The smoke is getting inside the house. It's smelly.

528
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,324
I'm cursing someone.

529
00:41:07,324 --> 00:41:09,534
What the hell kind of cursing is that?

530
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:12,544
And what are these?

531
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:16,094
Did you dump in all this salt and chilies in there?

532
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:18,764
What? I'm burning chilies and burning salt.
(T/N: the authentic Thai way to curse somebody)

533
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:21,664
If I don't dump in salt and chilies, what else am I supposed to dump in?

534
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:25,784
Such a pea-brain brother.

535
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:31,414
Instead of wasting time on this kind of nonsense, wouldn't it be better to study and improve yourself?

536
00:41:31,414 --> 00:41:35,114
Okay. Fine... I'll use my brain more next time.

537
00:41:35,114 --> 00:41:36,924
Not giving up yet?

538
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:40,434
Put out the fire and clean up already. It stinks.

539
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:42,144
I'm not even done yet.

540
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,824
Do you want me to stuff these chilies in your mouth?

541
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:45,564
Fine... I'll go.

542
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,929
P'Can!

543
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:49,954
Clean this up first.

544
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:53,834
If I went, I'd be stupid. Clean it up for me, all right?

545
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:57,484
So, who's cleaning this up?

546
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:04,814
I only have one older brother and he's always putting everything on me.

547
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,509
Tar... This way.

548
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:37,564
Tar, are you tired? How are you? Have you eaten yet? Did you get some sleep?

549
00:42:37,564 --> 00:42:41,994
Dad and Mom wanted to say sorry for not picking you up, but they promised your favorite foods waiting at home.

550
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:47,234
P'Tum, calm down. One question at a time, please. I don't know which question to answer.

551
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:50,014
You don't need to answer me.

552
00:42:50,014 --> 00:42:52,434
Just seeing that you are fine, that's enough to make me happy.

553
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:54,254
Come on. Let's go home.

554
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:55,484
Here. I'll take this.

555
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:57,354
Thank you.

556
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:07,354
I'm done with classes, Ae.

557
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:13,974
Oh... I don't want to bother you.

558
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:18,095
I'll see you there, then.

559
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:28,984
[Preview]
Is that P'Pete?

560
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:32,194
Why is N'Chompoo helping you to study English?

561
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:33,394
My English skill is weak.

562
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:35,584
Actually, you can have me help you study.

563
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:36,654
I'm at the International Program.

564
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:38,534
What's this tense?

565
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:42,194
Lately, I've only met unfortunate things.

566
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:45,114
Talking to an idiot is wasting my time.

567
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,514
Are you calling me an idiot?

568
00:43:48,514 --> 00:43:50,664
I really missed this house.

569
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:52,764
If you missed it, then come back.

570
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:55,800
I finally set a goal, I'm going to be a French chef for sure.

571
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,501
Is it because Ai'Tharn loves French food?
