26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,210
Have you seen him lately?

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,930
Who are you talking about, Tin?

28
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,085
That guy...

29
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:30,779
Can.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,920
Tin... you're asking if I've seen Can lately, right?

31
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,350
Before the exam, I did see him.

32
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,680
But, right now, the Thai program is having exams.

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,900
And...

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,370
And...?

35
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:51,185
Forget about it.

36
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,500
It's nothing.

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,580
Can asked me for your number, too.

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,080
Can came to ask me for your number... and

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,550
he also asked me where you parked your car.

40
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,200
But I also don't know why Can was asking.

41
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,880
Can I have his number?

42
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,100
I... promised Can...

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,960
that I wouldn't give his number to you.

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,750
Why?

45
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,250
I don't know either.

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,550
But... why are you wasting time asking me?

47
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,180
Normally with just a phone call, you'd know right away.

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,910
I don't want him to be mad.

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,130
Okay.

50
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,960
If he were to know that I got his number through that method,

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,110
he'd be extremely furious for sure.

52
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,070
I don't want to violate his privacy.

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,970
Keep trying, Tin.

54
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,000
Can is a good guy. I guarantee that Can will understand you.

55
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,650
Good morning, everybody. How are you all today?

56
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,870
We'll be doing English today, right?

57
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,830
So, I'm going to teach you different types of essays. All right?

58
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,050
We have... "Informative."

59
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,610
Informative as the name says: we inform. Right?

60
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,200
So by writing this essay, you need to...

61
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,620
Good... Let's go and eat together.

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,420
I'm... going... to... go... study...

63
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,310
Geez! You're too uptight!

64
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,170
You need to relax your body first.

65
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,860
Once your body is relaxed, your brain will perform better already.

66
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,910
And then once you study... It's like "click" and in your head right away.

67
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,370
But if you're stressed, then you can eat ice cream with me.

68
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,560
But we have to eat it after we finish eating, all right? I guarantee that this method "WORKS."

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,680
Let me... seriously... ask you...

70
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,840
That method of yours, did it... really... help you... in... the exam?

71
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,260
Nah... I just guessed every single question in that exam.

72
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,160
But why should we be so stressed?

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,610
Just try looking at the bright future ahead of you.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,100
You can... go... and look... ahead... yourself...

75
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,150
I'm... going... to... study...

76
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,010
Geez, Ai'Good...

77
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,220
- Don't leave yet...
- Can!

78
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,600
How did you get here?

79
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,740
I have some business to discuss with you.

80
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,880
This... is... your... friend, right?

81
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,550
Then... you... should... treat him... to... lunch, all right?

82
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,580
Bye-bye...

83
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,270
Ai'Good! Don't go just yet!

84
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,260
Ai'Good!!!

85
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,820
Wait.

86
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,610
Let go.

87
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,870
You still haven't had lunch yet, right?

88
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,800
Good. I also haven't eaten yet.

89
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,620
Let go of my arm already.

90
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,380
Are you scared?

91
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm not scared.

92
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,450
But I'm not going to eat.

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,330
Or could it be that you want everyone in your school to know...

94
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,160
that your real full name...

95
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,070
is Cantaloupe.

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,830
Whatever you want to say, just say it then!

97
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,100
Why did you still apologize to me?

98
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,480
Sorry means sorry.

99
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,480
That day you might have lied to me and even tricked me,

100
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,660
but I was probably speaking too harshly.

101
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,430
So I just apologized. That's all. Done.

102
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,540
What if what I said that day was the truth?

103
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,140
What's with you?

104
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,800
It's true, then it's a lie.

105
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,150
I'm confused you know!

106
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,970
Well, what if what I told you that day that I was speaking the truth, would you believe me?

107
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,840
I'd believe you.

108
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,610
Well, I'm someone who easily believes people.

109
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,610
That's what everyone says.

110
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,510
Therefore, please don't lie to me.

111
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,450
If you keep lying to me, I'd end up believing you anyway.

112
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,780
What a waste of time...

113
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,170
And then you'd keep calling me stupid, too.

114
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,870
And another thing,

115
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,780
I'm someone who trusts my friends.

116
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,960
Therefore, don't insult Ai'Ae!

117
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,780
Otherwise, I'll be mad!

118
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,880
That's pretty cute.

119
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,160
Me? Cute?

120
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,030
Even though you're stupid,

121
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,880
but you're also a stupid person who's cute.

122
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,310
Follow me.

123
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,250
Is he complimenting me or insulting me?

124
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,650
Hey, Ai'Tin!

125
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,550
Are you complimenting me or insulting me?!

126
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,860
Come back and let's talk first!

127
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,360
Where are you going?

128
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,020
To eat, of course.

129
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,420
I'm not going to eat with you.

130
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,340
Well, you're the one who said that I need to apologize.

131
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,680
I am the one who said that...

132
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,310
Someone like you is going to apologize to me?

133
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,120
A top tier Khun Chai...

134
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,220
and dirt like me?

135
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,630
That's crazy already...

136
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,100
I won't believe it.

137
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,370
But you'll have to believe it,

138
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,620
that this time, I intend to treat you to a meal as an apology.

139
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,070
Ai'Tin, don't think you can throw money at me.

140
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,910
Didn't you say you'd believe me?

141
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,140
Well, you always like to lie to me...

142
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,420
But this time, I'm saying the truth.

143
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,660
If you're going to treat me, then treat me.

144
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
I'll eat then...

145
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,960
But once we're done eating, we'll go on our way. All right?

146
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,170
We'll go our separate ways.

147
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,020
Wow... It looks damn delicious, dude.

148
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,550
This one is also really yummy!

149
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,300
Why don't you eat, dude? Just staring at me isn't going to make you full...

150
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,710
Swallow your food, then speak. I can't understand what you're saying.

151
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,030
Are you sure... that you're going to treat me?

152
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,300
Why did you get my number from Pete?

153
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,300
What number? I don't understand...

154
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,530
I don't have it... Did you imagine it?

155
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,610
Pete told me.

156
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,270
So?

157
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,180
It's because of you...

158
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:41,170
I didn't know whether you were joking or saying the truth...

159
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,730
But even if you were insulting me,

160
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,900
I still shouldn't have spoken harshly you to like that.

161
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,940
At first, I planned to call to apologize.

162
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,740
But if you heard my voice, then you'd just insult me again.

163
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,280
So I decided to stick a note on your car instead.

164
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,700
That's all.

165
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,610
So why did you tell Pete... not to give me your number?

166
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,570
Well, then you'd call to yell at me again,

167
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,470
for sticking a note on your car.

168
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,010
Why are you grabbing my hand?

169
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,150
Can I have your number, Can?

170
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,030
I'm not giving it.

171
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,660
And let go of my hand, too.

172
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm eating.

173
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,380
Can, can I have your number?

174
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,910
I'm not giving it.

175
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,420
Even if you threaten me, I still wouldn't give it.

176
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,170
I'm not threatening you.

177
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm begging you.

178
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,040
Someone like you?

179
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,770
I'm begging you.

180
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,140
Please...

181
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,250
Cantaloupe.

182
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,921
Who said you can call me by my real name?

183
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,250
I'm not giving it to you, you asshole!

184
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,934
Geez!

185
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,780
Today, you're being pretty strange.

186
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,440
How so?

187
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,540
Thank you.

188
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,550
I don't know.

189
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,930
You've been strange since you called me cute.

190
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,130
Don't tell me that you got beaten up by Ai'Ae to the point your brain has flipped?

191
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,070
What does it have to do with him?!

192
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,540
All right, it doesn't have anything to do with him.

193
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,730
What are you so cranky for?

194
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,070
So are you going to give me your number?

195
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,470
No... Never.

196
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,440
Cantaloupe.

197
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,040
Are you trying to call my dad...

198
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,380
Whatever.

199
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,830
Cantaloupe is pretty soft.

200
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,330
Cantaloupe is pretty sweet.

201
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,530
Cantaloupe is pretty yummy.

202
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,670
If it's yummy then just eat it!

203
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,800
What are you staring at my face for?

204
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,800
I guess I started liking Cantaloupe now.

205
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,160
Now what?

206
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,910
So are you going to give me your number?

207
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,300
I told you I'm not giving it, so that means I'm not giving it. Stop asking already.

208
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,960
So now you're done apologizing to me, right?

209
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,870
So, I can leave.

210
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,480
Wait.

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,350
This is for your mom.

212
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,110
My mom?

213
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,060
As for this... it's for your little sister.

214
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't want them.

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,940
Why'd you bring them for? I don't want them.

216
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,870
In exchange for your number.

217
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,700
Ai'Tin!

218
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,910
I'm not someone you can just throw money at!

219
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,660
And what you're doing,

220
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,210
you're acting as if my mom doesn't have the means to use these kinds of things.

221
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,040
Let me tell you.

222
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,170
Even if you were to pile one million baht in front of my face,

223
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,470
you still wouldn't be able to buy me!

224
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,520
You should just take them back. I don't want them.

225
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,640
You're misunderstanding this.

226
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,920
Misunderstanding my ass!

227
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,350
You were just throwing these bags at me.

228
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,930
I'm not trying to use money to buy you.

229
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,110
What? Do I need to let you throw these bags right at my head

230
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,230
for you to finally admit that you were trying to buy me with money?

231
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,910
What a waste of time!

232
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,910
I shouldn't have come with you.

233
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,960
Wait!

234
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm actually just trying to flirt with you...

235
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,910
What?

236
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,510
What did you just say?

237
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,050
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,040
I didn't think that giving you things would make you feel so bad.

239
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,500
It's the only way I know to keep a good relationship.

240
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,010
This time...

241
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,510
I really wasn't trying to look down on you at all.

242
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,440
But I just thought you would be happy,

243
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,050
because I saw that you love your mom and little sister.

244
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,510
I don't know what I have to do

245
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,230
for you to start seeing me in a positive way either.

246
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,020
What I've done is because I'm hitting on you.

247
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,230
I think...

248
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,340
I should leave.

249
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,500
I was hit on by a guy...

250
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,720
Yes, Can, you got hit on by a guy.

251
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,900
And that guy is Ai'Tin!?!!?

252
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,910
Yes, Can...

253
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,150
You were hit on by Ai'Tin!

254
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,570
Was I seriously hit on by Ai'Tin?!

255
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,660
Yes, Can.

256
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,440
You were just hit on by Ai'Tin

257
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,560
It's true.

258
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,600
I was hit on by Ai'Tin

259
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,880
I was hit on by Ai'Tin...

260
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,260
Right now, you're done with your exams. Right?

261
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,680
Then... that means that you're free now, right?

262
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,350
Next week, should we watch a movie together?

263
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,670
Tar.

264
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,200
What is it?

265
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,470
There was cream on your lip.

266
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,570
Thank you.

267
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,060
And finally...the freedom I've awaited is finally here!

268
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,170
Don't be so extra. It was just finishing an exam.

269
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,000
Look...

270
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,150
If you had been forced to memorize the books for 2-3 weeks back-to-back like me, you probably would feel the same!

271
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,060
You're saying that as if we took different exams than you. Aren't they the same?

272
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,650
- Why?
- Oh right! Since we finished exams, should we celebrate?

273
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,180
I think... I'm going to head back to the dorm.

274
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,380
So you're not going to join us?

275
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,820
I think I won't. I should go back and pack up my stuff in the dorm first.

276
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,720
Next semester, I won't be in the same dorm.

277
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,810
Right, Ai'Ping. You're not going to go back and pack up your stuff at the dorm?

278
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,160
They're not going to kick me out today or tomorrow.

279
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,260
Let's go eat first, then go back to pack and we'll still make it.

280
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,770
Then... I'm going to go back first, all right?

281
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,900
- What? Why?
- See you later.
-Yeah.

282
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,220
Did he not understand what you said?

283
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,260
Hello... I'm on my way. Just wait for me there.

284
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,320
I think... he's not in a rush to get his things...

285
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,060
Are you thinking the same thing, B2?

286
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,980
I think so too, B1.

287
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:54,616
He's going to see Ai'Pete for sure!

288
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,680
So, where is Ai'Pond, anyway?

289
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,030
Ai'Pond? He went to see his girlfriend.

290
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,670
Again?

291
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:09,220
So now the only ones left are... you and me then.

292
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,460
Yeah. Me and you.

293
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:18,486
Where am I going? Where are you taking me?

294
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,250
I don't want to.

295
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,670
Lately, have you seen Tin at the football field at all?

296
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,310
No. It's exam time, so no practice.

297
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,420
And... have you seen Can lately?

298
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,548
He has his own exams. It's got nothing to do with me.

299
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:35,973
So... have you seen Tin going to see Can at all?

300
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:37,808
No.

301
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:41,652
I think that... lately, Tin and Can seem pretty strange.

302
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:46,000
Like the other day. Tin asked for Can's number from me.

303
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,220
And Can also asked me for Tin's number, too.

304
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,900
Ae, what do you think?

305
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,320
Do you really want to know how I feel?

306
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,950
Yes.

307
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,220
Where are we going, Ae?

308
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,420
Ae, where are we going?

309
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,740
I'm thinking just when will you stop saying other guys' names for once!

310
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,140
Ae, but I...

311
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,730
I'm not listening to any excuses.

312
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,160
You're with me. You don't need to think about any other guys.

313
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,940
You understand?

314
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,910
Ae, where are we off in a rush to?

315
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,070
To punish you, of course.

316
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,500
Ae! I didn't mean to talk about other guys, but Tin...

317
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,730
I won't say it anymore, Ae!

318
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,030
B-But Ae, what are you doing?

319
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,410
I already told you. That I'm going to punish you.

320
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,310
Didn't I tell you before?

321
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,400
That lately when I'm near you, I'm always having bad thoughts.

322
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,780
Do you want to know what that is?

323
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,860
I don't know.

324
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,870
What is it?

325
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,480
Then I'll tell you.

326
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,230
The walls in this room are damn thin.

327
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,550
Are you feeling hot?

328
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:57,337
Not that much, Ae.

329
00:23:57,337 --> 00:24:02,298
Ae, you just finished your exam. You should rest. I'll get up so you can sleep.

330
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:08,357
So... have your legs stopped shaking yet?

331
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:09,832
Ae!

332
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:13,207
There are some things you don't have to say so frankly!

333
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:19,280
You smell so nice.

334
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,910
Ae. No, Ae...

335
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,960
- Just a bit.
- No... Not at the dorm, Ae.

336
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,560
No...

337
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,250
No, Ae... Ae... Not in the dorm, Ae.

338
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,735
Ai'Ae, can I borrow your bicycle...?

339
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:34,755
Wow... Wow... Wow... Wow... Wow...

340
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,950
Hey! My friend has made some progress!

341
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,140
They're even laying down and cuddling!

342
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,920
But I smell something kind of fishy...

343
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,680
Or could it be the smell of...

344
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Shut your eyes now! If you don't shut your eyes, I'm going to shove my shoes in your mouth!

345
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,320
Fine... Fine... I won't look then!

346
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,021
Then I'm going to head out first. Whatever you guys want to do, just do it.

347
00:24:55,021 --> 00:24:58,907
But don't be too loud! This is your dorm! Everyone will hear it! I'm off!

348
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,950
This pair is so cute.

349
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,535
Oh! This pair is also cute.

350
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:18,485
I can't pick one.

351
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:21,760
I'm saving them all. Capture...

352
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,436
Capture...

353
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:35,550
And that pea-brain big brother of mine, is he going to be able to find P'Tin's pictures for me yet?

354
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:44,245
But I really want to have it now.

355
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:48,198
Don't let me do it myself, Brother Can.

356
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,060
Brother Can.

357
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,920
What is he dazed about this time?

358
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,570
Brother Can!!!

359
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,220
What are you shouting for? You pushed me, too.

360
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,810
You gave me a heart attack.

361
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,510
Right, Ai'Ley. Do you know of this bag brand?

362
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,560
Sure. Quite expensive bags are like 10k or more. Why do you ask?

363
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,850
10k or more?

364
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,300
He was using 10k in exchange for a number?

365
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,430
Is he crazy or something?

366
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,370
I don't care about what you have been through, but...

367
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,610
but have you gotten P'Tin's picture yet?

368
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,340
Not yet.

369
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,180
I'll give you one more week.

370
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,660
If you still can't get it, I'll ask myself.

371
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,770
You can't!

372
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,710
Why can't I?

373
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,020
- I said you can't, so you can't.
- So when am I going to get it then?

374
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,660
Okay, all right... I'll ask him for you...

375
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,580
Really?

376
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,930
Promise?

377
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,200
Yeah... Yeah...

378
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,370
Thank you so much.

379
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,440
Ai'Ley.

380
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,830
Is a guy... and a guy... flirting... strange at all?

381
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,700
A guy? Where?

382
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,470
Who's flirting with whom? Which guy?

383
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,540
When? How? Spill it.

384
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,740
Friends... Friends at the university.

385
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,850
Which friend though?

386
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,532
A... close friend... but we kind of drifted apart...

387
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:51,719
Um... d-drifted... drifted really far...

388
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:58,729
Well... it's not strange at all. Guys these days... Plenty of them date each other.

389
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:02,210
So, please tell your "friends."

390
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,700
If a guy hits on him, then he doesn't need to act disgusted about him or anything.

391
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,880
It'll make the other guy sad and it'll hurt his feelings.

392
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,761
It's not strange, right?

393
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:17,486
It's not strange.

394
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,380
Friends of friends? Friends of friends?

395
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,795
Hitting on each other? Friends of friends hitting on each other?

396
00:28:24,795 --> 00:28:26,510
Who are they?

397
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:30,824
Or could it be...

398
00:28:30,824 --> 00:28:33,405
It has to be...

399
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:35,739
P'Tin and P'Pete are hitting on each other for sure!

400
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,740
It has to be P'Tin and P'Pete... For sure! For sure!

401
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,430
"Tin?"

402
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,660
"What is it, Pete?"

403
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,700
Heaven!

404
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,560
So tweeting this.

405
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,210
Tweet it... Tweet it away...

406
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,245
It'll be trending for sure.

407
00:28:57,245 --> 00:29:01,645
Oh! P'Tin and P'Pete!

408
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:06,505
They're such a perfect match! So good.

409
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:08,140
"Tin?"

410
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,380
"What is it, Pete?"

411
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,650
"I think... we should try kissing, how about it?"

412
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:19,760
It's got me feeling so shy!

413
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,810
What should I do?

414
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,710
I want to call him, but I'm afraid to.

415
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,920
But I also need his picture.

416
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,899
Think... Think... Can...

417
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,460
Right!!! Ai'Pete!

418
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,140
Hello?

419
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,230
Pete.

420
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,850
Can you please tell Ai'Tin that I want to meet with him?

421
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,560
Why don't you tell him yourself?

422
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,920
I don't wanna call him though...

423
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,210
Can, if you miss him, then you should just tell Tin.

424
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,820
Hey! How does wanting to meet him mean I miss him??

425
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,840
Well, isn't it the same meaning, Can?

426
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,550
I didn't want to see him or anything.

427
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,420
He's the one who hit on me fir...

428
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,950
Fuck...

429
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,180
Is that so? Then, I'll ask Tin first. All right?

430
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:33,150
Ai'Can! Why do you always have such loose lips!

431
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,837
You're so good at talking!

432
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:38,092
Now, he knows everything.

433
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,200
What is it?

434
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,110
Tin said to meet him at the mall at 11:00 a.m.

435
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,730
And if you want to change the time, then you have to call and change it with him yourself.

436
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,420
Otherwise, Tin won't listen.

437
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,710
Then, that's all. All right?

438
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,018
Ai'Dictator!

439
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:09,330
Are you Hitler's son or something?

440
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,360
No. He doesn't look like Hitler.

441
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:19,270
Just why does Ai'Ley want his picture anyway?!

442
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:25,950
Ae?

443
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,200
What is it?

444
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,060
Ae, how many days is your trip?

445
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,050
3 days and 2 nights.

446
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,060
Is that so?

447
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,880
Will you be lonely?

448
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,670
I won't be lonely... You're only going to be gone for a few days...

449
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,330
If you think you'll be lonely, then you should say so.

450
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,710
I'm afraid you'll be sick of me. You're only going on a trip with friends.

451
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,380
Honestly, you... Will you be lonely?

452
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,730
Well... a little bit...

453
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,810
Then you should just tell me directly.

454
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,010
If you will be lonely, just say it.

455
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,840
Because I, myself, will... probably be missing you, too.

456
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,000
Then, can I call you when you're on the trip?

457
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,010
Have I ever stopped you?

458
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,080
What are you even wearing?

459
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,460
Your shirt is long-sleeved. Your pants are even long.

460
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,520
Did you think you were in Milan or something?

461
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,730
Me dressing like this is correct. Because I'm here for a date.

462
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,570
What date? We're just here to talk. It's not a date or anything.

463
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,450
Then, whatever you want to say, just say it.

464
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,220
Then, that's the same thing as you accepting that this isn't a date.

465
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,610
Your thinking process is pretty blunt, Cantaloupe.

466
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,430
Who said you could use my full name?!

467
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,220
I ought to...

468
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,060
I told you already that I'm hitting on you.

469
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,780
And by inviting you out,

470
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,680
it means that we're on a date. Isn't that right?

471
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,250
It's not true.

472
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,030
I just came to ask you... You saying that you were hitting on me... You were kidding, right?

473
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,000
You really want me to answer that here?

474
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:47,158
Somewhere else is fine...

475
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,600
Good. Then let's go eat together.

476
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,335
I'm not going!

477
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,630
I just planned on coming to talk and then going back right after.

478
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,810
Do you really not know?

479
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:11,240
That by inviting someone before noon means that they're inviting you to eat together?

480
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,870
And you agreed.

481
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,260
Then that means that you've accepted my invitation.

482
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,260
So you have to eat with me.

483
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,120
I didn't know that.

484
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,120
Then you should know now.

485
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,280
Follow me.

486
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,810
Follow me already, Cantaloupe.

487
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,840
I fucking wanted this!

488
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,170
It must be perfect for gaming.

489
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,640
And it even takes really pretty pictures at night, too!

490
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,660
Buy it then.

491
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,650
It's 30K (Approx. $963 USD), dude... Not 300 (Approx $9).

492
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,500
Want me to buy it for you then?

493
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:46,479
Do you want this phone in my hands to hit you on the head then?

494
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,630
I told you already, you can't buy me with money.

495
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,300
But I really fucking want it...

496
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,270
But, hey, I've already made a deal with my mom.

497
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,050
If my grades for this semester are good,

498
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,270
then I'll have my mom help me buy it.

499
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,670
And I'll pay her back 1K (Approx. $32 USD) a month.

500
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,950
1K every month? By the time you're done, it'd be about 2 years.

501
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,980
But I want it though.

502
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,240
It's really expensive.

503
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,710
I don't have the means to buy it myself.

504
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,750
Installments are perfect for me.

505
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,480
When is your birthday?

506
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,330
It's still half a year away...

507
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,380
Why?

508
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,980
At first, I was thinking of buying it as a birthday present.

509
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,570
But it's still six more months...

510
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,350
Then...

511
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:41,070
Should I buy it for you as something special for us having known each other for 3 months?

512
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,310
That's too close, Ai'Tin!

513
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
You're face is red, Can.

514
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,740
I need to poop! Then...

515
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,670
I'm going to poop first, all right?

516
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,130
You must be crazy, Ai'Can!

517
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,220
Why is my face so hot like this?

518
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,080
You can't just go along with him, Ai'Can!

519
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,520
You can't just go along with him...

520
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,600
Why do we have to talk nicely to him?

521
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,300
If it weren't for his last name being so big, he'd just be known as some typical drug-addict kid.

522
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,730
Oh! Where have you been?

523
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,750
And why is your face so wet?

524
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,180
Ai'Tin! What those people were saying...

525
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,580
What the hell does that mean?

526
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,900
So, what did those people say?

527
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,570
They said that... you're a drug-addicted socialite.

528
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,750
Are you taking drugs?

529
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,240
Do you believe them or something?

530
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,840
If I believed it, would I have been asking you?

531
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,730
Don't be stupid.

532
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,200
So, what exactly does it mean?

533
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,470
Why don't we find somewhere to sit and talk.

534
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,830
Ai'Tin, when are you going to start telling me?

535
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,280
There's nothing really interesting about it.

536
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,440
Interesting or not, I'll be the one to decide it myself.

537
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,640
My time is valuable you know!

538
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,480
But if... if you buy me another drink,

539
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,340
I can wait to listen to you.

540
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,870
Do you want to hear a tale?

541
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,670
I don't want to listen to a tale!

542
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,940
I want to hear your story.

543
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,210
There was a very big house.

544
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,230
There was a little brother who thought he had no one.

545
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,670
His father went to work,

546
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,230
and his mother went to social gatherings.

547
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,220
All he had was his older brother

548
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,350
who always took care of him and gave him attention.

549
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,850
Whatever he wanted, he would go find it for him.

550
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,840
At the age of 8,

551
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,350
that little brother was sent to study abroad,

552
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,150
even though he didn't want to go.

553
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,840
So there was only his older brother

554
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,080
who comforted him

555
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,530
and told him the reason

556
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,370
that it should be a good opportunity to see how big the world was.

557
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,970
That which the older brother never got.

558
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,580
Abroad,

559
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,350
his brother always looked after him, always sending and picking him up from school.

560
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,530
and kept him company;

561
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,080
utting in so much effort to take good care of him until he left.

562
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,700
The little brother thought his big brother was his everything.

563
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,550
He was the one he trusted the most.

564
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,100
He was his whole world.

565
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:36,600
But after a while came a day when the older brother never contacted the little brother again.

566
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,880
So the little brother got attached to his friends,

567
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,050
lacking responsibility.

568
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,000
Once he was 15 years old,

569
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,310
a friend invited the younger brother to an acquaintance's house.

570
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,500
He had them sneak out of the dorm together.

571
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,070
But once they arrived at the party,

572
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,680
it wasn't a regular party.

573
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,200
Everyone there were using drugs.

574
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,020
And it was quite strange.

575
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,440
It was quite strange indeed.

576
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,110
They had a party every week.

577
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,150
But just the younger brother going for the first time,

578
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,740
the police suddenly came in

579
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,210
and arrested everyone there.

580
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,400
On the next morning,

581
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,970
that ended up in the front pages in Thailand.

582
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,170
"A rich socialite addicted to drugs arrested abroad"

583
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,900
Even though they tested the younger brother's body and never found any drugs in his system,

584
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,860
but he had to be sent back to Thailand.

585
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,100
His father looked at him with disappointment.

586
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,510
His mother called him an unloving son.

587
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,780
He destroyed the name and reputation of the whole family.

588
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,600
He became the topic of gossip in social circles,

589
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,000
"The son and heir of a billionaire, addicted to drugs."

590
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:06,610
There was only his older brother who always took care and comforted him.

591
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,440
He was the only place the younger brother could lean on.

592
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,800
But finally, the truth came out.

593
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,280
That day, the younger brother was being forced to go back to studying abroad.

594
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,730
His big brother was very drunk,

595
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,270
and finally revealed the whole truth.

596
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:34,060
The older brother was the one that convinced their dad and mom to send the younger brother abroad.

597
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,870
He's the one who hired friends to bring his younger brother to the party.

598
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:43,970
He's the one who paid friends to bring his younger brother to the party.

599
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,110
He was the one to called the police.

600
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,210
He's the one who sent the news to the reporters in Thailand.

601
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,410
He was the one behind everything.

602
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,610
And the older brother said,

603
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,050
"You should have just died already."

604
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,830
That's all there is at the end of the story.

605
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,980
Why are you making that face?

606
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,810
You take me to your house right now.

607
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,430
Why?

608
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,800
I'm going to punch your older brother's face, of course!

609
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,380
He's a fucking piece of shit!

610
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,930
Actually, "shit" isn't even enough!

611
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:35,220
Shit... Does he even have any humanity still?

612
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,240
Thanks.

613
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,280
What are you thanking me for?

614
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,970
You believed the story I told you, didn't you?

615
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,980
If you tell me to believe it,

616
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,720
then I'll believe you.

617
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,050
I like you.

618
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,213
And it's because I like you,

619
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:04,920
so I don't want you to became my older brother's target.

620
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,430
Just you believing me,

621
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,480
that alone is enough.

622
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,300
I believe you.

623
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,250
Then that's enough.

624
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,970
I really don't understand rich people.

625
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,030
They're actually siblings, and to be able to do that...

626
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,530
And your dad and mom are also stupid for letting your older brother fool them!

627
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,260
Also, that lie about drugs.

628
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,380
I don't know what word to insult him with. Even the word "asshole" might not be enough.

629
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,820
He should be called... "double asshole" or something.

630
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,930
Here.

631
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,410
What is it?

632
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,470
It's yours.

633
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,570
What the heck is this?

634
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,950
I said that it's yours.

635
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,550
I don't want it.

636
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,150
I'm not going to let anyone buy me with money.

637
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,710
I'm not going to give it to you for free.

638
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,270
You would've had to pay your mom bit by bit anyway.

639
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,570
You're just changing it to pay me instead.

640
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,770
Then that means... I'd owe you then!

641
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,460
Even if you don't want it, I'd just throw it away anyway.

642
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,150
I already have one.

643
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,450
And another two tablets.

644
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,570
Either way, I wouldn't use it.

645
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,150
You rich kid...

646
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,210
I bought it as a package.

647
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,720
The price is cheaper.

648
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,300
You'd owe me less.

649
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,550
But you'd have to change your number.

650
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,100
Fine.

651
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,660
I'm ready to throw away my old sim card right away.

652
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,360
Your number is already on my phone, too.

653
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,630
Right, Ai Tin. Can I take your picture?

654
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,760
To set as your picture when you call.

655
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,140
1... 2 ... 3—!

656
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,680
What the hell are you doing?

657
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,540
I don't like taking pictures alone.

658
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,650
If you want to take a picture, then it has to be together.

659
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,950
I also don't want to...

660
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,730
Then I'm not taking it.

661
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,230
All right. I'll take it. I'll take it then.

662
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,280
Geez, what a damn fussy guy.

663
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,900
Can't even take a picture by himself.

664
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,500
Smile, too.

665
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,270
1... 2...

666
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,400
How do I set it though?

667
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,160
There's a shit ton of games, too!

668
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,070
What is this?

669
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,940
It's really pretty, dude.

670
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,810
Wow.

671
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,550
Thanks so much for dropping me off. See you.

672
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,330
Hold on!

673
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,160
That's all you're going to say for goodbye?

674
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,860
Well, I'm a Thai guy you know. That's all you say for goodbyes. What do you want me to do?

675
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,930
You want me to kiss your cheek or kiss you on the lips right now?

676
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,680
Good. I studied abroad for a long time.

677
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,950
I have nothing against it.

678
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,600
But I'm against it.

679
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,150
We kissed two times already!

680
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,460
What more do you want?

681
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,750
I want a third time.

682
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,110
Can we not kiss?

683
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,280
Payment for the snacks you ate.

684
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,230
Tin...

685
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,580
Payment for the phone.

686
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,020
Ai'Tin...

687
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,230
Payment for my car's gas. For dropping you off today.

688
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,530
You want to kiss so bad? Then go ahead and kiss.

689
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,720
Can we not kiss, dude?

690
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,980
If you're going to kiss then just kiss!

691
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,350
Why are you licking my mouth? Are you a dog?

692
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,400
If it's not with the tongue, then it's not called a kiss.

693
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,270
Kissing is... just lips touching each other, isn't it?

694
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,540
That's too childish.

695
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,110
If you want to kiss like an adult, then go kiss someone else.

696
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,110
What kind of person... Give them an inch, they'll take a mile.

697
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,270
Give them some flirting, but they want a kiss.

698
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,350
I'm going into my house now.

699
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:46,430
Ai'Tin, thanks for dropping me off.

700
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,730
I'll take good care of this.

701
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,710
I should be the one... that has to thank you.

702
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,350
Brother Can, who dropped you off?

703
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,620
My friend.

704
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,360
My friend dropped me off.

705
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,710
So, why is your voice so high pitched?

706
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,950
It's noth... (Ahem!)

707
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,480
What about P'Tin's picture? Did you get it yet?

708
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,300
I still didn't get it yet.

709
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,900
I'm going to go upstairs first, all right?

710
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,770
What!?!

711
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,900
Did you not take enough medicine, or did you have too much medicine today??

712
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,770
Will he ever be just normal one day?

713
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,440
Brother Can!

714
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,950
I thought I'd actually have a picture for Ai'Ley.

715
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,470
But look at the face you're making, Ai'Tin!

716
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:55,360
Making a face as if you're about to eat me.

717
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:57,980
How could I let Ai'Ley see this?

718
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:05,150
And just what did I do today with Ai'Tin?!

719
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,940
But whatever.

720
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,020
It was pretty fun though, right?

721
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,110
My dear baby, you are so pretty.

722
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,480
Thanks.

723
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,220
For believing my words.

724
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,000
Thank you, Can.

725
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,040
Either way, I'm not going to let you slip from my hands.

726
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,730
He still hasn't come?

727
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,600
Not yet, dude.

728
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,730
This is already pretty late, too.

729
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,330
Dude! Dude! Dude! He's coming! He's coming!

730
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:22,210
He's here already?

731
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,500
Geez... it's upside down, dumbass.

732
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,600
Hey, dude! Let's quickly go out and see!

733
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,550
Hey!

734
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,650
Drunk every single day...

735
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,960
He really stinks of alcohol, dude.

736
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Damn it.

737
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,050
Shut the door gently.

738
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:05,870
Hey, maaan... Thank you two so very much...

739
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,630
Yes. Yes, sir.

740
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,120
Bro, you don't need to talk.

741
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,840
P'No.

742
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:14,080
This is awesome...oh!

743
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:36,540
Geez... What's with my big brother being this drunk?

744
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,510
He's heavy, too.

745
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,130
Geez... and what's with you?

746
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,210
You're making such a scary face.

747
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,660
I really can't stand it anymore.

748
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,150
What's with you?

749
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,280
I can't stand seeing him with someone else.

750
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:55,820
My dad and mom are downstairs.

751
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,520
I know. Not today.

752
00:54:01,013 --> 00:54:02,723
But...

753
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,060
Soon.

754
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,420
Happy birthday to Uncle Ae.

755
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,920
Yay!!!!

756
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,340
I'm going to tell you something...

757
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,860
Even if you want to go back to Ai Tharn so badly,

758
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,910
there will never be a day where he'll come back to you!

759
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,210
Tum! No!

760
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,250
Forget it... Let's go eat together.

761
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,340
I'm so hungry that my stomach is growling.

762
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,930
It's so hot, too!

763
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,330
If you want something, just tell me. All right?

764
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:49,070
But your older brother... has to be mine.
