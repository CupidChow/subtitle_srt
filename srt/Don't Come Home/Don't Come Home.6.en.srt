Yes, Aof?

[Aof] Inspector,
I checked the serial number.

18
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,666
The gun was registered in 2006.

19
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,375
The owner is Colonel Yutthachai.

20
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,416
Are you absolutely sure?

21
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,625
Yes, Inspector.

22
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,208

I don't have time.

I don't see you doing anything.

Do you remember this case?

31
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,958
Of course I do.

32
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,666
It's that Western house
in the middle of the forest.

33
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,291
The owner moved out ages ago.

34
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,791
People say it's a haunted house.

35
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,250
There's a caretaker there, Pa.

00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,416
You mean the blind guy?

37
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,708
His name is Natee.

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you know him?

39
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,458
I put him in jail once.

40
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,500
Why?

41
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,333
Illegal logging.

42
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,208
The owner of the house
bailed him out and gave him a job.

43
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,416
[Fah] Who is this woman?

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
It's just some lunatic.

How did she die?

46
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,416
She tried to shoot the family.

47
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,250
The owner had to defend herself.

48
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,458
Do you remember her name?

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,333
You didn't write it down?

50
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,500
How the hell could I know?

51
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:28,791
[scoffs] Oh.

52
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,000
You didn't come here to see me,

53
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,333
but to ask about this.

54
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,750
It was the anniversary
of your mother's death,

55
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,833
and you didn't even bother to come here.

56
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,041
Didn't you try to investigate who it was?

57
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,875
I didn't know where to start.

58
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,791
She didn't have any documents
or any ID on her.

59
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,916
She only had a gun.

60
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,791
Is this gun the one you filed as evidence?

61
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,958
Of course it's the same gun.

62
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,250
How did it get to be there?

63
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,416
It was registered in 2006.
How can it be the same?

64
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,250
Did you tamper with the evidence
in this case?

65
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,041
What nonsense are you talking?

66
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,875
Maybe you're forgetting.

70
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,000
just to pick a fight with me.

71
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,500
No, you're wrong. I didn't.

72
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,958
I just want to know what happened.

73
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,125
Everything I know is in the report.

74
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,791

00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,750
There's one thing.

Yeah? What's that?

78
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:06,250
The deceased had a bit of paper
with numbers written on it.

79
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,916
What numbers?

80
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,750
How the hell am I supposed to know that?

81
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,958
Lotto numbers?

82
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,500
I'm leaving.

83
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,416

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,125
What is it?

86
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,375
The anniversary of her death
is just once a year.

87
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,166
Why can't you come?

88
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,791
What's your problem?

89
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,041
Huh?

90
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,916
You beat her when she lived.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,375
Now that she's gone,
you want to be nice to her?

92
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,541
And you? So righteous.

93
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,375
Why? What about me?

94
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,833
You're so eager for promotion,
so you became his mistress.

[Tae] Why are you so interested
in this case?

109
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,833
How is it connected
with Varee and her daughter?

110
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,541
I don't know either.

111
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,875
These two incidents
happened at the same place.

112
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,333

Here's the gun, Inspector.

115
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,666
- [Tae] So whose gun is it?
- Varee's husband's.

116
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,083
But why is it in the evidence box
from 1992?

117
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,208
It's very odd.

118
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,000
Do you think that somebody
has swapped the gun?

119
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,875
Last night…

120
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,708
Varee called me
and said that she had a gun.

121
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,166
Why give it to me?

122
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,458
[Natee] Please take it back.

123
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,541
I just can't use it.

124
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,000
You keep it, Natee.

125
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,833
Use it to protect yourself.

126
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,750
She might go crazy again.

If necessary,

128
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,708
you shoot her.

129
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,583
I can't do that. I don't want to.

130
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,041
[Panida] Are you going to let her
hurt people in this house?

131
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,250
You're the only man
in the house right now.

132
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,958
You must protect us, Natee.

133

What?

Why have you locked me up?

147
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,833
What did I do to you?

148
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,166
You made me crash my car
and almost killed me.

149
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,208
You were going to kill me.

150
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,375
[Natee] Who was going to kill you?
I wanted to take you to the police.

But what did I do?

152
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,333
I don't even know who you are
or how you came to be in this house.

153

But you brought this damn gun.

00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,791
[Fah sighs]

186
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,750
So what did your father say?

187
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,833
He's useless.

188
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,333
He's old.

189
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,541
You should let him have his way.

190
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,041
Like my mother did?

191
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,083
CAUSE OF DEATH: FALLING FROM A HIGH PLACE
BURNED BODY

192
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,916
[uneasy music playing]

193
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,166
What is it?

194
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,041
I found it at Varee's house.

195
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,916
Like the body in the photo.

196
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,458
Yeah.

197
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,375
Dad said there was a piece of paper
with numbers on it.

198
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,541
Fuck.

199
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,083
How is this possible?

200
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,125
[exhales incredulously]

201
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,166
Her daughter's in the house.

202
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,291
But where? We searched everywhere.

203
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,750
She-- she's in the house,

204
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,833
but not right now.

205
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,916
- Not at this time.
- [Tae] Fah, what are you talking about?

206
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,583
Inspector!

207

[Min breathing shakily]

213
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,291
- I'm scared. [breathing heavily]
- [thunder rumbling]

214
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,375
Scared of what?

215
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,250
[Min continues breathing heavily]

216
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,833

See? No need to be scared.

225

226
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,833

228
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,541
[Varee] Hey!

229
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,041
Let me out now!

230
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,916
You can't lock me up like this!

231
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,791
Can't you be quiet?

232
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,291
- [knocking on glass]
- [breathing shakily]

233
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,166
Please let me out.

234
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,375
I just came for my child.

235
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,458
Give me back my child.

236
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:15,833
Child?

237
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,208
- Whose child do you mean?
- The child… that my mother…

238
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,958
your boss lady…

239
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,625
Your boss has kidnapped my child!

240
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,958
- [mysterious music playing]
- [Varee panting]

241

Let me out! Let me out of here!

245
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,458
Let me out!

246
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,583
Let me out right now!

247
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,791
Be quiet! I said be quiet!

248
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,916
[Varee] Let me out!

249
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,291
Do you want to die?

250
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,500
No matter how much you shout,
no one can hear you.

251
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,666
Give me my child! Let me out!

252

What are you doing here?

261
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,916
She won't stop screaming, Mrs. Panida.

262
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,291
And what, you can't handle that?

263
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,583
Find something and gag her.

264
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,125
That woman,
she said she was looking for her child.

265
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,625
And so now you're believing
some kind of lunatic? Huh?

266
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,291
The girl…

267
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,500
She's my child.

268
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,416
I told you before. She's my child.

269
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,333
- But she--
- No buts!

270
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,875
You just do what I tell you to do.

271
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,041

283
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,375
[Danai] Captain.

284

Yes, sir.

285
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,208
Where's Inspector Fah?

286
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know.

287
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,375
Whose body?

288
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,375
It's evidence from a case.

289
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,083
Please step away from the board.

290
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,291
[Danai] "Sir." Please step away, sir.

291
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,416
This is Colonel Yutthachai.

292
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,166
Please step away, sir.

293
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,291
Did somebody die?

294
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,625
Captain, can you explain?

295
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,250
There was a death in the house
over 30 years ago.

296
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,083
Thirty years ago?

297
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,708
So why have you dug up
a 30-year-old case now?

298
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,333
Sir, this case from long ago

299
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,666
occurred in the house
where your family disappeared.

300
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,791

I don't know how I ended up here.

362

My daughter and I,
we time-traveled from the future.
