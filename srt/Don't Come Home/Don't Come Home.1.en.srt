[woman] What are you doing, dear?

187
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,916
[thunder crashing]

188
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
[Min] Mom, what room is this?

189
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:18,250
I don't actually know.
Your grandma said it was off-limits.

190
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,333
[Min] Why was that?

191
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,250
Probably it was her private storage.

192
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,041
[ominous music playing]

193
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,041
[thunder rumbling]

194
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,125
- [thunder continues rumbling]
- [rain pouring]

195
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,291
Do you like this house, Min?

196
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,041
No.

197
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,916
It's very old.

198
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,541
This house was built almost 100 years ago.

199
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,625
So of course it's old.

200
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,125
I plan to renovate it
now into a small hotel.

201
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,333
Or maybe a coffee shop. What do you think?

202
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:06,458
But there's no internet here.
I want to watch cartoons.

203
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,541
We'll get that set up.

204
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,000
But I want something to play with.

205
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,916
[electricity flickering]

206
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,625

208
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,375
[Min gasps]

209
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,125
[Min panting in fear]

210
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,000
It's just the power.

211
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,541
[Min continues panting fearfully]

212
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,791
[thunder rumbling]

213
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,750
[woman] There.

214
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,708
I lit it just in case we get a blackout.

215
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,041
[Min continues panting fearfully]

216
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:02,958
Min.

217
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,833
What's wrong, dear?

218
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,833
I can see someone standing over there.

219
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,916
[eerie music playing]

220
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,708
[woman] Where?

221
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,333
I don't see anyone.

222
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,875
[electricity flickering]

223
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,458
[Min gasping]

224
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,666
- [terrifying musical sting]
- [Min screams]

225
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,083
Min, why are you screaming?

226
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,416
Min, why are you crying?

227
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
[thunder rumbling]

228
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,000
- Mom, where are you going?
- [woman] I'm going to get a flashlight.

229
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,875
[foreboding music playing]

230
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,833
[thunder rumbling]

231
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,958
I'll be outside for a bit.

232
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,208
I want to check
if the generator is working.

233
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,375
I'm coming with you.

234
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,000
It's raining outside. Just wait here.

235
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,291
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain pouring]

236

[lock clicks open]

238
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,125
[woman] Pass me the flashlight.

239
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,458
[thunder rumbling]

240
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,166
Mom, are you finished?

241
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,875
I'm looking for the switch, dear.

242
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,125
- [mouse squeaks]
- [woman cries out, grunts]

243
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,833
Mom! What's wrong?

244
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,250
I'm fine. I'm okay.

245
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,500
[thunder rumbling]

246
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,583

[electricity crackling]

250
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,458
Give it to me.

251
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,625
[generator powers down]

[thunder rumbling]

254
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,416
No power tonight, I'm afraid.

255
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,250
Oh, you're all wet. [chuckles]

256
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
[chuckles]

257
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,791
Mom, can you read me this story, please?

258
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,833
Min, where did you find this book?

259
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,250
In the closet.

260
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:44,708

"Oh gosh. What silly nonsense
did I begin to utter?"

263
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,000
"In that second,

264
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:03,458
Alice's head
touched the ceiling of the hallway."

265
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:07,541
"In fact,
right now, she's probably nine foot tall."

269
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,458
[woman] Shall we start?

270
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,500
[Min] One,

278
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,916
I'm coming!

286
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,791
Found you.

287
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,500
What are you looking for?

288
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,416
I thought you were hiding in here.

289
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,041
Mom, what is this room for?

290
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,250
It was Grandma's study.

291
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,291
But now it's a storage room.

292
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,416
[mysterious music playing]

293
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,583
Who is this?

294
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,125
It's Grandma's photo.
It's sad. She died before you were born.

295
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,333
[Min] Mommy, what are these?

296
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,250
They're paper dolls.

297
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,208
Hey.

298
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,166
When I was a child,
I played with paper dolls

299
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,791
and changed their clothes.

300
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,208
Can we play with these?

301
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,666
I want to play with them.

302
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,166
Please, Mom,
let's play with the paper dolls.

303
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,750

I'm coming for you.
Don't you worry, princess.

I'm here to protect you.

Min? What's wrong, dear?

319
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,083
- Min.

Min, what are you doing?

330
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,333
[Min] What is it, Mom?

[birds chirping]

332
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,166
How about we go to the beach?

- [gentle piano music playing]
- [birds chirping]

334

Ma, look.

Good job.

336
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:36,583
Living here is nice.
Just a short drive to the beach, eh?

337
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,791
I want to paddle in the water.

338
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:53,875
Go.

339
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,875
Don't go too far.

341
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,083
[Natee] Hello, Miss Varee.

342
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:24,708
Uncle.

343
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,750
I need to ask you something.

344
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,916
Are there other houses near me?

345
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,625
The closest one to your house is mine.

346
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,625
Do you have a little girl

347
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,250
of around five living with you?

348
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:39,583
No, I don't.

349
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,208
My grandchildren are all grown up now.

350
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,375
Ah, well,

351
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:48,291
are there any kids
that like to play around my house?

352
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:53,250
You're surrounded by rubber plantations,
so I really don't think so.

353
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,583
Is something wrong, miss?

354
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:57,625
Um…

355
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,833

Didn't I tell you not to go far?

376
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,916
If you don't listen to me,
we won't come here again.

380
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,083
[Varee] Min, why are you doing this?

381
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,875
Why are you destroying these things?

382
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:27,041
I'm not hurting them at all.

383
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,916
I think you are, so don't argue.

384
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,958
I don't want to live here anymore.

385

Where do you want to live?

386
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:37,208

[music quietens]

403
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,583
I see someone standing over there.

I don't see anyone.

405
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,375
There really is someone standing there.

Listen to me, dear.

408
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,583
If you see anyone,
whether you know them or not,

409
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,083
you must tell me immediately.
Don't talk to them.

410
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,375
And don't go into that forest.

411
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,458
If you go in there, you might get lost,

412
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,333
and then you won't see me again.

How about we move here permanently?

424
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,500
We can go to the beach,

425
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:57,208
and when school starts,
you can go to a new school.

426
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,458
I don't want to change schools.

427
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,875
Why don't you try?

428
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:02,875
Just think.

429
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,333
You'll make lots of new school friends.

430
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:08,375
No, I don't want to.
I don't want to live here.

I don't like this house.
