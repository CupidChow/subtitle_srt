00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:11,750
I want a divorce.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,041
I don't want to stay here.

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,041
Where will you go, Varee?

5
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,500
You really think you can run from me?

6
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,458
[gun cocks]

7
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,000
You think I couldn't find you?

8
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,833
Our daughter is leaving with me.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,708
- I'm not letting you go.

[breathing shakily]

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,333
Based on the evidence we have,

15
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,291
we can't conclude that you brought
your daughter here with you.

16
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,750
Wait, what's wrong with you?
[breathing shakily]

- You think I'm lying?!
- [glass shatters]

18
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,875
I said she was in the back seat,

19
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,500
but the camera didn't catch it.
Don't you understand!?

20
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,625
That bloodstain is yours, isn't it?

21
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,375
We'd like to check your dress.

22
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,791
Check why? What for?

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,125
We want to confirm that the blood
on your dress is really yours.

24
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,291
What are you thinking?!

25
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,375
Are you out of your mind? I'm her mother!

00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,625
I'm her mother, goddamn!

27
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,000
We're really sorry for having to do this.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,208
This is to prove your innocence.

Ms. Varee…

33
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,208
did you happen to hurt your daughter?

Hey. [crying]

46
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,000
You came here and took our daughter.

47
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,625
[sobbing] You came here and took her away.

48
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,583
Tell me you came here.

49

You took her away, didn't you? [sobbing]

00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,250
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,416
Where are you now?

52
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,041
How on earth are you taking care of her?

00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,333
[continues sobbing]

54
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,458
Yes, hello.

55
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,083
Hello?

56
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,416
Who are you?

57
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm with the police.

58
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm questioning Ms. Varee as we speak.

59
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,208
What's your relationship to her?

60
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,666
What's going on?

61
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,458
Explain to me what this is about.

62
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,125
Do you know
where your daughter presently is?

63
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,166
With her, of course.

64
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,666
Why are you asking me this?

65
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,083
[Varee sobbing softly]

66
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,666
You insist Ms. Varee
brought the child with her?

67
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,458
Yes.

68
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,291
So, did your daughter
appear to be normal when they left?

69
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,208
What do you mean?
What's happened to the child?

70
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:24,583
We have a report from Ms. Varee
that your daughter is missing.

71
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,125
What? What did you say? Min is missing?

72
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, then, could you send us
some photographs of your daughter?

73
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,833
We'll get back to you
as soon as there are any new updates.

74
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,250
Why are you asking me for her photos?
Doesn't her mother have them?

75
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,000
Put my wife on the phone, please.

77
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,708
You're on speaker. She can hear you.

78
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,666
Ms. Varee is sitting with us.

79
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,625
Varee, if you can't cope, come back here.

80
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,041
What kind of a mother are you?

81
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,166
You can't even take care
of a single child.

82
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,916
Please cooperate and send us the photos.

83
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,291
Don't waste our time.

84
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,250
Before you start ordering me around,

85
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,541
I'd like to know what your rank is
and what division you're from.

86
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,416
I'm guessing
you still don't know who I am.

87
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,541
- I do.
- [Varee sniffles]

88
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,583
You're someone who likes to hurt women.

89
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,375
That's why she ran away
with your daughter.

90
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,625

I don't know.

99
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,708
She doesn't seem to be that kind of type.

100
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:23,166
A victim of abusive behavior
can often become violent at times.

101
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,375

[man 2] Let's check again.

121
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,625
[man 4] Maybe she fell into the water.

122
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,916
Sir, where does this stream run to?

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,083
[man 4] It runs all the way to the canal.

124
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,666
[Fah] Tae, send a team to check it out.

125

Prepare a car and a team
to check out the canal. Copy?

129
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,166
Have you had any sleep?

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,541
Please leave this to the police now.

131
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,666
You need to get some rest.

132
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,125
[Natee] Ms. Varee, Inspector,
why don't you wait at the house?

133

[Varee] Mm.

143
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,750
Everybody says that.

144
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,416
It's my fault.

145
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,541
I shouldn't have brought her here.

146
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,750
It's your husband's fault.

147
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,000
You did the right thing by running away.

148
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,291

Over six months.

What does your husband say
about you working?

A child…

154
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,458

No, nothing.

00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,875
If she fell into the water,
the body won't float for a while.

Looks like there's a body stuck over here!

184
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,541
What body?

186

What body, Tae?

190
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,000
It's just a cow.

191
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,458
It's not a child's body.

192
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,250
[Fah] Mm.

193
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,916
It's not her. It's not your daughter.

194
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,708
Have you searched all of the rooms?

195
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,541
I've searched everywhere.

196
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,416
This room?

198
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,416
Is the key somewhere else?

There's only these.

Right here.

Okay, so we'll start searching right here.

Looks like it.

242
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,041
But it's all dried up. It's old.

243
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,500
Ms. Varee, has anyone come down
to this room before?

244
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't know.

245
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,333
I haven't lived here
for more than 30 years,

246
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:38,583
and this is the first time
I've ever been to this basement.

247
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,208
[Aof] Inspector, Captain,
have a look here.

248
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,791
What's that mark?

249
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,416
Interesting.

250
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,166
The result of a short circuit.

251
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,250
Maybe, but why is it circular?

252
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:05,750
Weird.

253
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,791
Ms. Varee, what's the room above this?

254
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,333
The living room, I think.

[Fah] Who is that?

258
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,500
[Varee] That's my great-grandfather.

259
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,291
He built this house.

260
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,125
He was a Westerner.

261
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,208
He was Portuguese.

262
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,875
He was an engineer.
He operated a mine here.

263
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,583

264
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,125

[foreboding music playing]

270
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,333
[Varee] What mark is this?

271
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I think it's gotta be a burn mark.

272
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,000
Based on what we've seen
in the other rooms,

273
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:10,041
it's fair to say these marks
have been here for a while.

274
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,041
What does all this
have to do with my daughter?

What's with this house?

278
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,083
Before your daughter disappeared,
she was sleeping on this bed, right?

279
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,583
Yes.

280
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,250
[Fah] What about you?
Where were you sleeping?

281
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,125
I was sleeping on the bed with her.

282
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,333
Tae, check the bathroom,
and see if there's a kid's toothbrush.

283
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,541
Yes, Inspector.

284
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,250

We think it's very unlikely
that the girl is in the forest.
