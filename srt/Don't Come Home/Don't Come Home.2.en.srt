Min! Min!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,416
Min?! Min!

- [Tae, over phone] What's going on?

28
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,291
Missing child report.

29
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,208
I don't have any details yet.

30
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,291
Anyway, meet me at the Jarukanant house.

For now, it's just me.

36
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,541
What happened to your face?

37
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,875
Oh. A small accident.

38
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,041
They don't look like wounds
from an accident.

39
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,791
Do you want to file a report?

40
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,791
My daughter's missing.

41
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,541
Can you focus on her first?

42
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,458
Okay.

43
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,666
Well, how about we talk inside?

50
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,250

Varee.

52
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,000
Varee Jarukanant.

53
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,250
And the missing person is?

54
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,500
Min.

55
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,416
Miss Mintira Pitanant.

56
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,958
It's her dad's surname.

57
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,541
Age?

58
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,166
Five years.

59
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,375
What's her weight, height, and appearance?

60
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,666
Height about 110, 17 kilos.

61
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,750
Hair this long.

62
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,333
And what's your relationship to her?

63
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,375
I'm her mother, of course.

64
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,833
And her father?

65
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,208
We're not together.

66
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,125
Not for some time. [breathes emotionally]

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,208
Can I see a photo?

68
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,125
I don't have any.

69
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,708
You don't have any photos
on your cell phone?

70
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,125
I did on my old phone, but I've lost it.

71
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,833
What about photos
posted on Facebook or Instagram?

72
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:54,833
Do you have any?

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,833
I mean…

74
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,291
I… I'm not on social media.

75
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,166
Do you remember what she was wearing
when she disappeared?

76
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,333
She was in pajamas
and a pink polka-dot shirt.

77
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,125
When did you realize she was gone?

78
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,708
3:00 a.m.

79
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,000
How can you be so sure
it was 3:00 so exactly?

80
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,750
The hallway clock chimed at that time.
That's how I remember.

81
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,500
Where was it you last saw her?

82
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,958
In her bedroom.

83
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,541
Can you take me there?

84
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,375
[uneasy music playing]

85
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,500
The clock is dead.

86
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,083
It was working last night.

87
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,583
So we don't know when she went missing.

88
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,041
[eerie music playing]

89
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,958
There was a blackout last night.

90
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,791
[door creaking]

91
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,250
Why is it in such a mess?

92
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,583
Tell me everything
that happened last night.

93
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,708
Last night,
I was in the dining room downstairs.

94
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,791
I dozed off.

95
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:51,166
I was woken abruptly by the clock chiming.
Then I heard my daughter calling.

96
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,000
I rushed upstairs.

97
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,000
And then…

98
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:00,916
And then?

99
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,958
I saw the bed floating in midair.

100
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,833
So the bed's broken
because it rose up on its own?

101
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,208
By the time I came in,
Min was already gone.

102
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,500
So what did you do next?

103
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,708
I called her name,
and I tried to look for her everywhere.

104
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,875
And you haven't seen her since?

105
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,458
[Varee sighs]

106
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,458

[birds chirping]

108
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,750
A five-year-old couldn't climb down there.

109
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,416
[Varee sighs]

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,333

111
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,416
- [window unlatches]
- [engine stops]

112
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm up here. Come on up.

113
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,750
[camera shutters clicking]

114
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,500
[camera shutters continue clicking]

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,083
[Tae] What building is that?

116
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,750
It's a generator.

117
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,041
Power generator?

118
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,250
- [uneasy music playing]
- [insects chirping]

119
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,208
Gosh.

120
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,750
Does this house need
a generator this huge?

121
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,291
My mother installed it.

122
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,750
[mysterious music playing]

123
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,166
Min!

124
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,666
Min, where are you?

125
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,625
I looked everywhere in here
before I called you.

126
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,458
So what now?

127
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,166
What do we do next?

128
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,625
Before your daughter disappeared,

129
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:27,416
did she say anything suspicious?
Or had she met any strangers?

130
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,625
In the forest!

131
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,416
Yesterday, she said she saw someone
in the forest.

132
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,458
Where?

133
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,541
[mysterious music continues]

134
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,500
[Varee] Over there.

135
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,000
She said she saw someone over there.

136
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,916
Inspector, let me go. You wait here.

137
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,416
It's okay.

138
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,708
[mysterious music continues]

139
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,416
The pair of kids shoes in the house,
they belong to your daughter?

140
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,333
Yes. Why?

141
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,458
I doubt she wandered barefoot
into the forest.

142
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,958
If she'd be in here,
there would be footprints.

143
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,083
But there are none.

144
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,583
There are only adult footprints,
which are probably yours.

145
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,541
[Varee sighs]

146
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,875
How did you get that bloodstain?

147
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,375
I fell down when I was looking for her.

148
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,666
Did you come here last night?

149
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,416
Yes.

150
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,416
Why did you?

151
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,958
To look for my daughter.

152
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,541
[camera shutter clicking]

153
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,250
[phone camera clicks]

154
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,583
Did you come from Bangkok?

155
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,291
- Yes.
- [woman] How long have you lived here?

156
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,375
Just for a few days.

157
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,875
Did you drive here alone
with your daughter?

158
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,375
Yes.

159
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:34,583
Well, could you give me some more details
of the date and time you left Bangkok?

160
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,250
And the stops you made along the way?

161
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,791
We hit the road on Sunday night.

162
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,625
We stopped at a gas station
in Chumphon, I think it was.

163
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,875
Why did you leave at night?

164
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,250
What's wrong with that?

165
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,500
Why is that relevant at all?

166
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,250
[woman] Be honest with me.

167
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,750
Were you running away from someone?

168
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,458
[vehicle approaching]

169
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,541
[engine puttering]

170
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,666
[engine shuts off]

171
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,166
- [truck door closes]
- [Natee] What's going on here?

172
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,291
[policeman] A girl has gone missing.

173
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What girl?

174
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,750
Sir, have you seen her daughter?

175
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,500
[Natee] Whose daughter?

176
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,000
Her daughter.

177
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,125
Ms. Varee came here alone.

178
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,833
You remember my daughter.

179
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,041
You saw her standing at the window
the other day.

180
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,875
I didn't see any girl that day.

181
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,583
[dark music playing]

182
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,708
So what happened?

183
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,750
Is she really missing?

184
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,666
You have no photos or evidence.

185
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,958
What proof do you have

186
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,708
to verify the identity

Sir. Sir!

377
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,291
Can you put the knife down first?

378
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:14,125
We've come here to ask you
about the girl who went missing.

379
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,791
Come and talk inside the house.

380
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,375
Sir…

381
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,708
what's in the shack?

382
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,750
Nothing, really. It's storage.

383
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:30,958
Can I see inside?

Don't go in there.

388
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,500
It's acid.

389
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,500
They use it to dry rubber.

391
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,125
What's your relationship
to Ms. Varee's family?

392
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,875
I was her mother's driver
for many years before she died.

393
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:30,458
I've looked after the house.
Since they moved to Bangkok.

394
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:32,583
How long ago was that?

395
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:34,875
About 30 years ago.

396
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,458
Ms. Varee was still a child.

398
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,541
Um, I'm sorry to ask,

399
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,250
but how long has your eye been like that?

400
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,916
Let me see.

401
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,250
It was before
she and her mother moved out.

402
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,458
And how did it happen?

403
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,000
Can you please tell us about it?

404
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:15,916
On that day,

405
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:20,875
a lunatic barged into the house
to attack the family.

406
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,125
I tried to stop it happening.

407
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,958
But it was a rampage.

408
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,708
I was blinded by a glass shard.

409
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:34,541
This wound was the result.

410
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,708
So, was this person a man or a woman?

411
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:42,583
A woman.

412
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,666
And who was she?

413
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,166
Where did she come from?
Why did she attack them like that?

414
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,416
I don't know either.

415
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,291
She was mad.

416
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,291
Did the police arrest her?

417
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,500
They didn't need to because she died.

418
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,583
Inside that house.

419
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,916
She fell from the second floor.

420
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:05,708
After that, Ms. Varee and her mother
moved out and never came back,

421
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,708
leaving the house in the state you saw.

What else is there?
I've told you everything I know.

443

You said your daughter has gone missing.

Yes! I've told you everything.

with your daughter.

your daughter here with you.
