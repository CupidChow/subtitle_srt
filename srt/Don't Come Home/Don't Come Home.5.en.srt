13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,416
Are there still officers at your house?

They all left earlier this evening.

15
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,125
Ms. Varee, find a place to hide for now.

16
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,000
Don't do anything now.
Wait until I get there.

17
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,916
Maybe it's my daughter.

18
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,791
What if it's not?

Divorce papers.

115
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,666
Aof, take this back to the station
and secure it.

116
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,125
Yes, Inspector.

117
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,291
It's a lot of money.

118
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,291
If she was gonna run away,
she would have taken it.

119
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,541
Yeah.

120
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,291
I heard a strange sound
when she called me last night.

121
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,125
I couldn't make it out.

122
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,166
What sound?

123
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,250
A child counting.

124
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,125
Could it be that
she's already found the girl?

125
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,458
So where is she now?

126
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,625
Now they've both disappeared?

127
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,583
The car's here.

128
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,750
And all their belongings.

129
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,333
Mm, right.

130
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,041

Yes, Inspector.

136
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,958
They look like funeral photos.

137
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,291
Who are these people?

138
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,083
I don't know.

139
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,041
Probably the previous owners.

What are you doing here?

147
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,041
Jesus. You scared me.

148
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,125
Sir, have you seen the owner?

149
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,916
You mean Ms. Varee?

150
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,666
Her car's here. Is she not inside?

151
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,750
She's nowhere to be found.

152
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,458
And she's left her phone here.

153
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
[Natee] So where did she go?

154
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,000
Exactly.

155
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,375
I'd like to know.

156
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,791
Sir, what did the previous owner
do in the basement?

157
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,458
You know there's a basement in the house.

158
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:02,958
I do.

159
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,208
It was always forbidden to enter.

160
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,583
Mrs. Panida?

161
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:11,916
Who is she?

162
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,041
The owner. Ms. Varee's mother.

163
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,875
And tell me who she was.
What did she do for a living?

164
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,333
She was a professor,

165
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,791
and an engineer at a hydroelectric dam.

166
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,458
What was she doing here?

167
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,041
[Natee] I don't know.

168
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,458
The basement has long been sealed shut,

169
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,708
since she moved out 30 years ago.

170
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,208
[mysterious music playing]

171
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,500
[Tae] So, who are these two people?

172
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,666
That's her biological daughter
and her husband.

173
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,791
He's dead, right?

174
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,625
He died 30 years ago.

175
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,541
[Fah] Is this girl Ms. Varee's sister?

178
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,791
[Panida] Move to the other side.

Mom! Mom! Why are you locking me up?

182
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,958
Don't do this, please!

183
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,000
Please let me go!

184
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,166
Stop talking. Just eat.

185
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,250
[Varee breathing heavily]

186
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,125
Where are you from?

187
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,250
I live in this house,

188
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,000
but I have no idea
how I ended up in this room.

189
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,708
I was looking for my daughter upstairs
and suddenly fell down here.

190
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,625
Your daughter?

191
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,250
Yes, my daughter.

192
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,166
Have you seen her here?

193
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,375
Her name is Min, and she's five years old.

194
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,791
- Her name is Min.
- Enough.

195
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,708
Mom!

196
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,208
[Panida breathing shakily] That's enough.

197
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,166
Mom.

198
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,875

[discordant music continues]

203
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,458
[Panida inhales sharply]

204
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,750
- [bottle crashes]
- [Panida groans loudly] No!

205
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,791
[whimpering] No, she's not.

00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,500

208
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,333
Natee,

209
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,375
I need your help.

210
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,458
[Fah exhales]

211
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,208

[intriguing music playing]

214
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,875
What now?

215
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,458
I still don't get it.

216
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,000
What happened to the mother and child?

217
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,916
- [Tae] Let me help you.
- [Fah] Mm.

00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,250
[Aof] Yes, Inspector?

231
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,541
Where's the suitcase?

232
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,583
Where's the cash?

233
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,333
Huh?

234
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,541
[phone ringing]

235
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,416

236
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,833
Yes, sir.

237
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Yes, sir.

238
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,166
[knocking on door]

239
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,833
[Danai] Come in.

240
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,333
Good morning.

241
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Inspector Fah is in charge of this case.

242
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,125
Hello, sir.

243
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:06,000
[Danai] This is Colonel Yutthachai,
Ms. Varee's husband.

244
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,250
Right.

245
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,666
Regarding Colonel Yutthachai's
missing daughter,

246
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,291
have there been any updates?

247
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,750
It's not just his daughter now.

248
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,166
His wife is also missing.

249
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,875
What do you mean?

250
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,333
I was contacted by Ms. Varee.

251
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,791
Once I arrived, she was gone.

252
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,541
You searched well?

253
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,166
Everywhere, sir.
Including the surrounding areas.

254
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,208
We found no trace of her,

255
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,958
and her car was still there.

256
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,208
How capable are you?

257
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,750
Hm?

258
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,041
The suitcase

259
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,708
is critical evidence.

260
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,291
I must take it back.

261
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,750
[Yutthachai] But the money
in the suitcase is mine.

262
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,000
Stolen money
should be returned to its owner.

263
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,125
So are you concerned about money
or your family?

264
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,791
[uneasy music playing]

265
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,625
Is this officer fit for duty

266
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,083
in such a heavily pregnant state?

267
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,583
Hm?

268
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,375
It appears not to me.

269
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,916
Our job is to investigate
and track down missing persons,

270
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,208
not to make them disappear.

271
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,541
What do you mean by that?

272
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,041
May I know the date and time
you arrived in this town?

273
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,291
Why do you ask?

274
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,250
Inspector, you should leave.

275
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,791
When Ms. Varee contacted me,

276
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,458
she said there was someone
inside her house.

277
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,375
And so?

278
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,041
On the day she went missing,

279
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,750
a black car
appeared in front of her house.

280
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,791
The same car
is parked outside the station now.

281
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,666
May I ask is it your car?

282
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,625
Have I become a suspect now?

283
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,708
Hm?

284
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,833
Are you saying
I kidnapped my own wife and child?

285
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,791
If you have an alibi
that you weren't at the house last night,

286
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,125
we can remove you from the suspect list.

287
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,833
Last night,
the colonel was at the hotel in town.

288
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,916
I am his alibi.

289
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,791
You should return to work.

290
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,083
I wanted you two
to get to know each other.

291
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,000
That's all.

292
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,833
I think I know him well enough.

293
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,416
Excuse me.

294
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,500
[Yutthachai] Why would I want the girl?

295
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,166
What do you mean?

296
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,458
She isn't even my daughter.

297
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,541

No, honey.

There's no one in there.

I don't want you playing

Let's ask Aof. He'll know.

- Hey, Aof.
- Yeah?

358
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:02,208
Uh, it's a .38 Smith & Wesson revolver.

359
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,375
