Fortunately, the Lord agreed to my request.

26

how

105
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,460
It's terrifying

106

The Lord would occasionally look at people with that kind of eyes.

107
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,540

108
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,790

At this moment, the middle palace just needs to stay with me.

114

It's troublesome to toss like this

115
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,530
Your Highness has drunk too much medicinal wine.

116

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,760
Be careful in everything

183
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,060
I will specifically instruct the Imperial Court to

184
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,180
Holy Grace

185
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,870
Is the palace aware of this?

186
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,530
What

187
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,270
Yeah

188
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,210
The nave knows

189
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,070
That's it.

190
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,270
Never serve undercooked fish or meat

191
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,710
It's Zheng Shanggong

192
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,430
Also, no raw persimmons or shellfish are allowed.

193
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,740
Be extra careful

194
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,360
I understand

195
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,520
Just Zheng Shanggong

196
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,100
What's up

197
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,660
Cheng En Shang Gong is already pregnant

198
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,530
What will happen to the Queen Mother in the future?

199
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,530
What does this mean?

200
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,330
I want to ask whether His Majesty will favor only Consort Cheng'en.

201
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,230
The Queen Mother is the head of the female officials

202
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,700
[A woman who holds an official position in the palace]
The Queen Mother is the head of the female officials

203
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,070
How can you compare these two people? It is really disloyal.
[A woman who holds an official position in the palace]

204
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,490
How can you compare these two people? It is really disloyal.

205
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,260
The slaves are terrified

206
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,220
Alas, I am afraid that our Queen

207
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,030
[Note: meaning helpless]
You will become a dog chasing chickens with only its eyes on the roof.

208
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,160
You think the palace is...

209
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,060
A farm with animals?

210
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,330
So who is the chicken and who is the dog?

211
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,530
Talk and talk

212
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,530
I'm asking you who is the chicken and who is the dog

213
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,530
I heard that Concubine Cheng'en is pregnant

214
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,320
Oh, that's great.

215
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,830
Thanks

216
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,680
Oh, and these

217
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,050
They were all sent by the Empress Dowager.

218
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,240
Ginseng and Deer Antler

219
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,730
The Queen said that Concubine Cheng'en's hands and feet are cold

220
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,870
Plus the young master is still unstable.

221
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,010
Instructed Cheng En Shang Gong to pay more attention to the pregnancy

222
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,060
Chengen Shanggong must give birth to a prince

223
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,430
Thanks

224
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,250
From now on, Cheng En Shang Gong will fly to the branch

225
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,060
People like me are far behind.

226
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,210
Nubi means the person who is rewarded and the one who receives the reward.

227
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,120
We must distinguish between the upper and lower positions

228
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,020
yes

229
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,010
There is also the Shang Gong Cheng'en who needs to be remembered

230
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,370
Xu Shanggong is from the Central Palace

231
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,210
yes

232
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,890
The things have been handed over to Chengen Shanggong

233
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Thanks a lot

234
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,740
This is a good thing

235
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,990
But when I think of the Queen Mother

236
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,810
My heart is a little... painful.

237
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,620
Is the lady okay?

238
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,420
That girl is sensitive.

239
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,860
You need to spend more time before giving birth

240
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,640
Now Cheng En Shang Gong is pregnant

241
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,350
I am really afraid that the master will only be loyal to Cheng En Shang Gong.

242
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,560
Frankly speaking, I feel a little...uncomfortable.

243
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,870
What if Concubine Cheng'en really gave birth to a little prince...

244
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,260
If she gave birth to a prince

245
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,140
I raised the child as my own.

246
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,030
Zheng Shanggong

247
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,710
Zheng Shanggong

248
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,490
Didn't Zheng Shanggong not set a day for sleeping with the emperor?

249
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,590
This is the matter of the king and the nave getting married

250
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,280
It's not that it can be decided just by saying so.

251
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,830
Oh, what can I say?

252
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,980
No matter what

253
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,490
Zheng Shanggong must help to decide

254
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,320
Oh, you are really

255
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,270
Even if it is decided

256
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,760
Did the middle temple accept it willingly?

257
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,510
The Queen will accept it.

258
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,040
He became a king in the future.

259
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,260
The throne is not unbreakable.

260
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,230
Need to continue to consolidate and move forward

261
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,850
It's the Queen Mother

262
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,760
Still need to be careful at every step

263

[Looking back and forth, hesitant and indecisive]
But don't look around

267

Wait until you can move forward without fear
[Looking back and forth, hesitant and indecisive]

268
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,380
Wait until you can move forward without fear

269
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,990
Only then can you become king

270
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,760
It's the Queen Mother

271
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,710
These foods are too luxurious for slaves.

272
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,400
I know what you are thinking.

273
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,580
Don't worry, take it back and eat it.

274
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,940
You are still pregnant

275
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,870

It is no different from the dragon seed in the belly of this palace.

281
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,560
Do you want me to inform the hospital... how to make it?

282
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,000
No

283
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,300
The slaves are terrified

284
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,530
During this period of time, you just need to concentrate on keeping the baby safe.

285
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,670
Don't get involved in other meaningless things

286
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,050
Didn't you say that even though the body belongs to the Lord?

287
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,650
Does your heart still belong to me?

Pan Zhu, who was at the border, seemed to have discovered the movements of the northeastern army.

290
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,470
But Pan Zhu insisted on reporting to the Queen in person.

There must be support from the father behind me

In addition, the number of rebels has increased from 6,000 to 7,000

yes

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,420
I know.

332
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,610
The Lord has been watching here.

333

Sir, walk carefully.

334
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,370
At present, there are 40,000 soldiers between Huangzhou and Fengzhou.

335
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,060
Even if Wuliangha joined the rebellion, there would be only 10,000 of them.

336
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,040
We still have a chance of winning

337

My dear, do you mean to capture my father alive?

347
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,370
In this way, the widow

348
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,640
After killing the king's brother and dragging his elder brother down,

349
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,330
Became the king who captured his father

350
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,580
So how?

351
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,110
All we need to do is to ensure that the Supreme King is safe.

352
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,680
I don't know why the Lord is so hesitant to make up his mind.

353
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,810
This is how it is.

354
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,320
Although it was Zhao Siyi who started the rebellion

355
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,100
But the person behind him who controls the situation must be the Supreme King

356
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,510
Everyone knows this

357
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,500
How could the Lord not know?

358
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,320
Moreover, I don't know where the Supreme King is at the moment.

359
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,860
Arrest Zhao Siyi and ask him.

360
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,210
In this way

361
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,840
A big fight is inevitable

362
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,170
The Lord certainly does not want to go to war with his biological father.

363
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,780
Where are you going, sir?

364
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,380
Won't you leave the palace?

365
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,620
I want to find a book in the palace

366
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,710
Looking for books in the palace?

367
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,170
Anjo-kun, please go first.

368
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,750
Your Highness

369
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,190
Lord Helun requests an audience

370
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,250
I ordered you to come quietly, but you scared me.

371
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,690
Never

372
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,620
I am considering personally sending troops to the northeast.

373
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,660
Your Highness intends to leave the palace

374
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,370
Entrust your father's safety to others

375
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,610
I really can't rest assured

376
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,360
The current regime is not stable

377
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,310
If the news that the monarch is not in the palace leaks out

378
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,310
This palace...

379
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,810
I'm afraid you will have to help me guard it.

380
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,210
I receive your order.

381
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,040
I know that you are quite knowledgeable in astronomy and physiognomy.

382
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,660
I am terrified

383
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,890
So I have a question for you.

384
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,940
Your Highness, please ask

385
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,650
My dear, look at Li Shufan.

386
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,000
What kind of atmosphere is around you?

387
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,570
A loyal minister

388
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,450
Still a traitor

389
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,740
It depends on how His Majesty uses him.

390
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,320
There is no rebellious spirit

391
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,950
Although not a traitor

392
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,450
But whether he is a loyal minister or not depends on what I do.

393
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,930
good

394
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,410
that nave

395
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,660
What

396
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,960
I don't know what your Highness wants to ask.

397
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,260
King's Spirit

398
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,310
Your Highness, please take a look at the stars.

399
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,630
That's the red star.

400
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,240
That star is the third among the seven stars.

401
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,180
It is an ominous sign

402
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,470
You said it's ominous

403
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,780
There may be signs of rebellion

404
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,770
Rebellion is not the northeast

405
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,760
The Northeast Rebellion Has Begun

406
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,530
So it's not a sign.

407
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,600
So

408
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,820
Your Highness

409
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,060
It is better to hand over the palace to Lixingfuyuanjun

410
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,580
[Father of Yeoheungbuwongun Minji and Queen Wonkyeong]
It is better to hand over the palace to Lixingfuyuanjun

411
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:06,760
It is better to hand over the palace to Lixingfuyuanjun

412
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,200
My dear, you are asking me to test you.

413
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,210
I will keep an eye on it quietly.

414
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,080
Are you saying that the Empress is at the center of the rebellion?

415
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,620
I heard that His Majesty will personally send troops to the northeast.

416
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,700
What

417
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,870
personally

418
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,160
yes

419
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,860
His Highness seems to be considering handing over the palace to his father.

420
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,960
It seems that in times of crisis, the only people His Highness can trust are our Min family.

421
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,540
Stop talking nonsense

422
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,980
His Highness is accompanied by Lord Helun

423
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,080
There must be other considerations

424
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,260
But why didn't Your Highness tell me?

425
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,790
The queen is sad

426
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,220
That's a battlefield.

427
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,980
A matter of life and death

428
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,630
Go and ask the imperial concubine to come over

429
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,760
Niangniang

430
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,040
[Kwon Sun Lee Bang Won's Harem]

431
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,620
Niangniang

432
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,540
Cheng En Shang Gong said that she disturbed her prenatal education

433
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,790
pleaseâ€¦

434
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,210
Please respect yourself, ma'am

435
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,360
What

436
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,370
The Princess of Zhenyi Palace Arrives

437
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,620
Calligraphy

438
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,030
You said that my Xuanqin music disturbed your prenatal education

439
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,360
What does this mean?

440
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,400
It's noisy

441
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,170
Maybe it's because I don't understand music.

442
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,910
It's noisy

443
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,800
Very noisy

444
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,090
I don't even have the ability to appreciate music.

445
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,420
Such people can only

446
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,500
I have enchanted His Highness with my body.

447
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,890
Slaves are born lowly and humble

448
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,730
Just because there is no opportunity

449
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,180
At least when I sleep with you

450
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,220
I know why Your Highness is so happy.

451
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,640
The meaning of slaves is that slaves have fulfilled their duties as concubines.

452
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,300
Do your best

453
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,050
Tonight

454
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,810
Please come down to the palace

455
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,260
Your Majesty, do you want me to arrange for you to sleep with her?

456
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,500
Exactly

457
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,350
Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have contacted the Shuyun Temple...

458
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,770
That is to say, today was not set as the day for the sleeping ceremony.

459
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,360
Can't we make a date now?

460
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,780
This is the king and the queen sleeping together

461
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,970
Own process and preparationâ€¦

462
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,980
No need for complicated procedures and preparations

463
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,810
It's just a wife wanting to see her husband before he goes to the battlefield.

464
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,320
Although this is the case

465
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,870
But the Empress had never proposed the idea of sleeping with the emperor first.

466
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,220
This palaceâ€¦

467
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,810
I want to be with His Highness.

468
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,120
Is there any bigger reason than this?

469
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,820
If you don't think it's possible, I'll go directly to the bedroom.

470
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,350
No

471
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,800
I understand.

472
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,010
Today?

473
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,140
yes

474
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,120
The day is urgent

475
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,740
But considering that today is the most suitable day to give birth to the little prince

476
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,130
I know

477
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,690
Why is Chengen Shanggong like this?

478
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,810
The Palace Master Zhenyi has called the Palace Supervisor to reprimand the

479
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,540
This matter has been reported to His Highness.

480
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,770
Your Highness

481
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,020
yes

482
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,480
In order to ensure that the Palace Master Zhenyi can be at ease, she plays the Xuanqin

483
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,540
His Highness has ordered a pavilion to be built near the small lotus pond.

484
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,690
It's just because Concubine Cheng'en is pregnant

485
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,820
This matter has just been brought up

486
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,230
only

487
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,790
Why is His Highness so attentive to Palace Master Zhenyi?

488
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,880
The palace master is the daughter of a noble family.

489
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,080
Even the master cannot be underestimated

490
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,700
After all, the Quan family is rich and powerful.

491
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,270
I'm pregnant.

492
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,740
Seong-eun isn't the only one pregnant

493
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,140
Will His Highness stay with Shang Gong Chengen until the end of time?

494
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,220
There is no shortage of young and beautiful women in the palace.

495
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,290
So

496
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,400
I also need powerful officials

497
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,250
Isn't it?

498
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,450
Okay, okay.

499
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,880
Come

500
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,280
I wonder how much Anjo-kun thinks he knows about his lord.

501
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,260
What should be understood is understood

502
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,470
You should know this.

503
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,340
It seems to me that Anjo-kun doesn't understand at all.

504
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,120
Why do you say that, sir?

505
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,700
This time, the Lord will not ask Anjo-kun to play as a forward.

506
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,030
How will that happen?

507
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,520
Could it be that the Central Palace is interfering again?

508
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,500
I said, how can Ancheng-kun be so ignorant of His Majesty?

509
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,150
How could His Majesty allow himself to be ordered around by others?

510
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,050
What the adult meant was

511
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,730
Your Highness will make his own judgment.

512
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,930
It's just that His Highness's many decisions before

513
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,200
She was indeed influenced by the Queen Mother.

514
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,130
After all, the two of you have been political allies for many years.

515
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,460
Even if His Highness has two concubines in the harem,

516
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,440
It's just like the dispute between His Highness and the two concubines in the harem

517
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,270
The political goals of the two have never changed.

518
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,430
Even if their political goals are similar

519
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,140
One is the king and the other is the subject

520
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:40,870
One is a man and the other is a woman

521
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,800
so

522
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:57,220
What I mean is that this is the easiest relationship to change in the world.

523
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:10,550
What can Anjo-kun do?

524
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,400
I will break this alliance.

525
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,220
I will definitely do it.

526
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,910
If so

527
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,890
What can your Excellency promise me?

528
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,050
His Majesty has arrived

529
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,930
I heard that His Highness is going to go to the battle personally.

530
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,390
good

531
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,470
How could you...

532
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,550
The Shang Gong on duty today just needs to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, understand?

533
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,100
What...what

534
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,230
Not this... this... Xu Shanggong

535
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,500
Shhh

536
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,390
I heard that His Highness is going to lead the army

537
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,870
I just feel like I'm going crazy

538
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,500
We should be together

539
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,130
You and I can only...

540
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,050
Act together

541
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,910
It would be better for Your Highness to go alone and ask Father to come back.

542
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,750
The father will be with those soldiers

543
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,460
How can I bring my father back alone?

544
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,980
My father is alone in Yuanzhongpu at this moment.

545
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,990
I only brought some personal soldiers with me secretly.

546
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,970
[Elite soldiers in the Joseon Dynasty who were responsible for guarding the capital and the border]
I only brought some personal soldiers with me secretly.

547
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,280
[Elite soldiers in the Joseon Dynasty who were responsible for guarding the capital and the border]

548
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,920
This is true

549
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,450
really

550
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,590
Did your spies find out again?

551
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,850
This is all for His Highness' sake.

552
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,790
only

553
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,450
Will my father easily agree to let me come back?

554
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,260
The Queen also knew how the father left Kaifeng that day.

555
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,050
The situation now is different from that time

556
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:23,300
The news of 40,000 soldiers and officers frightened Zhao Siyi's troops.

557
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,800
[All officers and soldiers are registered in the North Korean military]
The news of 40,000 soldiers and officers frightened Zhao Siyi's troops.

558
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,030
The news of 40,000 soldiers and officers frightened Zhao Siyi's troops.

559
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,790
I guess my father doesn't want

560
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:34,290
Let more soldiers get hurt in a battle that cannot be won

561
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:39,980
Maybe my father also needs a name to change his mind.

562
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,140
If I risk my life to invite this person

563
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,730
This title belongs to me.

564
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,160
This may not be easy

565
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,630
Inevitably dangerous

566
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,370
only

567
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:01,150
This may be the only way

568
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:18,430
Unless you think your master's life is in danger, you must not show up.

569
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,730
Do you understand?

570
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,510
If the Lord has not yet invited the Supreme King back after 3:45 of the morning hour,

571
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,250
You must go to the Caoan to protect the emperor.

572
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,960
It is about an hour's journey from where my father is.

573
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,180
[One hour is about two hours]
It is about an hour's journey from where my father is.

574
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,810
[One hour is about two hours]

575
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,710
There are ten soldiers guarding the King.

576
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:03,290
A group of five people will take turns twice at Youshi and Maoshi 3:30.

577
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:10,530
So I need to see my father between 12:00 and 12:00.

578
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,320
I don't know if my father is in good health.

579
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,510
You came to this rural area.

580
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,210
Are you here to arrest your father?

581
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,530
No

582
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,550
I am here to ask my father

583
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,840
With soldiers

584
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,220
Come and ask for your father

585
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,260
I came here alone.

586
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,930
Do you want your father to believe that the king of a country came alone?

587
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,950
Please trust me, father.

588
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,130
Go back

589
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:04,900
Father

590
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,740
go back

591
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:10,060
This battle is absolutely unwinnable.

592
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,060
Those soldiers were sacrificed in vain.

593
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,510
Why must the father turn a blind eye?

594
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,580
I will move the capital back to Hanyang

595
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,370
Asshole

596
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:28,710
I will sever ties with those who have been eyeing vested interests since the beginning of the state.

597
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,660
What my father wanted to do

598
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,280
I will continue

599
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,960
Your Highness must leave three quarters before

600
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,780
Your Highness is no match for those soldiers.

601
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,520
Please make up your mind, father.

602
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,560
You go back

603
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,130
If you don't go back

604
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,670
My father will kill you.

605
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:18,600
My father has already... killed me several times.

606
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,020
Catch Him

607
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,760
Don't move

608
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,000
I am the monarch of Korea.

609
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,710
He is not a monarch.

610
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,870
He is a traitor who calls himself a monarch

611

If the father kills his son

616
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,830
North Korea will die

617

If you kill your son, the court will be in chaos

The name of the king at that time

619
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,230
He will only be described in history books as a power-hungry person.

I just donâ€™t knowâ€¦

725
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:11,180
Can I cut off the power of Kaijing here?

726
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,890
Your Highness will definitely be able to do it

727
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,890
There will inevitably be sacrifices

728
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,590
This is inevitable

so

So maybe this matter...

741
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:26,370
It will start from the Min family headed by the Central Palace

00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,180
Can you do it?

743
