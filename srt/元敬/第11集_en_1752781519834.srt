May I ask you a question?

36
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,650
Why did the Queen Mother do this?

37
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,110
Because your mother saw your father's desire

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,980
He wants to do this and that for the people.

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,340
Your father has that desire in his heart

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,780

When I learned that it rained mud earlier,

50
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,090
Many people were starving.

51
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,700

Ouch

173
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,240
Your Highness

174
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,150
Your Highness

175
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,450
ah

176
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,980
Oops, sorry.

177
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,330
It seems that His Majesty really cares for me.

178
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,150
Today, the weather is exceptionally bright.

179
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,150
Oh, this flower

180
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:14,900
Zhen Ningjun

181
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,050
[The fifth son of Yeongnyeong-gun Lee Bang-won (the eldest son of Chae-ryeong)]
Zhen Ningjun

182
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,370
Let's pay our respects to the Queen Mother together.
[The fifth son of Yeongnyeong-gun Lee Bang-won (the eldest son of Chae-ryeong)]

183
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,420
Let's pay our respects to the Queen Mother together.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,790
That is Chungnyeong-gun, born to Chungnyeong-daegun and Suk-yi.

185
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,520
Zhenning-kun is also old enough to get married.

186
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,950
yes

187
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,680
You go to Shuyi's place

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,540
The marriage should always be arranged by the mother

189
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,600
So...

190
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,530
Five years of punishment

191
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,410
It's been long enough.

192
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,080
yes

193
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,300
You said the Empress Dowager was planning the wedding of Zhenning Jun.

194
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,890
The marriage of Jing Ningjun, born to the last filial palace master

195
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,420
It was also carefully prepared by the Queen Mother

196
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,100
Where is Shuyi?

197
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,640
How is Shuyi doing?

198
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,390
I heard that you are doing well.

199
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,470
Your Highness

200
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,650
Now, Zhenning has grown up.

201
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,130
How long will you keep the queen outside the palace?

202
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,190
She will be summoned to the palace soon.

203
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,070
The central hall seems to have the same intention

204
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,780
Who is it? Why is someone here suddenly?

205
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,880
Oh...it's Kim Sang-Gong again

206
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,900
That disgusting guy is here again...

207
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,250
Who is disgusting?

208
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,520
Zheng...

209
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
Zheng Shanggong

210
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,510
Ouch! Ouch!

211
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,750
How come you are here

212
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,090
The Queen is considering Cui Shikang's daughter

213
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,110
Cui Shikang...

214
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,370
Isn't it the military officer?

215
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,750
[A second-rank official in the Joseon Dynasty, who succeeded the Panseo as a vice chief official]
Isn't it the military officer?

216
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,960
yes
[A second-rank official in the Joseon Dynasty, who succeeded the Panseo as a vice chief official]

217
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,560
The other party has an outstanding character and a superior family background
[A second-rank official in the Joseon Dynasty, who succeeded the Panseo as a vice chief official]

218
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,260
The other party has an outstanding character and a superior family background

219
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,290
fine

220
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,520
The Queen Mother ordered the mother of the Prince of Zhenning to prepare the wedding herself

221
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,300
Your Majesty, it's time to prepare to return to the palace

222
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,660
Empress of the Middle Temple

223
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,280
What is it?

224
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,640
Something bad is happening

225
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,440
What's the big deal?

226
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,100
I heard that a woman secretly moved into the palace.

227
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,880
When the Lord found out, he was furious

228
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,130
What did you say

229
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,780
It is said that the prostitute was dressed in the clothes of a palace maid.

230
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,980
Hiding in the palace

231
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,410
What

232
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,640
Is this the girl?

233
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,040
How could you disappoint your father so much?

234
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,090
How can such a ridiculous person be a king?

235
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,080
I will definitely pay attention.

236
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,800
Will definitely pay attention

237
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,640
What to watch out for

238
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,140
Your words will definitely be noticed

239
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,080
It's just a common saying. Whenever I want to give my father a lie, I will say this.

240
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,060
My son is terrified

241
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,880
you...

242
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,340
Don't you know that the court officials are comparing you to Chungnyeong?

243
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,410
Your Highness

244
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,800
Whenever I heard those words, my father would feel terrified.

245
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,620
I was afraid that the princes would be pushed around by the court officials and cause a bloody storm.

246
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,410
Your Highness

247
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,880
Now is not the time to talk about this...

248
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,080
I want to do a good job

249
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,630
Also want to be recognized

250
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,860
But the more I do this, the more suffocating I feel.

251
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,420
What you call suffocation

252
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,930
Is it just playing with women in the end?

253
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,960
Your father ordered you to study hard.

254
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,700
Order you to practice martial arts

255
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,030
Cultivate a noble spirit

256
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,130
[The noble and upright spirit]
Cultivate a noble spirit

257
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,920
There is no noble spirit in the book
[The noble and upright spirit]

258
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,010
At least the noble spirit that I know
[The noble and upright spirit]

259
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,430
At least the noble spirit that I know

260
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,560
This palace doesn't have it.

261
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,740
The palace has

262
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,200
Just a bunch of disgusting ministers pretending to be loyal

263
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,370
Learn to swallow this disgusting

264
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,140
The King

265
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,590
Father won't understand

266
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,570
Don't understand

267
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,870
Those ministers who even looked down on the country's foundation

268
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,900
[The crown prince who will inherit the throne]
Those ministers who even looked down on the country's foundation

269
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,350
Those ministers who even looked down on the country's foundation

270
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,820
Did you just say that the minister looked down on the country?

271
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,920
Liyuanjun to the Crown Prince?

272
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,670
[Brother of Queen Wonkyung, the Prince of Yeowon]
Liyuanjun to the Crown Prince?

273
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,760
That happened after the prince had an argument with Li Shanjun and left the table angrily.
[Brother of Queen Wonkyung, the Prince of Yeowon]

274
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,230
[Younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong, Prince Yeowon and Prince Yeosan]
That happened after the prince had an argument with Li Shanjun and left the table angrily.

275
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,110
That happened after the prince had an argument with Li Shanjun and left the table angrily.

276
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,670
Besides you, is there anyone else who saw it?

277
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,050
This happened suddenly.

278
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,410
So let's not pursue it for now.

279
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,110
A prince despised by his uncle

280
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,460
Which minister looked down on the country?

281
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,090
Father

282
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,460
The father asks who you are

283
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,920
Uncles...Uncles...Uncles

284
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,510
The Crown Prince

285
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,550
Do you mean Liyuanjun and Lishanjun?

286
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,480
yes

287
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,580
What does this mean, sir?

288
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,390
I heard that Liyuanjun dared to punch the prince's mansion.

289
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,250
There must be a maid who saw this scene.

290
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,820
It's just a rumor.

291
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,970
If it's a rumor, someone should spread it.

292
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,230
Whether the rumors in the palace are true or false

293
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,240
If you really want to consider the Crown Prince, you should cover it up.

294
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,480
This is the moral duty of a subject.

295
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,370
Maharaja

296
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,610
Why did Anchengfuyuanjun make this matter public?

297
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,420
If your Highness is being disrespected, you should investigate thoroughly...

298
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,110
If any palace maid is willing to come forward and explain the truth

299
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,880
You have to risk your life

300
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,240
Not hesitating to use other people's lives as a guarantee

301
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,120
What is Anchengfuyuanjun's plan?

302
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,550
Not the Maharaja

303
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,870
I already have everything...

304
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,870
I am only acting out of loyalty...

305
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,870
How could the Maharaja...

306
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,300
Prince Chungnyeong immediately reprimanded Anseongbuwon-gun

307
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,050
The Ancheng prefect was speechless.

308
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,600
Don't mention how happy it is.

309
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,270
Is there anything that the prince knows?

310
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,540
What

311
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,160
Speak

312
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,210
Li Yuanjun was so angry that he punched the prince's mansion...

313
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,390
Adults like this

314
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,520
Ouch

315
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,220
Empress of the Middle Temple

316
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,860
Queen Mother

317
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,310
Where is the prince?

318
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,360
The Lord Calls

319
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,110
The Queen Mother has something to ask him in person.

320
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,840
You ask him to come to the palace

321
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,060
It's the Queen Mother

322
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,030
What is this

323
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,790
My son said he would not accept it.

324
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,400
Ancheng Fuyuanjun put it down and left...

325
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,840
My Lord, this is a bribe.

326
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,290
No

327
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,780
I just heard that good wine came from Ming Dynasty.

328
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,190
Among those who called the prince out of the palace to drink and hang out

329
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,050
Is there Gu Zongxiu who is on good terms with adults?

330
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,790
This person has been exiled

331
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,510
I have already severed ties with him.

332
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,900
Cut off contact

333
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,320
Adults must keep their word.

334
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,590
If I deal with them again and deliberately get close to the prince

335
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,450
I will not let you off easily then.

336
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,920
Go back

337
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,200
It's the Queen Mother

338
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,060
good

339
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,910
Then... goodbye

340
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,560
Go tell the Yijinfu Duti Diao

341
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,420
[The Imperial Court is a judicial institution directly under the king and an institution that supports the royal power]
Go tell the Yijinfu Duti Diao

342
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,740
There must have been someone else who called the prince out of the palace before.
[The Imperial Court is a judicial institution directly under the king and an institution that supports the royal power]

343
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,630
There must have been someone else who called the prince out of the palace before.

344
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,490
Who was drinking and hanging out with the prince outside the palace?

345
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,780
Who bribed the prince?

346
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,520
Who sent this woman to the prince?

347
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,580
Let them check it out for me.

348
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,640
I will punish you severely

349
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,180
It's your highness

350
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,090
The Queen Mother Arrives

351
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,650
Please send Lishan and Liyuan to exile.

352
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,680
So be it

353
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,390
I hope so

354
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:18,520
It can prevent more people from dying.

355
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,200
Liyuanjun Lishanjun

356
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,110
Just to clear out dangerous people for the prince

357
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,770
It does not stabilize the kingship

358
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,460
You two fill each other's glasses.

359
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,810
Drink it

360
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,290
Chungnyeong was born with the qualities of a king

361
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,100
That's what people say

362
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,910
You heard it

363
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,790
yes

364
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,220
Chungnyeong

365
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,320
Do you want to be a king?

366
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,020
Father

367
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,890
Answer to Father

368
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,590
In no mood

369
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,330
The only one who can inherit his father's legacy is the prince.

370
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:00,480
The father will definitely establish the tradition of the eldest son succeeding the throne

371
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,780
This is the iron rule

372
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,110
yes

373
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,190
You have to promise your father one thing.

374
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,170
Only use your profound knowledge for the prince

375
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,900
It's the father

376
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,850
Prince, did you hear it?

377
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,940
yes

378
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,120
Chungnyeong will help you

379
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
Everyone will help you

380
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,060
Don't be indecisive

381
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,950
Don't do anything shameful.

382
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,440
You just need to... keep your eyes on the target

383
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,700
Holy King

384
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,910
It must be your only goal

385
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,340
It's the father

386
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,740
You seem to be doing well.

387
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,780
Empress Xie summoned me to the palace again

388
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,260
good

389
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,490
I will never do anything stupid again.

390
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,190
In order to not be abandoned by the Queen

391
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,490
I will definitely perform well.

392
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,860
Ringback Tone

393
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:54,120
Don't forget that you are also the mother of a prince

394
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,930
yes

395
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,180
Empress of the Middle Temple

396
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,940
Niangniang

397
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:19,870
It happened that the Duke of Zhenning was getting married and His Highness conferred the title of Princess on the Queen.

398
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,750
Oh my god, my God

399
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,800
I also rearranged the place according to the princess's specifications.

400
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,590
Please

401
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,720
The Queen is back

402
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,970
Have you been on good terms with Anjo Fuin-kun recently?

403
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,610
yes

404
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,510
Do we need Anjofuin-kun to pay his respects?

405
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,510
I cannot let the Queen run wild like this.

406
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,610
Just let it go

407
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,390
Sooner or later, the middle palace will stab me in the back

408
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,680
That's right

409
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,340
So

410
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,770
Do you still remember the filial palace master?

411
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,900
Previously known as Yingshi

412
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
It's natural to remember

413
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,610
But although she was once favored, she was left alone in Kaifeng

414
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,880
It's been forgotten now.

415
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,190
only

416
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,850
I don't know why the adults mentioned filial piety.

417
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,380
There is a woman called Aunt Jiaohe

418
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,180
You go and bring this person to the Holy See.

419
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,520
[Gyoha Auntie is filial to the Queen (Yingshi) and her confidant]

420
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:04,920
grown ups
[Gyoha Auntie is filial to the Queen (Yingshi) and her confidant]

421
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,840
grown ups

422
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,130
Adults, wait

423
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,600
It's almost there. Just try harder.

424
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,280
Yingshi she...

425
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,290
When the filial master came to the villain's home in Jiaohe

426
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,240
Already pregnant with little master

427
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,320
It was probably when I was about to give birth to my daughter that winter.

428
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,760
A group of people came to Kaifeng

429
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,890
It is said that it came from Chudong

430
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,380
chuldong

431
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,470
Isn't it the Min family mansion in the middle hall where I lived before I ascended the throne?

432
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,200
yes

433
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,990
Those people took Yingshi away

434
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,400
There was a blizzard raging there

435
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,910
There are few people and only some wild animals passing by.

436
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,150
They left Yingshi, who was about to give birth, there.

437
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:20,740
It's like I want her to die.

438
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,550
so what

439
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,190
Wind and snow, pain in China and England

440
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:44,680
I can only crawl on the frozen ground with my bare hands, barely breathing.

441
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,250
It was the villain's brother who found her.

442
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,350
Maybe God helped me

443
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,990
The little girl's brother finally took her to a nearby stable.

444
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,120
Helped her give birth to a child

445
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,680
So to speak

446
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,020
Who in Chudong ordered this?

447
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,610
The Lord doesn't seem to believe it.

448
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,910
What happened

449
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,510
Get out of the way

450
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,240
What is it?

451
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,020
Including the Queen Mother

452
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,200
All the palace maids in the Central Palace

453
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,000
From this moment on, you are forbidden to leave the Central Palace. This is an imperial decree.

454
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,260
What

455
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,490
What happened

456
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,340
I don't know either.

457
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,770
But I am acting on orders.

458
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,400
Get out of the way

459
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,410
You Min family

460
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,100
Did you intend to murder Jing Ningjun and his mother in the past?

461
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,050
[Jingning Jun Taizong's second son was born to the filial palace master]
Did you intend to murder Jing Ningjun and his mother in the past?

462
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,200
Did you intend to murder Jing Ningjun and his mother in the past?

463
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,380
This is wrong, Your Highness.

464
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,290
[Lishan Jun Min Wuhui, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyung]
This is wrong, Your Highness.

465
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:12,540
This is wrong, Your Highness.

466
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,690
How dare I plot such a thing?

467
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,080
I have never done such a thing.

468
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,100
This must be a false accusation by someone who intends to murder me.

469
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,590
[Liyuan Gun Min Wuxiu, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong]
This must be a false accusation by someone who intends to murder me.

470
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,660
Please Your Highness,

471
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,930
Get them on their knees

472
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,070
yes

473
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,890
I ask again

474
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,190
You Min family

475
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,960
Did you deliberately murder Jing Ningjun and his mother?

476
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,370
Never

477
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,490
I have never had

478
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,060
Please, Your Highness...

479
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Grant me a death

480
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,730
I have never

481
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,460
To Yewon-gun Min Mu-su

482
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,130
Lishan Jun Min Wuhui

483
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,230
Death

484
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,150
[The death penalty is a punishment for favoring a minister or a king who gives him poison]
Death

485
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,280
[The death penalty is a punishment for favoring a minister or a king who gives him poison]

486
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,570
Your Highness, please summon the imperial physician.

487
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,140
No need

488
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:12,240
My family would never do this.

489
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,780
The one who knows best that this won't happen is His Majesty.

490
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,020
But

491
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,850
My Lord, you know it best, but you still do it?

492
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,880
I saw

493
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,490
Saw it

494
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,290
What did you see?

495
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,450
Liyuanjun despises the Crown Prince's servant

496
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,050
rumor...

497
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,050
true

498
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,350
If this matter is exposed, it may cause serious harm to the prince's family.

499
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,520
The Lord then found other reasons

500
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,540
And this reason

501
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,570
It was prepared by Li Shufan.

502
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,750
yes

503
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,860
tomorrow

504
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,850
The Lord said he would come to comfort the Queen

505
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,190
No

506
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,660
No need

507
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,520
Empress of the Middle Temple

508
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,110
My Lord, you don't need to comfort me, and neither do I.

509
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:24,440
My Lord, just do your job.

510
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,980
Your Excellency conveyed this

511
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,070
yes

512
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,380
The Queen said that the Master should just do His duty.

513
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,840
Xu Shanggong

514
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,750
The Queen Mother

515
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,020
Open it

516
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,480
I'm going to find the prince.

517
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,660
It's the queen

518
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,980
The Queen Mother is so early in the morning

519
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,120
Your Majesty, why don't you stay in the palace to calm your mind?

520
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,910
The Lord has ordered the death of all my brothers.

521
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,610
If I lie down in the center palace to rest at this time

522
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,060
Then some good people will come out and say

523
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,770
The middle palace was sick

524
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,380
Whether it is for the court

525
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,470
Or for my own sake?

526
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,260
This is definitely not a good thing.

527
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,410
But the Queen Mother

528
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,570
At this time, you have to take care of yourself first

529
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,190
Don't blame yourself, ma'am.

530
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,730
It's not the Queen's fault

531
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,630
Even if they committed a heinous crime, they are still blood relatives.

532
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,170
If I were a slave

533
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,400
I can't help but blame His Highness

534
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,450
They are all the queen's brothers, Xu Shanggong

535
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,170
This palace does not blame

536
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,670
Queen Mother

537
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,910
The Queen Mother can call me over.

538
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,870
No problem

539
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,640
Where is the prince?

540
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,620
Where is the prince?

541
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,540
Left the palace last night

542
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,340
The prince seemed to miss the gisaeng and left the palace

543
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,060
My mother is too embarrassed to see you.

544
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,660
I will endure and get through this.

545
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,640
Don't have to endure

546
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,770
Don't try to get through it.

547
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:44,760
Sometimes these things make people endure and endure

548
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,620
Instead, it will become a swamp in life

549
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,080
It's the Queen Mother

550
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,530
Come in

551
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,900
Isn't this the princess?

552
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,060
Where is the Queen Mother?

553
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,180
The queen is inside

554
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,200
What is it?

555
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,770
This afternoon, I will go to see Anseongbu Won-gun Lee Suk-fan

556
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,800
[Your Highness’s respectful title for the Crown Prince]
This afternoon, I will go to see Anseongbu Won-gun Lee Suk-fan

557
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,330
This afternoon, I will go to see Anseongbu Won-gun Lee Suk-fan

558
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,040
What

559
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,430
By then, I'm afraid you will receive the Black Horn Bow

560
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,230
Black Horn Bow

561
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,440
How did you know this?

562
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,210
Yesterday, the Lord of Ancheng Prefecture came to pay his respects to me.

563
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,970
He said that he would soon have the Crown Prince's residence in his hands.

564
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,920
I quietly inquired about the meaning of this sentence and hurried over to report.

565
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,600
Hearing that the exiled Gu Jong-su found the Black Horn Bow

566
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,190
And Anchengfuyuanjun Li Shufan will secretly present this item to the prince

567
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,840
Ah, this is North Korea's No. 1 black horn bow

568
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,500
This prince will never forget the help from Ancheng Fuyuanjun.

569
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,130
Your Majesty, please don't forget

570
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,770
I have given up everything for you.

571
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,300
Your Highness will always be my beloved subject, just as he is now.

572
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,620
It’s natural

573
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,520
Why does Your Majesty...

574
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,930
Your Majesty is not

575
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,400
Your Highness

576
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,000
I will be loyal

577
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,390
This prince will treat you like this in the future

578
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,160
Your Highness

579
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,410
oops

580
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,560
Your Highness...Your Highness

581
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,430
Your Highness

582
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:28,040
Is this a bribe from a criminal in exile?

583
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,730
Father

584
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,750
Bring it here

585
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,160
I have already made it clear that if I send a gift to the prince privately

586
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,900
Or if he was called out of the palace to drink and hang out, he would be severely punished.

587
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,580
Your Highness is not like that.

588
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,380
No need to say more

589
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,880
Deprive Ancheng Prefecture Prince Li Shufan

590
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,950
The Record and Certificate of the Official of the Ministry of Justice Liu Sina

591
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,570
[Iron plaque recording the meritorious service of the hero]
[Certificate of appointment to an official position]
The Record and Certificate of the Official of the Ministry of Justice Liu Sina

592
00:41:59,570 --> 00:41:59,700
Exile
[Iron plaque recording the meritorious service of the hero]
[Certificate of appointment to an official position]

593
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,530
Exile

594
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,310
Your Highness Your Highness...

595
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,460
yes

596
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,950
Your Highness

597
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,050
Please understand, Your Highness, Your Highness has misunderstood.

598
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,460
Your Highness

599
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,570
Please withdraw the imperial edict.

600
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,700
Please listen to me, Your Highness.

601
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,260
My Lord ignored my warning.

602
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,730
From now on, I am afraid I will never be able to see my Lord alive again.

603
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,520
Prince...

604
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,270
Before the calling

605
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,550
You are not allowed to leave the palace.

606
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,750
yes

607
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,380
Father

608
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,900
Take people away

609
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,850
That's not the case...

610
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,580
I have no choice but to report this to Your Highness.

611
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,070
The crown prince is the king who will inherit the throne one day.

612
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,850
How could the middle temple humiliate him like this?

613
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,130
Your Highness must not deliberately turn a blind eye

614
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,910
Your Highness must see clearly

615
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:04,150
The prince has no kingly demeanor

616
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,410
nave

617
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,460
Now, His Royal Highness

618
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:13,190
It's time to take back the heavy clothes that the prince is going to wear.

619
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,060
The nave is really cruel

620
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,520
Whether it's for me or for the prince

621
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:26,700
The Supreme King once said

622
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,170
[The father of the Grand King Taejo Lee Seong-gye and the King Taejong Lee Bang-won]
The Supreme King once said

623
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,420
If someone destroys the kingship and ruins the country
[The father of the Grand King Taejo Lee Seong-gye and the King Taejong Lee Bang-won]

624
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,040
If someone destroys the kingship and ruins the country

625
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,410
Even children can kill them.

626
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,260
The grief of having to kill his son

627
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,110
The king's righteousness

628
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,370
Is it different, Your Highness?

629
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:46,540
What does this mean?

630
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,200
If the crown prince destroys the kingship and ruins the country

631
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,800
Your Highness can be sure that he will not take out

632
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,300
The hammer that the Supreme King took out?

633
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,030
nave

634
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,190
The Widow

635
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,960
I am different from my father.

636
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,360
If the father passes the throne to the eldest son

637
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,120
Previous Year of Wuyin

638
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,590
I will never kill Fang Fan and Fang Shuo.

639
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,390
[Li Fangfan Li Fangshuo
Lee Bang-won's half brother, son of Queen Sindeok]
I will never kill Fang Fan and Fang Shuo.

640
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,420
If the father passes the throne to the eldest son
[Li Fangfan Li Fangshuo
Lee Bang-won's half brother, son of Queen Sindeok]

641
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,520
If the father passes the throne to the eldest son

642
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,820
Your Highness will definitely not sit on this dragon throne

643
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,690
I'm afraid I'll feel lost and cry

644
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:49,740
After all, His Highness desires this throne more than anyone else.

645
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,360
Is there no prince who desires the throne more than anyone else?

646
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,530
I am afraid that there will be another bloody storm among the princes.

647
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,140
so

648
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,110
I want to establish my eldest son as the heir to the throne to prevent future troubles.

649
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:11,690
I know best what Your Highness is afraid of.

650
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,690
I am also afraid

651
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,560
But the prince has no qualifications to be a king

652
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,100
I will teach him

653
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,420
Teach him that

654
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,940
The prince once wanted to accept bribes from criminals

655
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,700
There was also a big banquet outside the palace

656
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,890
The prince is defying the order.

657
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,660
I will teach him

658
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,390
I will teach him myself without asking anyone else to do it.

659
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,840
The middle palace has always understood me better than anyone else.

660
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,850
Although there were disputes, in the end the palace supported me.

661
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,430
I hope the Central Palace will support this time.

662
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,850
Why did the Queen Mother do this?

663
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:06,310
Does the Queen Mother know how disappointed the King is with me?

664
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,080
Are you afraid of falling out of favor with your father?

665
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,920
You are the Blackhorn Bow who intends to accept bribes from criminals.

666
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,170
Naturally, we must take responsibility for this matter first

667
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,360
The throne is not a place of responsibility

668
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,030
It's about accountability.

669
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:25,610
The king is responsible

670
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,220
Queen Mother

671
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,470
When the Lord was planning to pass the throne to you

672
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:37,030
Your uncles wanted to force you onto the throne without any preparation.

673
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,000
If it wasn't for the Queen Mother stopping me

674
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,150
The Lord will certainly draw his sword against you

675
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,960
If you succeed to the throne and fail to implement benevolent policies

676
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,290
Where will the Lord's sharp blade point to?

677
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:51,680

680
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,000
The three military headquarters are all in the hands of the master...

681
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,210
Is it unpalatable?

682
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,470
Won't

683
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,570
This is the meal that people usually eat.

684
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:46,380
Just forget about yesterday.

685
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,280
The Father has punished those who led you astray.

686
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,690
yes

687
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:58,340
You just need to study hard to cultivate your qualities as a king.

688
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,840
Father

689
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:13,390
Do you think your son can become a sage king?

690
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,900
Father, do you think I have what it takes to be a king?

691
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,610
Just work hard

692
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:34,640
This matter... just need hard work?

693
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,460
Work hard

694
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,770
I want to know why my father is so determined to make me the crown prince.

695
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,020
Because you are the eldest son

696
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,880
But my father is not the eldest son

697
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,830
so

698
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,480
Father wants to establish you

699
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,070

[Youngest son of Prince Seongnyeong, Taejong Lee Bang-won and Queen Wonkyeong]

702
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:40,160
Chungnyeong is good in everything. I am just worried that he is a little weak.

703
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,640
Chungnyeong may look a bit weak at first glance

704
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,980
But the decisiveness after careful consideration

705
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,570
But no one can beat Chungnyeong

706
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,030
Cheng Ning

707
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,290
Come here

708
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,900
Father

709
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,940
You've grown taller again.

710
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,620
In the past month, I seem to have grown an inch taller.

711
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,390
good...

712
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,200
It's true

713
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,920
Grass green is a color but it also has flavor.

714
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,370
What does it taste like?

715
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,010
Fresh scent

716
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:50,150
There is a breath of quietly blooming and growing

717
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,550
I really like this taste.

718
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,030
Our Seong-Ning is truly the number one poet in North Korea.

719
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,560
Not just North Korea

720
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,910
Your hands are a little hot

721
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,930
I have a low fever.

722
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,130
When did it start?

723
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,240
She said she has had a low-grade fever since this morning.

724
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,310
Not in the way

725
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,580
Don't worry, son.

726
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,230
Where is the imperial physician?

727
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:23,950
I can't hear the sound of Xuanqin at all recently.

728
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:28,010
I have recently left Xuanqin behind and devoted myself to tea art.

729
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,650
Tea Art

730
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,430
Make tea and pour tea

731
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,460
Savor the aroma of tea

732
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,850
It allows people to focus on themselves

733
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,310
Your Highness

734
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:54,580
I have heard what the Queen Mother reported about the Crown Prince's residence.

735
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,430
yes

736
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,610
I dare to make a suggestion

737
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:03,440
The words of the Queen Mother are true

738
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,350
It's fine for others, but why do you say that?

739
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:13,380
Frankly speaking, Your Highness is also feeling uneasy.

740
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,220
Your Highness

741
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,310
In the long run...

742
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,830
My thoughts will not change

743
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:21,090
There is no need to mention this matter again

744
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,710
Your Highness

745
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,230
Your Highness

746
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,270
What is it?

747
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,260
Lord Chengning...

748
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,370
Suffering from...suffering from acne

749
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:37,870
[Smallpox is an infectious disease with a very high mortality rate]
Suffering from...suffering from acne

750
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:38,230
[Smallpox is an infectious disease with a very high mortality rate]

751
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,560
Acne
[Smallpox is an infectious disease with a very high mortality rate]

752
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,700
You mean smallpox?
[Smallpox is an infectious disease with a very high mortality rate]

753
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,380
You mean smallpox?

754
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,210
The slaves are terrified

755
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,740
His Majesty has arrived

756
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,770
Son

757
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,590
No need to get up

758
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,220
Just lie down.

759
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:17,510
Lie down well

760
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,100
Father

761
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,960
I'm sorry to have made my father worried.

762
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,230
Won't

763
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:28,750
No problem

764
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,000
Come over here and talk to me.

765
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,510
It's your highness

766
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,160
Are you sure it's acne?

767
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,910
It is true

768
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,360
So...

769
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,710
What to do

770
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:11,400
I have the audacity to prescribe Baidu San and Shengma Gegen Tang.

771
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,510
He is helping Lord Seongnyeong to eliminate the accumulated disease in his body.

772
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:20,780
But...I can still live

773
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,530
Save Him

774
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:26,360
He must be saved

775
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,620
The next three or four days are critical

776
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,920
The heat must be lowered within a few days.

777
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,640
We must...save him

778
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,260
Your Highness

779
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,880
Um

780
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:55,190
Smallpox is highly contagious

781
00:56:55,190 --> 00:57:00,580
No other princes and princesses are allowed to come

782
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,670
good

783
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,640
The prince was suffering from pox

784
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,650
I think it will spread among the people.

785
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:13,510
Your Highness must take good care of the people of Dawn

786
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,560
Cheng Ning here

787
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,670
I will keep it

788
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,420
My son is so seriously ill

789
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:29,070
You call me a widow...

790
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,940
Go take care of the people of Dawn first

791
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:25,430
[Preview of the next episode]

792
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,980
I heard that pox will start to ooze pus from the third day.

793
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,560
Where is the prince?

794
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,630
Are you still a human being?

795
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,930
Please depose the crown prince.

796
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,210
Banish the prince to a foreign land

797
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:42,500
You added Xanthium sibiricum to the bath water of the Queen Mother.

798
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,710
If you want to change the master's mind, you have to risk your life.

799
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,530
Are you really selfless?

800
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,490
But the middle temple asked you to say so

801
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:53,350
If one of the younger brothers ascends the throne

802
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:56,230
I will definitely chop him off.
