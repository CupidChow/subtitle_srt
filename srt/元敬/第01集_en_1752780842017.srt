I heard that he privately

122
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,550
Frankly speaking, the Lord and the Min family are the masters of the world together.

Didn't the Central Palace secretly prepare something?

129
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,010
Let us prepare some weapons

130
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,820
I was shocked at the time.

131
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,560
I'm worried about what to do if the nave is exposed.

132
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,770
The Queen Mother should have been born a man

133
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,160
Whether it is courage or other

134
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,920
If the palace is a man

135
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,720
Wouldn't he become the king of a country?

136
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,700
Your Highness has always been like this before, no matter what I say

137
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,540
His Highness just smiled.

138
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,840
In fact, every time this happens, I can't figure it out.

139
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,200
What is your Highness thinking?

140
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,910
Yeah, I can understand that.

141
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,700
Hidden and cautious

142
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,890
Only in this way can we save our lives during those days.

00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,280
But Your Highness

144
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,150
Now the world is at your feet.

145

Your Highness, you can speak freely.

146

This is the first time

147
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,170
If I speak frankly

148
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,590
Can the two uncles accept this?

149
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,780
No, Your Highness, what are you talking about?

150
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,000
How can we not understand your Majesty?

151
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,120
You drank too much

152
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,460
Today is a happy day

153
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,650
But some things should be said and some things should not be said

154
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,520
Your Majesty is still sitting.

155
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,140
How dare you say that if the Queen was born a man, she would be the king of a country?

156
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,070
Isn't this what we are talking about now?

157
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,420
I'm just saying you two are a match made in heaven...

158
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,470
Even if you mean this,

159

What to do on a happy day?

160
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,790
Stop arguing.

161
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,170
Come

162
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,560
Come over and have a drink

Your Highness

165
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,100
Your Highness finally did it.

166
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,100
We did it together

167

She's definitely on our side.

175
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,880
I don't know what my father thinks.

176
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,440
As long as we can prove it to the people tomorrow

177
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,240
Our facts are the right path.

178
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,310
Without you

179
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,280
If I were alone

180
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,100
I'm afraid I won't even take the first step.

181
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,170
I am also

182
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,420
It is because my husband is by my side that I dare to dream

183
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,210
The world you and I will face next

184
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,960
It will be completely different from before

185
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:26,090
I hope you will not be afraid and move forward bravely.

186
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,450
There will be some unexpected sacrifices this time.

187
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,690
This is what you and I need to bear.

188
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,010
This is the throne created by God.

189
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,970
This honor belongs only to His Highness.

190
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,730
Next, Your Highness can show...

191
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,830
Great ambitions

nave

193
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,110
Your Highness

194
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,210
[Opening Beijing]

195
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,140
Is it because of the change of king?

196
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,340
Ouch! Ouch!

197
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,570
Why is there such a severe drought?

198
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:23,990
Ouch

199
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,350
This is the wrath of God. This is the wrath of God.

200
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,810
There are more than one or two dead.

201
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,350
I heard that he killed all his younger brothers.

202
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,180
you do not say

203
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,960
In the end, he was able to sit on the throne by relying on the Central Palace.

204
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,320
What are you whispering?

205
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,000
Who in the world doesn't know?

206
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,760
The Supreme King just couldn't stand his behavior so he took the seal and left.

207
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,110
What

208
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,170
Not so...

209
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,310
Doesn't the king have a seal now?

210
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,930
Mr. Pan Zhu, are the food and wine to your liking?

211
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,820
Is that the blind fortune teller?

212
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,770
Is there a room available?

mother

214
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,720
Do you have a vacant room?

215
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,580
Regarding whether His Highness's ascension to the throne is legitimate

216
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,220
There are negative comments in the market.

217
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,690
Is that what Pansu said?

218
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,370
The ministers in the court also discussed

219
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,740
don't want

Asshole

222
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:39,070
I clearly told you... not to just kill him like this

223
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,860
It wasn't the Lord who did it himself.

224
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,200
Many people were wrongly accused, their property was robbed and they were even enslaved.

225
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,970
Therefore, I intend to restore their status as good citizens.

226
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,400
But Your Highness...

227
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,450
What is it?

228
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,040
In this way

229
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,990
Many yangban lost their property.

230
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,140
How does Your Highness intend to appease their discontent?

231
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,840
If you rely on forcibly seizing people's property to supplement the family income

232
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,870
How can it be considered as his personal property?

233
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,790
I had already applied to the Ming Dynasty for the imperial edict and seal.

Were you unaware of this situation when you sent your envoys?

242
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,930
Your Highness, I am terrified

243
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,160

We try so hard to show our sincerity

249
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,860
I think my father will calm down sooner or later.

250
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,580
Thanks

251
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,370
Your Highness does not need to worry about the Ming Dynasty's delay in sending the imperial edict and seal.

252
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,150
Too hasty

253
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,680
This time the uncle and nephew of Ming Dynasty quarreled

254
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,330
Should I start attacking Liaodong?

255
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,090

At the beginning of the founding of the country, he almost caused the lives of the people of our country

261
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,660
Your Highness, don't worry.

262
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,390

I used to

266
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,310
I value you very much

267
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,030
Well, what job do you do in the palace now?

268
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,890
I am in charge of the candles in the palace.

270
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,630
But still happy

How do I react when I receive these grapes?

272
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,320
You should pay respect to the master you serve...

Let's report to the Central Palace as well.

I am a widow...

280

The person I once respected came from afar

281
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,520
This is a precious thing.

Ouch, that's right.

Oh, so smart.

When I was talking to my father

289
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,100
What are you going to say first?

290
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,720
Please forgive me for being so bold

291
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,850
Ouch, baby.

Lord Helun...

293
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,390
Will you believe it?

294
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,520
What to believe

295
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,780
Believe him to be the king's son

296
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,990
We went to Beijing because we thought we couldn't let the little prince grow up in the countryside.

297
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,690
But I'm sure this is something special.

298
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,150
Or enter the palace

299
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,970
Either die

300
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,030
It must be one of the two

301
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,620
Alas, I said it would only take a moment, but it's not you.

302

What are you doing?

Let's meet the adults. It's really important.

307
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,060
Our master is not someone who can be seen by just anyone.

Anyone? Anyone?

309

Can you bear this responsibility?

Don't wait to regret it later

Oh my Lord

313
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,830
What's so noisy?

314
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,750

You were punished by the Queen Mother and almost beaten to death.

324

It was the current Queen Mother who saved you.

It is true

yes

Green crystal grapes sent by the nave

337
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,890
Father, you can eat it.

338
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,660
Is it good to eat?

339
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,770
Does the father have anything else to tell you?

340
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,660
No more

341
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,510
Do you know why the Central Temple asked you to take this trip?

342

yes

343
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,290
What did your father say after you met him?

344
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,360
Would you like to return to the palace?

Your Highness, I have something important to report.

350
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,330
Your Highness, do you still remember when you lived in the residence in Chudong several years ago?

351
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,670
[The residence of the king before he ascended the throne]
Your Highness, do you still remember when you lived in the residence in Chudong several years ago?

352
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,800
There is a girl named Yingshi
[The residence of the king before he ascended the throne]

353
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,390
There is a girl named Yingshi

354
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,420
You said Yingshi

355
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,630
This is the day when the two princes sleep together

356
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,770
Please send me a little prince.

357
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,810
Very well written

358
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,020
What is your Highness doing?

359
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,140
Do you remember...

360
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,510
Yingshi

361
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,070
She raised a little prince

362
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,610
Your Highness can confirm

363
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,250
That's right

364
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,170
So

365
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,940
She suddenly disappeared

366
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,680
Is it because of His Highness?

367
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,060
This widow doesn't know

368
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,490
Where is she now?

369
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,090
I heard that she seemed to have found Lord Helun's house.

370
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,120
I need to see her first.

371
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,620
So Your Highness, please don't worry about this matter for now

372
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,000
nave

373
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,060
Leave the nave first

374
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,890
Go and call those other supervisors

375
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,040
Hurry up

376
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,270
Someone come

377
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
Leave the nave first

378
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,270
I will buy time.

379
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,450
Your Highness

380
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,270
Is your highness all right?

381
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,470
Niangniang

382
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,150
Empress of the Middle Temple Empress of the Middle Temple

383
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,930
Her Royal Highness, the Queen

384
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,610
The Queen Mother is alright.

385
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,670
Be careful, madam.

386
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,950
There was a fire

387
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,510
This is Yuan Fan

388
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,150
No mistake

389
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,700
So

390
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,770
Sent by the Father

391
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,160
Who tried to kill the king last night?

392
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,730
The little man does not know

393
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,770
Unknown

394
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:06,330
Someone saw you meeting someone privately last night.

395
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,550
I just want to die

396
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,510
Wish to die

397
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,900
You would rather die than obey

398
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,410
Outside the Palace

399
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,870
But there is still your old mother who is now blind.

400
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,360
You have become a traitor and you should die.

401
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,230
But what about your mother?

402
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,140
When your mother dies...

403
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,250
Either they were stoned to death or they starved to death.

404
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,810
Please promise me

405
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,370
in this way

406
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,920
The villain is dead.

407
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,720
The little man's mother...

408
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,590
I promise you that

409
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,490
Speak

410
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,910
Who is

411
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,680
Who is

412
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,100
Don't copy

413
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,920
[The family copied the most elite private soldiers in the palace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye]
Don't copy

414
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,100
Don't copy the house in the northeast
[The family copied the most elite private soldiers in the palace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye]

415
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,620
Don't copy the house in the northeast

416
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,970
[The birthplace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye in the northeastern region, nowadays Hamgyong Province]
Don't copy the house in the northeast

417
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,240
So the person behind this...
[The birthplace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye in the northeastern region, nowadays Hamgyong Province]

418
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,580
So the person behind this...

419
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,680
too...

420
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,410
superior

421
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,150
How dare you

422
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,760
Framed His Royal Highness

423
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,090
Your Highness

424
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,160
Now my Li family

425
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,370
Some people also passed the imperial examination.

426
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,830
It's Dad

427
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,150
Thanks

428
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,530
Thank you

429
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,510
Everyone has always looked down on me because of my poor academic performance.

430
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,640
Sorry for my father

431
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,880
Now you are proud of yourself

432
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,360
Someone who can help my father realize his ambitions in the future

433
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,800
certainly

434
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,660
It's you Fangyuan

435
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,870
Come here soon

436
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,950
Bastard

437
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,780
Father

438
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,900
Only you, Concubine Min, are quiet, chaste, dignified and sincere.

439
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,870
I heard that he privately

440
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:38,630
Frankly speaking, the Lord and the Min family are the masters of the world together.

441
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,940
If the palace is a man

442
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,690
Wouldn't he become the king of a country?

443
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,180
Your Highness

444
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,940
Your Highness finally did it.

445
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,970
We did it together

446
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,670
Without you

447
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,050
I can't get to this point.

448
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:11,630
Congratulations, Madam

449
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,690
History tonight

450
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,880
She's definitely on our side.

451
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,830
The world you and I will face next

452
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,540
It will be completely different from before

453
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Congratulations, Madam

454
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,000
Congratulations, Madam

455
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,610
No one cares about others and acts recklessly

456
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,280
Now that he holds military power, what is there to fear?

457
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,030
My father is Zuo Zhengcheng and my sister is Zhongdian.

458
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,730
Now I have the little prince on my back.

459
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,580
Lijiang Jun is the commander-in-chief of the Central Army

460
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,690
[General Commander of the Central Army in the Central Army Organization of the Early Joseon Dynasty]
Lijiang Jun is the commander-in-chief of the Central Army

461
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,150
It's your highness
[General Commander of the Central Army in the Central Army Organization of the Early Joseon Dynasty]

462
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,470
[General Commander of the Central Army in the Central Army Organization of the Early Joseon Dynasty]

463
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,140
Oh my god ouch

464
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,170
My lady, it's alright.

465
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,910
presumptuous

466
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,390
Empress of the Middle Temple

467
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,360
mother

468
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,440
There's nothing to cry about.

469
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,280
yes

470
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,030
Is this the child?

471
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,770
yes

472
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,250
All your matters in the future

473
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,010
The palace will handle it

474
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,970
So from now on you just need to listen to me.

475
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,320
You understand

476
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,230
yes

477
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,170
So sad.

478
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,370
Since His Highness already has a Queen, why is he still interested in other women...

479
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,720
Oh, the Empress of the Middle Temple

480
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,500
Nothing

481
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,120
Just act as if nothing happened

482
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,430
Your Highness

483
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,600
How is Young-sil doing?

484
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,040
Why do you ask this question, Your Highness?

485
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,690
I want her to enter the palace.

486
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,190
Not only did he let his Highness's little prince enter the palace...

487
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,190
I don't know how the middle temple will react.

488
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:23,040
I want her to enter the palace.

489
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,720
Go and tell Shen Shi that I have conveyed your wishes.

490
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,270
[The secretary who conveyed the imperial edict]
Go and tell Shen Shi that I have conveyed your wishes.

491
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,500
[The secretary who conveyed the imperial edict]

492
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,030
Obey the order

493
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,210
I heard that the Lord ordered Yingshi and his son to enter the palace.

494
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,040
Empress of the Middle Temple

495
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,540
Today is the day that Shuyun Temple has decided to have sex.

496
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,940
Niangniang

497
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,120
I don't know what the lady is doing.

498
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,390
It would not be too late to report to His Majesty when he arrives.

499
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,880
His Majesty the Lord

500
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,150
Open the door

501
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,320
Please step down from the dragon throne.

502
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,060
I hope Your Highness can talk to me at eye level.

503
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,870
This is a matter between husband and wife

504
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,570
Shouting at me

505
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,590
Now, do you still want to sit on this dragon throne?

506
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,830
I want Yingshi to enter the palace

507
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:42,270
Your Highness, do you think that I am here just to ask for a trivial matter like whether or not to let her enter the palace?

508
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,790
I have asked Your Highness to let me handle the matter of Yingshi.

509
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,330
I said I would handle it myself.

510
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,950
She raised my child outside the palace

511
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,120
This matter

512
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,840
How can Your Highness be so confident in front of me?

513
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,770
Whether or not to allow Young-sil to enter the palace is a matter for the harem

514
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,370
It's up to me, the concubine, to decide

515
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:02,610
nave

516
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,320
Your Highness is the king of a country

517
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,210
I didn't want to leave that girl alone.

518
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:12,850
So Your Highness should just rest assured and wait for me to deal with it.

519
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,540
You call me wait

520
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,280
You made the king of a country wait

521
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,520
At first

522
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,850
So many women

523
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,360
Why did His Highness choose Yingshi?

524
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,200
She was responsible for serving the concubines.

525
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,370
I value her very much.

526
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,330
I want a concubine...

527
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,820
Jealous of her

528
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,130
Your Highness, do you know how shameful this is?

529
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,780
A great shame

530
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,270

But they
[Sambong Jeong Dojeon's nickname]

536
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:05,870
But they

537
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,380
Whenever there is a chance, I want to kill you

538
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,700
Your Min family is powerful and has many private soldiers. In order to survive

539
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,990
I have to rely on your Min family.

540
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,380
The shame you felt

541
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,800
I often feel

542
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,530
Always forbearing

543
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,210
How can these be mixed up?

544
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,940
I don't feel any difference

545
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,000
That's why His Highness...

546
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,430
I think this is the most effective way to humiliate you.

547
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,140
Your Highness

548
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,910
It seems that he is no longer the person I have known for many years.

549
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,480
In this world, I am the king

550
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,560
Now you are my subject

551
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,810
Everything is decided by me

552
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,870
You just need to obey orders.

553
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,480
I am not your Highness's subject.

554
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,110
This is a country of sexology.

in this way

Ringback Tone

That's it

562
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:16,130
The king and queen's room is different from that of ordinary palaces

563
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,960
This is planning for the country.

564
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,200
Please remember this, Madam.

565
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,040
The lady has paid special attention to it.

566
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,930
The lights must be turned off so that the Lord and His Highness can not be seen clearly

567
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,980
Your Majesty needs to lie on the left side of His Highness.

568
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,360
No sound

569
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,560
You are not allowed to touch His Highness' body.

570
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,040
You must not climb on His Highness's body

It is the duty of the Queen Mother to serve in the bedchamber

Empress of the Middle Temple

579

If the queen leaves

580
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,000
Many people lost their lives

581
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,920
Please think twice, Madam.

Empress of the Middle Temple

583
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,940
If you are well prepared

584
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,680
You can have sex

585
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,410
His Highness changed as soon as he ascended the throne.

586
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,970
Share everything

587
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,930
You and I enjoy everything

588
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,760
Your Highness, have you forgotten?

nave

590
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,090
If I had known that His Highness would become so miserable

591
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,100
I will never use the power of the Min family.

592
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,230
Let His Highness ascend the throne

593

Visitors

594
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,320
Where is His Royal Highness now?

595
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,070
My lady, you can't

596
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,540
Why not?

597
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:51,580
The Queen of the Central Palace is not allowed to enter the Bedroom

598

Entering the bedroom...

I will drive you out of the palace...

603
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:17,920
But the nave

604
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,770
Did His Highness change once he gained power?

605
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:24,270
He invited His Majesty to personally attend the temple renovation ceremony

606
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,040
Don't you think there's something fishy?

607
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,420
What is the purpose of killing my father?

608
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,530
I want to make everything that is distorted return to its original state.

609
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:34,090
Absolutely not
