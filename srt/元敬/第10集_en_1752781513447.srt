Strict production guidelines were also adhered to when filming child actors and animals.]

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,880
The 100 knots of land that His Highness promised to award were not handed over to Higanji.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,850
Not only that, there are also many people who have not received the relief food awarded by His Highness.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,290
I heard that all this is related to Doctor Mingshan

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,840
It must be that the Mingshan doctor has formed his own faction and despised the royal power.

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,810
How can the king's order be conveyed under such circumstances?

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,560
Your Highness must summon the judge to ask the reason

Your Highness must summon the judge to ask the reason

15
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,220
Master, just go and ask the Imperial Court Supervisor.

16
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,720
Then it will be handed over to His Highness.

17
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,160
I will definitely pass it on to Your Highness.

18
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,410
He said he wanted to see the city.

19
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,260
Have a good walk and take a good look at the capital city

20
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,620
yes

The Lord of today

30
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,980
I never thought that this day would come.

31
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,830
All right

32
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,630
You may have asked about it.

33
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,680
yes

39
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,860
The Lord will definitely be unfavorable to them

40
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,010
After all, they are from the Min family.

41
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,580
I don't know what your plans are.

42
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,390
The master had been suffering from sores.

The master had been suffering from sores.

Show the prince and take the palace

48
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,940
I'm afraid the Empress' help is indispensable for this matter.

49
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,180
Since the Queen is the elder sister, naturally...

50
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,330
Go and find out what the middle temple means first.

51
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,780
yes

Who is this?

56

Isn't this Li Mao, the Lord of Danshan Prefecture?

57
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,280
Your Majesty has not forgotten me.

58
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,940

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,900
I have left the court on the grounds of ill health.

63
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,850

It's ridiculous

69
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,570
Your Highness is still healthy, how can this happen?

70
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,600
The master had suffered from a boil a long time ago.

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,910
In the early years of the palace, once the sore became serious, the master would be so sick that he would lie down for several days.

72
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,710
I heard that the Lord's condition has become more serious recently.

73
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,940
What exactly does Danshanfuyuanjun want to say?

74
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,900
We will quietly make the Master's sores worse.

75
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,620
What

76
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,870
If the Queen Mother takes the opportunity to show the Crown Prince

77
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,380
Then place our people in charge of the military government

78
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,690
I'm afraid I heard it wrong.

79
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,330
How dare you ask me to rebel?

80
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,680
It's just about getting back the power that was stolen.

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,320

89

Just pretend I haven't heard of this.

90
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,490
If you come to me again about this matter

91
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,530
You guys won't be able to survive then.

92
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,340
Oh, sir, you are here.

93
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,790

Lee Moo, who had been to Jeju, also went to the central hall of the Hyeamsa Temple.

102
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,030
This is really

103
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,310
I didn't expect things to go so smoothly.

104
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,620
What do you plan to do?

105
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,140
Anything else?

106
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,430
The Central Palace seems to have sent someone to the palace

107
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,390
Send someone

108
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,990
This person seems to have a letter in his hand.

109
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,480
Someone come

110
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,290
It's Master

111

Who destroyed this flower?

112
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,920
Go find the person quickly.

113
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,020
yes

116

oh

117
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,790
Where shall we rest for the night?

118
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,610
Let's find a pub or a place to stay for the night.

119
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,530
yes

120
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,770
Where is it around here?

121
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,770
Yeah, it should be over there.

122
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,990
Who

123
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,160
Take it

124
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,860
Is this the letter that the Queen Mother wants to send back to the palace?

125
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,350
It's Master

126
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,150
I almost lost my life.

127
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,530
So Tanzanfuin-kun

128
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,810

Contact with the exiled Lijiangjun and Lichengjun

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,760
He also secretly met with the middle palace to plot rebellion

132
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,850
Is this what you mean now, my dear?

133
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,660
good

134
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,850
Is there any evidence

135
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,210
It's your highness

136
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,710
If there is no adult, I'm afraid I'll have to give up my life.

137
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,840
[Dansangun Yi Mo, a hero who helped Joseon to establish the country and King Taejong to ascend the throne]

Your Highness

141
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,570
Don't be so hasty to behead him.

142
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,000
Who will get hurt if this becomes a controversy?

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,540
It’s the middle hall and the crown prince

144
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,900
Although Lijiangjun and Lichengjun are far away in Jeju Island

145
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,170
It was not put into practice, but the rebellion was certainly discussed.

146
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:00,730
Aren't you a close friend of Lixingfuyuanjun?

147
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,670
[Father of Queen Wonkyeongun of Yeoheungbu]
Aren't you a close friend of Lixingfuyuanjun?

A close friend indeed
[Father of Queen Wonkyeongun of Yeoheungbu]

149
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,730
[Father of Queen Wonkyeongun of Yeoheungbu]

150
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,400
Don't you think you are too ruthless?

151
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,550
Your Highness

152
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,370
The matter was resolved by executing Li Mao.

153
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,850
Your Highness

154
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,320
I plan to go out hunting temporarily.

155
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,260
Although His Highness can escape

156
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,810
But sooner or later you have to make up your mind.

157
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,120
Going out hunting suddenly?

158
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,900
good

159
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:24,990
So I, your son, will follow my father...

So I, your son, will follow my father...

You stay in the palace
[Yi Ti Ryung Grand Prince]

162
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,410
You stay in the palace

163
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,320
Look after state affairs for me

164
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,790
Lord Helun will help you

165
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,700
yes

166
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,990
You two should stop arguing and live a good life.

167
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,280
Yes Yes

168
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,370
Don't be sad for nothing

169
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,980
Just live well with this moment's mentality

170
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,170
yes

171
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,370
I will keep it in mind.

172
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,290
This spring flower is really bright

173
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,270
In the eyes below

174
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,260
The girl is Haruhi

175
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,580
I am sinking for the girl

176
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,210
From the first time I saw the girl

177
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,570
I fell in love with the girl

178
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,510
Understand

179
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,000
I am neither a noble nor the eldest son of the family.

180
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,080
Compared to your Min family who have royal family and marriage contract

181
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,490
Son

182
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,350
Compared to the spring flowers that wither after heralding spring

183
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:34,320
I prefer the green that fills the whole spring later.

184
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,850
Empress of the Middle Temple

185
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,870
The Crown Princess sent a letter

186
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,950
Is the Queen Mother safe?

187
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,540
The reason why I sent this letter is because

188
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,370
Starting tomorrow, my father will go out hunting for a week.

189
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,530
It looks like the master will be away from the capital for a week.

190
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,760
In this case, why don't you return to the palace at this time?

191
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,990
If the queen returns to the palace, it means that the master is angry again.

192
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,380
I can't do anything to the empress.

193
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,970
Didn't the master say that no one is allowed to enter the palace without the master's permission?

194
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,890
Are you worried that I won't be able to return to the palace?

195
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,170
I don't want to eat simple meals anymore.

196
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,700
You can't get such a refreshing breeze in the palace.

197
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,520
The world overlooking here is also unusually peaceful.

198
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,410
It's all external.

199
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,050
If you look closely, you will find that the palaces, temples, and the common people are all pretty much the same.

200
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,470
[Area where common people live]
If you look closely, you will find that the palaces, temples, and the common people are all pretty much the same.

201
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,820
What do you mean?
[Area where common people live]

202
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:24,880
[Area where common people live]

203
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,930
It's all intrigue

204
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,830
I want to eat this. I want to eat more.

205
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,150
This side is wolfing down the food, and that side is wolfing down the food.

206
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,220
Don’t you feel your damn stomach is full?

207
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,210
My lady, please stop laughing. I am serious.

208
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,970
Hey

209
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,810
What's this

210
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,190
What's going on?

211
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,780
Empress of the Middle Temple

212
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,530
Empress of the Middle Temple

213
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,000
What is it?

214
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,680
Before His Majesty gives His Majesty's order

215
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,970
Madam, you can't leave here.

216
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,340
The Lord has also given such an order

217
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,170
Why

218
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,920
Because the situation shows that the queen intends to rebel

219
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,360
How to rebel

220
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,520
Otherwise, why would they gather the troops?

221
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,490
From today on, no one in the temple can go out.

222
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,990
People outside the temple are not allowed to enter.

223
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,340
How could the Queen be so luxurious?

224
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,680
At first glance, I thought it was the Queen Mother.

225
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,590
You said that because you haven't seen the Queen Mother.

226
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,900
A little gift

227
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,210
This is the rouge that is popular in Ming Dynasty recently.

228
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,430
rouge

229
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,340
As the youngest in my family, I have the smallest job in the Eunuch's Office.

230
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,670
I heard that there is a vacancy for a medicine clerk in the pharmacy.

231
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,930
Shangyao

232
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,090
Shangyao is from the third grade

233
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,780
Responsible for managing the palace's medicinal materials

234
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,480
Take it back

235
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,340
However, I have long heard that the youngest child in my wife's family is extremely powerful.

236
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,270
So Madam, don't worry about going back.

237
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,540
What

238
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,440
So...

239
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,590
During my stay in the palace, I have always been a member of the palace.

240
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,290
Madam, you just need to promise this.

241
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,660
How dare I disobey?

242
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,240
I heard that Shuyi often gives advice on all matters in the palace.

243
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,100
How could you not know that this would bring pressure to the Lord?

244
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,820
But it's just a job for the Imperial Household Department's medicine

245
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,600
This is no small task

246
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,860
If Shangshan doesn't even agree to this request,

247
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,090
Call me this favored second-rank concubine

248
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,430
How embarrassing!

249
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,420
Shangshan, please agree.

250
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,370
You should promise me

251
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,940
You are here

252
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,520
Yes, I have done what you ordered.

253
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,760
We must not let the central hall leave Higanji Temple

254
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,200
But why did the Lord suddenly order such a dangerous thing?

255
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,570
If the Lord knew

256
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,110
You must not let the Lord know.

257
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,390
Absolutely not

258
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,150
While staying at the central hall at Higanji Temple

259
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,300
I will make His Highness agree to depose the Concubine no matter what.

260
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,160
What if adults can't do it?

261
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,640
When the worst happened, the middle temple...

262
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,870
When walking around Higanji Temple

263
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,050
Died at the hands of vicious bandits

264
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,580
Like I said... that was the worst time

265
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,780
yes

266
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,100
master

267
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,130
Is this the person who ruined my flower garden?

268
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,610
It seems to have been stepped on while playing hide-and-seek.

269
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,210
I'm wrong, sir.

270
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,170
Please forgive me for once, sir.

271
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,790
It's really childish.

272
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,730
If it's you, please forgive him.

273
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,640
Put him in a warehouse and let him starve to death

274
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,700
master

275
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,520
Sir, don't

276
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,230
don't want

277
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,470
The master doesn't want him to be a child.

278
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,730
Please forgive me this time.

279
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,250
The little guy is wrong

280
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,410
Someone come

281
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,320
master

282
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,470
Get these people out of here.

283
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,340
Master, Master

284
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,580
He is still a child

285
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,220
The villain is wrong, the master cannot let him starve to death

286
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,920
Master, Master

287
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,630
master

288
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,550
master

289
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Master

290
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,820
Ouch, kid.

291
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,430
What happened?

292
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,080
Wake up!

293
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,660
Drink slowly

294
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,660
Master

295
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,350
They killed Master Minglun

296
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,700
Oh my god

297
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,040
Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva

298
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,210
Is this really okay?

299
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,530
You don't have to go together

300
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,160
No

301
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,620
The servants will follow too.

302
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,860
I will tell those people whose relief food has been taken away.

303
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,300
Okay, Master, please hurry up.

304
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,700
yes

305
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,830
The lady seems to be here

306
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,460
Be careful, madam.

307
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,260
Be careful, madam.

308
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,410
Where is this going?

309
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,250
Who

310
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,070
[Lishan Jun Min Wuhui, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyung]
[Liyuan Gun Min Wuxiu, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong]

311
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,900
By the way, is the central hall safe?
[Lishan Jun Min Wuhui, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyung]
[Liyuan Gun Min Wuxiu, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong]

312
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,780
By the way, is the central hall safe?

313
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,240
yes

314
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,510
It should be more dangerous in the fourth brother's capital.

315
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,070
Call everyone you can.

316
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,900
clear

317
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,860
Let's go

318
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,190
What

319
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,430
How could so many imperial guards let people go?

320
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,580
The subordinate is terrified

321
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,380
But what if the Central Palace enters the capital?

322
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,950
Of course you have to take it

323
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,770
We must catch her and end this.

324
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,040
What

325
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,940
Coming

326
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,190
Let's go

327
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,580
Let's go.

328
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,220
What is it?

329
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,230
We are here to beat the drums to appeal for justice

330
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,040
This drum can't be played by just anyone.

331
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,670
Own process

332
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,370
The people want to appeal

333
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,550
What process is needed?

334
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,860
Middle...Middle Hall Empress

335
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,460
Father

336
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,590
Father

337
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,380
What happened

338
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,460
Father also asked the father to come to the place where the grievances were raised

339
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,450
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

340
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,310
If the Queen Mother is in trouble, I will inform you.

341
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,630
Would you like to help my mother?

342
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,110
Everybody's here.

343
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:14,250
We, the innocent people, were robbed of the relief food given by our Lord.

344
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,530
He wanted to report the matter to the authorities but was beaten

345
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,860
Have any of you had the same experience?

346
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,190
I

347
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:38,940
Me too

348
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,250
All back off

349
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,480
His Majesty has arrived

350
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,710
All back off

351
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,550
nave

352
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,630
What happened?

353
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:06,750
The relief food given by the Lord was not distributed to the people

354
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,310
What

355
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,430
No matter how the people run to the government office

356
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,590
I can't tell His Highness about this.

357
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,100
I had no choice but to let the people beat drums to complain.

358
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,060
Not only that

359
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,750
The field that His Highness bestowed upon Higanji was never delivered to Higanji.

360
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,260
[Farmland and land]
The field that His Highness bestowed upon Higanji was never delivered to Higanji.

361
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,150
The field that His Highness bestowed upon Higanji was never delivered to Higanji.

362
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,330
Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva

363
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,690
In addition, Shufan dared

364
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,530
Without authorization, he took his highness's troops and falsely conveyed the imperial edict.

365
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:41,000
I, the queen, am imprisoned in the Higan Temple.

366
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,280
Your Highness

367
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,970
This is true

368
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,490
This is because…

369
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:56,450
I have received an imperial decree from His Highness to place the Empress Dowager under house arrest.

370
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,020
Who spread it?

371
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,600
I ask you who spread this

372
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,110
Ming...Mingshan...

373
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,330
Doctor Mingshan

374
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,990
Take it

375
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Empress of the Middle Temple

376
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,940
Empress of the Middle Temple

377
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,610
These are the Min family's confidants who are hiding quietly.

378
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,320
It seems that he came to rescue the Queen Mother.

379
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,020
Madam, are you okay?

380
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,340
Wanwang Your Highness will sympathize with the Queen

381
00:29:36,340 --> 00:30:01,630
The Empress of the Middle Temple...

382
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,660
who

383
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,740
Wait, let me tell you a few words first.

384
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,430
Wait till you die

385
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,430
Help…

386
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,510
If it happens

387
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,060
Why hasn't there been any news yet?

388
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,260
No news is good news

389
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,300
Last night's dream was also quite auspicious

390
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,260
only

391
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,970
I don't know why the sea today

392
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,320
Extraordinarily blue and vast

393
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,440
The palace has received a detailed report

394
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,640
Knowing what happened in the harem during my absence

395
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,940
The concubines serving the master must act with a clear conscience

396
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,250
The people will trust and follow the king.

397
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,740
Shuyi

398
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,270
My concubine is here

399
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:24,210
How dare you...interfere in palace affairs?

400
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,030
Empress of the Middle Temple

401
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,480
You should leave the palace from now on.

402
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,360
Ringback Tone

403
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,350
I am your highness's concubine.

404
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,810
Without His Majesty's decree...

405
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,260
This palace is the head of the inner ladies.

406
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,300
Empress of the Middle Temple

407
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,530
You forced yourself to stand on the edge of the cliff

408
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,450
Go and convey my will to order the exiled Lord Lijiang and Lord Licheng to commit suicide

409
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,450
[Suicide]
Go and convey my will to order the exiled Lord Lijiang and Lord Licheng to commit suicide

410
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,580
[Suicide]

411
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:31,980
Empress of the Middle Temple

412
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,670
The Lord ordered Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun to commit suicide

413
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,170
What should I do?

414
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,060
Empress of the Middle Temple

415
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,620
The world you and I will face next

416
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,330
It will be completely different from before

417
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:48,310
I hope you will not be afraid and move forward bravely.

418
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,020
There will be unexpected sacrifices along this road.

419
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,400
This is what you and I need to bear.

420
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:02,240
The Queen Mother has properly buried the remains of her two younger brothers.

421
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,870
The funeral was done

422
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,800
In the future, we will also quietly organize a Jiandu Fast.

423
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,070
Pray for the souls of the two deceased

424
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:16,230
Thank you very much, Madam.

425
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:24,310
As a mother, I have been praying for the safety of the Queen Mother.

426
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,380
Please ask Zheng Shanggong to convey this to me.

427
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,340
But no matter what, my lady, please meet me before you leave.

428
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,160
Niangniang

429
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,870
It's all my fault.

430
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,150
No

431
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,660
The Queen Mother seems to have accepted everything calmly

432
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,410
The news has been sent back to the palace

433
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,220
OK

434
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:45,370
I heard that no one starved to death during the spring famine.

435
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,680
No longer will the people be robbed of their food and property by corrupt officials.

436
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,140
After His Majesty sat on the throne

437
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,090
The world has really changed.

438
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,840
Chungnyeong

439
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,620
Now that you're here, why don't you say anything?

440
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:38,860
I am afraid of interrupting my mother's sword practice.

441
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,770
[Prince Yi Seokchungnyeong later became King Sejong]
I am afraid of interrupting my mother's sword practice.

442
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,900
Just wait quietly
[Prince Yi Seokchungnyeong later became King Sejong]

443
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,920
[Prince Yi Seokchungnyeong later became King Sejong]

444
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,870
I just saw the Queen Mother dancing with a sword. I can't help but feel that it's a pity for you to be a girl.

445
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,890
Sword training is just a way to exercise the body and mind

446
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,450
What does it have to do with being a man or a woman?

447
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:59,250
I am just worried whether your mother has any regrets as a woman.

448
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,630
Rather than saying that this daughter

449
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,000
My mother does have one regret.

450
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,810
Let's go

451
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,060
[Yi Ti Ryung Grand Prince]

452
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,800
This is the king's posture

453
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,680
Focus on the target

454
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,630
If you set a goal

455
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,120
Don't be shaken by anything

456
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,190
Hitting the Bullseye

457
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,380
You look like His Majesty the King.

458
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,180
I will continue to improve my archery skills in the future.

459
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,020
This kind of shooting skill is enough

460
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,550
Next, I should study hard.

461
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,070
It's the father

462
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,550
Father has sown enough seeds

463
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,980
It's up to you to make it blossom and bear fruit.

464
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,080
yes

465
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,750
Now I only have one thing left.

466
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,720
Hitting the Bullseye

467
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,160
I will definitely make you become that kind of person

468
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,160
Wouldn't it be a waste of such good weather if I just buried my head in books?

469
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,050
I like reading in the sunshine.

470
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,210
There are many beautiful things in this world

471
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't know why you love reading so much.

472

Yinghua Outsourcing

473
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:05,130
Reading can reveal the hidden beauty of flowers to the world

474
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,040
You have read the "University Commentary"

482
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,140
I heard that the Maharaja had studied it many times.
[Liyuanjun Min Wuxiu, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong; Lishanjun Min Wuhui, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong]

483
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,740
I don't know how many times I've read it.

484
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,000
I don't know how many times I've read it.

485
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,880
It's a shame to say

486
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,720
I read it five times

487
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,330
I heard that it took the prince six years to read it all the way through.

488
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,020
The Lord was very pleased and held a banquet to celebrate

489
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,650
I just read it but didn't fully understand its meaning.

490
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,050
That is why people say that the great king has always had the demeanor of a king.

491
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,580
good

493
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,980
I have never thought much about it.

494
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,580
Please forgive me, my lady.

495
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,920
Empress of the Middle Temple

He appointed his fourth brother the deputy chief of staff of Dunning

501
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,580
Isn't it just to cherish our Min family as before?

502
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,200
The master is just seeking a balance of power.

503
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,400
So you two must be careful in what you say and do and not act rashly.

504
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,830
Yes Yes

505
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,910
It’s just that the prince…

506
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,060
What happened to the prince?

507
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,090
Now that you are here, you should at least greet the prince.

508
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:35,710
I have heard that my two uncles hold important positions in the court.

509
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:40,050
It's time to revive our declining Min family.

510
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,430
Revitalize the declining Min family

511
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,260
Look at your majesty now.

512
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,020
I just feel happy and at peace.

513
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,120
If my deceased brothers saw this, they would be so happy.

514
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,170
What is the declining Min family?

515
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,050
Dead uncle

516
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,790
Don't mention these things again.

517

Your Highness

518
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,290
This prince is uncomfortable listening to this

519
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,240
Sounds uncomfortable

520
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,250
Your Majesty's words are too chilling.

521
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,250
Your Majesty grew up in our Min family.

522
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,000
It's fine for others, but the prince should understand.

523
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,690
My brothers died unjustly.

524
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,470
in this way

525
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:26,560
Uncle means that my father killed two innocent uncles.

526
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,780
If my uncle thinks this way, how can he be a subject to my father?

527
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,930
This prince left first

528
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:43,620
Your Highness

529
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,070
Your Highness

530
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,890
It was Li Shanjun who made a mistake.

531
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:52,940
Please forget it, Your Majesty.

532
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,020
Uncles, do you think this prince feels comfortable?

533
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,750
So I will never forget it.

534
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,240
Just remember the unjust deaths of my brothers

535
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,740
Wrongful Death

536
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,460
Your Highness

537
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,630
Do the uncles really not know why they died?

538
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,730
They intend to rebel

539
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:16,450
My elder brothers gave everything to help you ascend the throne.

540
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,340
But the master killed his brothers after using them.

541

uncle

542
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,990
I am the son of the king, the crown prince of this dynasty.

543
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:26,340
They are the criminals who should be killed

544
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,790
Please be careful with your words.

545
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:34,050
If you continue to speak rudely to my brothers,

546
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:38,300
I will never tolerate it again.

547
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,640
Liyuanjun to the Crown Prince?

548
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,050
That happened after the prince had an argument with Li Shanjun and left the table angrily.

549
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:03,200
As a national leader, he is so ignorant of the seriousness of the matter.

550
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,180
[The crown prince who will inherit the throne]
As a national leader, he is so ignorant of the seriousness of the matter.

551

He will be king one day.
[The crown prince who will inherit the throne]

552
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,080
He will be king one day.

553
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,450
What's the difference?

554
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,830
Your Highness, don't you intend to deal with it?

555
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,470
Besides you, is there anyone else who saw it?

556
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,780
This happened suddenly.

557
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,130
So let's not pursue it for now.

558
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,720
A prince despised by his uncle

559
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,670
He will only become a laughing stock among his subjects.

560
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:40,760
This prince must find the black horn bow

561
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,450

This prince must find the black horn bow

This prince will shoot all the arrogant people to protect himself

565
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,270
This prince must find the strongest black horn bow in all of Korea.

566
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:53,300
The man who presented you with a bow a while ago has returned home.

567
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,840
Where should I find it?

568
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,120
Anyway, this prince just wants to get

569
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,470
The Queen Mother Arrives

570
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,860
Thanks a lot

571
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,980
The Queen Mother

572
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:19,650
You should also know that the Lord also learned the way of the emperor from this book "University"

573
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,890
Queen Mother

574
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,320
What happened

575
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,080
Nothing

576
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:33,350
Studying Things to Gain Knowledge

577

Studying Things to Gain Knowledge

Even on this screen with the inscription by the Queen Mother,

580
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,890
Don't just swallow it whole. Think carefully.

581
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,580
This is how you become an excellent king.

582
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,670
yes

583
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,830
in addition

584
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,870
This is the letter Pan Zhu left for his mother five years ago.

585
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,030
Next to the Crown Prince's residence was a musician named Li Wufang.

586
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,820
There is also Gu Zongxiu from the Patrol Office

587
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,400
The prince seems to be leaving the palace often

588
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,980
Hanging out with these people

589
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,520
What these people are trying to achieve

590
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,940
When the prince ascends the throne

00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,810
Can occupy a place

592
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:19,440
There are also rumors that Li Shufan had a close relationship with Gu Zongxiu's brothers.

593
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,950
It's just that this matter is still uncertain

594
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,810
It says what you received from whom.

595
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,660
And how you hang out outside the palace

596
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,980
At that time, the Queen Mother had intended to call the Chief Justice of the Censorate to investigate.

But the palace is in a state of panic because of your uncles' problems.

600
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:38,010
The Queen Mother only punished a few of them and then left the matter in a hurry.

601
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:38,990
Queen Mother

602
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,790
These are not what you need to be a king.

603
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:43,900
What do you mean?

604
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,320
It's strength

605
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,410
Once you have determined your goal, you will never waver.

606
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,020
Sometimes cruelty is necessary

607
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,220
strength

00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,270
Determined

609
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,390
and sometimes cruel

610
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,410
Is this what your king looks like?

611
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,890
The Queen Mother Believes in the Prince

612
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,220
It's the Queen Mother

613
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,990
Go back

614
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,120
Your Majesty, it's best not to look for the Black Horn Bow.

615
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:31,860
Why

616
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,070
The Queen will always watch your every move.

617
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,150
This prince must find it.

618
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:46,070
If we investigate through Gu Jong-soo, we may be able to find

619
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,090
That one who went out of the palace to drink and hang out with this prince

620
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,180
Gu Zongxiu, who was convicted and returned home

621
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,810
It's your Highness

622
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,570
Go find

623
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,390
Ouch

624
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,750
You are here

625
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,010
Oh, the weather is so hot, thank you for your hard work. Give it to me.

626
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:33,260
What herbs did you bring today?

627
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,880
Place it under the east eaves from Shen to You hours

628
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,530
Placed under the west eaves from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.

629
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,750
There is ventilation

630
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,510
Oh, you are thirsty.

631
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:43,780
Ouch

632
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,560
Drink this cup of tea now.

633
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,980
Thanks

634
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,240
Let me see

635
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,610
This is honeysuckle

636
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,570
Oh my god

637
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,930
Marigolds are so pretty.

638
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,610
What herb is this?

639
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,120
Please let me stay by your side.

640
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,070
I am willing to accept any punishment

641
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,670
I was wrong, Your Highness.

00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,570
What are you standing there for?

646
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:35,000
etc.

647
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:27,370
It's great to be here with you.

648

Queen Mother

649
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,400
Don't you think Hanyang is really vast?

650
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,670
There's no end in sight

651
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:45,780
Sir, don't you think Kaijing is really small?

652
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,710
You just said broad

653
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,860
yes

654
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,590
Why is this place so wide?

655
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:59,000
Because it's full of people

656
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,210
People working on the land

657
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,590
People who raise livestock

658
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,550
Hungry people

659
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,800
People with diseases

660
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,560
Laughing people

662
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,380
So you...

663
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,200
Do you want to be the king of this country?

[Preview of the next episode]

Don't you know that the court officials are comparing you to Chungnyeong?

667
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,710
It is said that the prostitute was dressed in the clothes of a palace maid.

668

Hiding in the palace

669
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,050
Is this the girl?

Bring this person to see the Holy

671
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:25,460
My mother once said that the king must be held accountable

672

If any palace maid is willing to come forward and explain the truth

673
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,050
This matter must be fought with life

674
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,790
Your Highness must see clearly

675
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:35,970
The prince has no kingly demeanor
