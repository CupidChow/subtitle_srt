Did you just say broad?

14

yes

15
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,647
Why is this place so vast?

16
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:24,207

[Prince Yi Seokchungnyeong later became King Sejong]

26
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:05,987

00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:30,347
May I ask you a question?

35
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:32,647
Why did the Queen Mother do this?

36
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:37,107
Because your mother saw your father's desire

37
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:44,977
He wants to do this and that for the people.

38
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:47,337
Your father has that desire in his heart

39
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,777
Did the mother say longing?

40
00:02:55,897 --> 00:03:01,967

[Famine relief to help the hungry people]

46
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:12,587
Famine relief?

47
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,587
When I learned that it rained mud earlier,

48
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,087
Many people were starving.

49
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:20,697
I was sad about this for a long time.

50
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,967
I wondered if there was anything else that could be done besides simply distributing relief food.

51

[Relief food is rice used to help people who have suffered natural disasters and the poor]

00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:30,057
But North Korea has no suitable rescue measures

54
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:34,477

I naturally want to leave now, but after all, the road must be repaired.

58
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:47,597

Have you delivered the herbs I sent you at the end of last year?

00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:28,417
It was also carefully prepared by the Queen Mother

183
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,097
Where is Shuyi?

184
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,637
How is Shuyi doing?

185
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:40,387
I heard that you are doing well.

186
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,467
Your Highness

187
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,647
Now, Zhenning has grown up.

188
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,127
How long will you keep the queen outside the palace?

189
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,187
She will be summoned to the palace soon.

190
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:59,067
The central hall seems to have the same intention

191
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:14,777
Who is it? Why is someone here suddenly?

192
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:16,877
Oh...it's Kim Sang-Gong again

193
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:19,897
That disgusting guy is here again...

194
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,247
Who is disgusting?

195
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:22,517
Zheng...

196
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:24,677
Zheng Shanggong

197
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,507
Ouch! Ouch!

198
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:28,747
How come you are here

199
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:37,087
The Queen is considering Cui Shikang's daughter

200
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:39,107
Cui Shikang...

201
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:40,747
Isn't it the military officer?

202
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:43,557
[A second-rank official in the Joseon Dynasty, who succeeded the Panseo as a vice chief official]

203
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:41,957
yes

204
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:46,257
The other party has an outstanding character and a superior family background

205
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:50,287
fine

206
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:59,517
The Queen Mother ordered the mother of the Prince of Zhenning to prepare the wedding herself

207
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:03,297
Your Majesty, it's time to prepare to return to the palace

208
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:35,657
Empress of the Middle Temple

209
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:38,277
What is it?

210
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,637
Something bad is happening

211
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:40,437
What's the big deal?

212
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:44,097
I heard that a woman secretly moved into the palace.

213
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:46,877
When the Lord found out, he was furious

214
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:48,127
What did you say

215
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:50,777
It is said that the prostitute was dressed in the clothes of a palace maid.

216
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:52,977
Hiding in the palace

217
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,407
What

218
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:05,637
Is this the girl?

219
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:19,037
How could you disappoint your father so much?

220
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:22,087
How can such a ridiculous person be a king?

221
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,077
I will definitely pay attention.

222
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:24,797
Will definitely pay attention

223
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,637
What to watch out for

224
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:29,137
Your words will definitely be noticed

225
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:34,077
It's just a common saying. Whenever I want to give my father a lie, I will say this.

226
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:36,057
My son is terrified

227
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:37,877
you...

228
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:42,337
Don't you know that the court officials are comparing you to Chungnyeong?

229
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:43,407
Your Highness

230
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:46,797
Whenever I heard those words, my father would feel terrified.

231
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:50,617
I was afraid that the princes would be pushed around by the court officials and cause a bloody storm.

232
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,407
Your Highness

233
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:52,877
Now is not the time to talk about this...

234
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:57,077
I want to do a good job

235
00:15:57,077 --> 00:16:00,627
Also want to be recognized

236
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,857
But the more I do this, the more suffocating I feel.

237
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:06,417
What you call suffocation

238
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,927
Is it just playing with women in the end?

239
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,957
Your father ordered you to study hard.

240
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:12,697
Order you to practice martial arts

241
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,127
Cultivate a noble spirit

242
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:17,007
[The noble and upright spirit]

243
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,917
There is no noble spirit in the book

244
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:20,427
At least the noble spirit that I know

245
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:22,557
This palace doesn't have it.

246
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:24,737
The palace has

247
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:29,197
Just a bunch of disgusting ministers pretending to be loyal

248
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:35,367
Learn to swallow this disgusting

249
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,137
The King

250
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,587
Father won't understand

251
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,567
Don't understand

252
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:51,347
Those ministers who even looked down on the country's foundation

253
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:50,897
[The crown prince who will inherit the throne]

254
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:54,817
Did you just say that the minister looked down on the country?

255
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,667
Liyuanjun to the Crown Prince?

256
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,757
[Brother of Queen Wonkyung, the Prince of Yeowon]

257
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:03,107
That happened after the prince had an argument with Li Shanjun and left the table angrily.

258
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:02,227
[Younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong, Prince Yeowon and Prince Yeosan]

259
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:06,667
Besides you, is there anyone else who saw it?

260
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,047
This happened suddenly.

261
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:11,407
So let's not pursue it for now.

262
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:15,107
A prince despised by his uncle

263
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:18,457
Which minister looked down on the country?

264
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,087
Father

265
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,457
The father asks who you are

266
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:27,917
Uncles...Uncles...Uncles

267
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,507
The Crown Prince

268
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:39,547
Do you mean Liyuanjun and Lishanjun?

269
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,477
yes

270
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,577
What does this mean, sir?

271
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:11,387
I heard that Liyuanjun dared to punch the prince's mansion.

272
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:14,247
There must be a maid who saw this scene.

273
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:15,817
It's just a rumor.

274
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:19,967
If it's a rumor, someone should spread it.

275
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,227
Whether the rumors in the palace are true or false

276
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,237
If you really want to consider the Crown Prince, you should cover it up.

277
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:28,477
This is the moral duty of a subject.

278
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:31,367
Maharaja

279
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:34,607
Why did Anchengfuyuanjun make this matter public?

280
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:39,417
If your Highness is being disrespected, you should investigate thoroughly...

281
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:43,107
If any palace maid is willing to come forward and explain the truth

282
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:45,877
You have to risk your life

283
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,237
Not hesitating to use other people's lives as a guarantee

284
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:53,117
What is Anchengfuyuanjun's plan?

285
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:55,547
Not the Maharaja

286
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,867
I already have everything...

287
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,867
I am only acting out of loyalty...

288
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,867
How could the Maharaja...

289
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:10,297
Prince Chungnyeong immediately reprimanded Anseongbuwon-gun

290
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,047
The Ancheng prefect was speechless.

291
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,597
Don't mention how happy it is.

292
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:23,267
Is there anything that the prince knows?

293
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:24,537
What

294
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,157
Speak

295
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:31,207
Li Yuanjun was so angry that he punched the prince's mansion...

296
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:33,387
Adults like this

297
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,517
Ouch

298
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:37,217
Empress of the Middle Temple

299
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,857
Queen Mother

300
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:40,307
Where is the prince?

301
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:42,357
The Lord Calls

302
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:46,107
The Queen Mother has something to ask him in person.

303
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:48,837
You ask him to come to the palace

304
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,057
It's the Queen Mother

305
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:54,027
What is this

306
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,787
My son said he would not accept it.

307
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:58,397
Ancheng Fuyuanjun put it down and left...

308
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,837
My Lord, this is a bribe.

309
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:05,287
No

310
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,777
I just heard that good wine came from Ming Dynasty.

311
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:15,187
Among those who called the prince out of the palace to drink and hang out

312
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:18,047
Is there Gu Zongxiu who is on good terms with adults?

313
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,787
This person has been exiled

314
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:22,507
I have already severed ties with him.

315
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:24,897
Cut off contact

316
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:27,317
Adults must keep their word.

317
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:31,587
If I deal with them again and deliberately get close to the prince

318
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:34,447
I will not let you off easily then.

319
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:42,917
Go back

320
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:45,197
It's the Queen Mother

321
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:47,057
good

322
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:51,907
Then... goodbye

323
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:03,417
Go tell the Yijinfu Duti Diao

324
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:05,737
[The Imperial Court is a judicial institution directly under the king and an institution that supports the royal power]

325
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:06,627
There must have been someone else who called the prince out of the palace before.

326
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:09,487
Who was drinking and hanging out with the prince outside the palace?

327
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,777
Who bribed the prince?

328
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:13,517
Who sent this woman to the prince?

329
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:16,577
Let them check it out for me.

330
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,637
I will punish you severely

331
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:21,177
It's your highness

332
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:59,087
The Queen Mother Arrives

333
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:10,647
Please send Lishan and Liyuan to exile.

334
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:12,677
So be it

335
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:18,387
I hope so

336
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:27,517
It can prevent more people from dying.

337
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:44,197
Liyuanjun Lishanjun

338
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:48,107
Just to clear out dangerous people for the prince

339
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:50,767
It does not stabilize the kingship

340
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:56,457
You two fill each other's glasses.

341
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:20,807
Drink it

342
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:35,287
Chungnyeong was born with the qualities of a king

343
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:42,097
That's what people say

344
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:43,907
You heard it

345
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:45,787
yes

346
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,217
Chungnyeong

347
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:52,317
Do you want to be a king?

348
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:53,017
Father

349
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:54,887
Answer to Father

350
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:58,587
In no mood

351
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:03,327
The only one who can inherit his father's legacy is the prince.

352
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:09,477
The father will definitely establish the tradition of the eldest son succeeding the throne

353
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:11,777
This is the iron rule

354
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:13,107
yes

355
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:16,187
You have to promise your father one thing.

356
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:21,167
Only use your profound knowledge for the prince

357
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,897
It's the father

358
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:26,847
Prince, did you hear it?

359
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:28,937
yes

360
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,117
Chungnyeong will help you

361
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:34,437
Everyone will help you

362
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,057
Don't be indecisive

363
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,947
Don't do anything shameful.

364
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:41,437
You just need to... keep your eyes on the target

365
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,697
Holy King

366
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:46,907
It must be your only goal

367
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:50,337
It's the father

368
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:21,737
You seem to be doing well.

369
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:29,777
Empress Xie summoned me to the palace again

370
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:31,257
good

371
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:39,487
I will never do anything stupid again.

372
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:44,187
In order to not be abandoned by the Queen

373
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:47,487
I will definitely perform well.

374
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:51,857
Ringback Tone

375
00:25:55,807 --> 00:26:03,117
Don't forget that you are also the mother of a prince

376
00:26:06,387 --> 00:26:07,927
yes

377
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:10,177
Empress of the Middle Temple

378
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,937
Niangniang

379
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:28,867
It happened that the Duke of Zhenning was getting married and His Highness conferred the title of Princess on the Queen.

380
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,747
Oh my god, my God

381
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:34,797
I also rearranged the place according to the princess's specifications.

382
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:36,587
Please

383
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:47,717
The Queen is back

384
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:58,967
Have you been on good terms with Anjo Fuin-kun recently?

385
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:01,607
yes

386
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:09,507
Do we need Anjofuin-kun to pay his respects?

387
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:28,507
I cannot let the Queen run wild like this.

388
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:30,607
Just let it go

389
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,387
Sooner or later, the middle palace will stab me in the back

390
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:34,677
That's right

391
00:27:34,677 --> 00:27:36,337
So

392
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:39,767
Do you still remember the filial palace master?

393
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,897
Previously known as Yingshi

394
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:43,897
It's natural to remember

395
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:47,607
But although she was once favored, she was left alone in Kaifeng

396
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:49,877
It's been forgotten now.

397
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,187
only

398
00:27:51,187 --> 00:27:53,847
I don't know why the adults mentioned filial piety.

399
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,377
There is a woman called Aunt Jiaohe

400
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:02,177
You go and bring this person to the Holy See.

401
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:13,917
[Gyoha Auntie is filial to the Queen (Yingshi) and her confidant]

402
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:14,837
grown ups

403
00:28:14,837 --> 00:28:17,127
Adults, wait

404
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:25,597
It's almost there. Just try harder.

405
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,277
Yingshi she...

406
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:46,287
When the filial master came to the villain's home in Jiaohe

407
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:49,237
Already pregnant with little master

408
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:52,317
It was probably when I was about to give birth to my daughter that winter.

409
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:55,757
A group of people came to Kaifeng

410
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:57,887
It is said that it came from Chudong

411
00:28:57,887 --> 00:29:00,377
chuldong

412
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:05,467
Isn't it the Min family mansion in the middle hall where I lived before I ascended the throne?

413
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:07,197
yes

414
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:13,987
Those people took Yingshi away

415
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:17,397
There was a blizzard raging there

416
00:29:17,397 --> 00:29:21,907
There are few people and only some wild animals passing by.

417
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:25,147
They left Yingshi, who was about to give birth, there.

418
00:29:25,147 --> 00:29:29,737
It's like I want her to die.

419
00:29:29,737 --> 00:29:31,547
so what

420
00:29:42,877 --> 00:29:47,187
Wind and snow, pain in China and England

421
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:53,677
I can only crawl on the frozen ground with my bare hands, barely breathing.

422
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:56,247
It was the villain's brother who found her.

423
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:58,347
Maybe God helped me

424
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:02,987
The little girl's brother finally took her to a nearby stable.

425
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:06,117
Helped her give birth to a child

426
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:08,677
So to speak

427
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:13,017
Who in Chudong ordered this?

428
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:34,607
The Lord doesn't seem to believe it.

429
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,907
What happened

430
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:29,507
Get out of the way

431
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:45,237
What is it?

432
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,017
Including the Queen Mother

433
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:49,197
All the palace maids in the Central Palace

434
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:52,997
From this moment on, you are forbidden to leave the Central Palace. This is an imperial decree.

435
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:54,257
What

436
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:57,487
What happened

437
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,337
I don't know either.

438
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:02,767
But I am acting on orders.

439
00:32:04,787 --> 00:32:06,397
Get out of the way

440
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:16,407
You Min family

441
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:19,197
Did you intend to murder Jing Ningjun and his mother in the past?

442
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:19,047
[Jingning Jun Taizong's second son was born to the filial palace master]

443
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:21,537
This is wrong, Your Highness.

444
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:21,287
[Lishan Jun Min Wuhui, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyung]

445
00:32:21,537 --> 00:32:23,687
How dare I plot such a thing?

446
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:27,077
I have never done such a thing.

447
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:30,587
This must be a false accusation by someone who intends to murder me.

448
00:32:27,097 --> 00:32:30,587
[Liyuan Gun Min Wuxiu, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong]

449
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:32,657
Please Your Highness,

450
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:34,927
Get them on their knees

451
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:36,067
yes

452
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:05,887
I ask again

453
00:33:08,037 --> 00:33:10,187
You Min family

454
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:14,957
Did you deliberately murder Jing Ningjun and his mother?

455
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:16,367
Never

456
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:18,487
I have never had

457
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:24,057
Please, Your Highness...

458
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:27,717
Grant me a death

459
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,727
I have never

460
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:39,457
To Yewon-gun Min Mu-su

461
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:42,127
Lishan Jun Min Wuhui

462
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,147
Death

463
00:33:44,227 --> 00:33:47,277
[The death penalty is a punishment for favoring a minister or a king who gives him poison]

464
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:08,567
Your Highness, please summon the imperial physician.

465
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:12,137
No need

466
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:21,237
My family would never do this.

467
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:25,777
The one who knows best that this won't happen is His Majesty.

468
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,017
But

469
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:30,846
My Lord, you know it best, but you still do it?

470
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:32,877
I saw

471
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:34,487
Saw it

472
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:37,287
What did you see?

473
00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:43,446
Liyuanjun despises the Crown Prince's servant

474
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:55,047
rumor...

475
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:57,047
true

476
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:04,346
If this matter is exposed, it may cause serious harm to the prince's family.

477
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:06,517
The Lord then found other reasons

478
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:09,537
And this reason

479
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:11,567
It was prepared by Li Shufan.

480
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,747
yes

481
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,857
tomorrow

482
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,847
The Lord said he would come to comfort the Queen

483
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:20,187
No

484
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,657
No need

485
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:22,517
Empress of the Middle Temple

486
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:27,107
My Lord, you don't need to comfort me, and neither do I.

487
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:33,437
My Lord, just do your job.

488
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,977
Your Excellency conveyed this

489
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,067
yes

490
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:54,377
The Queen said that the Master should just do His duty.

491
00:36:44,347 --> 00:36:45,837
Xu Shanggong

492
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,747
The Queen Mother

493
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,017
Open it

494
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:04,477
I'm going to find the prince.

495
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:08,657
It's the queen

496
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:11,977
The Queen Mother is so early in the morning

497
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:16,117
Your Majesty, why don't you stay in the palace to calm your mind?

498
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:19,907
The Lord has ordered the death of all my brothers.

499
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:23,607
If I lie down in the center palace to rest at this time

500
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:26,057
Then some good people will come out and say

501
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:30,767
The middle palace was sick

502
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:34,377
Whether it is for the court

503
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,467
Or for my own sake?

504
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,257
This is definitely not a good thing.

505
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,407
But the Queen Mother

506
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:44,567
At this time, you have to take care of yourself first

507
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,187
Don't blame yourself, ma'am.

508
00:37:48,187 --> 00:37:50,727
It's not the Queen's fault

509
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,627
Even if they committed a heinous crime, they are still blood relatives.

510
00:37:54,627 --> 00:37:56,167
If I were a slave

511
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:59,397
I can't help but blame His Highness

512
00:37:59,397 --> 00:38:02,447
They are all the queen's brothers, Xu Shanggong

513
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:09,167
This palace does not blame

514
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:13,667
Queen Mother

515
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,907
The Queen Mother can call me over.

516
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:19,867
No problem

517
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,637
Where is the prince?

518
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,617
Where is the prince?

519
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:29,537
Left the palace last night

520
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:34,337
The prince seemed to miss the gisaeng and left the palace

521
00:38:36,837 --> 00:38:40,057
My mother is too embarrassed to see you.

522
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:43,657
I will endure and get through this.

523
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,637
Don't have to endure

524
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:48,767
Don't try to get through it.

525
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:53,757
Sometimes these things make people endure and endure

526
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:56,617
Instead, it will become a swamp in life

527
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:01,077
It's the Queen Mother

528
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:05,527
Come in

529
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:14,897
Isn't this the princess?

530
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:19,057
Where is the Queen Mother?

531
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,177
The queen is inside

532
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:27,197
What is it?

533
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:31,327
This afternoon, I will go to see Anseongbu Won-gun Lee Suk-fan

534
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:30,797
[Your Highness’s respectful title for the Crown Prince]

535
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,037
What

536
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:36,427
By then, I'm afraid you will receive the Black Horn Bow

537
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:38,227
Black Horn Bow

538
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:43,437
How did you know this?

539
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:46,207
Yesterday, the Lord of Ancheng Prefecture came to pay his respects to me.

540
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:48,967
He said that he would soon have the Crown Prince's residence in his hands.

541
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:53,917
I quietly inquired about the meaning of this sentence and hurried over to report.

542
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:04,597
Hearing that the exiled Gu Jong-su found the Black Horn Bow

543
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:09,187
And Anchengfuyuanjun Li Shufan will secretly present this item to the prince

544
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:21,837
Ah, this is North Korea's No. 1 black horn bow

545
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:26,497
This prince will never forget the help from Ancheng Fuyuanjun.

546
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:28,127
Your Majesty, please don't forget

547
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:31,767
I have given up everything for you.

548
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:36,297
Your Highness will always be my beloved subject, just as he is now.

549
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:39,617
It’s natural

550
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:46,517
Why does Your Majesty...

551
00:40:46,517 --> 00:40:48,927
Your Majesty is not

552
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,397
Your Highness

553
00:40:51,397 --> 00:40:53,997
I will be loyal

554
00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:57,387
This prince will treat you like this in the future

555
00:40:57,387 --> 00:40:59,157
Your Highness

556
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:03,407
oops

557
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:14,557
Your Highness...Your Highness

558
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:16,427
Your Highness

559
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:37,037
Is this a bribe from a criminal in exile?

560
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:39,727
Father

561
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:42,747
Bring it here

562
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:53,157
I have already made it clear that if I send a gift to the prince privately

563
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:57,897
Or if he was called out of the palace to drink and hang out, he would be severely punished.

564
00:41:57,897 --> 00:41:59,577
Your Highness is not like that.

565
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:01,377
No need to say more

566
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:04,877
Deprive Ancheng Prefecture Prince Li Shufan

567
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:08,567
The Record and Certificate of the Official of the Ministry of Justice Liu Sina

568
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:08,697
[Iron plaque recording the meritorious service of the hero]
[Certificate of appointment to an official position]

569
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,527
Exile

570
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,307
Your Highness Your Highness...

571
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:13,457
yes

572
00:42:14,037 --> 00:42:14,947
Your Highness

573
00:42:14,947 --> 00:42:17,047
Please understand, Your Highness, Your Highness has misunderstood.

574
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:19,457
Your Highness

575
00:42:19,457 --> 00:42:20,567
Please withdraw the imperial edict.

576
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:24,697
Please listen to me, Your Highness.

577
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:39,257
My Lord ignored my warning.

578
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:44,727
From now on, I am afraid I will never be able to see my Lord alive again.

579
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:56,517
Prince...

580
00:42:56,517 --> 00:42:59,267
Before the calling

581
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:02,547
You are not allowed to leave the palace.

582
00:43:03,227 --> 00:43:04,747
yes

583
00:43:04,747 --> 00:43:06,377
Father

584
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:07,897
Take people away

585
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:49,847
That's not the case...

586
00:43:57,147 --> 00:43:59,577
I have no choice but to report this to Your Highness.

587
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:03,067
The crown prince is the king who will inherit the throne one day.

588
00:44:03,067 --> 00:44:04,847
How could the middle temple humiliate him like this?

589
00:44:04,847 --> 00:44:07,127
Your Highness must not deliberately turn a blind eye

590
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:08,907
Your Highness must see clearly

591
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:13,147
The prince has no kingly demeanor

592
00:44:13,147 --> 00:44:14,407
nave

593
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:16,457
Now, His Royal Highness

594
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:22,187
It's time to take back the heavy clothes that the prince is going to wear.

595
00:44:28,937 --> 00:44:31,057
The nave is really cruel

596
00:44:32,117 --> 00:44:35,517
Whether it's for me or for the prince

597
00:44:35,517 --> 00:44:37,167
The Supreme King once said

598
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:39,417
[The father of the Grand King Taejo Lee Seong-gye and the King Taejong Lee Bang-won]

599
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:40,037
If someone destroys the kingship and ruins the country

600
00:44:40,037 --> 00:44:43,407
Even children can kill them.

601
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:46,257
The grief of having to kill his son

602
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:49,107
The king's righteousness

603
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:54,367
Is it different, Your Highness?

604
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:55,537
What does this mean?

605
00:44:55,537 --> 00:45:00,197
If the crown prince destroys the kingship and ruins the country

606
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,797
Your Highness can be sure that he will not take out

607
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:05,297
The hammer that the Supreme King took out?

608
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:07,027
nave

609
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:09,187
The Widow

610
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:11,957
I am different from my father.

611
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:33,357
If the father passes the throne to the eldest son

612
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:35,117
Previous Year of Wuyin

613
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:38,387
I will never kill Fang Fan and Fang Shuo.

614
00:45:35,587 --> 00:45:39,417
[Li Fangfan Li Fangshuo
Lee Bang-won's half brother, son of Queen Sindeok]

615
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:42,517
If the father passes the throne to the eldest son

616
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:46,817
Your Highness will definitely not sit on this dragon throne

617
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:52,687
I'm afraid I'll feel lost and cry

618
00:45:54,107 --> 00:45:58,737
After all, His Highness desires this throne more than anyone else.

619
00:46:02,147 --> 00:46:06,357
Is there no prince who desires the throne more than anyone else?

620
00:46:06,357 --> 00:46:09,527
I am afraid that there will be another bloody storm among the princes.

621
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,137
so

622
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:15,107
I want to establish my eldest son as the heir to the throne to prevent future troubles.

623
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:20,687
I know best what Your Highness is afraid of.

624
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:23,687
I am also afraid

625
00:46:23,687 --> 00:46:28,557
But the prince has no qualifications to be a king

626
00:46:28,557 --> 00:46:30,097
I will teach him

627
00:46:30,097 --> 00:46:31,417
Teach him that

628
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,937
The prince once wanted to accept bribes from criminals

629
00:46:33,937 --> 00:46:36,697
There was also a big banquet outside the palace

630
00:46:36,697 --> 00:46:38,887
The prince is defying the order.

631
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:40,657
I will teach him

632
00:46:40,657 --> 00:46:43,387
I will teach him myself without asking anyone else to do it.

633
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:47,837
The middle palace has always understood me better than anyone else.

634
00:46:47,837 --> 00:46:52,847
Although there were disputes, in the end the palace supported me.

635
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:55,427
I hope the Central Palace will support this time.

636
00:47:07,297 --> 00:47:09,847
Why did the Queen Mother do this?

637
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:15,307
Does the Queen Mother know how disappointed the King is with me?

638
00:47:15,307 --> 00:47:18,077
Are you afraid of falling out of favor with your father?

639
00:47:18,077 --> 00:47:21,917
You are the Blackhorn Bow who intends to accept bribes from criminals.

640
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:25,167
Naturally, we must take responsibility for this matter first

641
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:29,357
The throne is not a place of responsibility

642
00:47:29,357 --> 00:47:31,027
It's about accountability.

643
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:34,607
The king is responsible

644
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:36,217
Queen Mother

645
00:47:37,017 --> 00:47:41,467
When the Lord was planning to pass the throne to you

646
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:46,027
Your uncles wanted to force you onto the throne without any preparation.

647
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:47,997
If it wasn't for the Queen Mother stopping me

648
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:51,147
The Lord will certainly draw his sword against you

649
00:47:52,227 --> 00:47:55,957
If you succeed to the throne and fail to implement benevolent policies

650
00:47:55,957 --> 00:48:00,287
Where will the Lord's sharp blade point to?

651
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:01,417
Bingcao

652
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,357
[An official office in charge of military affairs during the Joseon Dynasty]

653
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:07,997
The three military headquarters are all in the hands of the master...

654
00:48:33,387 --> 00:48:35,207
Is it unpalatable?

655
00:48:36,787 --> 00:48:38,467
Won't

656
00:48:48,787 --> 00:48:51,567
This is the meal that people usually eat.

657
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,377
Just forget about yesterday.

658
00:48:55,377 --> 00:49:00,277
The Father has punished those who led you astray.

659
00:49:00,277 --> 00:49:01,687
yes

660
00:49:01,687 --> 00:49:07,337
You just need to study hard to cultivate your qualities as a king.

661
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:16,837
Father

662
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:22,387
Do you think your son can become a sage king?

663
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:28,897
Father, do you think I have what it takes to be a king?

664
00:49:34,587 --> 00:49:36,607
Just work hard

665
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:43,637
This matter... just need hard work?

666
00:49:44,537 --> 00:49:46,457
Work hard

667
00:49:46,457 --> 00:49:48,767
I want to know why my father is so determined to make me the crown prince.

668
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:50,017
Because you are the eldest son

669
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:54,877
But my father is not the eldest son

670
00:50:00,517 --> 00:50:01,827
so

671
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:05,477
Father wants to establish you

672
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:32,687
Chungning and Seongning

673
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:32,717
[Youngest son of Prince Seongnyeong, Taejong Lee Bang-won and Queen Wonkyeong]

674
00:50:44,907 --> 00:50:49,157
Chungnyeong is good in everything. I am just worried that he is a little weak.

675
00:50:49,157 --> 00:50:51,637
Chungnyeong may look a bit weak at first glance

676
00:50:51,637 --> 00:50:55,977
But the decisiveness after careful consideration

677
00:50:55,977 --> 00:50:58,567
But no one can beat Chungnyeong

678
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:14,027
Cheng Ning

679
00:51:14,027 --> 00:51:15,287
Come here

680
00:51:15,287 --> 00:51:16,897
Father

681
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:20,937
You've grown taller again.

682
00:51:20,937 --> 00:51:24,617
In the past month, I seem to have grown an inch taller.

683
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:26,387
good...

684
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,197
It's true

685
00:51:47,197 --> 00:51:50,917
Grass green is a color but it also has flavor.

686
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,367
What does it taste like?

687
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:54,007
Fresh scent

688
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:59,147
There is a breath of quietly blooming and growing

689
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:03,547
I really like this taste.

690
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:09,027
Our Seong-Ning is truly the number one poet in North Korea.

691
00:52:09,027 --> 00:52:11,557
Not just North Korea

692
00:52:27,097 --> 00:52:28,907
Your hands are a little hot

693
00:52:31,977 --> 00:52:33,927
I have a low fever.

694
00:52:33,927 --> 00:52:36,127
When did it start?

695
00:52:36,127 --> 00:52:40,237
She said she has had a low-grade fever since this morning.

696
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,307
Not in the way

697
00:52:41,307 --> 00:52:43,577
Don't worry, son.

698
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:47,227
Where is the imperial physician?

699
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:32,947
I can't hear the sound of Xuanqin at all recently.

700
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:37,007
I have recently left Xuanqin behind and devoted myself to tea art.

701
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:39,647
Tea Art

702
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:46,427
Make tea and pour tea

703
00:53:46,427 --> 00:53:48,457
Savor the aroma of tea

704
00:53:48,457 --> 00:53:51,847
It allows people to focus on themselves

705
00:53:51,847 --> 00:53:53,307
Your Highness

706
00:53:56,827 --> 00:54:03,577
I have heard what the Queen Mother reported about the Crown Prince's residence.

707
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:06,427
yes

708
00:54:06,427 --> 00:54:08,607
I dare to make a suggestion

709
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:12,437
The words of the Queen Mother are true

710
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:17,347
It's fine for others, but why do you say that?

711
00:54:17,347 --> 00:54:22,377
Frankly speaking, Your Highness is also feeling uneasy.

712
00:54:23,037 --> 00:54:24,217
Your Highness

713
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:25,307
In the long run...

714
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:27,827
My thoughts will not change

715
00:54:27,827 --> 00:54:30,087
There is no need to mention this matter again

716
00:54:32,497 --> 00:54:33,707
Your Highness

717
00:54:36,187 --> 00:54:37,227
Your Highness

718
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:41,267
What is it?

719
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:43,257
Lord Chengning...

720
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:46,867
Suffering from...suffering from acne

721
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:49,697
[Smallpox is an infectious disease with a very high mortality rate]

722
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:48,557
Acne

723
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:50,377
You mean smallpox?

724
00:54:50,377 --> 00:54:52,207
The slaves are terrified

725
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:17,737
His Majesty has arrived

726
00:55:17,737 --> 00:55:18,767
Son

727
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:22,587
No need to get up

728
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:24,217
Just lie down.

729
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:26,507
Lie down well

730
00:55:29,457 --> 00:55:31,097
Father

731
00:55:31,397 --> 00:55:34,957
I'm sorry to have made my father worried.

732
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:36,227
Won't

733
00:55:36,227 --> 00:55:37,747
No problem

734
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:51,997
Come over here and talk to me.

735
00:55:51,997 --> 00:55:53,507
It's your highness

736
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:10,157
Are you sure it's acne?

737
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:11,907
It is true

738
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,357
So...

739
00:56:15,357 --> 00:56:16,707
What to do

740
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:20,397
I have the audacity to prescribe Baidu San and Shengma Gegen Tang.

741
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:24,507
He is helping Lord Seongnyeong to eliminate the accumulated disease in his body.

742
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:29,777
But...I can still live

743
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:33,527
Save Him

744
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:35,357
He must be saved

745
00:56:35,357 --> 00:56:38,617
The next three or four days are critical

746
00:56:38,617 --> 00:56:41,917
The heat must be lowered within a few days.

747
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:46,637
We must...save him

748
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:57,257
Your Highness

749
00:56:57,957 --> 00:56:58,877
Um

750
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:04,187
Smallpox is highly contagious

751
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:09,577
No other princes and princesses are allowed to come

752
00:57:09,577 --> 00:57:10,667
good

753
00:57:11,117 --> 00:57:13,637
The prince was suffering from pox

754
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:17,647
I think it will spread among the people.

755
00:57:17,647 --> 00:57:22,507
Your Highness must take good care of the people of Dawn

756
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:24,557
Cheng Ning here

757
00:57:25,497 --> 00:57:28,667
I will keep it

758
00:57:32,677 --> 00:57:35,417
My son is so seriously ill

759
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:38,067
You call me a widow...

760
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:40,937
Go take care of the people of Dawn first

761
00:58:26,977 --> 00:58:34,427
[Preview of the next episode]

762
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,977
I heard that pox will start to ooze pus from the third day.

763
00:58:37,977 --> 00:58:39,557
Where is the prince?

764
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,627
Are you still a human being?

765
00:58:42,627 --> 00:58:44,927
Please depose the crown prince.

766
00:58:44,927 --> 00:58:48,207
Banish the prince to a foreign land

767
00:58:48,207 --> 00:58:51,497
You added Xanthium sibiricum to the bath water of the Queen Mother.

768
00:58:51,497 --> 00:58:54,707
If you want to change the master's mind, you have to risk your life.

769
00:58:54,707 --> 00:58:57,527
Are you really selfless?

770
00:58:57,527 --> 00:58:59,487
But the middle temple asked you to say so

771
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:02,347
If one of the younger brothers ascends the throne

772
00:59:02,347 --> 00:59:05,227
I will definitely chop him off.
