Sir, you may have guessed who is the clan member who supports the Yegu Jin clan behind the scenes.

00:01:56,432 --> 00:02:00,572
There will be dozens of Lijiang Lords and hundreds of Licheng Lords appearing.

There are relatives among the clan and there are relatives outside the clan.

47
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,852
I heard that Lord Helun was here too.

48

Helun doesn't have much tolerance.

49
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:11,882
I have introduced several houses over there to Lord Helun.

50
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:14,182
And the adults told me to borrow someone else's name

51
00:03:14,182 --> 00:03:15,662
I did as the adults ordered.

52
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:17,802
Really petty

53
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:21,682
Such a territory

54
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:24,432
The price should be high.

55
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:27,232
Lord Helun is always stingy.

56
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:29,462
I just sold it for the money I paid for it.

57
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:38,722
In this case, we will only charge half of Anjo-kun's capital.

58
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,652
I'll just give it to you.

59
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:48,292
What's the difference between charging only half the cost and giving it away for free?

60
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:51,522
Besides, An Chengjun has been paying attention to this piece of land for a long time.

We should keep the existing property and make money.

183
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:06,722
Li Jiangjun

184
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:10,242
Didn't they say that no one in the aristocratic family doesn't do this?

185
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:12,082
But you can't

186
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:13,512
I have clearly warned you

187
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:14,812
minister

188
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,582
I am the eldest grandson in the family.

189
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:21,492
Let the Min family prosper and bring glory to the family

190
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,772
The responsibility lies with me

191
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:25,092
Not the Queen Mother

192
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:25,882
Li Jiangjun

193
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:27,342
Madam, don't you know?

194
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:30,962
The Queen Mother is to blame for the situation.

195
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:32,142
What

196
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,782
At least my sister became the Queen

197
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:38,252
Li Jiangjun

198
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:42,102
If your Majesty agrees, I will leave first.

199
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:55,582
Empress of the Middle Temple

200
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:22,902
Why did you come to the library?

201
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,152
The silkworm ceremony is coming soon.

202
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:29,612
I would like to read some books about sericulture first.

203
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,842
[Sericulture and weaving]

204
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:32,782
Shuyi?

205
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,012
So

206
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:39,592
Why did the Palace Master come here?

207
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:42,272
It's none of your business

208
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:53,102
Even if he is the younger brother of the Queen Mother

209
00:13:53,102 --> 00:13:55,042
If there is a way to make money easily

210
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:59,422
It's human nature to be moved.

211
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:59,452
[Human nature refers to the natural emotions or reactions of human beings]

212
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,592
Can you take responsibility for this?

213
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:06,182
It's better not to say this consolation

214
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,292
yes

215
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:14,112
Isn't that Jin Shanggong?

216
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:19,722
Go and have a look

217
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,702
yes

218
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:26,592
Dad, I don't want to move.

219
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:27,642
Ouch

220
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:30,572
Only two dan of rice and one dan of soybeans

221
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:34,582
Anyway, if I stay, it will be taken away by corrupt officials.

222
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,772
This change of dynasty was just changing the name of Goryeo to Joseon.

223
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:40,232
I'll borrow a wheelbarrow.

224
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:43,142
Hey, are you here to see the house?

225
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:44,452
This house has been sold.

226
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:50,742
Sell it to the Night Vale Jin family?

227
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:53,982
Don't say it's called drug dealer Jin

228
00:14:53,982 --> 00:14:55,852
Drug Dealer

229
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,732
You said a drug dealer bought this house.

230
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,032
Didn't the woman who came with me just now say she was from the palace?

231
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:04,122
How would I know this?

232
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:12,462
Where are you between 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. today?

233
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:14,262
The servant in the palace

234
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:16,502
You are in the palace

235
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:18,862
Where in the palace?

236
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:25,612
The slave is not feeling well, so she rests in the dormitory

237
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:27,472
Rest during the day

238
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:29,572
yes

239
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:32,792
I think I saw you in Nakamura

240
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:32,132
[The area surrounding Jongno in Nakamura]

241
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:33,972
No

242
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,992
My lady must have seen it wrong.

243
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:37,512
Yeah

244
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:39,872
only

245
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:43,582
Why do you ask this, Madam?

246
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:48,422
I think you have been acting inappropriately recently.

247
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,522
I will pay attention to this in the future.

248
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:52,872
What to watch out for

249
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:54,912
What

250
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,722
Don't do things that are not in the light.

251
00:15:56,722 --> 00:16:01,212
Or should we be careful not to be discovered by others when doing something shameful?

252
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,762
Empress of the Middle Temple

253
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,902
You are the palace lady.

254
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:08,402
If I find you doing anything that is unworthy of your position,

255
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,132
By then

256
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:12,602
This palace will not let you off easily.

257
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:14,622
yes

258
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:19,692
Please ask His Highness to come to the Central Palace to sleep tonight.

259
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:21,452
Ke Shuyi...

260
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:26,712
yes

261
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:28,712
The servant will arrange it.

262
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:31,402
Ringtone is not comfortable

263
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:32,952
yes

264
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,502
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

265
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,062
Caught a cold

266
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:39,272
[The term for cold in the past]

267
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:40,892
The cold is no problem

268
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,462
Absolutely not

269
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,902
If it is passed on to His Highness, it will be troublesome.

270
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,642
The imperial concubine was given many instructions.

271
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,942
That widow understood

272
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:55,882
in addition

273
00:16:55,882 --> 00:17:00,032
The Queen Mother requests to sleep with you tonight

274
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,082
What

275
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:12,192
Madam Shuyi, the servant is coming in

276
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:20,342
I have received a message that the Lord will stay in the Central Palace tonight.

277
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:22,212
Why

278
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:24,412
That...that...

279
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:27,021
It is said that Empress Shuyi is unwell

280
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:32,942
This palace is not feeling well

281
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:03,042
I proposed to sleep with His Highness, but it frightened His Highness.

282
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,192
yes

283
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:07,612
only

284
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:11,702
I feel that I am losing face by coming here like this.

285
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,302
Give it to me

286
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:36,352
When the two of you quarreled, you fought to the death, but now you are so affectionate

287
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:38,162
I don't know why.

288
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:40,412
They got along well and had children

289
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,972
We've been through so much together.

290
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:46,472
Of course, some things are absolutely unbreakable.

291
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,262
What are those things?

292
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,912
It's hard to tell

293
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,722
Oh, there must be something.

294
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:07,002
I went to Nakamura.

295
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:09,002
nave

296
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:11,312
If I had informed His Highness in advance, he would have said it was dangerous.

297
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:14,172
I won't let you go.

298
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:18,392
so what

299
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:20,742
I saw the people

300
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:25,612
See how they were displaced.

301
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,952
The palace is overstepping its bounds by doing this now.

302
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:28,622
Your Highness

303
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:30,612
I have considered it.

304
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:33,492
What the Middle Temple said last time

305
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:36,802
Where do I stand?

306
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:41,182
I am not standing beside my clan members or heroes.

307
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:46,272
But it seems that he is not standing next to the nave.

308
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:49,002
I will stand in my place

309
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,792
The position of the king of a country

310
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:56,982
yes

311
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:02,042
It's my question that's a bit stupid.

312
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:11,142
Madam Shuyi Madam Shuyi Madam Shuyi Madam...

313
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:17,292
Your Highness

314
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:18,712
Your concubine...

315
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:22,332
I can serve Your Highness tonight.

316
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:23,832
I will serve you.

317
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:24,492
Ringback Tone

318
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:26,072
Your Highness

319
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:33,912
I still have some things to say to the High Palace.

320
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:35,252
You go down

321
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:36,602
Your Highness

322
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,702
What are the palace ladies doing?

323
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:39,722
Please ask the lady to leave quickly

324
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:40,782
quick

325
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,182
It's Zheng Shanggong

326
00:20:57,482 --> 00:20:59,242
Lady Shuyi

327
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:04,072
I'm going somewhere

328
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:06,532
You go back first

329
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,922
But this...

330
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:10,102
You go back first

331
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:13,902
Yes, slave, obey your command

332
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:57,142
This Xuanqin may comfort you

333
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,742
What book did you say you wanted to read for the wedding silkworm ceremony?

334
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:22,912
But I've finished watching it

335
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,162
I used to be just a slave.

336
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:30,432
yes

337
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,602
The life now is too much for me to imagine

338
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:37,302
It's strange to say

339
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:40,132
If someone wants to take my things

340
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:46,232
I can't bear it even for a moment.

341
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:50,232
Look at the filial palace master

342
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:52,432
What is life like now?

343
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,712
Isn't she guilty?

344
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:56,912
The so-called sin

345
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:59,472
The crime of offending the Queen Mother

346
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:01,522
The Queen is a fair and selfless person

347
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,342
You are better than me...

348
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,362
Do you know more about the Queen Mother?

349
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,912
Even if she already has ten

350
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:14,702
I can also take away the same thing from the concubines in the harem.

351
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:23,402
You just need to remember one thing

352
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:29,032
This Xuanqin may be able to temporarily comfort the Lord.

353
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,342
But I can't win your heart

354
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:36,972
So we have to join forces

355
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,552
us

356
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:41,152
It's us

357
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:11,152
Why does Jin Shanggong treat me like this?

358
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:13,382
Forget about others, why did Jin Shanggong do this?

359
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:16,082
It is really difficult to disobey the order of the Queen Mother.

360
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:17,182
but

361
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:21,262
My loyalty to Madam Shuyi has not changed.

362
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:25,362
Today's events will eventually be redeemed

363
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:34,432
A three-room tiled house with about five stones of rice

364
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:36,312
[One stone of rice is about 160 kilograms]

365
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:38,602
You will collect the houses near Changdeokgung Palace at this price.

366
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,852
I will personally review it.

367
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:43,092
Properly distribute to officials of all ranks

368
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:45,242
Your Highness

369
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:47,272
Market price has been formed

370
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:50,152
Who set this price?

371
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:52,292
But the people decided

372
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:57,022
How much should you pay for your house?

373
00:24:57,022 --> 00:24:58,562
At what price?

374
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:02,302
It's all about people's freedom

375
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:07,772
How can Your Highness take a three-room tiled house and five stone of rice as the standard?

376
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,382
Such forced pricing?

377
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:18,412
I will bear the blame.

378
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:20,442
Your Highness, I am terrified

379
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:22,752
Now we moved the capital to Hanyang not long ago

380
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:27,012
I am worried that I may lose the support of the people in the capital because of this incident.

381
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:30,322
So please take back your order, Your Highness.

382
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:34,192
Please take back your order, Your Highness.

383
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:39,942
Could it be that the people you are talking about

384
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:42,372
Different from the people I know

385
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:46,092
Please ask me to take back my order.

386
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:48,992
In order to fight for an official position, you wanted to kill each other.

387
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:51,932
Why is everyone talking about this now?

388
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:54,632
I am not for others

389
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:56,842
If someone exploits the people to enrich himself

390
00:25:56,842 --> 00:25:59,432
We must punish severely according to the principle

391
00:26:00,752 --> 00:26:03,672
There must be no negligence in hearing the sentence

392
00:26:01,072 --> 00:26:05,882
[The abbreviation of the Criminal Justice Department, the head of the Criminal Justice Department in charge of judicial criminal law and litigation]

393
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:06,762
If there is any negligence in the handling

394
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:10,172
I must ask you

395
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:11,312
I obey your command.

396
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:18,502
We must not allow the Empress to be so rampant

397
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:24,792
We must seize the power of the Central Palace

398
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,952
The Queen is not easy to deal with

399
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:30,992
If he was easy to deal with, how could he become the ruler of a country?

400
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:33,692
Sitting on this throne in the middle hall

401
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:41,652
You already have a plan.

402
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,742
You said you were going to sell the house you bought not long ago.

403
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:54,232
A buyer appeared

404
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:55,522
The asking price is ten times

405
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:00,682
The palace said this cannot be done.

406
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:02,652
Then don't let the middle temple know.

407
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:03,732
Second Brother

408
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:05,872
Now you and I are far away from power

409
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:08,032
If I no longer have financial resources

410
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:11,542
In the end, there will be no place for you to show your abilities in Hanyang.

411
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:16,142
Didn't I say before

412
00:27:16,142 --> 00:27:20,172
The Queen Mother is not on the side of our Min family

413
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:24,642
Don't trust the nave

414
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:29,422
Now we have to go our way

415
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:30,782
Lijiangjun?

416
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,172
yes

417
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:35,932
I have previously introduced six three-bedroom tiled houses to Lijiang Jun.

418
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:39,252
Now we have found buyers for these houses.

419
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:43,852
Do you plan to design it this way?

420
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:49,622
He should be able to earn ten times the interest.

421
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:52,762
After all, he is the younger brother of the Queen Mother.

422
00:27:56,352 --> 00:28:00,632
You should have seen the Empress fall down with your own eyes.

423
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:02,712
Of course you have to see it with your own eyes

424
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:06,312
There was also the silkworm ceremony that was arranged temporarily to withdraw the intention of abdication.

425
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:07,742
I plan to go take a look

426
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:10,692
After all, the Queen has ordered all the female relatives of the clan to be present.

427
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,912
only

428
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:25,752
Li Jiangjun is not the only one who has expanded his family fortune in this way.

429
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:30,832
This fire might burn us too.

430
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:37,062
Who dares to come forward and tell how much money they have earned through improper means?

431
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:39,332
As long as we don't speak

432
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:41,502
There won't be any problems

433
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:43,832
But... those people

434
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:46,082
Be it threats or appeasement

435
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:48,782
I will keep their mouths shut.

436
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:52,422
Um

437
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:06,112
What is the bath water of the Queen?

438
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,532
This is it

439
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:21,102
Are you all ready?

440
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:23,032
Yes, all is ready.

441
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:24,282
Jin Shanggong

442
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:27,082
Why is Jin Shanggong here?

443
00:29:27,082 --> 00:29:29,382
That Jin...Jin...Jin Shang Gong

444
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:31,672
Ouch

445
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:36,332
Oh, it's all right.

446
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,872
This is the Chou and Yin hours.

447
00:29:41,872 --> 00:29:44,912
Fresh water from the half-mile-deep Han River

448
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:47,962
and the clear water of the Suiseongdong Valley at Mt. Nion

449
00:29:47,962 --> 00:29:50,682
So the water is still a little cold

450
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:53,942
Xu Shanggong will bring hot water soon.

451
00:29:57,822 --> 00:29:59,092
Heating water

452
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:07,812
No need

453
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:13,202
How should the central hall bathe and fast?

454
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,272
Empress of the Middle Temple

455
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:04,652
lady

456
00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:10,102
What is it?

457
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:12,812
lady

458
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:16,852
Pouring wine to offer to the Silkworm God

459
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:21,462
Gong Sang walked up to the podium and picked five mulberry leaves

460
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:25,642
The crown prince and the court officials presented articles of congratulations

461
00:31:26,872 --> 00:31:31,892
His Majesty the Lord and His Majesty the Queen of the Central Palace receive the congratulatory greetings from the ladies of the inner court.

462
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:36,002
I have prepared everything according to your Majesty's instructions.

463
00:31:41,472 --> 00:31:44,032
No need to prepare for the celebration

464
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,502
Let's do it together with the audience

465
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,152
It's the queen

466
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:55,642
Madam, you are here

467
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:57,362
The lady is really beautiful

468
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:02,162
Madam, thank you for coming all the way here. Please come in.

469
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:14,782
Mrs. Hard Work has come from afar

470
00:32:15,822 --> 00:32:18,192
I'll take my wife to the backyard.

471
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:56,582
Please follow the servant.

472
00:32:56,582 --> 00:32:57,672
yes

473
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:05,832
Mrs. Hard Work has come from afar

474
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:07,782
Thank you for your hard work.

475
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:09,802
Please.

476
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:20,102
Go inside

477
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:31,642
Come here soon

478
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:41,742
Ouch! Ouch!

479
00:33:41,742 --> 00:33:43,612
Be careful

480
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:59,332
This is the Queen Mother

481
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:00,882
What happened

482
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:05,242
Um, what's wrong?

483
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:06,792
The urgency of what you said, sir

484
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:12,182
Lijiang Jun seems to have fallen into the trap of Yegu Jin

485
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:14,262
What

486
00:34:53,651 --> 00:34:56,512
Has there been such an event in the past?

487
00:34:56,512 --> 00:35:00,282
I heard that this is the first time that the Central Temple has hosted this event.

488
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:22,022
Empress of the Middle Temple

489
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:23,802
You've fallen into a trap.

490
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,082
What

491
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:33,712
His Majesty and His Majesty the Queen are always considerate of the people

492
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:37,502
Seeing the people starving is heartbreaking.

493
00:36:37,502 --> 00:36:41,422
To save the poor and destitute people

494
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:44,582
The Supreme King established the country and maintained peace

495
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:52,192
The Lord and the Queen are worried about inheriting the King's will.

496
00:36:52,192 --> 00:36:57,412
The Queen Mother of the Central Palace set an example for the people by holding the silkworm ceremony

497
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:00,092
Honesty is the blessing of the people

498
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:08,412
The Queen Mother encouraged silkworm rearing and cared for the people's livelihood.

499
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:28,332
The other party set up a secret trap and Lijiang Jun naturally fell into it

500
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:31,382
Even the Queen Mother was included in the design

501
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:36,432
I am the Mingshan Doctor, a relative of His Majesty.

502
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:37,642
[The third-rank rank bestowed upon the clan members by Doctor Mingshan]

503
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:39,452
The person behind the Yegu Jin family

504
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:44,432
It was the half brother of His Majesty the Grand Prince, Doctor Mingshan.

505
00:37:47,402 --> 00:37:48,792
in this way

506
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,452
I'm afraid the master is also difficult.

507
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:56,272
For ordinary people, housing is more important than raising silkworms.

508
00:37:56,272 --> 00:37:59,252
That's the house where the old and young will live.

509
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:03,932
But a group of powerful officials robbed people's houses

510
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:06,812
Enriching oneself

511
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:08,412
I have come to report to Your Highness.

512
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:13,112
I don't know who the powerful minister you are talking about is.

513
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:51,552
I heard that as long as you temporarily buy a house that is sold at a low price and then sell it

514
00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:56,822
You can earn ten times the profit

515
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:58,922
Blinded by greed...

516
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:02,232
Others will forget it.

517
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:04,562
I just lost my mind for a moment.

518
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,562
Your Highness

519
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:15,702
I sincerely wish to present these houses to Your Highness.

520
00:39:15,702 --> 00:39:17,272
Please accept these houses.

521
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:22,642
Distribute the houses fairly to officials of all ranks

522
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:29,192
Is that all?

523
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:33,492
According to the report I received from the work

524
00:39:33,492 --> 00:39:35,462
But there are others

525
00:39:36,892 --> 00:39:42,742
I also have two three-room tiled houses and two four-room tiled houses in Zhongcun.

526
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:45,892
I am willing to donate these properties to show my loyalty.

527
00:39:45,892 --> 00:39:49,002
Continue Lijiangjun's good aspirations

528
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:54,882
I am also willing to offer you a tiled house, Your Highness.

529
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:58,952
I will be loyal to your Highness.

530
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:01,932
I am willing to offer three tiled houses to Your Highness.

531
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:06,462
Your Highness, I will be loyal to you.

532
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:15,052
I will also hand over all the houses I have.

533
00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:19,532
Your Highness is worried about the people, hoping to help Your Highness share his worries

534
00:40:22,912 --> 00:40:25,472
Where is Doctor Mingshan?

535
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:29,392
that…

536
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:33,542
If the clan elders are willing to come forward

537
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:36,862
Your Highness must be very pleased

538
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:41,042
This

539
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:42,752
This minister also...

540
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:46,332
I... naturally...

541
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:49,632
Your Highness

542
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:55,262
I have two two-room tiled houses in Zhongcun.

543
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:59,792
and five three-room cottages

544
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,322
All are at your disposal.

545
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:39,612
Your Highness

546
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:41,152
Now it's time to issue an order to the Ministry of Justice.

547
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:43,502
[The Criminal Law Department is an administrative agency that oversees judicial and criminal justice]

548
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:42,992
Nightvale Jin Clan…

549
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:47,882
Your Highness

550
00:41:55,322 --> 00:41:57,092
Thanks for your hard work

551
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:10,722
Doctor Mingshan's matter

552
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:13,202
The slave naturally feels happy

553
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:17,072
But if he were in the palace, he would be my husband's uncle after all.

554
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:20,522
When he was in Kaijing that day, he enjoyed these evil practices

555
00:42:20,522 --> 00:42:22,952
Come to Hanyang and enjoy

556
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:24,882
Still want to continue to enjoy

557
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,362
Where is the prince?

558
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:31,292
Already went to the East Palace

559
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:32,912
He worked hard today.

560
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:35,132
It's time to praise him.

561
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:36,722
Let's go

562
00:42:41,082 --> 00:42:42,722
Know about

563
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:45,892
It's your highness

564
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:50,352
Now go inform the judge to arrest Yegu Jin immediately

565
00:42:50,352 --> 00:42:52,232
It's your highness

566
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:21,182
What do you think?

567
00:43:23,652 --> 00:43:25,302
I mean the middle palace.

568
00:43:29,832 --> 00:43:31,892
The central hall shows the king's demeanor

569
00:43:35,332 --> 00:43:37,662
Therefore, Your Highness must be on guard.

570
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:41,752
If the Min family uses these good stories to establish the prestige of the Queen and the Crown Prince

571
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,032
Can Your Highness bear it?

572
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:47,982
If His Highness fights against the Crown Prince

573
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:50,392
The Queen should be on the side of the Crown Prince.

574
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:54,722
It is because he knew this that His Highness rescinded his previous order to pass on the throne.

575
00:43:56,382 --> 00:43:58,692
I am really presumptuous.

576
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:00,222
Deserve to die

577
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,032
No

578
00:44:02,032 --> 00:44:03,942
My dear, you are right.

579
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:07,592
Your Highness

580
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:10,442
Now is the time to suppress this momentum.

581
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:13,742
Ancheng Jun Li Shufan

582
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:16,662
Your Highness must use some means to deal with these people

583
00:44:18,012 --> 00:44:21,502
Looks like I have to hurry up and prepare for the prince's wedding.

584
00:44:27,662 --> 00:44:28,912
Is this it?

585
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,542
right

586
00:44:31,342 --> 00:44:35,042
The bow of the Black Horn Bow must be made of Huasang wood and bamboo.

587
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:35,072
[Black Horn Bow is a precious bow made of black ox horn]

588
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,622
But this bow is made only of bamboo.

589
00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:43,012
What's more, the horns on both sides are not buffalo horns.

590
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:45,332
Go find it again

591
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:46,722
At the residence of the Crown Prince Zunzhi

592
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:49,972
Aren't buffalo horns military supplies that had to be shipped back from the Ming Dynasty?

593
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:51,162
Queen Mother

594
00:44:51,162 --> 00:44:53,062
This bow is only for hunting.

595
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:57,972
Is it necessary to use the Black Horn Bow?

596
00:44:57,972 --> 00:45:00,192
After all, I am the crown prince of the dynasty.

597
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:03,712
Because you are the prince of the dynasty

598
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:05,422
Be extra careful

599
00:45:05,422 --> 00:45:09,642
My mother asked you why you had to have a bow made from military supplies.

600
00:45:11,852 --> 00:45:12,832
Jin Naiguan

601
00:45:12,832 --> 00:45:13,382
yes

602
00:45:13,382 --> 00:45:17,192
The prince should have more than one bow.

603
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:19,202
You go get them all

604
00:45:19,202 --> 00:45:19,862
Empress of the Middle Temple

605
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:21,102
quick

606
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:22,712
yes

607
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:29,012
Where did these bows come from?

608
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:33,182
I am still studying hard.

609
00:45:33,182 --> 00:45:35,682
What's the point of reading?

610
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:38,142
You have this attitude now

611
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:40,352
So

612
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:43,782
From now on, I will only hunt once every three months.

613
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,942
Based on the bottom line of not disturbing the people

614
00:45:53,932 --> 00:45:55,302
Once every six months

615
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:58,092
Since you said so

616
00:45:58,092 --> 00:46:01,282
The mother will believe you

617
00:46:02,962 --> 00:46:04,872
It's the Queen Mother

618
00:46:05,342 --> 00:46:06,592
Xu Shanggong

619
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:08,012
yes

620
00:46:14,962 --> 00:46:16,222
This is the time for the silkworm ceremony.

621
00:46:16,222 --> 00:46:19,332
Your reward for displaying the prince's dignified manner

622
00:46:19,332 --> 00:46:22,182
Map of the Capitals of Successive Dynasties in the Unified Territory

623
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:26,482
[Map of the Capitals of Successive Dynasties in the Unified Territory (Map of Territory)]
Made during the reign of Emperor Taizong, this is the oldest world map in the East.]

624
00:46:22,662 --> 00:46:26,902
This is a world map that clearly depicts the capitals of many countries.

625
00:46:32,262 --> 00:46:37,652
When His Majesty first ascended the throne, he drew this map of the territory.

626
00:46:37,652 --> 00:46:44,402
Prince, you should also keep in mind your father's ambition to draw this map.

627
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,542
It's the Queen Mother

628
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:05,932
In addition, I must appoint Licheng Lord Min Wuji as the Grand Censor.

629
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:08,202
[The head of the Censorate who is responsible for monitoring and reporting]

630
00:47:06,622 --> 00:47:08,182
If Min Wuji became the Chief Justice

631
00:47:08,182 --> 00:47:10,982
They will definitely attack Doctor Mingshan who is at the core of the clan.

632
00:47:10,982 --> 00:47:12,812
I did this to let him attack.

633
00:47:12,812 --> 00:47:14,572
Doctor Mingshan is your Highness's ally.

634
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:15,742
It's true that they are friendly forces

635
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:19,052
But also corrupt

636
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:31,042
Today, the Queen Mother at the Silkworm Ceremony

637
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:34,732
If Queen Seondeok were reborn, would she look like this?

638
00:47:35,592 --> 00:47:40,482
I think it was the Queen who became the ruler of Joseon.

639
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,942
It will definitely do well.

640
00:47:43,672 --> 00:47:46,292
I can't help but have this thought

641
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:52,222
In this country, women cannot be kings

642
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:55,092
What do you mean?

643
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:13,272
Everyone said that the Queen Mother looked like a king.

644
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:20,592
But the king of a country

645
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:23,182
There is only one His Majesty

646
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:39,762
You said the central hall is full of kingly demeanor

647
00:48:43,602 --> 00:48:49,202
Just this one sentence can cost you your life.

648
00:49:03,772 --> 00:49:07,052
I want to change the inner chamber guards into inner guards

649
00:49:05,382 --> 00:49:08,482
[The Inner Guards guard the troops in the palace]

650
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:10,162
In addition, I will incorporate the inner guards into the central army of the Three Military Offices.

651
00:49:10,162 --> 00:49:12,772
In the future, it will be managed by three controllers.

652
00:49:12,772 --> 00:49:14,862
Strengthen military power

653
00:49:14,862 --> 00:49:17,182
The reason why the inner guard exists

654
00:49:17,182 --> 00:49:19,402
It is the guard of the palace.

655
00:49:19,402 --> 00:49:21,912
It's your highness

656
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:24,232
besides

657
00:49:24,232 --> 00:49:26,702
I will facilitate the prince's wedding

658
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:29,262
If there is a family willing to participate in the national wedding

659
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:31,572
Then he accepted the list of candidates for the ladies

660
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:33,292
[The document with the birth date written on it]

661
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:34,512
Knowing the matter, setting up auspicious ceremonies

662
00:49:33,782 --> 00:49:38,242
[Galise is a temporary institution established for royal marriages]

663
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:36,802
Responsible for assisting the Empress

664
00:49:36,802 --> 00:49:39,092
It's your highness

665
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:44,772
In addition, Min Wuji, the Lord of Licheng, was granted

666
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:48,062
For the Grand Judge

667
00:49:46,772 --> 00:49:49,852
[Except for officials appointed by the King himself]

668
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:57,282
Holy Grace

669
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:11,532
In addition, I must appoint Licheng Lord Min Wuji as the Grand Censor.

670
00:50:12,262 --> 00:50:13,882
If Min Wuji became the Chief Justice

671
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:16,622
They will definitely attack Doctor Mingshan who is at the core of the clan.

672
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:18,442
I did this to let him attack.

673
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:20,192
Doctor Mingshan is your Highness's ally.

674
00:50:20,192 --> 00:50:21,372
It's true that they are friendly forces

675
00:50:21,372 --> 00:50:24,572
But also corrupt

676
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:31,052
You have to use the knife eight points to cut off about five points.

677
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:33,072
If you cut off five points at the beginning

678
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:37,212
Even if they only scored two or three points, they would stop.

679
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:41,912
This will not impress the people at all.

680
00:50:41,912 --> 00:50:43,292
Your Highness means

681
00:50:44,872 --> 00:50:47,212
I will find a suitable time.

682
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:49,742
Pardon Mingshan

683
00:50:50,212 --> 00:50:51,342
in this way

684
00:50:52,222 --> 00:50:54,792
They will from then on

685
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:57,412
Attack the Min Family

686
00:51:10,602 --> 00:51:12,462
The first task of the Grand Judge

687
00:51:12,462 --> 00:51:14,592
That is to investigate those who are colluding with the Jin family of Yegu

688
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:19,562
The powerful officials who seized houses and land

689
00:51:19,562 --> 00:51:20,222
yes

690
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:23,372
Their men were lying in ambush everywhere in the court.

691
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:26,142
Don't give them too much space.

692
00:51:26,142 --> 00:51:28,592
This must be done in secret

693
00:51:28,592 --> 00:51:31,862
I will strictly implement it without leaving any room for error.

694
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:16,252
I have invited Doctor Mingshan

695
00:52:16,252 --> 00:52:19,622
He sent me a letter asking me to meet him.

696
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:20,942
Sit down

697
00:52:26,902 --> 00:52:30,072
Someone will be here soon.

698
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:38,502
The right army commander is His Highness's intention

699
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:41,442
But the person sitting in that seat is an adult.

700
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:45,112
Is the name of the seat really important?

701
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:49,532
The name of the position represents the size of the power

702
00:52:54,892 --> 00:52:56,302
The adults are here

703
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:57,772
The adults are here

704
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:05,102
This old man is really embarrassed

705
00:53:07,512 --> 00:53:12,452
What did the Central Palace say about Doctor Mingshan?

706
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:15,582
But he was severely tricked by the middle temple

707
00:53:15,582 --> 00:53:20,602
Why did the Lord allow a mere woman to be so rampant?

708
00:53:20,602 --> 00:53:23,082
Sir, this is a bit too much.

709
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,612
How did it pass?

710
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:27,582
Honestly, who did we put on the throne?

711
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:29,672
Is it the Lord or the Middle Temple?

712
00:53:30,452 --> 00:53:33,052
His Highness has appointed Lord Licheng as the Grand Censor

713
00:53:33,052 --> 00:53:34,812
So

714
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:49,132
So I want my daughter to become the Crown Prince's concubine.

715
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,922
Please help me, sir.

716
00:53:54,922 --> 00:53:58,272
Only with the strong support of the clan members can this be accomplished.

717
00:53:58,272 --> 00:54:01,802
You want your daughter to be the crown prince's concubine

718
00:54:01,802 --> 00:54:04,002
So we need the clan members to recommend

719
00:54:04,002 --> 00:54:05,342
yes

720
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,442
Why

721
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:10,432
Who is the prince?

722
00:54:10,432 --> 00:54:13,372
He grew up in the Min family.

723
00:54:13,372 --> 00:54:16,782
So if the Crown Prince's concubine is not one of us

724
00:54:16,782 --> 00:54:19,342
The situation will definitely be controlled by them again

725
00:54:20,452 --> 00:54:27,152
But His Highness has ordered the Ministry of Rites to publicly collect the selection list.

726
00:54:27,152 --> 00:54:29,812
Don't worry about this, sir.

727
00:54:33,642 --> 00:54:35,132
This humble official is Li Shufan

728
00:54:35,132 --> 00:54:37,272
Madam Madam

729
00:54:39,232 --> 00:54:41,202
Everybody gather here.

730
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,372
Please save my life.

731
00:54:58,492 --> 00:54:59,802
Who are you?

732
00:55:01,892 --> 00:55:03,712
This seems to be the first time I see you

733
00:55:03,712 --> 00:55:05,452
If it weren't for my help, your wealth wouldn't have doubled.

734
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:07,602
Now I pretend I don't know

735
00:55:08,432 --> 00:55:09,792
Do you have evidence?

736
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:11,522
I'm afraid not.

737
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:13,352
grown ups

738
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:18,052
The piece of land that you said you would sell to me last time

739
00:55:18,052 --> 00:55:22,282
Fortunately, it has not been transferred to my name yet.

740
00:55:22,282 --> 00:55:24,162
Just pretend it never happened

741
00:55:28,682 --> 00:55:31,122
Someone come

742
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:34,402
Someone come

743
00:55:34,402 --> 00:55:37,092
The sinner came here

744
00:55:38,712 --> 00:55:42,002
My Lord, do you think that I can stop this matter by myself?

745
00:55:42,002 --> 00:55:43,202
Someone come

746
00:55:43,202 --> 00:55:45,482
I will never die on my own

747
00:55:45,482 --> 00:55:47,762
If you still think about the future

748
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:52,222
Just worry about how to die a good death today.

749
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:57,922
Come on, what are you still standing there for?

750
00:55:57,922 --> 00:55:59,632
Take the person away quickly.

751
00:55:59,632 --> 00:56:01,452
I will never die alone

752
00:56:01,452 --> 00:56:02,192
Get out of the way

753
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,392
I will never die alone

754
00:56:07,202 --> 00:56:08,742
Sorry to bother you, gentlemen.

755
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:11,022
Ouch, what's going on?

756
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:13,192
Ouch, little fear

757
00:56:13,192 --> 00:56:14,132
Are you okay, sir?

758
00:56:14,132 --> 00:56:15,022
Ouch, little fear

759
00:56:15,022 --> 00:56:16,332
Okay, okay.

760
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:17,792
Let's go

761
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,082
Really

762
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:26,822
This is the first time since the founding of the country that a crown prince's concubine has been chosen.

763
00:56:26,822 --> 00:56:29,752
What we are going to do next will become a model

764
00:56:29,752 --> 00:56:32,532
And this example will become history

765
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:36,762
Be fearful when preparing

766
00:56:59,302 --> 00:57:01,352
Are these the only people?

767
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:02,492
yes

768
00:57:04,312 --> 00:57:09,142
There were only three people, including the daughter of Ancheng Jun Yi Shufan.

769
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:12,702
What's more, the other two are just foils.

770
00:57:15,822 --> 00:57:17,472
Re-collect the bill

771
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,012
Empress of the Middle Temple

772
00:57:20,012 --> 00:57:24,112
I heard that the clan members are also recommending Anjo-kun.

773
00:57:24,112 --> 00:57:26,722
This palace does not allow

774
00:57:28,502 --> 00:57:31,772
But... if the person is recommended by the clan

775
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:32,502
Your Majesty...

776
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:34,362
Go back to the expedition

777
00:57:34,362 --> 00:57:37,822
I will not choose the Crown Prince's concubine based on this.

778
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,152
[Daughter of Li Shufan of the Ancheng Li family]

779
00:57:53,172 --> 00:57:54,692
[Daughter of Jin Hanlao, the Jin family of Gwangsan]

780
00:58:00,952 --> 00:58:04,582
This palace intends to hold a weaving competition

781
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:10,232
The one who wins this competition will become the Crown Prince's concubine.

782
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:13,232
["Yuan Jing"]

783
00:58:45,352 --> 00:58:49,732
[Preview of the next episode]

784
00:58:49,732 --> 00:58:52,732
The Crown Prince's concubine has been decided

785
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:55,542
My intention is to strengthen the kingship.

786
00:58:55,542 --> 00:59:00,132
My feelings towards you have never changed.

787
00:59:00,132 --> 00:59:02,452
As long as we win, it's fine

788
00:59:02,452 --> 00:59:06,022
You're the one who caused this, right?

789
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:07,812
Now I am North Korea

790
00:59:07,812 --> 00:59:08,792
Your Highness is despicable.

791
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,202
Enough

792
00:59:10,202 --> 00:59:12,712
Spare their lives

793
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:16,562
How can Your Highness treat me like this?
