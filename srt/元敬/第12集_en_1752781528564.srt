I intend to make this suggestion

Suhe oil is a medicinal material used by His Majesty.

94
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,780
Is it like this when you get the herbs?

95
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,590
Or maybe it was due to improper storage.

96

It is said that he is the elder brother of the Grand Palace's most powerful concubine Jin Shanggong.

I think God

111
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,940
This is to prevent His Highness and I from parting ways.

112
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,160
This child was sent here

113
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,290
I always thought he was a gift from God.

114
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm afraid

115
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,950
Afraid of losing this child

116
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,890

Let's all go and say goodbye to Lord Chengning.

123

But where is the prince?

124
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,350
When my brother was dying

125
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,130
You're hunting

126
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,090
Your brother is dying.

127
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,420
Are you still a human being?

128
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:55,130
Are you still a human being like this?

129
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:09,810
The Lord was not able to see Cheng Ning's burial

My Lord is the King

131

Don't touch the coffin.

132
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,530
I also failed to see Cheng Ning buried

133
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,930
But you did all these things

You did a great job

137
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,850
The Crown Prince's family was drinking and having fun outside the palace

138
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,760
Showing the people in an indecent manner

139
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,600
During the last hunt, the Crown Prince injured the people's cows and pigs.

140
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,400
Disaster to the people

141
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,890
The prince believed the slander of the treacherous ministers

142
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,420
Lust for women and committing many unjust acts

143
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,760

But no one spoke up for the prince.

Do you want to open the window?

156
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,060
It's sunny outside

157
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,650
Madam Queen, I'm going to open the window.

158
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,430
It's true

159
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,310
Green is a color but also has a fragrance

160
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:32,780
The Lord intends to depose you, the Crown Prince

161
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,890
When the imperial edict arrives, you must not panic

162
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,720
Until the end, you must maintain the dignity of the prince.

163
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,730
yes

164
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,840
You've become a waste.

165
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,300
You are the eldest son in the family, and that will not change.

166
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,390
There is something I must say.

167
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,550
Chungnyeong...looks a lot like his father

168
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,550
Chungnyeong

169
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,500
Chungnyeong obviously wants to do something for the people.

170
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,930
He has ambition and perseverance.

171
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,820
What's the difference between me and my father?

172
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,000
That is, the father does not have a mother like the queen mother.

173

The Crown Prince

174
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,770
I will get along well with my brothers.

Thank you

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,440

Unable to inherit the throne, all ministers and officials please

180
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,490
Now I abolish the title of Crown Prince Li

181
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,490
Degraded to let Ning Dajun serve him

182
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,790
The deposed prince made Ning have two sons

183
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,700
The eldest son is six years old and the second son is three years old

184
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,410
I will pass the throne to the eldest son of Prince Rangnying.

185
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,890
As for whether you should call him the Prince of Wang or the Grandson of Wang Taisun.

186
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,620
Please think carefully before reporting.

187
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,370
yes

188
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,400
The reason why I took so much trouble to invite all the censors to come here

189
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,970
This is to establish the heir apparent.

190
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,380
The master is considering the eldest son of the deposed prince Rang Ning.

191
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,360
But I have objections.

192
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,380
But the empress of the middle palace

193
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,690
Who can change His Highness's mind?

194
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,860
If you want to change the master's mind, you have to risk your life.

195
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,630
Once you make your decision, Your Highness will only focus on the road ahead.

196
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,390
I don't listen to what others say.

197
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,020
I will find a way to make His Highness listen.

198
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,990
Please advise on the most suitable candidate for the crown prince.

199
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,770
Put your faith in admonishing others and make remonstrances

200
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,270
Forget about others, why does the princess treat me like this?

201
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,420
I want to present it to the master. The Suhe oil has gone bad.

202
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,110
Your brother was responsible for bringing this item into the palace.

203
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,210
I don't know

204
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,020
It must have gone bad after it was handed over to the palace.

205
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,680
So we need to understand clearly

206
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,010
Was it before or after entering the palace?

207
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,850
I am just curious why the princess has to be the one to handle this matter.

208
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,390
Because I will never let you off easily.

209
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:09,980
What

210
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,590
In the early morning of the day of the silkworm ceremony

211
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,870
[The Silkworm Ceremony is a ceremony where the princess personally picks mulberry leaves and feeds the silkworms
A ceremony to pray for a good harvest (the only ceremony led by the Queen)]
In the early morning of the day of the silkworm ceremony

212
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,180
You added Xanthium sibiricum to the bath water of the Queen Mother.
[The Silkworm Ceremony is a ceremony where the princess personally picks mulberry leaves and feeds the silkworms
A ceremony to pray for a good harvest (the only ceremony led by the Queen)]

213
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,390
You added Xanthium sibiricum to the bath water of the Queen Mother.

214
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,090
If inhaled continuously, it may damage the liver and cause death.

215
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,280
Did the princess see it with her own eyes?

216
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,490
It's just conjecture.

217
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,000
There is no evidence

218
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,910
At that time, the palace

219
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,720
I thought you were my man, so I didn't leave any evidence.

220
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,410
I regretted it.

221
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,790
I also blamed myself

222
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,420
Since when did the princess become so determined to become the queen's person?

223
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,850
Since when?

224
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,650
If you climb from the bottom to the top

225
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,540
It's hard to look back down naturally

226
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,320
After all, my horizons have been raised.

227
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,120
But you know that if you go down from the peak

228
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,240
What will you see first?

229
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,570
I can see your thoughts clearly from the low place.

230
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,440
So now the princess is planning to join the Empress?

231
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,470
As long as you are willing to take me in

232
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,030
No matter who it is, I will be loyal to you.

233
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,700
Forget about others, how can you not know

234
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,440
Madam Princess, the servant is coming in

235
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,890
Take people away

236
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,970
Letting go

237
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,300
Let me go

238
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,140
When the crown prince comes to the throne, he will definitely reuse Anseongfuwon Lord again.

239
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,780
If you consider the future, you should not treat me like this.

240
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,040
Unfortunately, your hopes may be dashed.

241
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,600
Have a nice trip

242
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,010
Take her away

243
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,360
open

244
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,140
Princess Princess

245
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,350
Let me go

246
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,450
Princess

247
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,010
Waiting for the prince to confirm

248
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,370
I want to become the prince's teacher.

249
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,500
[The Crown Prince's Teacher is an official position responsible for educating the Crown Prince]
I want to become the prince's teacher.

250
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,160
You want to be the prince's teacher?
[The Crown Prince's Teacher is an official position responsible for educating the Crown Prince]

251
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,500
You want to be the prince's teacher?

252
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,630
yes

253
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,900
Why

254
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,520
First

255
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,340
Different from other ministers

256
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,350
The prince's teacher should not be used as a stepping stone to power

257
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,460
second

258
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,560
I want to teach you what kind of person should be a king.

259
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,900
So what kind of person should become a king?

260
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,170
Emperor Yao once said

261
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,520
God appoints a king

262
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,720
I don't love the monarch alone.

263
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,320
But for millions of people

264
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,910
This is what His Majesty the King once said.

265
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,790
A King with a Heart for His People

266
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,510
I will not be selfish

267
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,660
Pass on the wisdom he has learned to the new prince completely

268
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,200
Selfishness

269
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,260
Are you really selfless?

270
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,390
In the eyes of the Queen Mother, you are selfish.

271
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,380
Queen Mother

272
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,120
Once you have power

273
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,700
You will want to use this power to act. You have this desire.

274
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,070
No, I'm just...

275
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,230
Even if I can't become the king of a country

276
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,970
Even if I become the Prince's Master

277
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,300
You also want to use this to quench your desire.

278
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,570
This is your selfishness

279
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:46,790
I know exactly what my father is worried about.

280
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,150
The reason why I no longer have greed is because of this.

281
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,070
Your Highness looks very thoughtful.

282
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,310
Chungnyeong is a suitable candidate for the crown prince

283
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,600
The censors submitted memorials one after another, all with the same opinion

284
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,790
It must have been arranged by the Central Palace.

285
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,390
What is your highness's plan?

286
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,080
There is plenty of time to teach Ning Changzi the ways of a king.

287
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,050
This servant dares to report to His Majesty

288
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,070
The Empress sent a message to ask His Highness

289
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,790
It's late at night

290
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,920
Please go, Your Highness.

291
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,610
The Queen Mother would invite His Highness so late at night for something special.

292
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,190
His Majesty has arrived

293
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,720
Why is the abandoned prince, who should be outside the palace, here at this time?

294
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,580
It was I who secretly summoned him into the palace.

295
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,170
Last time

296
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,330
You once told my mother that Chungnyeong looks like His Highness.

297
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,980
yes

298
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,770
You also said that you would never be greedy for power in this life

299
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,280
But I will get along with my brothers

300
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,040
yes

301
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,690
Are you willing to swear in front of His Majesty?

302
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,690
Yes, mother

303
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,150
The abandoned prince made Ning

304
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,850
To help his father

305
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,690
Daring to enter the palace

306
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,650
Sharing worries

307
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,870
Although I am already the deposed prince

308
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:42,900
But I will never blame my father.

309
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,340
If someone covets power and deliberately approaches the son

310
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,410
I will definitely chop him off.

311
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,980
If one of the younger brothers ascends the throne

312
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,820
I will definitely become his loyal minister.

313
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,070
Among the younger brothers

314
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,430
But the middle temple asked you to say so

315
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,860
There will be no more quarrels between brothers

316
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,020
Rang Ning has sworn an oath

317
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,750
nave

318
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,220
Earlier Year of Wuyin

319
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,020
[The year of Wuyin, the year when the first Prince Rebellion broke out]
Earlier Year of Wuyin

320
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,690
Crown Prince Lee Bang-seok and Prince An-gun Lee Bang-bum
[The year of Wuyin, the year when the first Prince Rebellion broke out]

321
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,480
Crown Prince Lee Bang-seok and Prince An-gun Lee Bang-bum

322
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,460
The two younger brothers ascended the throne

323
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,010
It's not your highness's fault.

324
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,410
Why did the middle temple suddenly mention these?

325
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,140
That is God's will.

326
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,990
God appoints a king

327
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,110
I don't love the monarch alone.

328
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,460
But for millions of people

329
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:46,750
This is what the Supreme King said.

330
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,580
[The father of the Grand King Taejo Lee Seong-gye and the King Taejong Lee Bang-won]
This is what the Supreme King said.

331
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,760
[The father of the Grand King Taejo Lee Seong-gye and the King Taejong Lee Bang-won]

332
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,760
That's destiny

333
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:04,370
Please see clearly who holds the fate now.

334
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,250
I will take my leave first.

335
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,720
Queen Mother

336
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:17,450
The stars are especially bright tonight

337
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,180
There is a star over there

338
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,870
Shining blue light

339
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,200
I intend to give the

340
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,020
He personally copied the "University Commentary" for a long time and gave it to Zhongning

341
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,600
Although such a heavy seat

342
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,360
But you said you'd take it.

343
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,880
Then you have to make a decision.

344
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,560
If you have made up your mind, please make your will known to the Lord.

345
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:13,130
Mencius in answer to the question of King Xuan of Qi

346
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,780
I have mentioned that the people are more important than the king.

347
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,850
What will happen if the king cannot be benevolent?

348
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,130
I report this with fear

349
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:30,280
The people may rebel with hammers and the king must be vigilant at all times

350
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,060
I think this is the lesson.

351
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,700
Chungnyeong

352
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,880
The reason why my father raised his sword in the year of Wuyin

353
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,620
It is also the hammer pointing at the unqualified prince.

354
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,320
This is what I think

355
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,620
Chungnyeong

356
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,000
My son is here

357
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,970
Do you want to be the king?

358

have

359
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,760
What kind of king do you want to be?

360
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,110
I want to give the people the best treatment in the world.

361
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,930
Become a king that is feared by the people

362
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,970
From now on

363
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,720
My father is about to get off the tiger he is riding.

364
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,170
Chungnyeong took the copy of the "University" written by Jungjeon himself.

What kind of king will give his people the best treatment in the world?

369
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:56,010
What kind of king would be afraid of his people?

370
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,020
You should study it thoroughly.

371
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,140
It's the father

372
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,240
[Taizong Yi Bangwon, the third king of Joseon, reigned from 1400 to 1418]

[Taizong Yi Bangwon, the third king of Joseon, reigned from 1400 to 1418]

376
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,190
There was a lot of rain this year and the rice did not mature

377
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,300
The people are suffering from this

378
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,980
The inspectors of various places must investigate all the losses suffered by the people without missing any.

379
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,350
It's your highness

380
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,430
Before I ascended the throne, I had organized some measures to help the people.

381
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,140
You can refer to this.

382
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,120
It's your highness

383
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,280
Soldiers obey orders

384
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,160
We in Korea lack copper and sulfur for producing weapons.

385
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,060
It can be used as a reference for the weapons used by the Ming Dynasty

386
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,550
The most important thing is to study the production of copper

387
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,960
It's your highness

388
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,540
in addition

He is the younger brother of the concubine

394
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:02,230
After they were convicted, their families also became criminals.

395
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,400
I hope the Lord will have mercy on me.

Criminal sentencing check related bills later reported

399
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,700
But Your Highness

400
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,240
These people are all guilty of infidelity.

401
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,850
We cannot forgive you easily just because Your Highness has ascended the throne.

402
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,100
This is what the king ordered.

403
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,340

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,860
So I dare not disobey

[1420, the second year of King Sejong’s reign]

408
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,960
Let's go to Kaijing together

409
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,970
Why did His Highness suddenly mention going to Kaifeng?

410
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,680
I miss you very much

411
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,570
We were always young in Kaijing

412
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,790
Your Highness, are you reminiscing about your youth?

413
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,550
Miss you

414
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:34,910
If I were young again, would I want to become king again?

415
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,450
What would have happened if I had not become king?

416
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,080
The Queen Mother fell in love with me because I said I wanted to become the king, right?

417
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,400
Thank you for fulfilling your duty as king.

418
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,370
Because of the Queen Mother, I was able to come this far.

419
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,030
If a woman could be king

420
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,310
The Queen will surely become a more outstanding king than me.

421
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:19,130

[Shouchang Palace is a Goryeo palace located in Kaesong]

424
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,330
When His Highness sat on the throne for the first time

425
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,580
I once asked my concubine

426
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,970
Do you want to sit on this dragon throne?

427
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,430
At that time, I was unable to answer

428
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:42,310
I was unable to answer and was lost in thought.

429
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:46,770
Thinking about whether I really want to sit on the throne

430
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,320
It is the concubine who wants to sit

431
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,750
But I gradually understood

432
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,850
Is it really power that I covet?

433
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:07,640
What I covet is not power but this world

434
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:20,180
Because I love this world, I don't care who sits on this throne.

435
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:37,270
We will set out for Kaijing tomorrow morning.

436
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,480
Rest early today.

437

00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,440
Concubine

439
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,010
The maid came in

440
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,090
Concubine

441
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,950
Concubine

442
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,380
It's malaria

[Malaria is an infectious disease with a high mortality rate]

446
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,030
No need to make a fuss

447
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,050
What should I do?

448
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,110
Therefore, the disease will fluctuate between hot and cold

449
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:02,720
Therefore, we need to consider whether to use warm medicine or cold medicine according to the condition.

450
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,180
I intend to go to Kaesong with His Majesty the King

451
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,940
No

452
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,550
Queen, maybe it's okay now, but you must not underestimate this disease just because the symptoms disappear.

453
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,970
In this case, does this mean that I need to go to a hospital for treatment?

In this case, does this mean that I need to go to a hospital for treatment?

I don't want to go

456
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:20,880
I don't want to go

in this way

458
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,070
How about being careful on the way there?

459
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,360
This is what I wrote in the year of Bingyin at the Hiyan Temple.

460
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,810
Year of the Tiger

461
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,630
Could it be that I killed Pan Zhu?

462
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:53,810
The time when the Queen left the palace

463
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:04,920
I think if it weren't for now

464
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,820
I'm afraid there will be no chance for His Highness.

465
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,550
If you and I had not become king and queen

466
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,840
What will be the outcome?

467
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:51,500
Why did I think saving the world was the only meaningful life when I was young?

468
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,340
Even if I live a life of an ordinary person

469
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,630
As long as you are by my side

470
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:07,170
I'm happy enough in this life.

471
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,560
This is what I understand here.

concubine

473
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,110
Even if you feel cold all over, you have to bear it.

474
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,380
The heat must be dissipated

475
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,980
Let the widow come

476
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,660
Your Highness, please go back.

477
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,440
Kaijing...

478
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:05,510
Next time...next time

479
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,220
Tomorrow I will go to the minister's house to avoid illness.

480
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,980
If you insist... I understand the danger of this disease.

481
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,980
Could it be that I am the only one...

482
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,970
To hurt you like this

483
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:13,940
No

484

Birth, aging, illness and death are God's will

485
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,700
Please don't cry secretly.

486
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:31,450
Even the sadness behind the scenes can be felt.

487
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,780
now

488
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,510
I can be sober

489

Feel His Majesty's hands

490
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,730
That's enough

491
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,850
Who is good at treating the Queen Mother's malaria?

492
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,090
I will send out Yima to look for doctors everywhere.

Mother, please eat a little bit and don't leave any

501
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:17,490
The mother felt as if she had strength again.

502
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,630
Now, in the name of avoiding malaria

503
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,890
First, we went to the residence of General Guo Chengyou.

504
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,960

As long as I can save your mother's life

Even the ghost father will beg Him

510
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,180
But

511
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,550
That's it.

Father

513
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,890
You can't sell the Queen out of the palace.

514
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:02,420
The Lord must personally welcome the Queen back to the palace

I think the Queen must be grateful.

522
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,810
This is nothing compared to the way the Queen treated me.

523
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,490
How's the Queen?

00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,320
