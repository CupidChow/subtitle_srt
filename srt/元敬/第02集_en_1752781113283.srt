You need to serve His Majesty.

00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,400
What

9
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,090
Does the Queen Mother know about this?

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,670
Take her off

11
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,100
Are you going to use this to serve His Highness?

12
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,180
Take her to bathe

13
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,880
The slaves will first report to the Empress of the Middle Palace of Ming Dynasty.

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,660
All the women in this palace belong to His Highness.

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,150
Even the maids in the palace are the same

16
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,060

Your Highness

19
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,640
It seems that he is no longer the person I have known for many years.

20
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,720
In this world, I am the king

21
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:42,881
Now you are my subject

22

Don't you think Kaijing is really small?

27
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,790
I want to run freely in this vast world

28
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,580
You really overturned the fate of women so easily

29
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,130
What about the young master?

30
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,420

Catch a thief

34
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,760
Hey, you dare to put the stolen rice cake into your mouth

35
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,580
You little thief

36
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,870
Hey, didn't I tell you to leave quietly today?

47
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,290
This girl's mother abandoned her and ran away not long ago.

48
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,660
Oh my god you...

49
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,450
Hello

You you that

51
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,780
Do you know how valuable that is?

52
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,760
Hey, why don't you catch this girl?

53
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,610
Hey Ouch...

54
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,780
Ouch

55
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,880
Hey, come here.

56
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,630
For you

57
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,570
But I have a condition

58
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Would you like to go home with me?

59
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,360
Being a woman doesn't mean you don't have power.

60
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,810
Should be looked down upon

61
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,880
I will let you live in that

62
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,400
A world without discrimination

63
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,140
Zheng Shanggong is here

64
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,810
I heard that the maid who entered your highness's bedroom earlier

65
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,980
I've returned to my own place.

66
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,090
The marriage consummation went smoothly...

67
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,050
Is there anything else I need to know?

68
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,580
No more

Niangniang

70
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,710
This girl has been favored

71
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:19,580
Just deal with it according to palace rules.

72
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,730
yes

73
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,680
I understand

74
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,110
Cai Ling's humble origins

75
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,970
I was afraid that those palace maids would look down on me.

76
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,310
You need to establish her authority.

77
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,050
yes

78
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,890
I understand

79
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,550
The maid came in

80
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,530
The imperial concubine is here

81
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,900
The palace will soon prepare a separate place for you.

82
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,920
Now you have been favored by His Highness

83
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,260
If a child is born, he will be of the fourth rank.

84
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,110
Since you are of noble status, you should pay special attention

85
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,090
Donâ€™t act rashly

86
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,140
yes

87
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,800
If any palace maid looks down on you because you were born as a slave in the palace

88
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,520
Tell me first

89
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,100
The Queen Mother has ordered me to establish your prestige in time.

90
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,120
yes

91
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,500
All matters related to recruiting Yingshi from outside the palace into the palace

92
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,780
This palace will decide everything.

93
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,270
But I don't know if His Majesty has any other instructions on this matter.

94
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,860
This palace is the master of the harem

95
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,850
So you just need to follow my orders.

96
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,460
I understand

97
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,420
Damn the Empress, the servant

98
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,210
Empress of the Middle Temple

99
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,770
Damn the slave

100
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,310
Damn the Empress's servants

101
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,540
Empress of the Middle Temple

102
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,000
This matter...

103
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,640
This is not your fault

104
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,440
The fault lies with the person who touched you

105
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,160
last night

106
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,180
How to sleep

107
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,930
If you are sleeping with me like that, you shouldn't be happy with His Majesty's love.

108
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,530
His Highness treats you like a piece of grass

109
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,440
You should be angry

110
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,480
Empress of the Middle Temple

111
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,020
The Queen Mother of the Central Palace asks the Queen Mother...

Just eat a bite of the Queen Mother has arrived
[Yi Ti Ryung Grand Prince]

Just eat a bite of the Queen Mother has arrived

118
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,710
No need to get up

119
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,600
Well, isn't it uncomfortable?

120
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,420
Your Highness has a serious cold

121
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,740
You will feel better after taking the medicine.

122
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,540
Don't worry too much, ma'am.

123
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,160
knew

124
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,260
If you want to take the medicine, you need to drink the porridge first.

125
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,450
His Majesty has arrived

126
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,360
Father

127
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,430
good

128
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,570
Let's eat something with the Queen Mother.

129
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,330
Let the Father...

130
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,630
They said they didn't know why the king abdicated.

131
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,240
Even if the king abdicates

132
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,190
The king also has Prince Yian and Prince Huaian.

133
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,520
[Prince Ikan and Prince Hwaian Lee Bang-won's third and fourth brothers]
The king also has Prince Yian and Prince Huaian.

134
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,870
Why did His Majesty ascend the throne?
[Prince Ikan and Prince Hwaian Lee Bang-won's third and fourth brothers]

135
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,040
I need to meet His Majesty the Grand King in person to understand the situation.
[Prince Ikan and Prince Hwaian Lee Bang-won's third and fourth brothers]

136
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,300
I need to meet His Majesty the Grand King in person to understand the situation.

137
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,020
It seems that they don't take me seriously at all.

138
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,830
Why is Your Highness so self-deprecating?

139
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,350
At present, the Ming Dynasty is not only in chaos

140
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,320
The follow-up also involves issues such as tribute.

141
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,830
Your Highness should also know that the Ming Dynasty is just trying to show its power.

142
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,230
[The filial palace lady Yeong-sil]

143
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,890
The great kindness of the queen in inviting me into the palace
[The filial palace lady Yeong-sil]

144
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,000
I will never forget the Queen Mother
[The filial palace lady Yeong-sil]

145
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,070
I will never forget the Queen Mother

146
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,660
good

147
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,980
How many words can children read now?

148
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,960
Because I canâ€™t take care of my childrenâ€™s calligraphy

149
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,200
But this child is gifted

150
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,170
Once a day in the morning and evening

151
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,130
Every time I see him for a quarter of an hour

152
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,730
Empress of the Middle Temple

153
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,320
Compared with other princes

154
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,600
He must be behind in his studies.

155
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,460
So the rest of the time should be used for study

156
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,440
He is still young

157
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,840
But he is a prince

158
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,140
How dare you interfere with the prince's education?

159
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,650
The princes are all the sons of this palace.

160
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,990
so

161
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,160
From now on, you are also my son.

162
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,570
[Li Bo Jingning]

163
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,490
yes
[Li Bo Jingning]

164
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:12,590
yes

165
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,850
Even if you are the son of a king

166
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,880
If you are not well-educated, you will be looked down upon by the officials.

167
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,760
The Queen Mother

168
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,070
You don't have to be too kind in the palace.

169
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,390
If you are not careful, you will appear to be easy to bully.

170
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:34,170
This palace has never been perfunctory for a moment

171
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,320
So this is how I teach my children.

172
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,970
You should do the same

173
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,850
I will do the same.

174
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,590
I once dreamed

175
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,860
[Chuldong Qianseong, the residence of Yi Bang-won before he ascended the throne]
I once dreamed

176
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,370
A white dragon entwined in the rafters of the residence in Chudong
[Chuldong Qianseong, the residence of Yi Bang-won before he ascended the throne]

177
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,300
A white dragon entwined in the rafters of the residence in Chudong

178
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,670
I have mentioned

179
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,850
In the end, he became the ruler of a country.

180
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,530
Do you remember those days?

181
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,230
So warm

182
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,890
You are still the same as before

183
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,550

283
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,890
I knew when I lived in Chudong

284
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,360
This will happen at least once.

285
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,270

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,910
Perhaps that's why he hooked the master.

Now the Lord is waiting for us

288

It's definitely different from the past.

289
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,720
Just now, the Lord met me in the side hall.

290
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,140
It made my heart skip a beat and my hair stand on end.

291
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,120
That look can really kill.

292
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,200

There must be someone behind this.

What's up

307
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,890
After all, a concubine's daughter can never be a king

308
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,120
Do I have to look up at you when I hear you speak?

309
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,110
So I don't intend to make him study so hard.

310
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,680
It's about the prince's learning

311
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,760
Your opinion doesn't matter at all

312
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,870
Why is your majesty so harsh on me, your concubine?

313
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,010
I don't understand why I have to explain all these things to you one by one.

314
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,470
I have never received a good education.

315
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,070
If you want to avoid disturbing the princes who are studying together, follow their footsteps.

316
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,990
This is the only way.

317
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,380
interference

318
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,020
That's not right.

319
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,180
The Queen Mother just hates me.

320
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,450
How can I like you?

321
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,130
That's why the queen beat him so hard.

322
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,690
You said that I beat the child because I hated you

323
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,010
yes

324
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,480
Because Your Majesty can't stand your concubine being favored

325
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,200
Are you crazy?

326
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,130
That's why the queen vents her anger on the child.

327
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,020
I know what you're thinking.

328
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,350
I have shown you favor.

329
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:05,170
But you are willing to step on me to get to the top in order to monopolize the master's love

330
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,560
so

331
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,290
To you, I must be a bad guy.

332
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,610
Bad enough to be trampled by you

333
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,390
Only in this way can you reduce self-blame

334
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,970
Since the queen is so powerful

335
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,450
The truth of the world is in the hands of the queen

336
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,030
Why did the Queen let His Highness be so lonely?

337
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,890
Is that why you had a secret meeting with your master who was then Lord Jing'an?

Your Highness is caught between your powerful wife and your father-in-law's family.

342
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,770
I want to hold on no matter what. It's really heartbreaking.

343
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,780
Shut up for me.

344
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,910
His Majesty said

345
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,370

346

Why so noisy?

357
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,820
Not this person...

358
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,600
Nevermind, I confirmed it.

359
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,100

00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,020
Wait a moment

362
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,510
No need.

363
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,780
A man like him is so inflexible

364
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,340
I heard that the Lord will come to the Palace Master's bedroom tonight.

365
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm thinking I might as well find an excuse to postpone it.

366
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,230
Why

367
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,090
Need not

368
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,520
I will serve His Majesty the Lord.

369
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,760
Palace Master

370
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,350
As long as His Highness wants, I will serve you at any time.

371
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,780
Isn't this the duty of the harem?

372
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,240
well...

373
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,760
Well done, madam.

374
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,360
After all, the queen has given birth to a prince.

375
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,250
There is absolutely no need to be afraid

376
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,230
I'm not afraid

377
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,540
These rouge and eyebrow powder

378
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,560
The slaves bought the best goods from Korea.

379
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,540
Oh and this is...

380
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,050
Sachet

381
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,580
It contains musk

382
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,130
Madam, why don't you smell it?

383
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,860
This scent will drive men crazy in bed

384
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:27,120
From now on, you just need to make the monarch surrender to your pomegranate skirt.

385
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,570
Let the monarch no longer be inseparable from the queen

386
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,170
Cheng En Shang Gong asked for an audience

387
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:48,590
Madam, please find me

388
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,050
[Chengen Shanggong Ringtone]
Madam, please find me

389
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:50,060
[Chengen Shanggong Ringtone]

390
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,400
Dressed like this

391
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,490
You are such a beauty too.

392
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,770
How could the Queen...

393
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:05,110
Who else would dare to beat the favored concubine like this?

394
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,480
I am the personal servant of the Palace Master.

395
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,800
Obey the Palace Master's orders

396
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,200
Yeah

397
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,860
You have served the Queen for a long time, so you must know it well.

398
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,210
How confident is the middle palace in itself?

399
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,260
The Central Palace is based on its own ideas.

400
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,030
Everything else is considered an error

401
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,090
Now I am no longer the Yingshi of the past

402
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,950
That's why I want to ask you

403
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,910
You and I should join hands so that we won't be at the mercy of the middle temple.

404
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,870
And survive in this palace, right?

405
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,880
If I ask you to choose between me and the Queen Mother

406
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,560
Who do you choose?

407
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,980
Of course, choosing the Palace Master will be beneficial to you.

408
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,200
Who is blessed now?

409
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,320
Everyone in the palace knows this.

410
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,210
Cheng'en Shanggong

411
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,390
What is it?

412
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,590
If the palace lady does not want to live out her life in loneliness in the inner room

413
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,960
You have to choose the right side

414
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,740
thisâ€¦

415
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,180
What do you mean?

416
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,300
Being favored by the master once does not mean you have everything.

417
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,990
If you are not careful, you will make enemies everywhere.

418
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,330
Completely abandoned

419
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:30,130
If you are not careful, you will make enemies everywhere.

420
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,620
Completely abandoned

421
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,300
If I ask you to choose between me and the Queen Mother

422
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,760
Who do you choose?

423
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,470
Cheng'en Shanggong Cheng'en Shanggong

424
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,160
Chengen Shanggong, where are you going?

425
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,880
Cheng'en Shanggong

426
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,250
Cheng'en Shanggong

427
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,050
No, this is what's going on.

428
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,460
Can't

429
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,350
Empress of the Middle Temple

430
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,100
Can't

431
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,040
I am a slave ringtone

432
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,990
Can't

433
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,090
Empress of the Middle Temple

434
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,230
Can't

435
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,920
I imagine serving the Queen Mother as I did in the past.

436
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,960
It was the Empress who saved me.

437
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,200
I decided to die beside you.

438
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,140
Empress of the Middle Temple

439
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,120
Didn't your Majesty say that His Highness favors this slave?

440
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,010
Isn't it the servant's fault?

441
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,170
Empress of the Middle Temple

442
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,470
The maidservant of the Queen Mother came in

443
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,520
Empress of the Middle Temple

444
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,750
What do you do?

445
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,590
A concubine who has been favored by His Highness

446
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,660
I was totally unaware of my own identity change.

447
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,930
So reckless

448
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:29,130
Are you planning to make me worry about His Highness' messy women problems?

449
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,210
The servant is terrified, Madam Queen

450
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,260
If this happens again,

451
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,360
You have to vacate the position of the imperial concubine.

452
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,640
Slave Guarantee

453
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,000
Make sure this never happens again

454
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,420
Please ask Shang Gong Chengen to go back

455
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,450
The Queen Mother asks the Concubine Chengen to go back

456
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,910
Empress of the Middle Temple

457
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,430
Empress of the Middle Temple

458
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,790
Empress of the Middle Temple

459
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,130
Empress of the Middle Temple

460
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,690
It was the Queen Mother who abandoned me

461
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,400
The Queen did not abandon you but awakened you

462
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,840
Now, Shang Gong Cheng'en is the woman of His Majesty the Lord.

463
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,900
No longer a member of the Central Palace

464
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,470
Just calm down.

465
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,890
To survive in this palace

466
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,910
Send Chengen Shanggong back

467
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,970
Yes Yes

468
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,970
I heard about the matter of Cheng En Shang Gong.

469
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,990
Hearing that the palace was furious

470
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,560
You are the most secret person in the palace.

471
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,270
[The palace attendants who serve the king closely]
You are the most secret person in the palace.

472
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:12,610
You are the most secret person in the palace.

473
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,170
How to act after being favored by His Highness

474
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,860
Didn't you tell Shang Gong Chengen?

475
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,260
Ahaha

476
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,030
Tsk tsk tsk

477
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,160
See how you got this seat.

478
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,730
besides

479
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,890
I heard that you secretly added your brother's name to the list of tributes presented to the palace.

480
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,570
Is this true?

481
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,750
My brother is already qualified. Does Zheng Shanggong mean that my brother is not qualified?

482
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,340
Palace affairs have their own principles and procedures

483
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,790
And I decide what to do.

484
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,040
This happened more than once or twice.

485
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,690
Zheng Shanggong is tired, please leave

486
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,280
Zheng Shanggong

487
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,720
I said you go

488
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,710
I said I was tired today.

489
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,160
It was the Queen Mother who abandoned me

490
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,930
The Queen did not abandon you but awakened you

491
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,350
Now, Shang Gong Cheng'en is the woman of His Majesty the Lord.

492
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,330
No longer a member of the Central Palace

493
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,760
Was it the work of the Central Temple?

494
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,610
Were you beaten?

495
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,830
No

496
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,340
But it's okay

497
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,810
It's just women's stuff

498
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,720
I don't want to be forgotten

499
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,180
I'll live my life alone in my room

500
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,280
What does Cheng En Shang Gong mean?

501
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,870
I hope Jin Shanggong can help create opportunities

502
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,240
Let the Lord come to the temple to find me

503
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:21,240
That was the master's decision.

504
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm just following the emperor's orders.

505
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,980
This is the middle hall.

506
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,190
The one who gave me

507
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,820
What happened?

508
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,880
It is against etiquette to discuss the master's affairs casually...

509
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,780
So you can't say

510
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,320
Even the palace master's face was bruised

511
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,660
You can't say anything

512
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,990
I heard that the palace master had summoned Cheng En Shang Gong alone.

513
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,520
I told Lady Seong-eun in detail.

514
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,370
Do you mean the ringtone?

515
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,240
Exactly

516
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,620
I understand

517
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:52,580
You said you were going to resign as the commander-in-chief of the Central Army.

518
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,060
[General Commander of the Central Army in the Central Army Organization of the Early Joseon Dynasty]
You said you were going to resign as the commander-in-chief of the Central Army.

519
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,540
You said you were going to resign as the commander-in-chief of the Central Army.

520
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,800
It's your highness

521
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,450
I have frequent abdominal pain recently.

522
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,530
Maybe the burden is too heavy

523
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,940
Lijiang Jun has always shared a lot of worries for me.

524
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,230
Maybe it's because of overwork

525
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,680
I really feel indebted

526
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,010
Can Lijiangjun please stay by my side as much as possible?

527
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,270
No, Your Highness

528
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,010
My condition is serious

529
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,100
is that so

530
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,540
Too

531
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,660
Good health is the most important thing

532
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,600
Then you should resign from this position and concentrate on recuperating.

533
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,910
I will summon you again.

534
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,100
Holy Grace

535
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,590
Your Highness

536
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:49,020
His Royal Highness the Supreme King of Xiaoyao Mountain sent someone to

537
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,290
What

538
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,490
His Majesty the King said that the renovation of the Hiam Temple has been completed

539
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:54,500
To provide for the Qinduo

540
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,910
[Qinduo is a small bell hung under the eaves that makes a soft and beautiful sound with the wind]
To provide for the Qinduo

541
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,780
Please invite your highness to the ceremony
[Qinduo is a small bell hung under the eaves that makes a soft and beautiful sound with the wind]

542
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,330
Please invite your highness to the ceremony

543
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,860
Father?

544
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,040
yes

545
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,960
He went to Kaijing to make bronze qinduo.

546
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,290
yes

547
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,710
Not only that

548
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,560
I heard the words engraved on the zither.

549
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,040
There is also Wang Xianfei, who refers to the late Queen Consort.

550
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,560
[Wang Hyeon-bi, the first queen of Joseon, Queen Sindeok, stepmother of Lee Bang-won]
There is also Wang Xianfei, who refers to the late Queen Consort.

551
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,150
as well as
[Wang Hyeon-bi, the first queen of Joseon, Queen Sindeok, stepmother of Lee Bang-won]

552
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,660
The Prince's Words
[Wang Hyeon-bi, the first queen of Joseon, Queen Sindeok, stepmother of Lee Bang-won]

553
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,480
The Prince's Words

554
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,570
But

555
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,620
Something is fishy

556
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,160
What's going on?

557
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,780
This is the Queen Mother

558
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,010
Empress of the Middle Temple

559
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,440
What's strange about this?

560
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,110
yes

561
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,540
The person who engraved the words for Qin Duo said

562
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,440
It seems like I stopped halfway through.

563
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,090
It seems like I stopped halfway through.

564
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,520
yes

565
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,270
If you know other news

566
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,880
Please report to me as soon as possible.

567
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,500
yes

568
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,440
Empress of the Middle Temple

569
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,070
Dedicate the half-finished Qinduo to the Buddha

570
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,640
It's really a bit strange

571
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,350
Among them

572
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,960
There must be something hidden

573
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,510
Please check clearly, sir.

574
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,120
Yes, I understand

575
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,230
Farewell

576
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,310
Your Highness

577
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:13,040
The Huiyan Temple was the place where people prayed for the two princes and their husbands who died in the year of Wuyin.

578
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,800
This is the land of sexuality.

579
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,690
He invited His Majesty to personally attend the temple renovation ceremony

580
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,360
Don't you think it's weird?

581
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,780
I also think this matter is strange

582
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,850
But he was troubled by not being able to refuse his father's request.

583
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:31,060
Moreover, the Ming envoys will also be present.

584
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,700
in this way

585
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,770
I will first strengthen the vigilance

586
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:42,760
Block any armed persons at the entrance

587
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,820
I will guard it strictly and not let any mouse get in.

588
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,620
It's late at night. Why are you two here?

589
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,050
mother

590
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,380
Mom, I feel bad.

591
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,670
You

592
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,430
In terms of feeling bad, can you feel worse than the Queen?

593
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:19,400
Even Cai Ling was favored. Now His Highness is going too far.

594
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,580
Empress of the Middle Temple

595
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,080
I think we all have to lower our posture now.

596
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,640
So your Majesty, don't get too involved in Lijiang Jun's affairs.

597
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,910
It's Dad

598
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,210
No need to cry

599
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,180
Anyway, we still have the Little Prince

600
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,380
yes

601
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:47,760
Come

602
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,760
Stop doing it halfway

603
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,460
What does it mean?

604
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,410
What is Qinduo

605
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:12,650
The one that can produce soft and beautiful sounds is called Qinduo.

606
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,440
But that one is gone.

607
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,240
Besides, that is the most precious treasure that the Supreme King wants to present to the Buddha.

608
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,360
You said there is no such thing

609
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,690
Qin Duoâ€¦

610
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,550
Tell me what you think

611
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:47,620
What I say is of course my own thoughts.

612
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,260
besides

613
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,890
If this causes a disaster and leads to controversy

614
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,240
I'm afraid my life is in danger.

615
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,450
Your life is guaranteed by me

616
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,430
Both of them are masters served by slaves.

617
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,390
so

618
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,390
You can't say

619
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,190
Please grant me death

620
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,520
After Li Jiangjun stepped down

621
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:33,520
The middle hall seemed very sad

622
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,640
The middle temple said so

623
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,470
No

624
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:44,140
It's just that the central hall was particularly sensitive that day

625
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,520
I dare to speculate

626
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:54,830
Have my uncles-in-law been frequently entering and leaving the Central Palace recently?

627
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,980
Indeed

628
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,840
What did the middle temple talk to them about?

629
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,540
You heard it

630
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,730
Report everything you hear.

631
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,440
I order you to report truthfully.

632
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,850
in this way

633
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,020
Your Highness, can you come to my place twice a month?

634
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,320
At firstâ€¦

635
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,990
Isn't it the Central Palace that values you the most?

636
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,380
His Majesty is on the bed

637
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,560
I like my earlobes to be touched and feel warm

638
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,410
The story of Yingshi

639
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,960
I feel deeply ashamed

640
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,810
Thank you for coming all the way here.

641
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,910
Your Highness

642
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:13,030
Emperor Yao once said

643
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,570
God appoints a king

644
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,490
I don't love the monarch alone.

645
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,780
But for millions of people

646
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,830
What does your Highness mean?

647
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,330
What should we do for these millions of people?

648
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,880
I'm just thinking about this question for a while.

649
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,520
Maybe it's because I'm staying in Higanji Temple

650
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,580
The father looks calm.

651
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,790
I am so grateful to be able to summon you to such a significant occasion.

652
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,470
I am very grateful to my father.

653
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,320
It's so precious.

654
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,330
Who are you?

655
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:40,620
I am here to see the Queen Mother.

656
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,400
You can't go in

657
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,590
Please let the little guy in.

658
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,200
The kid must go in.

659
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,930
A big deal

660
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,500
Please let the little guy in.

661
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,260
Don't let me go.

662
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,530
Please get out of my way.

663
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,800
I really beg you

664
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,510
Get Out, Queen

665
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,590
What's the matter with the empress of the middle hall?

666
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,600
Empress of the Middle Temple

667
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,730
I have an urgent matter to report

668
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,250
What is it?

669
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,330
That's what's in there

670
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:43,240
Not Qinduo

671
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,390
Must stop

672
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,260
Absolutely not

673
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,220
[Preview of the next episode]

674
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,740
My righteousness is hatred

675
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,710
Do you mean someone can help?

676
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:46,480
Tell the truth

677
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,110
Didn't I say I would solve it?

678
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,600
I am the ruler of a country.

679
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,140
I said I'll handle it.

680
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,180
What I want to say is that Your Highness should calm down and see the reality clearly.

681
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,360
You have to tell me everything.

682
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,650
If I do as you say, what will His Majesty promise me?

683
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:05,040
Negotiation process for deposing a concubine
