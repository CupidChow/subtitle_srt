Strict production guidelines were also adhered to when filming child actors and animals.]

7
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:49,387
I think it was the Queen who became the ruler of Joseon.

[Previous Situation]

9
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:52,087
It will definitely do well.

10
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:54,967
I can't help but have this thought

11
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,607
In this country, women cannot be kings

12
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:01,507
What do you mean?

13
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,767
I will find a suitable time.

14
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,627
Pardon Mingshan

15
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:10,027
in this way

16
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:14,437
They will attack the Min family from then on.

17
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:16,777
This is the time for the silkworm ceremony.

18
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,827
Your reward for displaying the prince's dignified manner

19
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:23,327
Looks like I have to hurry up and prepare for the prince's wedding.

20
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:25,367
Please help me, sir.

21
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:29,177
You want your daughter to be the crown prince's concubine

22
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:31,357
So we need the clan members to recommend

23
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,367
yes

24
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:34,487
This officer seems to be seeing you for the first time

25
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:37,837
Come on, what are you still standing there for?

26
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:39,397
I will never die alone.

27
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:40,307
Get out of the way

28
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:42,147
I will never die alone.

29
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:49,407
This is the first time since the founding of the country that a crown prince's concubine has been chosen.

30
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:52,197
What we are going to do next will become a model

31
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:55,017
And this example will become history

32
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:59,207
Be fearful when preparing

33
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,587
Are these the only people?

34
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:24,857
yes

35
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:31,157
There are only three people, including the daughter of Ancheng Jun Yi Shufan

36
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:35,207
What's more, the other two are just foils.

37

Re-collect the bill

Empress of the Middle Temple

39
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:46,637
I heard that the clan members are also recommending Anjo-kun.

40
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:49,247
This palace does not allow

41
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:54,237
But...if the person is recommended by the clan

42
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:57,497
I'm afraid your Highness will have no choice but to accept it.

43
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:59,467
Go back to the expedition

44
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:02,857
I will not choose the Crown Prince's concubine based on this.

45
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:12,087
good

46
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:14,697
My dear, you requested to see the emperor alone.

47
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:15,957
yes

48
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:18,857
What is it for?

49
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:24,227
I want to present my daughter to Your Highness as your daughter-in-law.

50
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:27,897
Selection is the responsibility of the Central Palace

51
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:31,397
Your Highness

52
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:33,607
I will offer my daughter

53
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:36,657
It's all out of loyalty to His Majesty.

54
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:39,847
How could this be the palace's business?

55
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:46,667

61
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:01,797
Just don't know

62
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:06,567
I don't know why His Highness treats me differently than before.

63
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:26,877
My dear, I treat you differently than before.

64
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:33,267

66
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:39,047
I don't know why you have this misunderstanding.

Where is the store owner?

70
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,337
We had made an appointment before

Oh, this is good stuff.

74
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:44,577
Thanks

75
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,597
The one who looked like a lady

76
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,616
Why did her husband break her heart?

77
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,177
What? Could it be that her husband has a prostitute concubine?

78
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:51,567
What is this?

79
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:55,767
The master only recognizes our wife in his heart

80
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,737
I have something to ask of you.

81
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,447
But at your command

82
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:09,487
It seems that someone gave the prince a luxurious bow.

83
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:13,487
It's a gift, but it's actually a bribe

84
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:17,157
I hope you can help me find out who these people are.

85
00:06:18,257 --> 00:06:19,997
If you find out

86
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:23,887
You should inform the abbot of Higanji Temple.

87
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:24,947
yes

88
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,447
Oh, there is

89
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:34,927
Not long ago, there was some trouble in the residence of Ancheng Jun Li Shufan

90
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:35,947
What is it?

91
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:43,116
A maidservant whom Anjo-kun's daughter regarded as a sister committed suicide.

92
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:44,237
What

93
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,616
Why

94
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:52,447
It seems that the Ancheng King ordered the palace to return all the bribes received from the Yegu Jin family.

95
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:57,137
But the daughter of Lord Anjou refused to return the ring.

96
00:06:57,137 --> 00:07:00,317
When Anjo-kun found out, he reprimanded him.

97
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:04,517
The daughter of Lord Anjou said that the ring was stolen by the maid.

98
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:08,557
In other words, it was actually Anjo-kun's daughter who stole the ring.

99
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:11,367
But he framed the maid

100
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,557
yes

101
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:30,157
Ouch

102
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:31,697
Oh my god

103
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:33,157
Take this tofu down quickly.

104
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:37,427
The tofu is so heavy, how come you, a lady from a yangban family, carried it yourself?

105
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:40,937
Oh, I'll take the top.

106
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,147
How can you hold these with your hands like this?

107
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,647
Sit here and eat something before you leave.

108
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,287
I'll get two bowls of soup and rice.

109
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:48,537
Ah no

110
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:50,907
I won't bother you if you still have business to do here.

111
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,907
Please help me settle the bill

112
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,267
good

113
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:58,347
Did the queen say Jin Hanlao's daughter?

114
00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,447
Exactly

115
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:04,616
That person must be your highness's fellow imperial examination candidate, right?

116
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:05,467
[Passing the imperial examination on the same list]

117
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,387
only

118
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,457
This person has been criticized

119
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:10,727
During the reign of the Supreme King

120
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:11,327
[Father of King Lee Seong-gye and Lee Bang-won]

121
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:15,147
He once took the postman's horse and rode away on the pretext of attending a banquet.

122
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:15,707
[A clerk working at a post station located on a local transportation route]

123
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:18,487
This incident caused quite a stir.

124
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:19,817
Not only that

125
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:22,037
The last time we sent a Holy Festival envoy to Ming

126
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,547
[A delegation sent by the Holy Festival to celebrate the birthdays of the Emperor and Empress of China]

127
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:24,357
He also secretly did business to make a profit

128
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:26,467
He was even dismissed from office because of this

129
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:30,007
I am not talking about him now, Mr. Jin Han.

130
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,587
But the daughter of Jin Hanlao

131
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:33,097
But the Queen Mother

132
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:36,567
If you don't give me any chance because of my father's absence

133
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:41,016
That is the violence of an entire country against an individual.

134
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:46,727
So I plan to let the daughter of Lord Ancheng compete with the daughter of Lord Jin Han.

135
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,587
Empress of the Middle Temple

136
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:52,607
The Lord is considering Anjo-kun's daughter.

137
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,157
This matter still needs to be reported to His Highness...

138
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:58,297
Last time, I made the rules clear.

139
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:04,507
They will never allow the Crown Prince's concubine to be chosen as a means for them to satisfy their own selfish desires.

140
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:14,097
I heard that Your Highness is considering the daughter of Ancheng Jun Li Shufan.

141
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:17,247
I don't know what the middle temple thinks

142
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:21,117
I heard that Ancheng Jun requested to see the emperor alone.

143
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:23,697
Even more tears to advise

144
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:27,567
This person can definitely perform such loyalty

145
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,677
I naturally won't believe these.

146
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,997
So

147
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:38,977
I intend to establish a cavalry-centered

148
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:40,407
[He is also the personal guard of the servants, centered on cavalry]

149
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:45,227
But if you think about it carefully, one of the military powers of this dynasty is in the hands of Li Shufan.

150
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:49,127
However, this time we are looking for a lifelong companion for the prince.

151
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:52,197
In the end, the prince will become the king of a country.

152
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:55,047
The guards are the royal guards who protect the king's power.

153
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:58,107
The prince's wedding is naturally closely related to politics

154
00:09:58,107 --> 00:10:00,607
But we must not only consider political factors

155
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:04,097
My intention is to strengthen the kingship.

156
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:06,417
The middle temple should also think about it carefully.

157
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:31,757
[Daughter of Li Shufan of the Ancheng Li family]

158
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:39,337
[Daughter of Jin Hanlao, the Jin family of Gwangsan]

159
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:27,567
Ti'er, you're about to meet your lifelong friend. How do you feel?

160
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,987
I don't know

161
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:34,567
Father hopes to be someone like your mother.

162
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,377
Queen Mother?

163
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:37,497
Why

164
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,617
Your mother is upright.

165
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:43,747
Once you have determined your goal, you will move forward courageously.

166
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:45,667
Such a temperament is really precious

167
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:50,157
But I feel that this kind of temperament can sometimes be tiring.

168
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:02,477
Your Highness, let me be your servant

169
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,007
No need

170
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,857
Mencius mentioned this in his chapter on the

171
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:29,977
The people are precious The people are precious

172
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:32,367
Sheji is second to Sheji

173
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:33,887
[Sheji refers to the country or the court in general]

174
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,707
The King is Light The King is Light

175
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:37,527
This is what Mencius said in the chapter on the mind.

176
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:40,077
The king is so insignificant in front of the people

177
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:42,937
What's more, she is the Crown Prince's concubine

178
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:48,927
During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, there were Xia Jie and Zhou Wang

179
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:52,337
I heard that the two kings became dictators overnight.

180
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,227
Do you know what a dictator means?

181
00:12:56,457 --> 00:13:01,697
A dictator is a lonely man.

182
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:05,177
A cruel and unjust king who was driven out of power by the people is a tyrant.

183
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:06,697
Exactly

184
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:13,257
There is a saying that goes, "If you caress me, you will be hated later, if you abuse me, you will be hated later."

185
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:14,987
Do you know where it comes from?

186
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:18,547
From the Book of Shangshu, Taishi

187
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,827
Really smart

188
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:23,667
The afternoon selection will be carried out at 3 p.m.

189
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,987
[3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.]

190
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:27,197
The two ladies can take a rest after dinner.

191
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:29,617
Wait until the time comes.

192
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:33,077
I will go and ask the Queen Mother to come.

193
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:42,247
If I were as wealthy as you,

194
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:45,507
Will they also go through such a selection?

195
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:47,187
What do you think, Madam?

196
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:52,427
Anjo-kun's daughter seems to be smart and clever

197
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:54,767
The Queen doesn't think she seems to be distracted

198
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,857
Are you only interested in studying?

199
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:00,427
Focus

200
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:06,937
I don't have any special intentions.

201
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:14,017
How could the Queen choose the Crown Prince's concubine based on her intelligence alone?

202
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:15,317
How will you choose?

203
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:18,927
The Queen Mother will see the person

204
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:22,217
The daughter of Jin Hanlao will be selected

205
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:24,087
Is that what you think, Madam?

206
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:29,047
I think maybe Li Shufan's daughter will be selected.

207
00:14:29,897 --> 00:14:33,947
After all, choosing a concubine is not just about choosing a person.

208
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:37,157
But to find a political partner

209
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:45,977
Not long ago, there was a silkworm ceremony in the palace.

210
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,787
Do you know why the Silkworm Ceremony is held?

211
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,847
The Silkworm Ceremony is for the Improvement of People's Livelihood

212
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:55,517
The Queen Mother personally demonstrated silkworm rearing to the court and the public.

213
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:56,957
Exactly

214
00:14:56,957 --> 00:15:01,327
But I think there is a problem with the Silkworm Ceremony.

215
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,827
Why do you think

216
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:10,687
The silk thread produced by silkworms is called silk

217
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:17,367
But how many people among the common people can wear silk brocade clothes?

218
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,777
Exactly

219
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:27,067
The clothes that the common people wear are not made of silk.

220
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,417
Cotton clothes are mostly made of cotton

221
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,117
Or a linen garment made of coarse flax

222
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,777
Wearing silk brocade

223
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:37,917
How can we understand the life of ordinary people wearing cotton clothes?

224
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:43,577
Therefore, I plan to hold a cotton weaving competition.

225
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:49,257
And the winner will be chosen as the Crown Prince's concubine.

226
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:53,217
I will have someone teach you two how to weave.

227
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,517
We will try again later

228
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:12,947
The Queen ordered you two to stay here for three days and weave well.

229
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:13,967
What

230
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,647
Three days?

231
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:29,727
During these three days, you two must not meet anyone, including anyone from your mother's family.

232
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:40,937
I understand.

233
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:48,037
I don't know how the Queen can choose the Crown Prince's concubines by weaving cotton cloth worn by the lowly people.

234
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,237
It's just a competition

235
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:53,667
Winning is

236
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,547
So

237
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:04,037
There is someone in my house who is proficient in weaving.

238
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:05,787
only

239
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:09,237
The Central Temple ordered that no outsiders be allowed to enter

240
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,977
Leave it to me.

241
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:17,316
If the lady is willing to help

242
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:09,997
This is sent from the lady's house.

243
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:12,397
Just present this piece of cloth tomorrow.

244
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:15,207
Thanks

245
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:51,207
You knit very well

246
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:53,177
The minister is terrified

247
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,767
After all, this is your first time weaving, so it's natural

248
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:13,757
But although Anjo-kun's daughter was weaving for the first time,

249
00:19:13,757 --> 00:19:17,367
But the craftsmanship is amazing and it seems that he has put a lot of effort into it.

250
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:22,657
Why not let Miss Jin learn where she went wrong?

251
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:24,747
The Queen Mother

252
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:30,837
As the mother of the nation, you should teach the people these principles

253
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,457
Please show her how.

254
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:39,257
The Queen Mother

255
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:40,427
This cloth was really woven by you.

256
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,827
I'm asking you if you knitted it.

257
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:51,907
It's outside...

258
00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:55,787
The maid in my house...

259
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,937
You cheated

260
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:09,827
Lost the qualification to compete

261
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:17,067
I intend to punish the maid who helped you cheat.

262
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,257
What do you think?

263
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,017
I don't know

264
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,977
Don't you know?

265
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:34,267
That nanny is about to be punished because of you, but you don't know

266
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:42,167
Was this something given to me by Yegu Jin?

267
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:46,717
Didn't you say that it was stolen by your servant who was as close to you as a sister?

268
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:48,217
[A servant who works for a household]

269
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:48,797
How could it be in your hands?

270
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:53,777
You are not responsible for what you did.

271
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:56,927
But he shifted all the blame to others

272
00:21:56,927 --> 00:22:01,237
You will memorize the Shangshu's teaching that the ruler should be wary of the people.

273
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:06,337
But he had no fear or mercy for the people.

274
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:08,357
Such a person

275
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:12,367
How can I dream of becoming the crown prince's concubine and becoming the queen mother one day?

276
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:19,827
The Queen has decided on the Crown Prince's concubine.

277
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:23,367
Daughter of Jin Hanlao

278
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,647
But now not only the clan members praise

279
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,337
His Majesty also thought that Anseong-gun's daughter would become the Crown Prince's concubine.

280
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:35,987
Even if you saw it with your own eyes, would you still say this?

281
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,707
This woman is not qualified enough

282
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:41,777
Daughter of Jin Hanlao

283
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:46,647
Chosen as the Crown Prince's Consort

284
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,207
Your Highness

285
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:51,857
I understand

286
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:56,937
Do I need to convey His Highness's intention to the Queen Mother?

287
00:22:56,937 --> 00:22:58,677
No need

288
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,647
You go down first

289
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:17,977
In the early Wuyin year

290
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:20,927
But my soldiers gathered at the gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace

291
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:22,097
During the Park Bak Rebellion

292
00:23:21,377 --> 00:23:26,117
[Park Bae's Rebellion, the Second Prince's Rebellion, Park Bae's rebellion with his fourth son Yi Bang-gan]

293
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:25,657
I was the first to lead the troops and defeat those traitors.

294
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:27,077
But why...

295
00:23:27,077 --> 00:23:29,317
It's all over

296
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:34,457
Want to gain the master's trust

297
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:37,837
Is it that we can only rely on the Right Army Commander and the Crown Prince's Concubine?

298
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,377
Madam, what do you mean?

299
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:46,157
During the last silkworm ceremony, an outsider sneaked into the palace

300
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:51,597
But this outsider... is exactly the person His Highness wants

301
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:59,227
Can you catch this guy?

302
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:23,607
Is that them?

303
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:25,827
They have been colluding with the Jin family of Yegu for many years.

304
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:29,027
Accepting bribes to enrich oneself

305
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:30,137
yes

306
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:36,237
You wait and be presumptuous

307
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:37,897
master

308
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:40,137
Who gave the order?

309
00:24:40,137 --> 00:24:42,727
open

310
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:44,467
I'll go by myself.

311
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,377
Master, Master

312
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:50,197
My old man is innocent...

313
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,307
Let go of you guys.

314
00:24:57,307 --> 00:24:59,207
Ouch, what should I do?

315
00:24:59,207 --> 00:24:59,907
what to do

316
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:00,947
lady

317
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:02,247
Ouch Madam

318
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:04,577
What's going on? What should I do?

319
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,477
How could the Queen...

320
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:59,307
I sent people to look for you but there is no news.

321
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,417
yes

322
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,177
only...

323
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:12,097
Where did you come from so late at night?

324
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:16,807
Patrol...Patrol

325
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:18,537
[The Xunjinsi is an agency responsible for the security of the capital]

326
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:22,467
You are buying and selling houses in Nakamura.

327
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:21,897
[The area surrounding Jongno in Nakamura]

328
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:26,697
If you hadn't had an affair with that Yegu Jin

329
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:30,617
There would be no need to go in and out of the Patrol Office so frequently.

330
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:33,527
Slave...slave is not deeply involved

331
00:26:35,447 --> 00:26:38,227
You wait quietly.

332
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:39,547
What

333
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,977
The Lord has achieved his goal

334
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,927
This will be resolved soon.

335
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:45,637
How does the queen...

336
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:51,717
I have served the Lord for eight years.

337
00:26:51,717 --> 00:26:52,857
ah

338
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:13,637
This... this... this is rose seeds

339
00:27:13,637 --> 00:27:15,397
Rose seeds

340
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:17,697
When I have a nose ulcer, I will use this to disinfect it.

341
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:19,557
If used improperly

342
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:23,317
This substance can cause serious damage to the liver.

343
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:26,527
It can even endanger people's lives

344
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:35,317
Shu...Shuyi Niangniang

345
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:40,807
You are going to

346
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,407
Whose mouth is shut?

347
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:43,817
No

348
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:45,937
Absolutely not

349
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:48,387
Take it and throw it away

350
00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:50,607
This is not a good idea.

351
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,837
yes

352
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:56,127
Today, the palace is here

353
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:59,967
To the Crown Princess, I am also her mother-in-law.

354
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,637
Although I was born as a personal maid

355
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,877
But I don't want to be looked down upon.

356
00:28:03,877 --> 00:28:09,097
This time I came here to remind you not to cause any trouble.

357
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:11,337
How dare I disobey?

358
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:22,937
The prince's wedding is coming soon. I will grant amnesty to the world.

359
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,897
Led by Doctor Mingshan

360
00:28:27,477 --> 00:28:30,167
[The third-rank rank bestowed upon the clan members by Doctor Mingshan]

361
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:32,307
Among those implicated by the Night Valley Jin family

362
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:33,997
The hero of the society

363
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:34,467
[The title given to the meritorious officials in the First Prince Rebellion]

364
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:36,117
A meritorious official

365
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:38,127
[The title of meritorious official of the First Prince Rebellion was awarded to the meritorious official of the First Prince Rebellion]

366
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:38,337
In addition, all first-class meritorious officials will be pardoned

367
00:28:46,217 --> 00:28:50,697
Holy Grace

368
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:57,287
[Licheng Jun Min Wuji, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyung]

369
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:58,187
Holy Grace

370
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:05,327
Holy Grace

371
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:15,117
Your Highness planned this from the beginning.

372
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:17,237
How do you say this?

373
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:20,627
I want to pardon Doctor Mingshan.

374
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:23,227
What's the problem with this?

375
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:28,807
Doctor Mingshan will only become a stumbling block on His Highness's path.

376
00:29:29,797 --> 00:29:33,287
If stumbling blocks are properly cleared, they can also become stepping stones.

377
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:37,667
Your Highness should understand that this person cannot be a stepping stone

378
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:42,507
It was His Highness who hid behind the scenes and let Lichengjun swing the sword.

379
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:45,607
I will show you Licheng Jun

380
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:47,427
Will they give up?

381
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:49,257
Next, they will definitely attack Lichengjun.

382
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:54,287
Since His Highness has asked him to raise the knife, he should be responsible for this.

383
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,077
Responsible?

384
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:04,317
Taking responsibility for one's shortcomings is called being responsible.

385
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:08,377
But no matter what situation we face, we must not have shortcomings

386
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:11,337
The nave sometimes always forgets

387
00:30:11,337 --> 00:30:13,467
Now I am North Korea

388
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:14,147
Your Highness

389
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:18,167
I have clearly stated that I want to choose Shufan's daughter as the Crown Prince's concubine.

390
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,827
But the idea of me, the king of a country,

391
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:22,637
To the central hall, it is lighter than the white paper.

392
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:23,777
That girl is not qualified enough...

393
00:30:23,777 --> 00:30:27,827
Wasn't it all done to suppress me by publicly humiliating Shufan's daughter?

394
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:30,447
Do you want me to see clearly how inadequate this girl is?

395
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:32,267
Isn't this open contempt for the monarch?

396
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:34,837
I want to find a life partner for the prince.

397
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:37,057
The same is true during the silkworm ceremony.

398
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:39,747
Is it necessary to treat Doctor Mingshan like that?

399
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:41,077
Nave...

400
00:30:41,737 --> 00:30:43,527
But not the king

401
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,627
Your Highness is despicable.

402
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:53,407
Your Highness, please don't treat Doctor Mingshan like I do.

403
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:56,277
Isn't this why His Highness hid behind Lichengjun's sword?

404
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:57,147
Because I know that I...

405
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,597
nave

406
00:30:59,397 --> 00:31:01,727
Such a despicable attitude

407
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,847
How can it be called the North Korean style?

408
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:05,347
Enough

409
00:31:07,677 --> 00:31:09,087
Your Highness

410
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:10,997
Let's go back to the central hall first

411
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:18,717
Take it

412
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:19,687
yes

413
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:22,167
Who are you?

414
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:24,697
how so

415
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:26,187
Let me go

416
00:32:26,187 --> 00:32:28,227
Why are you doing this?

417
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:29,337
grown ups

418
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:32,977
Are you okay, sir?

419
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:39,027
The cell floor is cold

420
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:42,927
I've suffered a lot.

421
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:48,887
The master used the knife of his relatives to kill his relatives and meritorious officials.

422
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:53,267
I didn't expect His Highness to be like this.

423
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:57,707
Do you really not understand His Highness?

424
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:59,267
Although not born from the same mother

425
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:02,807
But His Highness killed the prince's younger brother and drove him away

426
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:05,157
That's how he ascended the throne.

427
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:08,687
But now His Highness has released the master from prison.

428
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,407
What does this mean?

429
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:19,167
Your Highness means that now we can also fight back

430
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:24,877
Because the Lord will never allow one party to dominate.

431
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:29,897
But

432
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:34,347
What should I use to fight back?

433
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:37,547
Your Highness

434
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:40,987
When His Highness wanted to pass on the throne

435
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:44,997
Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun were delighted.

436
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:48,587
But when His Highness rescinds his order and returns to his position

437
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:53,917
Unlike the happy people, the two of them showed sadness.

438
00:33:53,917 --> 00:34:02,777
If he didn't want to use the young prince to gain power, how could he do this?

439
00:33:57,357 --> 00:34:02,227
[Now I will express my intention to rebel]

440
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:06,027
Not only that, the day His Highness said he would pass on the throne

441
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:10,287
The two of them also planned to set up a Neizaishu under the name of the Crown Prince's residence.

442
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:11,157
[A system in which the king summons a small number of trusted ministers to handle major state affairs]

443
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:12,357
So now the general's heart is clear

444
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:15,107
Please take back their certificates and tickets.

445
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:18,127
[A certificate of appointment to an official position] [An iron plate recording the meritorious service of an official]

446
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:18,237
Deposed as a commoner

447
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:47,547
I am really terrified to see Your Highness in this state.

448
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:53,187
If the father-in-law had told me earlier, I would have sent the imperial physician to visit me.

449
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:55,267
How could he be so seriously ill?

450
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:58,846
I am terrified

451
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,647
Why did my father suddenly fall ill?

452
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:07,657
It is because His Highness abandoned me.

453
00:35:08,517 --> 00:35:09,967
Li Jiangjun

454
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:20,307
I have been waiting

455
00:35:20,307 --> 00:35:24,847
I really have something to ask of you, Your Highness.

456
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:29,397
I have been holding on and waiting for His Highness to come.

457
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:31,437
if

458
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,707
What happened?

459
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,057
Please His Royal Highness

460
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:51,677
Spare their lives

461
00:35:51,677 --> 00:35:53,317
Father

462
00:35:55,997 --> 00:35:59,967
They have many shortcomings

463
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:07,257
I can guarantee their loyalty to Your Highness.

464
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,377
so

465
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:11,267
His Royal Highness Wanwang

466
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,857
Spare their lives

467
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,757
Your Highness

468
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:30,187
Your Highness

469
00:36:56,717 --> 00:37:35,367
Ouch ouch...

470
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:38,407
His Majesty has arrived

471
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:09,377
Please go back

472
00:38:09,377 --> 00:38:11,557
I do not allow

473
00:38:12,347 --> 00:38:17,747
If you want to pay your respects to my father

474
00:38:20,457 --> 00:38:22,337
Your Highness is not worthy

475
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:27,327
Li Jiangjun

476
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:28,687
The Queen Mother

477
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:32,247
Licheng Jun is too sad to know right from wrong

478
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:33,767
Take him in.

479
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:34,937
yes

480
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,567
Let's go

481
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,137
I don't want

482
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:39,487
I won't leave

483
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:41,607
I won't leave

484
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,497
Let me go

485
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:46,367
Please let me go

486
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,597
Let me go

487
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:00,647
bye

488
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:11,947
bye

489
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:27,457
The funeral of Lixingbuyuangun Minji is over

490
00:39:27,457 --> 00:39:33,137
Reclaim the official certificates and records of his sons Lijiang Lord Min Wujiu and Licheng Lord Min Wuji

491
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,127
Exile to Jeju

492
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:38,917
So they let them live out their old age in Jeju

493
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:40,927
yes

494
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:43,957
What

495
00:39:46,077 --> 00:39:47,407
Empress of the Middle Temple

496
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,917
Please, Madam.

497
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,697
Please calm down, ma'am...

498
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:53,157
Get out of the way

499
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,067
Empress of the Middle Temple

500
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:55,237
Servant Xu Shanggong

501
00:39:55,237 --> 00:39:56,227
The maid came in

502
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,917
Empress of the Middle Temple

503
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,077
Something bad is happening.

504
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:08,117
Please see if this is the person

505
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:13,647
Yes

506
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:19,217
It was you who asked the Central Palace to disobey the order.

507
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,337
As early as the time of the prince

508
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:24,667
I have said that spies should not be used privately.

509
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:27,477
[a person who acts as a spy or who penetrates into the enemy camp to gather intelligence]

510
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:28,927
I thought I'd report it to the Queen Mother.

511
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:33,177
No different from reporting to His Highness

512
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:34,507
presumptuous

513
00:40:34,507 --> 00:40:35,897
How come there is no difference

514
00:40:35,897 --> 00:40:39,097
The middle hall is the minister of the Lord.

515
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:42,297
Please, Your Highness, grant me death.

516
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:53,167
You'd better ask for my life.

517
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:58,317
Please, Your Highness, grant me death.

518
00:40:58,317 --> 00:40:59,957
It's death

519
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:04,177
You don't want to cause trouble for the Central Palace.

520
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:09,297
Why are you so loyal to the Middle Temple?

521
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:14,747
Empress of the Middle Temple

522
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,937
A calling

523
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:22,487
Only the Lord can summon you.

524
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:28,547
I will definitely...keep this mission

525
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:47,917
If Your Highness kills this man

526
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:51,927
Your thoughts

527
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,187
It will cost the life of the middle temple.

528
00:41:58,347 --> 00:42:00,397
Just hate me

529
00:42:38,907 --> 00:42:40,427
Empress of the Middle Temple

530
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:02,187
Is Your Highness crazy?

531
00:43:02,187 --> 00:43:03,157
What

532
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:05,777
If it weren't crazy

533
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:09,287
How can you treat innocent people like this?

534
00:43:18,057 --> 00:43:20,237
This person is disobeying the order.

535
00:43:20,237 --> 00:43:23,267
I clearly told you

536
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,977
No secret use of spies

537
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:30,677
Your Highness is now sending not only my brothers to exile

538
00:43:30,677 --> 00:43:33,217
I will also kill the person whom I trust deeply.

539
00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:36,007
Why does Your Highness treat me like this?

540
00:43:37,857 --> 00:43:39,867
I have no regrets about the Central Palace

541
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,987
Your Highness

542
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:45,817
If the Queen Mother hates me for this, then let her hate me.

543
00:43:45,817 --> 00:43:48,087
I will bear it myself

544
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,397
Madam, this is mud rain

545
00:44:42,397 --> 00:44:44,257
It hurts your body.

546
00:44:50,217 --> 00:44:51,857
How could the Queen...

547
00:44:54,997 --> 00:44:58,427
Madam Shuyi sent word that she had a sudden chill.

548
00:44:58,427 --> 00:45:00,397
Let her out

549
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,977
Empress of the Middle Temple

550
00:45:02,757 --> 00:45:04,637
Do you want me to drag her out?

551
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:23,047
Kneel down

552
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:24,557
Lady Shuyi is His Highness's harem

553
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:25,537
How can the lady be so rude?

554
00:45:25,537 --> 00:45:27,377
I ask you to kneel down

555
00:45:27,737 --> 00:45:29,157
Get out of the way

556
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:40,437
You're the one who caused this, right?

557
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:42,427
yes

558
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:46,077
What do you do this for?

559
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:50,807
I want my master to recognize that I am a useful person.

560
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:53,347
This excuse is really lame.

561
00:45:54,507 --> 00:45:57,327
You are just intoxicated by the taste of power

562
00:45:57,327 --> 00:46:00,357
Now they want more and that is why innocent people die.

563
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,187
no

564
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:12,427
So far, I have never abandoned you.

565
00:46:12,427 --> 00:46:13,647
But now

566
00:46:15,537 --> 00:46:18,147
I will abandon you.

567
00:46:31,947 --> 00:46:33,947
Lady Shuyi

568
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,287
There has been a lot of mud and rain recently.

569
00:46:48,287 --> 00:46:50,217
Panic

570
00:46:50,217 --> 00:46:53,077
Seeing that more and more people are hungry

571
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:57,357
I plan to open the warehouse urgently to distribute relief food

572
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:57,927
[Relief food is rice used to help people who have suffered natural disasters and the poor]

573
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,527
Household judgment

574
00:46:58,297 --> 00:47:01,647
[The head of the Hucao department who is in charge of the financial affairs]

575
00:46:58,527 --> 00:46:59,427
Minister in

576
00:46:59,427 --> 00:47:01,507
To count how many families are suffering from famine

577
00:47:01,507 --> 00:47:04,167
Each family was given 10 dou of rice and 1 dan of soybeans

578
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:05,867
It's your highness

579
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:11,407
In addition, I have handed over the 100 knots of land I confiscated from the Jin family in Yegu to the Higan Temple

580
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:15,307
These lands were cultivated by the nearby people and the temple to make a living.

581
00:47:15,307 --> 00:47:19,377
Please find out whether these lands are managed properly and report back.

582
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:23,387
Why didn't the judge answer?

583
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,467
It's your highness

584
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:31,347
I obey your Majesty's order.

585
00:47:32,027 --> 00:47:33,237
Sentence

586
00:47:33,077 --> 00:47:37,787
[The abbreviation of the Criminal Justice Department, the head of the Criminal Justice Department in charge of judicial criminal law and litigation]

587
00:47:33,237 --> 00:47:34,477
Your Highness

588
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:38,927
You also need to investigate whether the land I gave to the temple is managed properly.

589
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:40,997
But Your Highness

590
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:44,107
His Highness has ordered the temple to manage itself...

591
00:47:44,107 --> 00:47:45,667
This is a sacred decree

592
00:47:54,027 --> 00:47:56,507
The land that the Lord gave to Higan Temple

593
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:59,577
Haven't you got permission yet?

594
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,077
Previously, I believed the words of Doctor Mingshan.

595
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:02,877
So he gave the land to Doctor Mingshan

596
00:48:02,877 --> 00:48:04,707
That piece of land...

597
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:06,937
It was originally agreed that I would take it from Yegu.

598
00:48:06,937 --> 00:48:07,877
That's my husband's land.

599
00:48:07,877 --> 00:48:10,247
No matter who owns the land, if this matter is exposed

600
00:48:10,247 --> 00:48:11,997
This subordinate is about to lose his head.

601
00:48:11,997 --> 00:48:13,037
You are not the only one who lost your head

602
00:48:13,037 --> 00:48:15,197
My life is in danger too.

603
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:17,697
This can't go on like this.

604
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:18,617
Why not go to Higanji Temple now...

605
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:20,257
Slow down

606
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:23,067
As long as the master doesn't know about this, it's fine.

607
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,897
How to do this

608
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,457
I will go back first.

609
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:36,577
The sentence is my husband's.

610
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:41,447
Niangniang

611
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:46,547
The burial of Pansu will be handled by the Household Department and the Gyeonggi Province Surveillance Commissioner.

612
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:47,927
[A local governor in charge of local governance]

613
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:48,187
Please give it to them, Madam.

614
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:50,237
Pansu comes to help me

615
00:48:50,237 --> 00:48:52,277
But she died tragically at the hands of my husband.

616
00:48:52,277 --> 00:48:53,847
How dare I ask others to deal with you?

617
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,197
But the Queen Mother

618
00:48:55,197 --> 00:48:57,417
The current situation is not good

619
00:48:57,417 --> 00:49:02,167
His Highness has ordered the exile of Lijiangjun and Lichengjun

620
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:05,537
Your Majesty must not leave the palace now.

621
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:13,407
They are innocent

622
00:49:13,777 --> 00:49:17,937
How could His Highness not know

623
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:28,797
Queen Mother

624
00:49:29,857 --> 00:49:32,527
It's not long since I entered the palace.

625
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:35,627
I'm sorry to have embarrassed you. I'm sorry, mother.

626
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:37,787
No, mother

627
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:39,627
My son is fine

628
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,617
Although I have always lived in the palace

629
00:49:45,617 --> 00:49:49,527
The sight must always be looking outside the palace

630
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:51,787
It's the Queen Mother

631
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:55,377
The people are outside the palace

632
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:56,517
yes

633
00:49:59,157 --> 00:50:00,217
Your Highness

634
00:50:01,817 --> 00:50:04,217
Um, what's up?

635
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:07,547
The Queen Mother left the palace

636
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,037
Leaving the palace?

637
00:50:09,037 --> 00:50:12,567
Said he wanted to collect Pan Zhu's body

638
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:18,247
The monarch killed the man.

639
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:21,147
The middle hall is going to collect the body

640
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:25,057
This has never happened before.

641
00:50:31,107 --> 00:50:32,257
Shangshan

642
00:50:32,257 --> 00:50:33,027
Slave in

643
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:35,697
Go tell the inner guards and the palace guards

644
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,747
[The Inner Guards guard the troops in the palace]

645
00:50:35,697 --> 00:50:38,047
Anyone

646
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:41,227
No one is allowed into the palace without my permission.

647
00:50:41,227 --> 00:50:42,437
yes

648
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:44,747
Right

649
00:50:44,747 --> 00:50:46,407
Keep going, keep going

650
00:50:46,407 --> 00:50:49,477
You should press hard.

651
00:50:56,247 --> 00:51:00,557
It seems that someone gave the prince a luxurious bow.

652
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:04,537
It's a gift, but it's actually a bribe

653
00:51:04,537 --> 00:51:08,217
I hope you can help me find out who these people are.

654
00:51:09,207 --> 00:51:10,947
If it is clear

655
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:14,167
You should inform the abbot of Higanji Temple.

656
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,367
I obey your orders.

657
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:19,467
I have to go to Higanji Temple.

658
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:21,767
Not going back to the palace?

659
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:23,487
Oh, it's all right.

660
00:51:23,487 --> 00:51:24,687
Oh, good.

661
00:51:26,637 --> 00:51:27,897
I stuffed half a tael of silver in it

662
00:51:27,897 --> 00:51:29,947
Oh, thank you.

663
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:33,667
He is a blessed man after all.

664
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:35,597
Why do you say that?

665
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:40,737
The bodies of many people who died of starvation were just dumped here.

666
00:51:40,737 --> 00:51:43,197
How can someone starve to death?

667
00:51:43,197 --> 00:51:46,067
The imperial court should have distributed relief food.

668
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:48,597
I think you look like a lady.

669
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:50,077
That's easy to say.

670
00:51:50,077 --> 00:51:52,977
Do you know who this person is...

671
00:51:53,817 --> 00:51:55,407
This damn relief food

672
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,747
A pit on the top and another pit in the middle

673
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,197
It is a blessing for ordinary people to receive it

674
00:51:59,197 --> 00:52:01,507
I don't know how many people didn't get it.

675
00:52:02,157 --> 00:52:04,037
This is true

676
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:08,757
I want to meet them

677
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:10,027
What

678
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:20,717
How did the condition take a turn for the worse?

679
00:52:30,107 --> 00:52:31,517
Sores...

680
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:33,737
[A boil or sore on the skin]

681
00:52:31,847 --> 00:52:36,667
It must be because Your Highness is overthinking.

682
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:41,537
Please put your worries aside.

683
00:52:43,297 --> 00:52:46,377
This is not appropriate for the king.

684
00:52:46,377 --> 00:52:49,277
How can I let go of my worries and find comfort in my heart?

685
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:50,187
Your Highness

686
00:52:50,187 --> 00:52:53,857
If you don't take good care of it, you may get a rheumatism.

687
00:52:53,857 --> 00:52:56,377
Your Highness needs to be on guard

688
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:11,457
What is the Palace Master doing?

689
00:53:11,457 --> 00:53:13,487
I heard that His Highness is ill.

690
00:53:13,487 --> 00:53:14,787
Palace Master, please go back.

691
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:16,727
This is the palace.

692
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:17,457
Shuyi

693
00:53:17,457 --> 00:53:20,957
I will go to see His Highness and take good care of him.

694
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:23,207
This palace is a virtuous person of the first rank.

695
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:25,787
But Shuyi had to start from the second rank

696
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,837
This palace should take care of it.

697
00:53:28,807 --> 00:53:32,197
There are four princes and princesses born to me.

698
00:53:32,197 --> 00:53:35,607
But during this period, the palace master only gave birth to one princess.

699
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:40,457
I wonder who the master will wait for to take care of him?

700
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:44,047
Palace Master, take care

701
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:57,407
Your Highness, Lady Shuyi requests an audience

702
00:53:57,407 --> 00:53:59,167
Let her in

703
00:54:05,557 --> 00:54:07,007
Your Highness

704
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:08,197
How did you know you were coming?

705
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:09,297
Your Highness

706
00:54:11,217 --> 00:54:13,607
I will take care of Your Highness.

707
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:14,847
No problem

708
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:16,027
There is also a royal doctor

709
00:54:16,027 --> 00:54:20,627
How can I eat and sleep now that Your Highness is calling me like this?

710
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:24,347
I will stay by your side all night to wipe away the pus.

711
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:26,817
Help His Highness make medicine

712
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,027
The imperial physician should withdraw first.

713
00:55:13,827 --> 00:55:18,817
Now, this makes me see people's hearts clearly.

714
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,397
No need to sigh about people's hearts

715
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:29,747
You and I just need to... turn our grief and anger into strength.

716
00:55:31,837 --> 00:55:35,077
If you and I start an army

717
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:37,067
How many people will follow?

718
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:47,477
I am afraid I will forget what Pan Zhu said.

719
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:49,887
I wrote them all down.

720
00:55:49,887 --> 00:55:53,337
Next to the Crown Prince's residence was a musician named Li Wufang.

721
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,737
[The palace music and dance agency]

722
00:55:53,337 --> 00:55:55,937
There is also Gu Zongxiu from the Patrol Office

723
00:55:53,737 --> 00:55:57,877
[The palace music and dance agency]
[The Xunjinsi is an agency responsible for the security of the capital]

724
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:58,437
The prince seems to be leaving the palace often

725
00:55:58,437 --> 00:56:00,967
Hanging out with these people

726
00:56:00,967 --> 00:56:02,507
What these people are trying to achieve

727
00:56:02,507 --> 00:56:07,447
It is to take a place when the prince ascends the throne.

728
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:13,777
There are also rumors that Li Shufan and Gu Zongxiu's brothers are very close.

729
00:56:13,777 --> 00:56:16,277
It's just that this matter is still uncertain

730
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:18,097
Li Shufan

731
00:56:25,097 --> 00:56:26,487
That's right

732
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:30,967
I heard that many people were unable to receive the relief food awarded by Your Highness.

733
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:32,897
What is going on?

734
00:56:32,897 --> 00:56:35,427
It seems that some people rely on powerful officials as their backers.

735
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:36,987
[a powerful minister]

736
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:40,447
Lower-level officials secretly withheld the relief grain

737
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,387
You mean the powerful official?

738
00:56:42,387 --> 00:56:43,367
yes

739
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:47,457
I have heard that you have recently relied on Doctor Mingshan.

740
00:56:45,177 --> 00:56:49,817
[The third-rank rank bestowed upon the clan members by Doctor Mingshan]

741
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:51,087
There are many people who do this

742
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:53,207
Doctor Mingshan

743
00:56:55,057 --> 00:56:59,897
Not long ago, the Lord granted land to the Higan Temple.

744
00:56:59,897 --> 00:57:01,537
I wonder if the master has received it.

745
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:04,547
I have never heard of this before.

746
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:10,897
Empress of the Middle Temple

747
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:16,237
Just now, I was blind and failed to recognize the great man.

748
00:57:16,237 --> 00:57:17,517
The villain deserves death

749
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,807
fine

750
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:20,307
Get up

751
00:57:20,307 --> 00:57:21,387
Get up

752
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:23,387
Get up, everyone.

753
00:57:31,607 --> 00:57:33,187
Are these the people?

754
00:57:33,187 --> 00:57:36,497
People who should have received relief food but did not

755
00:57:36,497 --> 00:57:37,917
yes

756
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,707
Exactly

757
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:26,327
[Preview of the next episode]

758
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:27,937
What do you want to say?

759
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,507
The Queen Mother showed the Crown Prince

760
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,207
Do you want to die on the spot under my sword?

761
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:37,087
Meeting in the palace to plot rebellion

762
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:39,917
Is there any evidence

763
00:58:40,537 --> 00:58:41,787
Beheaded

764
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:44,847
The central hall should be during the stay in Higan Temple

765
00:58:44,847 --> 00:58:48,497
Died at the hands of vicious bandits

766
00:58:49,617 --> 00:58:53,207
Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun, who were exiled to Jeju Island, were clearly planning a rebellion.

767
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:55,967
Go and tell them to commit suicide.
