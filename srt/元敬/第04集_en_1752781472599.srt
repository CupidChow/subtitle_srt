7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,640
Wouldn't you secretly think

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,070
The world of North Korea belongs to your Min family.

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,480
Why did the father say this?

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,150
It was your Min family who pushed today's master to the throne.

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,510
after

12
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,520
Will there be no more bloodshed?

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,210
Why did my father say this to make me feel so frightened?

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,640
The King's Affairs

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,670
Father

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,530
I called him here.

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,710
I heard that the Ming envoy had a close relationship with my father.
Special request for father's help

18
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,590
I hope that my father will pay tribute to you.
Don't give a clear answer yet and delay the time

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,380
You still want to play the role of a good king?

20
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,520
Either I play I am the king

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,140
Who is this king for?

22
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,719
Do you know why your father wanted to be the king?

23
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:57,180
Because I fought on the battlefield for my father

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,620
Meet the people

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,760
I saw the people who had everything taken away from them and were starving to death.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,110
As a father, I want to create a brand new world for these people.

27
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,300
But you

28
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,230
But he is not a king who cares about the people.

29
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,600
Why did the father say this?

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,020
The Min family is a family of prime ministers for generations.

31
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,950
You were just chosen by them to be a volunteer.

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,690
Father

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,650
So your father will end your life with his own hands

34
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,380
Your father wanted to kill you, a piece of flesh and blood.

35
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,770
Fulfilling my original dream

36
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,100
Building this country

37
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,990
Father...

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,020
What do you hope your son will do?

39
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,190
Die

40
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,010
Father

41
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,350
If you don't have faith

42
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,930
Then they will join those who use the name of North Korea
But the person who changed into court robes stopped communicating.

43
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,800
In this way, your father will recognize you as a king.

44
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,280
The palace asked my father to meet the Ming envoy

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,780
This is good for the North Korean people.

46
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,110
A father would naturally do this.

47
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,040
The father was wrong

48
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,140
Thank you for your hard work today.

49
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,630
Zhongdian, go back and rest first.

50
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,380
Your Highness

51
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,980
Let's take a rest in the central hall today.

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
Empress of the Middle Temple

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,590
Tonight is the night when the Queen and His Highness sleep together.

54
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,050
I chose today

55
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,190
I'm afraid it's impossible today.

56
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,790
Empress of the Middle Temple

57
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,510
Go ask the Lord what he means.

58
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,830
yes

59
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,560
Speak

60
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,450
Tonight is the day for the two of us to share a room

61
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,450
I don't know what your Highness plans to do.

62
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,020
But what did the middle temple say?

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,780
No

64
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,970
Then follow the rules and go to the Central Palace

65
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,670
yes

66
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,040
I will be well prepared and leave no mistakes.

67
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,170
Oh yeah

68
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,670
[Episode 4]
Oh yeah

69
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,950
Right
[Episode 4]

70
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,030
Right

71
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,040
catch

72
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Caught

73
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,630
That's right.

74
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,510
Come here for a moment

75
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,160
Oh, this little guy is really strong.

76
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,630
That one was also caught

77
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,750
The one in the middle

78
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,460
Make sure to do your best

79
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,260
It's Zheng Shanggong

80
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,060
God bless you God bless you

81
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,870
Pray to the gods of heaven and earth here

82
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,750
God bless you God bless you

83
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,360
Pray to the gods of heaven and earth here

84
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,840
stop

85
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,560
Go change one now.

86
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
It's Zheng Shanggong

87
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,560
The time when the gates of heaven are wide open

88
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,590
[Zi Shi ~ Yin Shi 11 pm to 5 am the next day]
The time when the gates of heaven are wide open

89
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,750
The ugly time when the earth's gate is wide open
[Zi Shi ~ Yin Shi 11 pm to 5 am the next day]

90
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,320
The Yin hour when all things in the world begin to move
[Zi Shi ~ Yin Shi 11 pm to 5 am the next day]

91
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,420
It is the time when Yang Qi is at its peak
[Zi Shi ~ Yin Shi 11 pm to 5 am the next day]

92
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,180
It is the time when Yang Qi is at its peak

93
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,680
The Shang Gong on duty will give a signal every hour.

94
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,820
Your Highness only needs to follow the signal and have sex.

95
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,270
The queen cannot touch the dragon's body during intercourse

96
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,800
Can't make any sound

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,390
Remember the King and Queen's sexual intercourse

98
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,090
Just to give birth to offspring

99
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,730
Empress of the Middle Temple

100
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,860
I wish your Highness and the Queen a wonderful night together.

101
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,810
In this case, please ask your highness and your majesty to rest in the bedroom.

102
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,490
The queen cannot touch the dragon's body during intercourse

103
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,910
Can't make any sound

104
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,530
Your Highness

105
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,620
Please start having sex again

106
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,740
Get that chicken away

107
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,140
But palace rules...

108
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,360
If that's the palace rule, then keep it.

109
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,390
Your Highness

110
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,000
The Shang Gong on duty can be outside

111
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,940
exist

112
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,350
Come in

113
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,020
Your Highness

114
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,540
Soon after I ascended the throne

115
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,760
Both I and the Queen are unfamiliar with the rules of royal sex.

116
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,990
Can you sit aside

117
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,120
Give guidance

118
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,630
yes

119
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:21,280
In this case, please let your Highness and your Majesty follow my instructions and have sex.

120
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,260
Please lie down side by side with your Highness.

121
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,120
The Shang Gong on duty should leave first

122
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,730
Your Highness

123
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,720
What to do next

124
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,480
Your Highness

125
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,920
I ask you what to do

126
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,610
Your Highness, why is this so?

127
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,140
The central hall just needs to do as it says.

128
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,530
What does Your Highness want to teach me?

129
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,400
Obey?

130
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,450
I refuse

131
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,350
Your Highness

132
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,230
Please grant me death.

133
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,980
What to do about this

134
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,840
What should Zheng Shanggong do?

135
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,630
Zheng Shanggong

136
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,280
What should we do about this absurd thing?

137
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,490
Where is the Queen Mother?

138
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,230
It has been sent back to the Central Palace.

139
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,090
Keep your mouths shut

140
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,830
yes

141
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,030
There is also the Shang Gong on duty

142
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,160
Don't let any news of today's events leak out.

143
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,660
otherwise

144
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,040
Everyone is doomed to die

145
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,170
yes

146
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,750
Empress of the Middle Temple

147
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,640
The Servant Zheng Shanggong

148
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,410
The maid came in

149
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,260
-Jeong Sang-Gong
-Jeong Sang-Gong is like this...

150
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,170
Today is not suitable for roommates

151
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,870
So it's all because of the humid weather

152
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,130
The Queen Mother was in a state of distress.

153
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,750
It was because I failed to see through the Majesty's intentions and forced the decision today.

154
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,670
So I will ask my Lord to grant me death.

155
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,050
To resolve this matter

156
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,470
This is not your fault

157
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,560
anyway
It is an indisputable fact that the Queen Mother refused to have sex with him

158
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,370
Someone should be responsible for this.

159
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,200
This is between us as a couple.

160
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,340
You two are the king and queen

161
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,230
The two of you sleeping together is definitely not a private matter.

162
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,800
My lady must keep this in mind

163
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,220
OK

164
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,570
No need to say anything more

165
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,720
Today's incident should be treated as if it never happened

166
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,540
What

167
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,260
From now on, I will not go to the Central Palace again.

168
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,450
There is no need to trouble you to set a date for sleeping together.

169
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,670
absolute

170
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,120
Did you hear clearly?

171
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,040
Your Highness

172
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,500
But…

173
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,810
If you set a date for sex again

174
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,990
At that time, I will only ask you

175
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,320
Why do you want to meet me?

176
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,530
I feel like I screwed up this time, Master.
Sleeping with the Empress of the Middle Temple

177
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,970
All thanks to Zheng Shanggong

178
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,360
What is screwed up?

179
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
How can you talk nonsense like that?

180
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,290
The conflicts between His Majesty the Lord and His Majesty the Queen are all...

181
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,710
All from the conflict on the bed

182
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,510
What did you say

183
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,010
Doesn't Zheng Shanggong know yet?

184
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,450
Your Highness wants to completely control the Queen in bed

185
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,740
Ouch

186
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,000
Which woman in this world would

187
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,290
Willing to have sex in front of others

188
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,030
That's the Queen Mother

189
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,970
The Queen is also a woman.

190
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,000
The chicken too

191
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,650
Isn't it true that you have to bring a cock with you when you have sex?

192
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,040
Are you asking this knowingly?

193
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,620
If His Majesty is too excited and something goes wrong during sex

194
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,970
You need to take chicken blood from the chicken's neck to feed your highness

195
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,530
Isn't this reasonable?

196
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,270
Your Majesty, everyone on this side has fallen down

197
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,080
The maids had to gather over there to chop off the chicken's head.

198
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,810
So what you mean is...

199
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,740
Frankly speaking, the wind is coming.

200
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,430
Zheng Shanggong

201
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,590
If you can be free

202
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,350
According to body needs

203
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,450
Once you are overexcited, release

204
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,980
Then the wind may come

205
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,200
Therefore, it is more dangerous for Your Highness to have sex with the concubines in the harem.

206
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,190
Because there was no defense.

207
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,980
Why don't you shut up?

208
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,070
I am really sad. So sad.

209
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,060
coo coo

210
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,190
Cuckoo

211
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,380
To cut off the boiling hot heart

212
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,080
Only the sword is the best

213
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,640
Your Highness, you are thoughtful.

214
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,450
So you have to endure the boiling heat

215
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,440
You guys step down

216
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,990
Woman holding a sword

217
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,090
North Korean women should not hold swords

218
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,800
So the Korean women's behavior

219
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,140
We should stop at the nave.

220
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,350
So-called North Korean women

221
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,610
What should it be like?

222
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,800
After dressing up beautifully

223
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,450
Just follow and obey unconditionally

224
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,560
Is that so?

225
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,520
My intention is to ask the middle palace to learn to be smarter.

226
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,510
Did His Highness change once he gained power?

227
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,400
If we follow the passage of time, it will be what the middle palace calls change.

228
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,380
That's right, I have changed.

229
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,580
Your Highness, please do not confuse me with these difficult words.

230
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,570
Your Highness just doesn't want to share this power with anyone.

231
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,590
If the palace thinks so

232
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,440
yes

233
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,380
That's not wrong.

234
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,430
The Queen Mother Lichengjun asks for an audience

235
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,570
Empress of the Middle Temple

236
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,330
That Yuan Fan

237
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,630
[Yi Seong-gye's confidant]
That Yuan Fan

238
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,040
I heard that a large number of elite troops are gathering in the northeast.
[Yi Seong-gye's confidant]

239
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,020
I heard that a large number of elite troops are gathering in the northeast.

240

[The family copied the most elite private soldiers in the palace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye]
I heard that a large number of elite troops are gathering in the northeast.

241
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,600
Yuan Fan has already met them
[The family copied the most elite private soldiers in the palace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye]

242

Yuan Fan has already met them

243
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,640
And when the King Taishang was about to return to the palace after the farewell banquet for the envoys

244
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,660
[A farewell banquet for envoys]
And when the King Taishang was about to return to the palace after the farewell banquet for the envoys

245
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,280
Launch a surprise attack
[A farewell banquet for envoys]

246
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,270
Launch a surprise attack

247
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,610
The palace asked my father to meet the Ming envoy

248
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,910
This is good for the North Korean people.

249
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,880
A father would naturally do it.

250
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,130
He came to ask his father to go back.

251
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,040
yes

252
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,520
If the Supreme King returns to the northeast

253
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,450
[Taesang King Lee Seong-gye, father of Lee Bang-won]
If the Supreme King returns to the northeast

254
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,080
I will definitely recharge my batteries there.
[Taesang King Lee Seong-gye, father of Lee Bang-won]

255
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,630
I will definitely recharge my batteries there.

256
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,450
Then go all the way south and fight back to Kaifeng

257
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,030
At that time, the Jiabiechao who ambushed the Sanjun Mansion will meet them.

258
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,710
It seems that they will eventually rebel.

259
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,410
That's not just any chaos.

260
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,510
That was the rebellion caused by the Supreme King.

261
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,630
Plus if there is a king joining

262
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,900
[King Lee Bang-gwa, Lee Bang-won's second brother]
Plus if there is a king joining

263

If things go wrong, the country will no longer be a country.
[King Lee Bang-gwa, Lee Bang-won's second brother]

264
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,170
If things go wrong, the country will no longer be a country.

265
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,920
Has the king made up his mind?

266
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,510
It is said that he was seeking the king's approval.

267
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:56,860
I have presented the document signed by everyone.

268
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,300
[Signature with palm print]
I have presented the document signed by everyone.

It says…

272
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,500
The names of those who are willing to risk their lives to restore the king

273
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,270
This matter should be reported to the Lord

274
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,840
No

275
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,920
This is the information we found out privately.

276
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,870
Violated the imperial decree

277
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,950
At that time, not only the Queen Mother

278
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,460
Our entire Min family will be in trouble.

279
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,530
[Seung Eun Shang Gong Cai Ling filial piety to Gong Zhu Ying Shi]

280
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,510
If you like any of these, pick one.

281
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,700
This palace sends you

282
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,160
No

283
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,790
No need

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,450
This is pine pollen added to the gouache

285
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,540
But it's quite rare

286
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,770
To brighten your skin

287
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,090
It doesn't get any better than this

289
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,760
Madam, try that one again.

290
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,220
-This
- Try it on

291
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,480
The palace of Cheng'en Shanggong sent someone to

292
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,680
The Queen Mother Cheng En Shang Gong is here

293
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,350
Empress of the Middle Temple

294
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,060
You said you belonged to this palace.

295
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,980
yes

296
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,930
But…

297
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,520
Do you know the personal servants who go in and out of the palace owner's place?

298
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,220
Follow us quietly

299
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,560
Go and report

300
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,670

301
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,540
The Queen Mother and the Chengen Palace Consort requested an audience

302

Come in

303
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:47,390

307
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,360
I heard they were planning to
When the King returned to the palace after the farewell banquet for the envoys

308
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,670
Launch a surprise attack and ask the King to return to the northeast

309
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,310
What

310
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,320
If the King of Heaven raises his army again and fights back to Kaesong in the future

311
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,050
Those who were ambushed in the Three Military Offices
Those who secretly follow His Majesty will also join

312
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,130
But how did the palace know about this?

313
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,660
I found out through the people who followed Licheng Jun.

314
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,930
The Central Palace disobeyed the imperial edict again

315
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,620
I am here to protect His Majesty.

316
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,740
If this is false

317
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,120
I'm afraid the middle palace will have to give up this life.

318
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,440
Okay, but it's up to your Highness.

It has been handed over to His Majesty the King.

How could the palace be so heavily guarded...

322
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,730
The palace master has a personal servant who often comes in and out.

323
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,840

It doesn't look like a ring that someone of her status would have.

325

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,530
What will the servant ask next?

331
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,540
The most secretive palace lady must answer properly without any falsehood

332
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,260

I will buy time.

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,560
Not why?

340
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,620

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,960
His Highness the King

362
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:18,690
Did not agree to follow

363
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,040
[Agree, follow and act according to their will]
Did not agree to follow

364
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,270
[Agree, follow and act according to their will]

365
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,360
[King Yi Banggo (Yi Bangwon's second brother, King Jeongjong)]

366
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,700
Second Brother

367
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,310
Fifth brother is here

368
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,970
What does this mean?

369
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,990
Serve the Queen Mother well

370
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,110
What happened?

371
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,290
Even if it's offensive, please forgive me.

372
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,560
-Search for me
-yes

373
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,470
Your Highness, I have found it.

374
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,950
The father does not know about this

375
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,010
Brother, you know this is a rebellion.

376
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,920
Anyway, I didn't agree, so it's not treason.

377
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,370
Knowing and not reporting is also treason

378
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,940
If I report

379
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:42,020
I'm afraid my people will die one after another at the hands of the master.

380
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,660
Your people

381
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,270
Second brother just mentioned your people

382
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,990
Your Highness, this is enough.

383
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,740
His Highness the King

384
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,520
I said that Your Highness has done enough.

385
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,000
Second Brother

386
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,460
Please ask the middle hall to go to the upper hall

387
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,850
Invite the father from the Supreme Palace to the palace

388
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,770
The only person I can trust now is the Grand Master.

389
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,390
This trip is dangerous

390
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,870
Not only that

391
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,620
Even if the palace invited my father

392
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,590
I can't promise anything to the Queen Mother.

393
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,980
so

394
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,220
The Temple can refuse

395
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,800
I am willing to invite the Supreme King to come.

396
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,410
Thank you for your hard work.

397
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,690
Have a safe journey everyone.

398
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,020
Thank you very much, His Majesty the King

399
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,560
Father

400
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,950
Yuan Fan

401
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,890
Your Highness

402
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,850
Empress of the Middle Temple

403
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,570
His Highness has arrived.

404
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,670
yes

405
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,490
-Your Highness
-Your Highness

406
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,370
Come back to the palace, father.

407
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,430
Your Highness

408
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,540
How come you come here...

409
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,370
Escort the father back

410
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,880
Your Highness can make a decision.

411
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,630
good

412
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,920
What

413
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,820
What did you decide?

414
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,850
There can be no more bloodshed between us brothers, father.

415
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,150
so

416
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,520
You plan to abandon your father

417
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,380
Depend on Fangyuan

418
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,950
To save your life?

419
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,720
My loyal son is determined to prevent chaos from happening again.

420
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,780
Father

421
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,310
Asshole

422
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,600
For the Father

423
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,790
What is righteousness?

424
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,470
Why did my father shake the world so much?

425
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:59,010
My righteousness is hatred

426
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,520
I hate you so much

427
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,170
The grief of having to kill his son

428
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,410
It is the righteousness of the widower

429
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,900
If I go there, I can show my courtesy.

430
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,890
But I'm afraid my father won't come back.

431
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,150
But Your Highness needs to use this as leverage

432
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,980
You must try to win the heart of His Majesty the King.

433
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,180
Your Highness

434
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:36,170
Your Highness...

435
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:46,960
Your Highness...

436
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,450
Your Highness...

437
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,190
I, the monarch, have abdicated long ago.

438
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:06,060
I don't want to see you guys die for me again

439
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,210
Your Highness...

440
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:15,310
My Lord and I are brothers whose blood is thicker than water.

441
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:25,180
And my responsibility is to help the master govern Korea

442
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,610
I hope you guys can change your mind.

443
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,920
Take care of your life

444
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,070
Present it

445
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,070
This is a wine mixed with horse blood.

446
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,560
I will do my best

447
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:16,900
Assisting the King of Korea
Build this land on a solid foundation

448
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,830
Your Highness

449
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,210
Your Majesty and I

450
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,540
Now we have sworn a blood oath

451
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,330
[Blood oath
The act of swearing an oath of loyalty by blood of an animal]
Now we have sworn a blood oath

452
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:49,380
[Blood oath
The act of swearing an oath of loyalty by blood of an animal]

453
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,360
You may think it is not worth it for the king to abdicate.

454
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,130
But that's just a high-sounding title

455
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,210
What did you say

456
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,720
We have always been loyal to His Majesty the King

457
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,220
Put it on

458
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,480
You don't have to look at each other's eyes, just make your own decision.

459
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,350
If anyone wishes to be like the King

460
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,770
Make a blood alliance with me

461
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,630
Then he came forward to drink a cup of blood wine

462
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,630
[Kaegyeong Shouchang Palace]

463
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,730
The palace master who was supposed to serve the monarch participated in the rebellion

464
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,530
This matter cannot be forgiven lightly

465
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,520
good

466
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,890
It is necessary to report as soon as possible.

467
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,370
-Yes, I understand.
-quick

468
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,080
I said

469
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,420
You all must have heard of it.

470
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,550
The palace master who was supposed to serve the monarch participated in the rebellion

471
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,980
This matter cannot be forgiven lightly

472
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,690
Better hurry up and file a petition.

473
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,410
-good
- Go and file a petition now.

474
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,950
If the king is carried away by his personal emotions

475
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,450
To protect the life of this harem

476
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,580
By then, the country will no longer exist.

477
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,050
good

478
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,890
The Confucian scholars must go and dissuade His Highness

479
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,810
Come come come

480
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,390
Have you heard

481
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,830
Confucian scholars must not sit idly by

482
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,530
The king should be dissuaded

483
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,710
Cheng'en Shanggong

484
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,230
Cheng'en Shang Gong is not allowed to enter

485
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:13,300
I have obtained permission from the Imperial Court Supervisor.

486
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,080
Let me in

487
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:20,160
I really didn't know that my personal servant had ever passed on such a secret letter.

488
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,070
Why would I participate in the rebellion?

489
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,240
I would like to see His Majesty the Lord

490
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,700
But His Highness did not summon me at all

491
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,170
No matter how I ask to see His Highness

492
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,080
Your Highness will not agree

493
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:42,750
Personal servants implicated in rebellion
The Palace Master is her master.

494
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,520
Naturally, I can't see His Majesty.

495
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,680
How His Majesty loves His Majesty

496
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:58,810
It is also impossible to reject the ministers' petitions.

497
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,820
Those who want to kill me

498
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,400
Those people always live and die for principles

499
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,250
What should this palace do?

500
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,340
What should I do?

501
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:28,210
Now, who can save the Palace Master?

502
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,610
Only one person

503
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,650
The Queen Mother

504
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,610
Empress of the Middle Temple

505
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,470
The Queen Mother in charge of all the female officials

506
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:47,550
If the palace rules are followed, the Queen Mother will ask His Highness to report this matter.
Hand it over to the nave for disposal

507
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:51,550
Then we can wait for the ministers to calm down.
Keep a low profile

508
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:57,490
At least you can save your life then.

509
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,440
What if I don't want to?

510
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,850
Your Majesty should consider Prince

511
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,960
If the Palace Master makes a mistake

512
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,740
Who will do their best to raise the little prince?

513
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,820
His Highness knows that he wants to see you.

514
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,270
This is a collective petition submitted by all the Confucian scholars of Sungkyunkwan

515
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,800
I don't need to see to know
You want me to sentence the Palace Master to death?

516
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,470
In the view of Zhishenshi

517
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:58,880
Is it reasonable to say that the palace master participated in the rebellion?

518
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,480
The palace owner is the concubine who serves the king.

519
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,600
The person sent secretly was implicated in treason

520
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,570
Naturally, there is no accountability

521
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,840
If the palace master died

522
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,920
People will definitely talk about this.

523
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:44,180
This palace is jealous.
Took her life

524
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,830
Empress of the Middle Temple

525
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:53,100
But am I really not jealous at all?

526
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,100
I'm not sure about this.

527
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:08,150
Does the palace master's favor make the queen sad?

528
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,680
In the past

529
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,810
When His Highness looked at me,

530
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,680
I looked at that look

531
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,260
I was thinking

532
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:34,050
Ah, this person is fascinated by me at this moment

533
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:41,020
That feeling is so sweet and warm

534
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,150
It makes me proud

535
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,360
His Highness tiptoed

536
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,440
Carefully

537
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,280
When I touch my palace

538
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,790
However

539
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,210
Now that all

540
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,510
They no longer belong to this palace.

541
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,890
It's cool outside

542
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,910
My lady, it's time to go back to the palace.

543
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:34,390
His Highness ascended the throne
Countless lives were sacrificed

544
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:40,320
Therefore, the process of consolidating the throne must be extremely cautious.

545
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,110
It was because he had anticipated a battle with His Majesty the Supreme King.

546
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:47,110
Only His Highness can gain His Majesty's loyalty.

547
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:51,150
The king who acted in this way
If you want to protect the harem involved in the rebellion

548
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,990
How will the officials evaluate

549
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,480
If personal feelings are mixed in strengthening internal unity

550
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,400
He will become a king who has lost his principles

551
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,300
Your Highness must remember that if a king loses his principles, his authority will be damaged.

552
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:10,070
If the strengthening of the royal power that His Majesty desperately desires is damaged,

553
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,210
It will only become more and more distant

554
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,120
so

555
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,310
In the end, my dear, you still want me to sentence the palace master to death.

556
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:23,650
Your Highness, your minister's intention is to demonstrate the majesty of the king.

557
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,070
Go and report

558
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,360
quick

559
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,430
Empress of the Middle Temple

560
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,560
Filial Piety Palace Master Requests to See You

561
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,890
His Highness has ordered the Palace Master not to leave the palace.

562
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,690
Let her go back

563
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:24,250
Please save my life, Madam Queen.

564
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:27,010
It's my fault.

565
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,580
Please save the Queen Mother

566
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,050
Your Highness

567
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,880
Your Highness, please spare my life.

568
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,610
Your Highness, please spare my life, Your Highness

569
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:43,670
Get up

570
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,750
I have no idea about this matter, Your Highness.

571
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,140
-Your Highness
-The Empress of the Middle Temple

572
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,050
His Majesty has arrived

573
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,830
Your Highness

574
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,550
The father-in-law, Yeoheungbuwon, was the chief secretary of Sungkyunkwan

575
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,080
Many students are under his command

576
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,620
Therefore, now Sungkyunkwan
Many Confucian scholars also admired Lixingbuyuan

577
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,670
More than just Sungkyunkwan

578
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:21,980
The court is full of people who follow Yeoheungbuwon-gun

579
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:27,090
What does your Highness mean by this?

580
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:30,470
So many stacks of sparse

581
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,440
I had to take her life in the end.

582
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,880
No matter what I, the king, think

583
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,020
Both were occupied by the middle hall and the Min family of the middle hall.

584
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,370
And the powerful officials that the Min family could mobilize pushed forward

585
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,640
Even the life and death of a concubine cannot be decided by herself

586
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,690
Am I still a king?

587
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,760
Filial Piety Master, please come in

588
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,440
No one can comfort me like she does.

589
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,930
I don't want to lose her

590
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,610
so

591
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,570
Please spare Yingshi's life.

592
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,330
Now I can save her

593
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,480
Only the central hall

594
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,790
Only this time

595
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,040
Please agree to my request.

596
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,230
ask

597
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,360
Not a command

598
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,180
A request?

599
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:58,080
Your Highness, it is better to say that it is because Your Highness loves Yingshi

600
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,920
Then you can kneel before me and beg for mercy

601
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,830
Maybe I will spare her life.

602
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,050
You let me, the ruler of a country, beg for mercy

603
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,790
Your Highness

604
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,510
["Yuan Jing"]

605
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,440
[Preview of the next episode]

606
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,970
If we can weaken the power of the Min family...

607
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,290
She actually wants to take a harem

608
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,090
No

609
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:24,910
This person

610
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:28,970
The Lord and the Queen finally started fighting

611
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,510
Who leaked the news to the Central Palace?

612
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:34,370
Now it's time for us to go our own way

613
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:37,720
Is the core of the palace the central palace?

614
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,050
Ambush

615
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,490
This Korea was built by me.

616
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,590
The Queen must be a Korean woman

617
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,480
Do you have the confidence to change this king?
