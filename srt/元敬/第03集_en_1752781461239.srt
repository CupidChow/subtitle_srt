00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,710
The spy organization and the financial resources to support it

176
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,560
This is the strength of our Min family

177
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,360
Perhaps it would be better to keep it a secret from the Master for now.

178
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,860
good

179
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,180
Now doesn't seem to be the time

180
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,630
It seems to me that the Queen Mother
Let His Majesty be so lonely

181
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,530
I will comfort Your Highness.

182
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,380
yes

183
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,660
You are the only one left to me

184
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,040
I will guard your Highness.

185
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,500
You all should back off.

186
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,080
It's the queen

187
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,540
Now there's no one outside.

188
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,180
Your Highness, you can release yourself and I will guard you.

189
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,360
Although there have been many disturbances recently

190
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,780
But when the King offered the qin-dak to the Hyeam Temple

191
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,490
[Father of King Lee Seong-gye and Lee Bang-won]
But when the King offered the qin-dak to the Hyeam Temple

192
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:37,920
But when the King offered the qin-dak to the Hyeam Temple

193
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,680
I have already prayed for the future of this dynasty

194
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,990
yes

195
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,000
Sentence

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,140
[Official position in charge of criminal prosecution and prison]
Sentence

197
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,090
Minister in
[Official position in charge of criminal prosecution and prison]

198
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,290
I heard rumors that something shameful happened at Higanji Temple.
[Official position in charge of criminal prosecution and prison]

199
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,330
I heard rumors that something shameful happened at Higanji Temple.

200
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,510
I order you to find the mastermind of the rumor and punish him severely.

201
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,720
It's your highness.

202
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,860
Know about

203
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,590
[The secretary who conveyed the imperial edict]
Know about

204
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,760
Minister in
[The secretary who conveyed the imperial edict]

205
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,200
[The secretary who conveyed the imperial edict]

206
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,560
The Middle Temple believed in bizarre rumors

207
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,940
Not only did it bother the father who was trying to offer the zither to the Buddha,

208
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,510
It also ruined the rare chance for reconciliation between me and my father.

209
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,490
This is obviously disrespectful.

210
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,590
Therefore

211
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,560
I order you to take charge of the proposed process of deposing the concubine.

212
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,430
[Deposed Queen]
I order you to take charge of the proposed process of deposing the concubine.

213
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,900
[Deposed Queen]

214
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,750
Your Highness

215
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,720
The Empress's Servant Xu Shanggong

216
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
The maid came in

217
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,020
The slaves are terrified

218
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,160
I heard that His Majesty summoned the Lord to

219
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,130
Order him to discuss the process of deposing a concubine

220
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,290
Empress of the Middle Temple

221
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,370
His Highness is just worried that the incident at Higan Temple earlier would make the Empress angry.

222
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,100
This is why we are preparing to deliberately denigrate

223
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,880
No need to make a fuss

224
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,140
Empress of the Middle Temple

225
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,470
Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun ask for an audience

226
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,550
Empress of the Middle Temple

227
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,790
Xu Shanggong

228
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,600
What is going on?

229
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,830
How could His Highness depose the concubine?

230
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,570
[Chengen Shanggong Ringtone]
How could His Highness depose the concubine?

231
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,510
That is to say
[Chengen Shanggong Ringtone]

232
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,310
That is to say

233
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,910
Someone is coming to the palace

234
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,070
Yeah

235
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,830
They are the younger brothers of the empress.

236
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,190
Then I'll stay here.

237
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,700
Wait until you see the queen before you leave

238
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,870
If the Lord is not crazy

239
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,980
Why would you mention the deposed concubine?

240
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,560
Licheng Jun, be careful with your words

241
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,760
Be careful with your words

242
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,560
Your Majesty, how should I be careful with my words?

243
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,180
If it weren't for the Queen
The master died under that hammer a long time ago.

244
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,330
But he wants to depose his concubine

245
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,490
That's the father killing his son.

246
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,920
Your Highness does this
Isn't it just to prevent the news from spreading?

247
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,140
How can this be stopped?

248
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,260
Besides, the only way to stop it is to depose the concubine.

249
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,530
The Central Palace
If it goes against the wishes of His Highness and his father, you must abandon it.

250
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,750
Your Highness wants to show your filial piety, right?

251
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,300
It's like killing two birds with one stone.

252
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,930
Your Highness needs a title to succeed the throne.

253
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,740
Isn't it ridiculous?

254
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,200
Don't even think about how we treated him.

255
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,420
Why don't you shut up?

256
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,160
My brothers are terrified

257
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,770
It's strange

258
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,560
Suppose that day was tragic.

259
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,270
The Lord really died tragically under the hammer of the Supreme King

260
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,990
The heir to the throne should be the eldest prince's son.

261
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,460
But

262
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,300
How could the Supreme King want to let my son Ti'er succeed to the throne?
And wield the hammer

263
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,050
That being said…

264
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,170
The lady means someone is helping

265
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,940
There must be a powerful force in the palace to help

266
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,900
I heard that there are also people in the Three Military Offices who have their own family

267
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,970
The lady is referring to them.

268
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,700
A person who can use these home copies

269
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,060
So

270
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,110
king

271
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,400
The king is brave and good at fighting
I fought on the battlefield with my father.

272
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,010
[King Yi Banggo (Jungjong, the second brother of Yi Bangwon)]
The king is brave and good at fighting
I fought on the battlefield with my father.

273
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,060
Among the family copies of the Three Military Office
[King Yi Banggo (Jungjong, the second brother of Yi Bangwon)]

274
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,290
Among the family copies of the Three Military Office

275
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,660
Aren't there still many soldiers following His Majesty the King?

276
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,030
So

277
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,920
The King was also involved in the incident at Higan Temple

278
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,360
Shhh

279
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,490
Madam, this is what you mean

280
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,600
This palace is just guessing

281
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,890
only

282
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,380
If the Queen can already guess this

283
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,580
Wouldn't the Lord know?

284
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,510
My Lord, you don't want to think so.

285
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,610
After all, this means that we will have to raise the knife against our own brothers again.

286
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,530
Empress of the Middle Temple

287
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,380
So

288
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,240
My brother remembered something.

289
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,850
I heard someone
Meeting with Jia Biechao in the Three Military Offices alone

290
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,750
This person has burn marks on his face.

291
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,110
It should be Yuan Fan

292
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,370
[Yi Seong-gye's confidant]
It should be Yuan Fan

293
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,630
[Yi Seong-gye's confidant]

294
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,540
Go find him in secret and don't let the news leak out.

295
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,400
Find out who he's been in contact with.

296
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,310
Empress of the Middle Temple

297
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,690
Cheng En Shang Gong asked for an audience

298
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,280
The Queen's Servant Ringtone

299
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,320
I came here because I was worried.

300
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,160
I will never leave this palace

301
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,700
You don't have to worry about it.

302
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,130
yes

303
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,030
When the servant reported the matter of the deposed concubine
The queen was not moved at all

304
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,290
But what can I say

305
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,820
This servant has also served the Empress Dowager.

306
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,200
You should always do your duty

307
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,840
Your Highness, please don't be in such a hurry to leave.

308
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,520
May I ask you to report this to your Highness?

309
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,020
I am only going to pray for the souls of my brothers.

310
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,750
No need to report

311
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,080
The Grand King is also waiting for His Royal Highness

312
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,000
Your Highness goes out like this...

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,870
Nothing

314
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,410
Don't come out.

315
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,130
I will serve you again in the future.

316
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,350
It's not my own idea.

317
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,090
Has this happened to me?

318
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,510
Blame you

319
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,180
Although the queen said...

320
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,530
But he never got close to his servants.

321
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,320
Please allow me to serve you as closely as before.

322
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,980
Empress of the Middle Temple

323
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,330
You have already received the favor

324
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,810
No longer my personal maid Cai Ling

325
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,050
Niangniang

326
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,740
The slave is just a ringtone

327
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:30,980
The ringing bell that had served the queen for many years in the residence of Chudong

328
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,010
[Chuldong Qianseong, the residence of Yi Bang-won before he ascended the throne]
The ringing bell that had served the queen for many years in the residence of Chudong

329
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,070
The ringing bell that had served the queen for many years in the residence of Chudong

330
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,180
Even if I dedicate my body to the Lord

331
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,070
My heart still belongs to the queen.

332
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,860
The servant has not changed

333
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,860
you…

334
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,480
It's changed

335
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,900
Now, His Majesty wants to discuss the matter of deposing the concubine.

336
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,450
There is also a lot of discussion among the people

337
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,100
[The filial palace lady Yeong-sil]
There is also a lot of discussion among the people

338
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,110
[The filial palace lady Yeong-sil]

339
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,890
Everyone says that His Highness is filial.
Abandoning the Wife of the Poor
[The filial palace lady Yeong-sil]

340
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,510
Everyone says that His Highness is filial.
Abandoning the Wife of the Poor

341
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,590
Abandoning the Wife

342
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,820
This will never happen.

343
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,730
I know your Highness well.

344
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,900
Unpredictable

345
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,280
Who would have thought that the Queen would rest here today?

346
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,550
I want to erase the central palace from the master's heart

347
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,960
But I don't know what to do

348
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,760
My lady, don't worry, just wait quietly.

Why did His Highness want the Queen?
[Title of the prince during the reign of Prince Jeongan Lee Bang-won]

352
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,670
Why did His Highness want the Queen?

353
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,830
Naturally because of freedom

354
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,180
Men will eventually abandon those women who can't resist

355
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,560
As long as this is good for our little prince

356
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,490
How's the safflower rouge you mentioned last time?

357
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,520
You can buy it soon

358
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,550
Oh, my lady, she is so beautiful even without dressing up

359
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,850
If I put on that expensive rouge

360
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,590
She must be like Yang Guifei reincarnated.

361
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,410
I want to give birth to a prince

I must give birth to a prince

364
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,950
I have to give birth to a prince while I am still young and beautiful.

365
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,180
I have to keep on giving birth

366
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,290
Would you like to help me?

367
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,080
Cheng En Shang Gong needs to endure

368
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,300
good

369
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,260
I will endure it

370
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,830
In this way, the Yang energy will gather in the lower abdomen.

371
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,250

You can stay for a long time

374
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,970
This makes it very likely that you will get pregnant.

It's Jin Shanggong

376
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,710
Why is Your Highness here?

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,840

Your Highness, don't you feel wronged?

390
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,080
The throne was taken away by Fangyuan

391
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,960
Your subordinates will definitely find it back for Your Highness.

392
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,040

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,450

If the sun is scorching

403
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,440
I have to hide in the shade temporarily

404
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,390
I am just worried whether the shade of the tree will last forever.

405
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,490
Are you worried that I will be deposed?

406
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,960

After finishing a book, you will receive a reward.

Yeah

418
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,900
My father also praised me and gave me food.

419
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,470
I also gradually find reading interesting.

420
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,780

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,700
well done

You don't have to follow me anymore. Just stay here.

Earlier, when the incident at Higanji Temple occurred

429
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,270
I once asked the middle temple how he knew there was a hammer in the box.

430
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,470
At that time, the middle temple replied that it was a coincidence.

431
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:44,080
In the past, when the private soldiers were reformed
I clearly told you not to keep spies privately.

432
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:52,610
But the Queen Mother has been hiding the fact that she has been raising spies.

433
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,930
So, is this the reason why His Highness mentioned the deposed concubine?

434
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,340
I have only been on the throne for a short time and my regime is still unstable

435
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,640
The Central Palace and the Min family of the Central Palace disobeyed the imperial decree

436
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,970
How can I tolerate such discussions in the court?

437
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,040
It is because of this that we can help our master escape from trouble.

438
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Please stop now, Central Palace.

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,540

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:24,810
Can Your Highness be so sure of distinguishing between friend and foe in the court?

442
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,230
The bloody storm still remains everywhere

443
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,270
Your Highness, since you have experienced it, you will naturally know

Do you have confidence?

448
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,910
Can quietly identify all these people

449
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,320
What does the palace want to say?

450
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,320
Your Highness, please think about it.

451
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,250

453
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,410
How could my father act like this without any preparation?

454
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,390

Your Highness had already guessed it.

458
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,670
But deliberately avoid

459
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,770
So the middle hall is to call me
Do you regard your father and second brother as enemies?

460
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:29,210
I want Your Highness to calm down and see the reality clearly.

461
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,150
Wait until His Highness is sober and calm enough

462
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,330
It won't be too late for me to clear out the spies.

463
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,440
Does the Central Palace want to completely ignore me?

464
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,250
I said I would face it myself.

465
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,890
I said I would solve it myself.

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,610
I am the ruler of a country.

467
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,500

Your Highness

469
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,310
If the Queen really thinks I am the ruler of a country
So I stopped there

00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,990
If you dare to mention His Majesty the King again

471
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,450
I will never let you off easily.

472
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,170
Hearing that His Highness is on a hunger strike, His Highness is very worried.

525
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,880
[From the palace of the king to the palace of the secret palace, the palace lady who serves Li Fangguo (the king) personally]
You asked me to deliver this item to the Upper King's Palace to the Mishan Palace

526
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,910
good
[From the palace of the king to the palace of the secret palace, the palace lady who serves Li Fangguo (the king) personally]

527
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,350
good

528
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,610
What is this

529
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,730
You don't need to know this...

530
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:52,530
The King has sent messages many times to find His Highness.

531
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,870
World Trouble

532
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,840
His Majesty is at peace.

533
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,110
The king is worried

534
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,900
You don't know yet

535
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,830
The matter that troubles this king has not yet been exposed.

536
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,440
What is this

537
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,770
The servant is worried

538
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,010
So I cooked some porridge and brought it to

539
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,750
Porridge

540
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,500
I remember the time in the Chudong Cave.

541
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,080
The Queen Mother relies on black sesame porridge to regulate her spleen and stomach
Improves appetite

542
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,630
Oh, Chengen Shanggong is really sensible

543
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,370
Empress of the Middle Temple

544
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,520
Cheng En Shang Gong brought some black sesame porridge

545
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,340
Want to announce?

546
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,860
Xuan

547
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,640
This servant belongs to the Empress Central Palace.

548
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,190
in this way

549
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,390
Would you like to hear the Lord's thoughts?

550
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,900
Tell me

551
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,060
Would you like

552
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:07,770
So, can this servant serve the Queen closely?

553
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,340
good

554
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,370
The slave is willing

555
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,920
His Highness will be here tonight

556
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,450
The reason why His Highness came to see Lady Chengen is because...

557
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,280
I know

558
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,940
His Majesty has arrived

559
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,850
No need

560
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,190
Has Lichengjun visited the Central Palace recently?

561
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,170
yes

562
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,220
Lijiang Jun Licheng Jun

563
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,570
Both of you have been there

564
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,430
What did they talk about?

565
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,710
It seems that they talked about His Majesty the King.

566
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,910
How to say

567
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,250
I didn't hear it clearly.

568
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,100
After all, their voices were very low when they talked in private.

569
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,310
About the King
You need to tell me everything.

570
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,780
yes

571
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,760
That's it.

572
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,100
If you are as careless and impatient as before
I'm afraid it will ruin things.

573
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,990
What to do on the bed
Just hand it over to His Majesty.

574
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:29,120
I heard that the Lord stayed at Cheng'en Shanggong's place tonight.

575
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,290
Where is the Lord staying?

576
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,270
As the Queen Mother, I must know this.

577
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,510
The Queen taught me

578
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,530
It's late at night

579
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,910
Madam, why don't you take a rest first...

580
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,460
I know.

581
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,130
Go down

582
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,500
yes

583
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,350
don't want

584
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,510
Asshole

585
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,690
You'll never make it.

586
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,600
I'm going to kill you.

587
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,760
Let everything that is distorted return to its original state

588
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,740
Your Highness

589
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,100
Your Highness

590
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,670
Your Highness

591
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,250
Your Highness

592
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,870
Your Highness, please relax and lie down comfortably.

593
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,120
Aren't you sleeping?

594
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,550
Slave...

595
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,260
Rather than falling asleep facing His Majesty's back

596
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,980
Why not use the dim moonlight?

597
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,470
Sit here

598
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:15,000
Staring at His Majesty's face all night

599
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,080
You were a servant in the palace.

600
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,280
Later she entered the palace and became a personal maid

601
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
yes

602
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,390
Later, Cheng Le En became Cheng En Shang Gong

603
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,120
yes

604
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,180
You are so ridiculous that you ask me to come to your place twice a month

605
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,720
So you get a lot of things, right?

606
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:59,350
This servant has not yet won the favor of His Highness.

607
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,090
You can't have one foot in the nave.

608
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:23,180
One foot is here.

609
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:23,850
Your Highness

610
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:27,380
You can't make your own decisions
Just send the messages you want to send

611
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,900
It is absolutely forbidden to know without reporting

612
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,610
Everything needs to be reported to me for decision.

613
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:34,430
Do you understand?

614
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,880
Why not answer?

615
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,010
If the slave agrees

616
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,730
Your Highness, would you like to believe

617
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,440
Everyone still thought that I was still a member of the imperial palace.

618
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,550
I believe

619
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,160
The Widow

620
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,070
Willing to believe

621
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:55,960
If the slave does this

622
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,880
What will His Highness promise me?

623
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,460
I will give myself to you

624
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,410
Put yourself...

625
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,400
Deliver to you

626
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,030
All right

627
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,870
My Lord, you are serving me well.

628
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,970
yes

629
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,780
My Lord, have you ever been unhappy?

630
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,400
There was no sign of

631
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,420
The Lord sleeps peacefully.

632
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,800
Quite capable

633
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,920
You actually filled the vacancy in this palace.

634
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,210
I dare not

635
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:38,340
The slaves are just following orders.

636
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,800
You go down

637
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,040
It seems that the opportunity has come for the Queen Mother

638
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,050
The second brother is referring to the Ming envoy

639
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,160
yes

640
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,190
It turns out that the queen knows all

641
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,680
If the Ming envoys come to look for the Supreme King

642
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,570
It would be difficult to discuss the matter of deposing the concubine.

643
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,090
-yes
-yes

644
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,000
Go to the Lord and make up your mind.

645
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,750
yes

646
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,860
only

647
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,440
Being too aggressive is probably not a good idea.

648
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,740
The Queen Mother

649
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,800
Just don't know

650
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,770
Can the King be released from the palace?

651
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,260
The movement in the northeast is unusual.

652
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,950
Ask Panzhu to listen carefully to the news

653
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,990
The Queen Mother

654
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,540
this...

655
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,240
this...

656
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,710
Should I hand it over to His Majesty the King?

657
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,930
good

658
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,610
besides

659
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,080
this...

660
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,690
What is this

661
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,840
A small gift

662
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,310
No need

663
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,740
To Mishan Palace

664
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,980
His Majesty has arrived

665
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,830
Your Highness

666
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:47,190
I heard that the Ming envoys were about to arrive in Kaifeng.

667
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,930
How are the preparations for hosting the Ming envoys going?

668
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:55,400
The palace conventions have always been prepared by the Empress

669
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,690
But now they are still discussing the matter of deposing the concubine.

670
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,250
It is to welcome the governor to say that preparations are complete.

671
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,030
[A temporary organization established by the Welcoming Supervisor to entertain Ming envoys]
It is to welcome the governor to say that preparations are complete.

672
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,160
I am also worried that something might go wrong.
[A temporary organization established by the Welcoming Supervisor to entertain Ming envoys]

673
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,470
I am also worried that something might go wrong.

674
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:18,800
The Ming envoy expressed his wish to personally meet the Supreme King
Understand the situation clearly

675
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,780
They said they wanted to see the Supreme King to find out the situation.

676
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,830
Its real purpose is to pay tribute.

677
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,190
At present, Zhu Yunwen and Zhu Di are fighting fiercely.
The most needed thing is a war horse

678
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:30,370
[Zhu Di (Emperor Yongle) was defeated by his nephew Zhu Yunwen (Emperor Jianwen) during the Jingnan Campaign
The war for the Ming throne]
At present, Zhu Yunwen and Zhu Di are fighting fiercely.
The most needed thing is a war horse

679
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,830
But if we pay tribute to Zhu Yunwen directly,

680
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:33,420
But if we pay tribute to Zhu Yunwen directly,

681
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,530
Zhu Di will hold the power one day.

682
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,520
I must make plans early

683
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:45,900
I think we should delay time to see the war situation clearly.

684
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,290
Only His Majesty the Supreme King can do this.

685
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:51,940
Hearing that the envoys came

686
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,450
When His Majesty the Supreme King was in the northeast

687
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,010
He has a close relationship with His Royal Highness the Supreme King.

688
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,530
But

689
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,550
Is His Royal Highness willing to come forward?

690
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,670
Your Highness, why don't you order the Highness to come forward?

691
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,300
Long before His Highness ascended the throne

692
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:14,870
The Queen has been mediating between His Highness and the Supreme King.

693
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,120
Your Highness wants me to go and see my father in person.

694
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,250
Convince your father?

695
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,290
What does the Central Palace want?

696
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,920
I am willing to go

697
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:38,860
only

698
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,830
I grant you the title of the middle palace

699
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,900
Mr. Supervisor

700
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,010
The matter of abolishing the concubine was stopped

701
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,540
We have to set a date for the bedtime

702
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,890
The Queen's menstruation has stopped for eleven days.

703
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,100
[Monthly period refers to menstruation]
The Queen's menstruation has stopped for eleven days.

704
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,500
But tomorrow is the day of Si
[Monthly period refers to menstruation]

705
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,020
But tomorrow is the day of Si

706
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,510
It is not good on Si day, nor on Yin day.

707
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,300
The first and the thirty-fifth day of the lunar month are all unacceptable

708
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,430
So when can we

709
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,320
Why not wait until next month...

710
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,570
Can't wait till then

711
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:32,250
This official observes the celestial phenomena

712
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,980
Worried about thunderstorms in the near future

713
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,070
snort

714
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:40,120
How about today?

715
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,250
Today?

716
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,980
Si and Yin days are not good.

717
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,140
The first thirty ten...

718
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,000
Not fifteen either.

719
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,620
No thunderstorm either.

720
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,520
Why did Zheng Shanggong suddenly

721
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,620
There is still a little mist...

722
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,020
That's it.

723
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,970
Let's set it today

724
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,830
How can there be such a rule?

725
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:04,390
Rules are based on needs

726
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,910
You stay here

727
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:59,360
I heard that the chief envoy of this mission is my father's close friend.
Many years of friendship

728
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,530
Reuniting with a Lost Friend
I think it can also relieve the fatigue in my heart...

729
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:04,820
Nonsense

730
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,850
The envoy will ask us to pay tribute of 10,000 fine horses.

731
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:13,850
But it takes some time to prepare properly.

732
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,490
Please give me some advice, my father.

733
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:25,080
You plan to observe the situation of the Jingnan Campaign

734
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,550
While dealing with the Ming Dynasty's request for tribute

735
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:33,390
So I want to ask you to buy some time

736
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:39,370
If this is the case, why doesn't the Lord come forward?

737
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,560
And it was the central palace again.

738
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,980
After all, the incident at Higan Temple came first.

739
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,540
The Lord may feel a little embarrassed to meet his father

740
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,160
besides

741
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,280
besides

742
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,380
My Lord, I feel that since I was in the palace
He had a close relationship with his father.

743
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,390
That was the royal palace period.

744
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:03,020
Now he is on the throne

745
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,790
There are things a king should do

746
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:10,200
There are things that the nave should do

747
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,590
how

748
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:20,110
Are you going to use the guise of Dawn People again?
Teach me a lesson

749
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,040
No Father...

750
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,700
Didn't you secretly think

751
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,970
The world of North Korea belongs to your Min family.

752
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,410
Why did the father say this?

753
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:39,350
It was your Min family who pushed today's master to the throne.

754
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,510
Father

755
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:48,590
The master originally listened to you in everything.

756
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,250
Only in the future

757
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,970
Will there be no more blood?

758
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,740
Why did my father say this to make me feel so frightened?

759
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,120
The King's Affairs

760
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,150
Father

761
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,090
I called him here.

762
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,620
What does the father want his son to do?

763
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,740
Die

764
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,640
Father

765
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,440
[Preview of the next episode]

766
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,280
The Shang Gong on duty will give a signal every hour.

767
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,830
According to the signal...

768
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,000
The central hall just needs to do as it says.

769
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,100
Just follow and obey unconditionally?

770
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,450
My intention is to ask the middle palace to learn to be smarter.

771
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,030
It seems that they will eventually rebel.

772
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:20,650
The grief of having to kill his son
It is the righteousness of the widower

773
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,780
Second Brother

774
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,050
Spare her life.

775
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:23,900
Only the nave.

776
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,210
Your Highness, please kneel before me.
Please spare her life.
