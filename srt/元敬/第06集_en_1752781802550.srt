Who is delivering the message to the middle hall?

16
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,098
This is what His Highness had told me to do.

17
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:20,748
How do you plan to report?

18
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:24,618
The servant did not...

19
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:27,678
See anything special?

20
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:32,058
But if you dare to report other matters to the master

21
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:35,808
I will drive you out of the palace.

22
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:37,788

The Queen Mother

24
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,468
I understand why my father wants to host a banquet for the Lord this time.

25
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:10,988
Fortunately, the Lord agreed to my request.

26
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:16,158
But at times like this, we must be more careful.

27
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,808
The eyes of the court looking at our Min family have become more and more sharp.

28
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:23,588
yes

29
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,638

32
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:36,638
Meeting with the spies in private is too dangerous

33
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:43,098
Your Majesty should know that the Lord is not an ordinary person

34
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:16,288
Your Highness

35
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,808
I was not able to see the father-in-law last time.

36
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:21,498
He hurriedly took the Queen back to the palace

37
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,948
I always feel guilty

38
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:25,378
I dare not be Your Highness

39
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:29,018
It is truly a great favor that His Highness can come to visit us personally.

40
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,558
Come in quickly please

41
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:46,208
Wouldn't it be great if we all got together?

42
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,278
Your Highness, I wonder if these dishes suit your taste.

43
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:51,528
Very good taste

44
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,258
I'm here to pour a glass of wine for the father-in-law.

45
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:54,448
Please give me some wine, Your Highness

46
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:55,958
Long time no see

47
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,308
This wine is so sweet

48
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:02,958
Hey, who is this?

49
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:10,128
Oh give me

50
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,228
I'd like to offer a toast to His Highness.

51
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:17,908
These dishes are so delicious. Oh, that's natural.

52
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:20,168
Really delicious

53
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:24,478
I have heard that Your Highness is going to welcome the daughter of Sungkyunkwan Le Zheng Quanhong into the harem.

54

[Sungkyunkwan Music Master, a fourth-rank official in Goryeo and Joseon who studied music theoretically]

56
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,548

58
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:35,048

[Liquor and soju]

62
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:49,058
Where does this wine come from?

63
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,598
It was brought by the local native official.

64
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:52,208
[The native officials made an exception and conferred official titles on the local people]

65
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:56,298
Ming Dynasty liquor requires at least six stone of rice

66
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:57,848
[The unit of measurement for stone rice is about 160 kg]

67
00:05:56,298 --> 00:05:59,978
So when my dear minister bought farmland in Kaijing at a low price,

68
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:02,258
I have also received help from them

69
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:06,728
this…

70
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:12,258
Lijiang Jun should pay the price for taking liquor from the local officials

71

Drink more, everyone.

78

79
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:34,978
Drink more

80
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,488
The wine seems to be not enough...

81
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:40,378
Go get some more wine.

82
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:57,058
You guys are waiting here

83
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,968
Just now when the master used the incident of Daming Huojiu to suppress the momentum of the Min family

84
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:13,098
Have you ever seen their expressions?

85
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,328
I was wondering why I was dragged here today.

86
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,148
I just wanted to watch this good show.

87
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,978
Just now, even the middle palace's face turned pale.

88
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:29,668
I think this matter is not just about the Min family.

89
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:31,928
Who said that?

90
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:33,528
My Lord?

91
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:37,008
This is all for us to see.

92
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:38,458
ah

93
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:42,678
However, they failed to create momentum and were criticized

94
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:44,088
Do you mean the Min family?

95
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,268
Shhh

96
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:46,458
Let's go

97
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,638
This wine is too intoxicating

98
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:57,928
Too intoxicating

99
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:05,178
Did you see the way the Lord looked at us when he mentioned fire wine?

100
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:06,488
how

101
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:09,458
It's terrifying

102
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:15,078
The Lord would occasionally look at people with that kind of eyes.

103
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,538
Disappointing

104
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,788
It was like this before

105
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,828
Different from before

106
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:26,168
The Lord is indeed on guard against us

107
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:35,468
In order to make your Highness feel better, I will go and prepare some medicine.

108
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:36,958
No no

109
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:41,808
At this moment, the middle palace just needs to stay with me.

110
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,118
It's troublesome to toss like this

111
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:47,527
Your Highness has drunk too much medicinal wine.

112
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:54,628
I just feel that I can't drink more than them.

113
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,748
I am the ruler of a country.

114
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:59,458
People won't care about this.

115
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,168
They will care

116
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:03,928
They will watch everything about me

117
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:05,948
They will keep watching

118
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:08,768
Watching closely and trying to find my loopholes

119
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:14,698
I am afraid

120
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,948
Your Highness, don't be afraid

00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:06,908
When the head of Pu Yin was broken and blood splattered

128
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:09,828
I felt my stomach churning and I wanted to vomit.

129
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:17,988
I'm really not familiar with this smell of blood

130
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:29,428
Madam, are you okay?

131
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:31,308
My concubine...

132
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,918
I also feel disgusted

133
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,578
But

134
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:38,358
Having embarked on this path

135
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:40,938
There's no turning back.

136
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:46,458
Standing on the edge of a cliff, you can't overlook

137
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,348
If you are afraid

138
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,338
If you make a mistake, you will be doomed.

139
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:54,338
therefore

140
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,888
I only look forward

141
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:08,888
Looking back, the Queen is more qualified to be a king than I am.

142
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:30,478
Congratulations to Cheng Eun

143
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:35,388
Congratulations to Cheng Eun

144
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:51,738
But why did Chengen Shanggong keep this to herself?

145
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:55,198
I'm afraid of something going wrong.

146
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,448
Wait until the fetal gas is stable.

147
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,118
If Chengen Shanggong does this, something bad will happen

00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,008
Please inform me as soon as possible in the future

149

Can you find out who the Queen had a secret meeting with in the mansion?

00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,668
I have seen clearly the person whom the queen is meeting secretly.

00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:30,358
I understand

188
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,518
Just Zheng Shanggong

189
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:39,098
What's up

190
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:41,658
Cheng En Shang Gong is already pregnant

191
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:44,528
What will happen to the Queen Mother in the future?

192
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:47,528
What does this mean?

193
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:53,328
I want to ask whether His Majesty will favor only Consort Cheng'en.

194
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:59,698
The Queen Mother is the head of the female officials

195
00:14:58,228 --> 00:15:02,068
[A woman who holds an official position in the palace]

196
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,488
How can you compare these two people? It is really disloyal.

197
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:04,258
The slaves are terrified

198
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:14,218
Alas, I am afraid that our Queen

199
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:19,028
You will become a dog chasing chickens with only its eyes on the roof.
[Note: meaning helpless]

200
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,158
You think the palace is...

201
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:25,058
A farm with animals?

202
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:29,328
So who is the chicken and who is the dog?

203
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,528
Talk and talk

204
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,528
I'm asking you who is the chicken and who is the dog

205
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:52,528
I heard that Concubine Cheng'en is pregnant

206
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,318
Oh, that's great.

207
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:56,828
Thanks

208
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:58,678
Oh, and these

209
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:01,048
They were all sent by the Empress Dowager.

210
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,238
Ginseng and Deer Antler

211
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,728
The Queen said that Concubine Cheng'en's hands and feet are cold

212
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:10,868
Plus the young master is still unstable.

213
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:14,008
Instructed Cheng En Shang Gong to pay more attention to the pregnancy

214
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:19,058
Chengen Shanggong must give birth to a prince

215
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,428
Thanks

216
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:25,248
From now on, Cheng En Shang Gong will fly to the branch

217
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:29,058
People like me are far behind.

218
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:38,208
Nubi means the person who is rewarded and the one who receives the reward.

219
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,118
We must distinguish between the upper and lower positions

220
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:44,018
yes

221
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:47,008
There is also the Shang Gong Cheng'en who needs to be remembered

222
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:50,368
Xu Shanggong is from the Central Palace

223
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,208
yes

224
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,888
The things have been handed over to Chengen Shanggong

225
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:08,218
Thanks a lot

226
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,738
This is a good thing

227
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,988
But when I think of the Queen Mother

228
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:16,807
My heart is a little... painful.

229
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,618
Is the lady okay?

230
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:20,418
That girl is sensitive.

231
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:25,858
You need to spend more time before giving birth

232
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:29,638
Now Cheng En Shang Gong is pregnant

233
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:32,348
I am really afraid that the master will only be loyal to Cheng En Shang Gong.

234
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:36,557
Frankly speaking, I feel a little...uncomfortable.

235
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,868
What if Concubine Cheng'en really gave birth to a little prince...

236
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:46,258
If she gave birth to a prince

237
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:49,138
I raised the child as my own.

238
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,028
Zheng Shanggong

239
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:56,708
Zheng Shanggong

240
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,488
Didn't Zheng Shanggong not set a day for sleeping with the emperor?

241
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,588
This is the matter of the king and the nave getting married

242
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,278
It's not that it can be decided just by saying so.

243
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:05,828
Oh, what can I say?

244
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:06,978
No matter what

245
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,488
Zheng Shanggong must help to decide

246
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,318
Oh, you are really

247
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:15,268
Even if it is decided

248
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:17,758
Did the middle temple accept it willingly?

249
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,508
The Queen will accept it.

250
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:45,038
He became a king in the future.

251
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,258
The throne is not unbreakable.

252
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:53,228
Need to continue to consolidate and move forward

253
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:57,848
It's the Queen Mother

254
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,758
Still need to be careful at every step

255
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:05,458
[Yi Ti Ryung Grand Prince]

256
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:07,848
But don't look around

257
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:09,268
[Looking back and forth, hesitant and indecisive]

258
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:10,378
Wait until you can move forward without fear

259
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:14,988
Only then can you become king

260
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,758
It's the Queen Mother

261
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:56,708
These foods are too luxurious for slaves.

262
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,398
I know what you are thinking.

263
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:04,578
Don't worry, take it back and eat it.

264
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,938
You are still pregnant

265
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,868
Empress of the Middle Temple

266
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:09,388
only…

267
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,658
The dragon seed in your belly

268
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:13,978
[Dragon King Family]

269
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:14,548
It is no different from the dragon seed in the belly of this palace.

270
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:23,558
Do you want me to inform the hospital... how to make it?

271
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:24,998
No

272
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,298
The slaves are terrified

273
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:33,528
During this period of time, you just need to concentrate on keeping the baby safe.

274
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:40,668
Don't get involved in other meaningless things

275
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:05,048
Didn't you say that even though the body belongs to the Lord?

276
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:07,648
Does your heart still belong to me?

277
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,418
Empress of the Middle Temple

278
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:26,048
Pan Zhu, who was at the border, seemed to have discovered the movements of the northeastern army.

279
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:30,468
But Pan Zhu insisted on reporting to the Queen in person.

280
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:31,518
Your Highness

281
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,728
Zhao Siyi still started a rebellion in the northeast

282
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:39,398
[Relatives of Queen Sindeok, the second wife of Lee Seong-gye, Cho Sa-eui]

283
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,738
Rebellion

284
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:39,978
Even if Zhao Siyi rebelled

285
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:42,798
There must be support from the father behind me

286
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,908
As the ruler of a country, I cannot go to war with my father.

287
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,798
Send Park Chun to implement a conciliatory policy

288
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:51,728
[Park Soon-rye, a military officer in the late Joseon Dynasty, died during the suppression of the "Jo Sae-yi Rebellion"]

289
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,428
The rebels have killed Park Chun

290
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:53,028
Marching towards Tokugawa Anshu

291
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:55,528
I heard that nearby families were also gathering there quickly.

292
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,748
[The family copied the most elite private soldiers in the palace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye]

293
00:21:55,528 --> 00:21:59,868
Cho Yeong-moo was appointed as the governor of Gangwon-do, Chungcheong-cheong, Gyeongsang-do, and Jeolla-do in the northeast

294
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,938
[The Supreme Commander of the Expeditionary Force]

295
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,698
Block other reinforcements from joining

296
00:22:01,698 --> 00:22:05,748
Jo Yeong-moo, Lee Chun-woo, Kim Yeong-ryeol, and Lee Gu-tetul were dispatched to the northeast

297
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:09,238
[Yi Chunyou, a military commander in the late Joseon Dynasty and the early Joseon Dynasty, a contributor to the founding of Joseon Dynasty, and the accession of King Taejong to the throne]

298
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:07,608
It's your highness

299
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:10,048
I heard that the rebels captured Li Tianyou's 100 cavalrymen alive.

300
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,968
In addition, the number of rebels has increased from 6,000 to 7,000

301
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:14,328
If Wuliangha joins

302
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:19,348
[A tribe of the Wuliangha Jurchens]

303
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:16,758
There are tens of thousands of people

304
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,408
You just said Wuliangha

305
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:36,308
Wuliangha was a tribe of the Jurchens

306
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:40,498
The tribe has a close relationship with the Supreme King.

307
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:43,758
In addition to Wuliangha, other troops can join

308
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:45,248
No

309
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,048
That's it.

310
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:52,368
Father, did you go to Yuanzhongpu as you said before?

311
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:51,988
[A port in Wonjungpo, Hwanghae Province]

312
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:54,028
yes

313
00:22:54,028 --> 00:22:55,418
I know.

314
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,608
The Lord has been watching here.

315
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:01,028
Sir, walk carefully.

316
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:15,368
At present, there are 40,000 soldiers between Huangzhou and Fengzhou.

317
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:18,058
Even if Wuliangha joined the rebellion, there would be only 10,000 of them.

318
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:20,038
We still have a chance of winning

319
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:25,378
But once the fighting starts, the casualties will be countless.

320
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:27,728
They are also the people of the widowed

321
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,978
If you can ask the father to come back

322
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:35,578
Can we end this war without moving a single soldier?

323
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:39,568
The Jiabie copy is to follow His Majesty the Supreme King

324
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,018
By then, it will naturally be like a pile of loose sand

325
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:43,528
In this way

326
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:44,788
Please give your order

327
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:48,348
I am willing to go there to ensure His Majesty the Great King returns safely.

328
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:51,148
My dear, do you mean to capture my father alive?

329
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,368
In this way, the widow

330
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:02,638
After killing the king's brother and dragging his elder brother down,

331
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:05,328
Became the king who captured his father

332
00:24:08,158 --> 00:24:09,578
So how?

333
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:19,108
All we need to do is to ensure that the Supreme King is safe.

334
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:23,678
I don't know why the Lord is so hesitant to make up his mind.

335
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:26,808
This is how it is.

336
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:29,318
Although it was Zhao Siyi who started the rebellion

337
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:32,098
But the person behind him who controls the situation must be the Supreme King

338
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:34,508
Everyone knows this

339
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:37,498
How could the Lord not know?

340
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:40,318
Moreover, I don't know where the Supreme King is at the moment.

341
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:43,858
Arrest Zhao Siyi and ask him.

342
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,208
In this way

343
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:48,838
A big fight is inevitable

344
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:52,168
The Lord certainly does not want to go to war with his biological father.

345
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:57,778
Where are you going, sir?

346
00:24:57,778 --> 00:24:59,378
Won't you leave the palace?

347
00:25:00,138 --> 00:25:02,618
I want to find a book in the palace

348
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:05,708
Looking for books in the palace?

349
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,168
Anjo-kun, please go first.

350
00:25:27,408 --> 00:25:28,748
Your Highness

351
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:31,188
Lord Helun requests an audience

352
00:25:57,648 --> 00:26:00,248
I ordered you to come quietly, but you scared me.

353
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:01,688
Never

354
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:05,618
I am considering personally sending troops to the northeast.

355
00:26:05,618 --> 00:26:07,658
Your Highness intends to leave the palace

356
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:11,368
Entrust your father's safety to others

357
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:13,608
I really can't rest assured

358
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:16,358
The current regime is not stable

359
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:19,308
If the news that the monarch is not in the palace leaks out

360
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:20,308
This palace...

361
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:24,808
I'm afraid you will have to help me guard it.

362
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:29,208
I receive your order.

363
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:39,038
I know that you are quite knowledgeable in astronomy and physiognomy.

364
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:42,658
I am terrified

365
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:45,888
So I have a question for you.

366
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,938
Your Highness, please ask

367
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,648
My dear, look at Li Shufan.

368
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,998
What kind of atmosphere is around you?

369
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:55,568
A loyal minister

370
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:57,448
Still a traitor

371
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:04,738
It depends on how His Majesty uses him.

372
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:07,318
There is no rebellious spirit

373
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:09,948
Although not a traitor

374
00:27:09,948 --> 00:27:12,448
But whether he is a loyal minister or not depends on what I do.

375
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:13,928
good

376
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:15,408
that nave

377
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:19,658
What

378
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:22,958
I don't know what your Highness wants to ask.

379
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,258
King's Spirit

380
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:42,308
Your Highness, please take a look at the stars.

381
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:46,628
That's the red star.

382
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:51,238
That star is the third among the seven stars.

383
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:53,178
It is an ominous sign

384
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,468
You said it's ominous

385
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:57,778
There may be signs of rebellion

386
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:01,768
Rebellion is not the northeast

387
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:05,758
The Northeast Rebellion Has Begun

388
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:08,528
So it's not a sign.

389
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:09,598
So

390
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:10,818
Your Highness

391
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:15,758
It is better to hand over the palace to Lixingfuyuanjun

392
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,578
[Father of Yeoheungbuwongun Minji and Queen Wonkyeong]

393
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:17,198
My dear, you are asking me to test you.

394
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:19,208
I will keep an eye on it quietly.

395
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:23,078
Are you saying that the Empress is at the center of the rebellion?

396
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:34,618
I heard that His Majesty will personally send troops to the northeast.

397
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:35,698
What

398
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:36,868
personally

399
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:38,158
yes

400
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:42,858
His Highness seems to be considering handing over the palace to his father.

401
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:47,958
It seems that in times of crisis, the only people His Highness can trust are our Min family.

402
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,538
Stop talking nonsense

403
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:51,978
His Highness is accompanied by Lord Helun

404
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:54,078
There must be other considerations

405
00:28:55,888 --> 00:28:58,258
But why didn't Your Highness tell me?

406
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:00,788
The queen is sad

407
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:04,218
That's a battlefield.

408
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:05,978
A matter of life and death

409
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:32,628
Go and ask the imperial concubine to come over

410
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:40,758
Niangniang

411
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,038
[Kwon Sun Lee Bang Won's Harem]

412
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:46,618
Niangniang

413
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:52,538
Cheng En Shang Gong said that she disturbed her prenatal education

414
00:29:52,538 --> 00:29:53,788
please…

415
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,208
Please respect yourself, ma'am

416
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:02,358
What

417
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:19,368
The Princess of Zhenyi Palace Arrives

418
00:30:30,188 --> 00:30:31,618
Calligraphy

419
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:41,028
You said that my Xuanqin music disturbed your prenatal education

420
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:43,358
What does this mean?

421
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:45,398
It's noisy

422
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:51,168
Maybe it's because I don't understand music.

423
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:52,908
It's noisy

424
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:53,798
Very noisy

425
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:58,088
I don't even have the ability to appreciate music.

426
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:01,418
Such people can only

427
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,498
I have enchanted His Highness with my body.

428
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:08,888
Slaves are born lowly and humble

429
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:13,728
Just because there is no opportunity

430
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:17,178
At least when I sleep with you

431
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:21,218
I know why Your Highness is so happy.

432
00:31:21,218 --> 00:31:25,638
The meaning of slaves is that slaves have fulfilled their duties as concubines.

433
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:28,298
Do your best

434
00:31:32,508 --> 00:31:34,048
Tonight

435
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:36,808
Please come down to the palace

436
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:40,258
Your Majesty, do you want me to arrange for you to sleep with her?

437
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:41,498
Exactly

438
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:44,348
Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have contacted the Shuyun Temple...

439
00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:46,768
That is to say, today was not set as the day for the sleeping ceremony.

440
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:49,358
Can't we make a date now?

441
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,778
This is the king and the queen sleeping together

442
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:52,968
Own process and preparation…

443
00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:55,978
No need for complicated procedures and preparations

444
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:59,808
It's just a wife wanting to see her husband before he goes to the battlefield.

445
00:31:59,808 --> 00:32:01,318
Although this is the case

446
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:04,868
But the Empress had never proposed the idea of sleeping with the emperor first.

447
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:06,218
This palace…

448
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,808
I want to be with His Highness.

449
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:12,118
Is there any bigger reason than this?

450
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:18,818
If you don't think it's possible, I'll go directly to the bedroom.

451
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:23,348
No

452
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,798
I understand.

453
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,008
Today?

454
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:30,138
yes

455
00:32:30,138 --> 00:32:32,118
The day is urgent

456
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:36,738
But considering that today is the most suitable day to give birth to the little prince

457
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,128
I know

458
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:51,688
Why is Chengen Shanggong like this?

459
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:54,808
The Palace Master Zhenyi has called the Palace Supervisor to reprimand the

460
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:57,538
This matter has been reported to His Highness.

461
00:32:57,538 --> 00:32:58,768
Your Highness

462
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,018
yes

463
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:05,478
In order to ensure that the Palace Master Zhenyi can be at ease, she plays the Xuanqin

464
00:33:05,478 --> 00:33:09,538
His Highness has ordered a pavilion to be built near the small lotus pond.

465
00:33:10,228 --> 00:33:11,688
It's just because Concubine Cheng'en is pregnant

466
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:13,818
This matter has just been brought up

467
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:15,228
only

468
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:18,788
Why is His Highness so attentive to Palace Master Zhenyi?

469
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,878
The palace master is the daughter of a noble family.

470
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:24,078
Even the master cannot be underestimated

471
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:28,698
After all, the Quan family is rich and powerful.

472
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:30,268
I'm pregnant.

473
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:33,738
Seong-eun isn't the only one pregnant

474
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:38,138
Will His Highness stay with Shang Gong Chengen until the end of time?

475
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:44,218
There is no shortage of young and beautiful women in the palace.

476
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:49,288
So

477
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:54,398
I also need powerful officials

478
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,248
Isn't it?

479
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:08,448
Okay, okay.

480
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,878
Come

481
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:17,278
I wonder how much Anjo-kun thinks he knows about his lord.

482
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,258
What should be understood is understood

483
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:26,468
You should know this.

484
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:34,338
It seems to me that Anjo-kun doesn't understand at all.

485
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:37,118
Why do you say that, sir?

486
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:41,698
This time, the Lord will not ask Anjo-kun to play as a forward.

487
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:45,028
How will that happen?

488
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:51,518
Could it be that the Central Palace is interfering again?

489
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,498
I said, how can Ancheng-kun be so ignorant of His Majesty?

490
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:04,147
How could His Majesty allow himself to be ordered around by others?

491
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:06,048
What the adult meant was

492
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:10,728
Your Highness will make his own judgment.

493
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:14,928
It's just that His Highness's many decisions before

494
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:19,198
She was indeed influenced by the Queen Mother.

495
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:25,128
After all, the two of you have been political allies for many years.

496
00:35:25,988 --> 00:35:29,458
Even if His Highness has two concubines in the harem,

497
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,438
It's just like the dispute between His Highness and the two concubines in the harem

498
00:35:32,438 --> 00:35:36,268
The political goals of the two have never changed.

499
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:40,428
Even if their political goals are similar

500
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:43,138
One is the king and the other is the subject

501
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:49,868
One is a man and the other is a woman

502
00:35:56,578 --> 00:35:57,798
so

503
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:06,218
What I mean is that this is the easiest relationship to change in the world.

504
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:19,548
What can Anjo-kun do?

505
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:22,398
I will break this alliance.

506
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:29,218
I will definitely do it.

507
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:32,908
If so

508
00:36:32,908 --> 00:36:34,888
What can your Excellency promise me?

509
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:03,048
His Majesty has arrived

510
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,928
I heard that His Highness is going to go to the battle personally.

511
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:19,388
good

512
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:43,468
How could you...

513
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:46,548
The Shang Gong on duty today just needs to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, understand?

514
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:48,098
What...what

515
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:52,228
Not this... this... Xu Shanggong

516
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,498
Shhh

517
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:19,388
I heard that His Highness is going to lead the army

518
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,868
I just feel like I'm going crazy

519
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:25,498
We should be together

520
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:30,128
You and I can only...

521
00:38:30,128 --> 00:38:32,048
Act together

522
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:35,908
It would be better for Your Highness to go alone and ask Father to come back.

523
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:41,748
The father will be with those soldiers

524
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:44,458
How can I bring my father back alone?

525
00:39:45,138 --> 00:39:49,978
My father is alone in Yuanzhongpu at this moment.

526
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:54,968
I only brought some personal soldiers with me secretly.

527
00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:57,278
[Elite soldiers in the Joseon Dynasty who were responsible for guarding the capital and the border]

528
00:39:57,508 --> 00:39:58,918
This is true

529
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:01,448
really

530
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:07,588
Did your spies find out again?

531
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:11,848
This is all for His Highness' sake.

532
00:40:20,478 --> 00:40:21,788
only

533
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:25,448
Will my father easily agree to let me come back?

534
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:29,258
The Queen also knew how the father left Kaifeng that day.

535
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:32,048
The situation now is different from that time

536
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:37,028
The news of 40,000 soldiers and officers frightened Zhao Siyi's troops.

537
00:40:32,298 --> 00:40:35,798
[All officers and soldiers are registered in the North Korean military]

538
00:40:37,028 --> 00:40:38,788
I guess my father doesn't want

539
00:40:38,788 --> 00:40:43,288
Let more soldiers get hurt in a battle that cannot be won

540
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:48,978
Maybe my father also needs a name to change his mind.

541
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:55,138
If I risk my life to invite this person

542
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:58,728
This title belongs to me.

543
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:01,158
