After the capital was moved to Hanyang

Many people robbed people's houses.

13

[The abbreviation of the Siheonbu, which was responsible for monitoring and impeaching officials during the Joseon Dynasty]

No one can be in power because of

25
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,761
Above the people

26
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,421

Ji Shi mentioned in the Analects

00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,761
[Prince Yi Seok-chungnyeong]

29
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,501
Because of the great power in his hands, he even coveted the royal power.

30
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:19,031
If Ji Shi is like this, the monarch should be punished, right?

31
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,031
good

32
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,631
What are you doing?

33
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:32,191
I am asking my mother about the Ji family mentioned in the Analects.

34
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:35,851
But the royal family of Lu, Ji

35
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:35,831
[Royal relatives and powerful families]

36
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:36,891
yes

37
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:46,101
Are you sure that there was no Ji clan of Lu in Joseon?

38
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:48,461
Are we moving the capital to Hanyang?

39
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:50,921
yes

40
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,311
You said you were going to cut off all the vested interests there

41
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:56,701
restart

42
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,641
It's the father

43
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:08,321
In this case, this matter may start from the Min family headed by the middle palace.

44
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,591
Can you do it?

45
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:15,211
I ask you, can you do it?

46
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,341
It's the father

47
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:47,541
Last time I met the emperor, I asked the Lord to grant me the post of commander of the right army.

48
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:47,151
[General of the Right Army, Commander of the Right Army in the Central Army Organization of the Early Joseon Dynasty]

49
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:52,311
Isn't this the seat that Shufan has been eyeing?

50
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:55,511
We must not hand over the important military post to Shufan.

51
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,301
Shufan is quite trusted by his master

52
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,931
Just a general of the Right Army

53
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:04,391
The military power is as strong as a mountain and we cannot give up

54
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,431
The prince must meet with the book banquet official three times a day

55
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,111
[The official in charge of the education of the crown prince]

56
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,531
[Yi Ti Ryung Grand Prince]

57
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:17,581
Talk in the morning, talk in the day, talk in the evening

58
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:19,871
Must be done here

59
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:21,051
yes

60
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:33,731
Thank you for your hard work.

61
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:42,721
In the Yin-Yang and Five Elements, yellow is the center of the earth.

62
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:44,701
[The Confucian doctrine of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements emphasizes harmony and unity through the Yin-Yang and Five Elements symbols]

63
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:46,501
The place closest to the sun also means the imperial decree.

64
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:51,421
So the queen mother used the light yellow dyed with gardenia.

65
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:53,941
Did the Empress personally select someone to make it?

66
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:59,191
Under the crown prince's residence

67
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:05,621
We have prepared a gift in the hope that you will become a brave king.

68
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,021
Wow, it's a marked feather

69
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:14,301
[A tool used to insert into the tail of a falcon when marking feathers]

70
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,921
I hope it can be used when hunting eagles at my residence.

71
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,161
Why don't you try shaking it?

72
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,631
His Majesty has arrived

73
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:35,891
Aren't you supposed to be heading to Taiping Pavilion now?

74
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:40,251
We are curious about the current learning environment in Changdeokgung.

75
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:42,651
Then take time to come

76
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,161
All right

77
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,171
Ti'er is reading "University" now.

78
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,051
yes

79
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:55,161
So you should know the meaning of Chengzheng Pavilion.

80
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:57,691
We should be sincere in studying

81
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,041
Attitude and state of mind should be correct

82
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,701
Take one of the two characters and you get the two characters Chengzheng.

83
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,031
good

84
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:09,561
Ti'er was born to be a king

85
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:12,031
Looks like His Highness.

86
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,091
etc.

87
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:19,221
Isn't this the marking feather?

88
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:30,271
Bring it to the father

89
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,711
You are the prince who will shoulder the responsibility of the entire country in the future.

90
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,521
Even if I spend all day studying, itâ€™s not enough time.

91
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,951
How can I study falconry?

92
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:41,571
I will only...

93
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,991
Keep it

94
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:46,151
If you stay, you will want to go out

95
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:47,881
Bring it to the father

96
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:58,101
Your Highness

97
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,461
So I'll leave it to the Lord.

98
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,201
Ti'er would read books here for several hours every day.

99
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:07,281
[One hour is about two hours]

100
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,261
Two hours

101
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,821
Five hours

102
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,381
It's five hours

103
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:16,851
If the servants come to report that you can read for five hours every day

104
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:19,061
Then the father will return it to you.

105
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,271
It's the father

106
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:29,921
You two

107
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:39,231
Things like coming to see the prince privately

108
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:42,161
There is also the matter of giving expensive gifts

109
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,901
There will never be another day

110
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:45,861
Not the Queen Mother

111
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:48,611
Do I have to look at His Majesty's face even for this matter?

112
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:51,701
The Crown Prince was raised in our care.

113
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,941
I have said that your mentality is the problem.

114
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,871
The crown prince is the foundation of a country

115
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:02,761
You must be extra careful not to have this kind of problem again in the future.

116
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:05,851
yes

117
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,961
I heard that their house suddenly had more servants.

118
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,731
There's not enough food anymore.

119
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:17,471
The servants in the mansions of my uncles are so numerous that they don't have enough food.

120
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:18,571
yes

121
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:21,971
The Central Palace knows this

122
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:24,351
Seems like I don't know yet

123
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:27,891
His Highness, Anjo-kun requests an audience

124
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,601
I heard that His Highness summoned me.

125
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:42,301
The number of servants in the palace of the middle palace suddenly increased

126
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:44,661
Go check it quietly.

127
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,871
But there is still the Constitutional Government

128
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,600
The Chief Justice is from the Min family

129
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,491
[The head of the Censorate who is responsible for monitoring and reporting]

130
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,911
It's your highness

131
00:08:56,301 --> 00:09:00,021
The Lord finally ordered an investigation.

132
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,801
Now, hundreds of people have become slaves of the Min family overnight.

133
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,281
Naturally, we have to check it out

134
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:11,921
In this way, can Anjo-kun become the commander-in-chief of the right army?

135
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:14,781
Shuyi has laid the groundwork in this way

136
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:17,421
I must do it naturally.

137
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,511
Then what's next

138
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,341
I don't know what I should do for Shuyi.

139
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,191
There is ample time

140
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,461
grown ups

141
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,841
After receiving the imperial edict

142
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:02,621
Is that how Anjo-kun investigated?

143
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:03,981
It's an adult

144
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:07,341
drive

145
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:17,521
drive

146
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,421
Stop, stop, stop

147
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,321
What is Ancheng going to report to the Lord?

148
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:30,911
It has nothing to do with Lichengjun

149
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:31,941
Please get off the sedan chair, Anchengjun

150
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:33,831
presumptuous

151
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:34,621
presumptuous

152
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:38,121
Licheng Jun may not know that the world has changed.

153
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,941
Get off the sedan

154
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:49,271
Your Majesty has given orders first.

155
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:50,901
The Lord has ordered

156
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,791
Anjo-kun also needs to tell us first

157
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,551
I should help cover it up.

158
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:56,641
I am not a subject of the Min family.

159
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,291
I mean we are comrades.

160
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,801
Comrade

161
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:06,531
Is the friendship between comrades more important than the loyalty between the ruler and his subjects?

162
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:07,691
So

163
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:09,241
Can Ancheng-kun walk and sit upright?

164
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,671
I

165
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,061
I naturally walk upright and sit upright

166
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,351
Really like chicken ribs

167
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:28,671
[Chicken ribs means that they are tasteless to eat and a pity to throw away]

168
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:26,861
Useless

169
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:28,341
Did Anjo just say it was useless?

170
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:30,021
Not bad

171
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:33,741
It is located at the center of power corruption

172
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:37,871
But he couldn't move because of the palace. It was really useless.

173
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:48,131
What are you doing?

174
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:58,871
There was a scuffle at the main entrance of Changdeokgung Palace

175
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:03,271
It turns out that two heroes are fighting for a position

176
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,781
Someone will definitely report this to the Lord.

177
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:10,221
This matter...

178
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,781
I will try to calm it down.

179
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:13,961
only

180
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,061
I'm afraid it won't be easy to calm down.

181
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,631
Lichengjun

182
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:22,801
yes

183
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:26,301
Please put aside your thoughts on the position of Right Army Commander

184
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:27,781
grown ups

185
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:32,491
Anjo-kun

186
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:33,511
yes

187
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:39,121
Ancheng-kun must promise me that he will not take the post of commander-in-chief of the right army.

188
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,841
Please answer my question first, Licheng Jun.

189
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,931
Just one position

190
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:53,121
What's the big deal?

191
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:54,991
only

192
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:58,961
Anjo-kun has been secretly investigating us.

193
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,091
This is the Lord's order.

194
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,081
When the capital was moved to Hanyang

195
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,341
There are more than one or two good people who lost their homes

196
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:07,121
I just took them in.

197
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,181
It's not good to take him in for nothing and then assign him some tasks.

198
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:13,991
So why did those good people go to the government to appeal for justice?

199
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,531
Why did the government...

200
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:18,921
Would they not conduct an investigation?

201
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,741
Because you are the younger brother of the Queen Mother.

202
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,221
What

203
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:31,111
I am just following orders.

204
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:37,031
I heard that among those who followed the adults

205
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:40,081
Someone coveted the post of commander-in-chief of the Right Army

206
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:45,581
Even if you mediate, I cannot sit idly by.

207
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,501
That guy

208
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:09,371
I look forward to receiving gifts of thanks after sending tribute.

209
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:13,711
Joseon and Ming can build a solid foundation of trust

210
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:16,511
Your Highness's Opinion

211
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,401
I will comply with the Ming Dynasty's request.

212
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:23,711
Presenting His Majesty the Emperor with 10,000 fine horses, a specialty of Korea

213
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:28,501
His Majesty the Emperor will surely be delighted

214
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:29,371
[Huang Yan, Korean eunuch and envoy of the Ming Dynasty]

215
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:36,531
It is better to explain how the Ming Dynasty should express gratitude at the beginning.

216
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:39,131
This way there won't be any different arguments in the future.

217
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:42,591
good

218
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,731
According to your Highness's wishes

219
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:49,031
Next is our Ming Dynasty's request.

220
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:53,661
North Korea must send tribute women

221
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:55,961
[A virgin presented as tribute to the Ming Dynasty]

222
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:56,711
Let me send out the tribute girl

223
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:59,071
At least fifty people

224
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,521
To ensure mutual trust between Ming and Korea

225
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:08,681
At least send this number.

226
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:16,901
Why did the Ming Dynasty... continue the bad habits of the Yuan Dynasty?

227
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:19,861
His Majesty intends to ask for more thank you gifts

228
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:21,981
To enrich the court's finances

229
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:24,921
But Huang Yan was already prepared

230
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,611
Taking advantage of the issue of tribute women

231
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,851
The master finally fell into the trap

232
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:33,911
It seems so

233
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:37,541
What do the censors say when things get to this point?

234
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,111
The Lord issued a gag order

235
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,291
Gag Order

236
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,931
The reason for setting up the Sijianyuan

237
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:45,131
[The Censorate is a government agency that criticizes the words and deeds of the king and his ministers and demands corrections]

238
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:46,751
Let the ministers speak their mind.

239
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:48,081
If the queen makes a big deal about this

240
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:52,821
It is to make public the fact that the Lord fell into Huang Yan's trap

241
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,601
My lady, just pretend you don't know.

242
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:27,231
This matter can be resolved by offering a tribute girl to the Ming Dynasty.

243
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,371
I have said that there is no need to mention it again

244
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:33,841
The Queen Mother said

245
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:37,661
If the Xin Dynasty acts the same as Goryeo

246
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:42,501
Why should we change the dynasty and establish a new country?

247
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:48,091
I have never instigated the ministers to submit petitions.

248
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,381
Just a reminder

249
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:52,471
remind

250
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,371
Before ascending the throne

251
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:58,181
The Lord clearly said that there would be no more tribute girls.

252
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:02,041
The Lord must keep this promise

253
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,221
Is it easy for the Queen to decide to be a widow?

254
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,041
I have also thought about it a lot.

255
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,121
My Lord, you should persevere to the end.

256
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:11,101
Even if it means sending one less tribute girl.

257
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:13,530
Isn't there any other way?

258
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,621
I will find a way

259
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,701
Please let me handle it.

260
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:21,981
No way

261
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,371
The Central Palace must not be like this...

262
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,631
That's six months.

263
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:36,020
If the Queen Mother fails to do this, she will not be allowed to leave the Queen Mother's Palace for six months.

264
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,741
Is the Central Palace willing to be confined like this?

265
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,451
yes

266
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:48,451
I am willing

267
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,941
This is the silk of Ming Dynasty

268
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:56,121
I hope to please the Queen Mother.

269
00:17:56,121 --> 00:18:02,631
The silk you sent earlier was said to be for the Ming Dynasty royal family.

270
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:05,731
Why are there still these in the palace?

271
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:10,241
During the Yuan Dynasty, the eunuchs of the imperial palace used to live in the mansions of concubines.

272
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:11,381
[Eunuch Daebugaeon, a government official in charge of price and storage in the late Goryeo period]

273
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:14,531
The daughter was presented to the Yuan Dynasty royal family...

274
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:15,431
yes

275
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:19,581
At that time, my grandmother was the crown princess of the Yuan Dynasty.

276
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:21,721
Seeing that the Ming Dynasty was in power, he committed suicide

277
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:24,591
The Emperor of the Ming Dynasty thought this was commendable.

278
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:28,881
So he gave our family many gifts.

279
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:32,211
I just think this is commendable.

280
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,851
The Ming Emperor gave gifts

281
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:38,211
I only rewarded you, the Quan family.

282
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,291
Don't you think it's strange?

283
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:50,051
What did your Quan family give to the Ming Emperor?

284
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:53,941
Otherwise, you are just a family of North Korea.

285
00:18:53,941 --> 00:19:00,091
How could the great Emperor of the Ming Dynasty send so many gifts?

286
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:01,011
Empress of the Middle Temple

287
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:06,811
After the Yuan Dynasty, your Quan family is planning to continue to build connections with the Ming Dynasty royal family, right?

288
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:11,951
I will not ask you what you gave me or why you gave me this gift.

289
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:16,031
The person in charge of the gifts to the royal family was Huang Yan.

290
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:16,851
yes

291
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,411
Huang Yan is smart and clever

292
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:21,251
But greedy for money

293
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:26,761
I don't think he will offer all the gifts.

294
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:29,041
I think it should be like this

295
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,141
I intend to use this incident as an opportunity

296
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:34,931
Solve the problem of this tribute girl

297
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:38,781
The Queen Mother

298
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:49,491
Empress of the Middle Temple

299
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,271
You are here

300
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:55,891
I don't know what the Queen wants.

301
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:58,011
I need your help with something.

302
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:01,871
I am willing to help

303
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:05,961
Are you willing to help without asking?

304
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:11,281
If Her Majesty needs me, I will do my best to help you.

305
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:26,881
The Ming Emperor will not tolerate any mistakes

306
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,491
They are the envoys of the Ming Emperor.

307
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:33,051
I must be on high alert and don't want to make any mistakes

308
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:37,221
What you need to do is to let them down their guard.

309
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,161
This is Lady Shuyi who serves His Highness.

310
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:43,751
[Sookyi Joseon Dynasty, second-rank imperial concubine]

311
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:46,151
The Queen Mother has left the palace

312
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:48,611
Before this, I was the one who served you.

313
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:33,681
The Queen Mother has arrived and said that she intends to meet with Eunuch Huang alone.

314
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:39,911
It seems impolite to invite the Queen Mother here.

315
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:43,361
I will serve you two well.

316
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:53,121
I have prepared a small gift for you two.

317
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:14,131
Why did the Queen Mother call only Eunuch Huang?

318
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:21,751
I will keep Eunuch Huang's affairs a secret.

319
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,811
I heard that Eunuch Hwang was born in Sinuiju

320
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:27,081
Speaks fluent Korean

321
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:31,351
I hope that Eunuch Huang can talk to me in Korean.

322
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,611
I hope Eunuch Huang will agree.

323
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:35,491
good

324
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:48,381
Does Eunuch Huang look familiar?

325
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:53,671
The Quan Mansion where the Zhenyi Palace Master lives has some connection with the Ming Dynasty royal family.

326
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:57,801
So I sent some gifts to the Ming Emperor.

327
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:01,471
But I heard that this thing was not sent out.

328
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:06,461
They certainly have no evidence to prove that this was offered.

329
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:13,981
The father of this Zhenyi Palace Master once sent a letter stating what gifts were given

330
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:19,581
But I received a reply saying that I had not received these gifts.

331
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:26,071
This is true

332
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,971
What should Eunuch Huang do?

333
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:30,901
Will you help me find it back?

334
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:35,961
Or should we report this to His Majesty the Emperor in person?

335
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:46,891
What does the queen mean?

336
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:51,041
Is it really the emperor's will that my dynasty send 50 tribute girls?

337
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:56,651
His Majesty the Emperor clearly said that the Ming Dynasty was different from the Yuan Dynasty.

338
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:59,671
He also explained that he had different positions on tribute girls.

339
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,931
This is really weird.

340
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:10,471
Could it be that someone lied about the number of women being offered as tribute and used public power for personal gain?

341
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:13,971
What does the queen want?

342
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:19,501
Eunuch Huang just needs to have fun and go back happily.

343
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:26,381
Take all the gifts you should bring

344
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:33,731
Foreign ministers are being entertained and are about to return to the court

345
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:37,451
Especially the 10,000 horses that His Highness promised to pay as tribute.

346
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:40,971
It will surely please His Majesty the Emperor

347
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:44,991
As for the matter of the tribute girl

348
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:51,661
I will report this to Your Highness for further discussion later.

349
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:53,791
To discuss again

350
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,041
What about the number of tribute women?

351
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:59,351
It won't be the same as before

352
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:35,771
you...

353
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:41,611
Have you ever seen anyone who is better at playing the Xuanqin than you?

354
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,571
I have met your Highness.

355
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,631
Then you'll be jealous

356
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:52,061
I think there are still many things worth learning.

357
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:26,441
You said that Lichengjun quarreled with Anchengjun over this matter.

358
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:27,631
yes

359
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:31,561
Anjo-kun is following orders.

360
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:35,311
In this case, it was Licheng Jun who made a mistake.

361
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:36,401
What

362
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:38,261
Empress of the Middle Temple

363
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:40,541
Release all good people who have been enslaved

364
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,331
Pay all their previous wages

365
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:47,761
In addition, I will ask the Lord to punish you.

366
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:49,361
Empress of the Middle Temple

367
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:50,581
Why is your Madam like this?

368
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:51,781
What is the reason?

369
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:54,351
We risked our lives and the Min family's reputation

370
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:58,201
This allowed the former Jing'an Jun to ascend the throne

371
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:58,871
Li Jiangjun

372
00:26:58,871 --> 00:27:01,061
But the Queen has given the order, so we should act with caution.

373
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:02,201
But

374
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,531
Can't even this little thing be done now?

375
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:04,981
No

376
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:06,291
Absolutely not

377
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,681
I'm afraid other heroes will be even more outrageous and will never lose to us.

378
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:12,831
It is even more unacceptable because you are the younger brothers of the middle palace.

379
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,741
As the younger brother of the middle palace, why can't I have more

380
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:18,471
Why we should be more careful and make more concessions

381
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,011
If that was the case, why did we fight for power in the first place?

382
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:22,651
I don't care what others say

383
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:26,421
Half of this power belongs to our Min family.

384
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:28,901
What is power to you?

385
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:33,151
Is it to have more, enjoy more, squander more?

386
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,871
Can you own what is in front of you?

387
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,901
This is power

388
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:42,871
The power in my heart is different from yours.

389
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,611
I want to create a new world different from Goryeo

390
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,771
Thatâ€™s why we need power

391
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:51,381
I am terrified

392
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:56,091
Why does the Queen dare to have such a dream?

393
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,951
The Queen Mother has no power to change the world

394
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,731
Is that what you think?

395
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,561
Namoto Palace

396
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:09,171
I'll prove it to you

397
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:16,631
Open the door

398
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:21,981
Empress of the Middle Temple

399
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:24,531
Why did the lady come so late at night?

400
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:27,211
Your Highness can sleep now

401
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:28,531
not yet

402
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:31,231
You step down first

403
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:32,821
What

404
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:36,061
yes

405
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:56,031
My brothers had indeed used unjust means to expand the number of household slaves.

406
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:57,671
[House slave private servant]

407
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:58,371
I hope your highness will conduct a thorough investigation

408
00:28:58,371 --> 00:29:00,351
Severely punish

409
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:05,611
The central hall is for these things.

410
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:06,881
Come in

411
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:14,441
If I sit face to face with His Highness and look at His Highness's expression

412
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:19,051
I am afraid I dare not ask, so I will ask here.

413
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:22,891
What is it?

414
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:28,301
Why did the father want to harm His Highness?

415
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:37,551
If I become king, I will not be able to build the Korea that my father dreamed of.

416
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:39,381
Father has always been so sure

417
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:45,401
But that day in Yuanzhongpu

418
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:46,491
[A port in Wonjungpo, Hwanghae Province]

419
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:49,631
His Highness made his father change his mind

420
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,981
How did His Highness do it?

421
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:54,051
so

422
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,121
I am determined to achieve

423
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:02,741
The Korea that my father dreamed of

424
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,321
I have promised my father

425
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:10,961
Is that all?

426
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:15,361
besides

427
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,641
I promise that if there are any obstacles on the road to North Korea's success

428
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:23,021
Must be eradicated

429
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:26,461
Among these stumbling blocks

430
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:31,271
Do I have several younger brothers?

431
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,131
Exactly

432
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,861
if

433
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:41,961
I mean if

434
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:50,601
My brothers relied on the prince to block your highness's way.

435
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,131
How does His Royal Highness intend to deal with it?

436
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:58,461
Want to kill them?

437
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:04,351
Did he kill the prince too?

438
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:15,091
What did the father do?

439
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,751
I will go that way too.

440
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:36,091
Wouldn't you secretly think

441
00:31:36,091 --> 00:31:41,001
The world of North Korea belongs to your Min family.

442
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:44,951
I hate you so much

443
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:48,391
The grief of having to kill his son

444
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:50,781
It is the righteousness of the widower

445
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,831
Empress of the Middle Temple

446
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:57,141
Father

447
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:22,151
Why did the Queen summon us here?

448
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:24,961
For you

449
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:26,951
What is this palace?

450
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:35,971
The queen is the pillar of our Min family.

451
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:39,511
She is also our proud sister.

452
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:48,881
You are the Queen Mother of the current dynasty.

453
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,831
From now on

454
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:57,101
I will keep my distance from the Min family.

455
00:32:58,441 --> 00:32:58,991
What

456
00:32:58,991 --> 00:33:00,201
Why did the Queen say that?

457
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:05,071
The meaning of this palace is the Queen Mother of the Min family and the Queen Mother of the Nation.

458
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:10,561
Cannot coexist

459
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:14,951
The nave seems to have changed.

460
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:19,141
The central temple is like this

461
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:23,321
We just need to continue on our Min family's path.

462
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:06,691
The memorials all mentioned that Licheng Jun should be appointed as the commander of the right army.

463
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:06,361
[Min Wuji, brother of Queen Wonkyung, Prince of Yeoseong]

464
00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:09,581
Is this also the reason why you came here, my dear ministers?

465
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,901
Licheng Jun has been in charge of the army for many years

466
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:16,861
There are many soldiers in the army who are willing to serve Licheng Jun loyally.

467
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:19,660
These people will only follow the will of Licheng Jun

468
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,390
Please hand over the military affairs to Licheng Jun.

469
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:26,850
The Min family forcibly detained hundreds of good citizens, including Lichengjun, as slaves.

470
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,611
The Yamen governor was afraid of the Min family's power

471
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:31,120
I haven't even investigated it properly.

472
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,870
Power corrupts like this

473
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,261
How can I entrust the important affairs of state to the Lord of Licheng?

474
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:40,151
The Queen's previous achievements have been enough to cover up the minor flaws of Licheng Jun.

475
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:45,251
Huang Yan asked Wu Du to be the woman who protected North Korea

476
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,981
After the good story spread

477
00:34:46,981 --> 00:34:50,660
There are also some ministers who follow the Empress.

478
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:56,091
So please, Your Highness, hand over the military affairs to Licheng Jun.

479
00:34:56,091 --> 00:34:59,491
Please hand over the military affairs to Licheng Jun.

480
00:34:59,491 --> 00:35:05,120
Your Highness, please leave the military affairs to Licheng Jun.

481
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,781
Please Your Highness,

482
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:10,891
Your Highness

483
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:19,211
Please Your Highness,

484
00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:29,641
You should have been protecting the king in the palace.

485
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,811
Now they come out to threaten me

486
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:33,871
Temperance

487
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:34,971
exist

488
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:52,721
Except for the one you are loyal to, I will kill all the others.

489
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,801
quick

490
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:59,311
Your Highness

491
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:01,031
Your Highness

492
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,421
These generals should have been my generals

493
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:11,501
Soldiers should also be my soldiers

494
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,751
But now

495
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:17,661
You who should have protected me, all of you came out to protect Licheng Jun

496
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:21,531
Do you recognize Licheng Jun?

497
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:24,491
Do you totally disown me?

498
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:33,411
Empress of the Middle Temple

499
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:34,821
Servant Xu Shanggong

500
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:36,011
Open it

501
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,201
Empress of the Middle Temple

502
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:43,531
His Majesty ordered the Queen to enter the main hall

503
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:44,181
What happened

504
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:48,301
I heard that a hundred people gathered in front of the main hall to support Li Chengjun.

505
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:50,381
[Ranks of officers in the Five Guards of the Capital City Defense Force]

506
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:49,061
What

507
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:52,981
The Crown Prince has also been summoned to the main hall.

508
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:09,141
The Crown Prince

509
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:15,581
I intend to pass the throne to my son.

510
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:16,851
Your Highness

511
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:39,621
Your Highness

512
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:41,281
Never, Your Highness.

513
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:43,581
Please explain the reason, Your Highness.

514
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:57,741
Please take back your order.

515
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,591
Your Highness

516
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:12,901
Your Highness

517
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,441
We need to establish an internal bureau

518
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:33,501
[A system in which the king summons a small number of trusted ministers to handle major state affairs]

519
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,721
The prince is still young. If he inherits the throne

520
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:34,111
Ministers are needed to assist

521
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,631
It's best to set it up quickly tonight.

522
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:39,521
I will see His Majesty tomorrow morning.

523
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:40,641
only

524
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:42,461
I don't know what the Lord means...

525
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:43,711
The Lord's intention

526
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:45,251
Why is it important?

527
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:48,951
If we miss this opportunity, the master will accuse us of using unfair means to increase the number of servants.

528
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,791
Eradicate all of our Min family

529
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,311
yes

530
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:55,621
The Lord has already said this.

531
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:58,761
The prince is ours

532
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:01,011
Go strengthen the palace's security.

533
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:04,211
If there is any disturbance in the palace, report it immediately

534
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,311
yes

535
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:08,761
Also, let me tell you that although it is late at night

536
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:11,001
But those ministers who are interested in joining can come to my house now.

537
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:11,791
yes

538
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,001
Second Brother

539
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:16,071
Should I inform the Queen Mother... Not yet?

540
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,531
Now is not the time

541
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:28,631
Nei Zaishu

542
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:29,751
yes

543
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:34,431
It seems that this time I can tell who is the traitor.

544
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:40,681
Except for the guards loyal to the Min family, they will quietly gather troops tomorrow morning.

545
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:41,361
yes

546
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:47,661
Also find out who went to the Min family tonight.

547
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:52,271
It's your highness

548
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:27,481
Just wait for your father to revoke his order.

549
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:27,751
[Give orders]

550
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,661
Ti'er waited with his mother.

551
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,431
It's the Queen Mother

552
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:36,321
Empress of the Middle Temple

553
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:39,911
I heard that the Lord sent the imperial seal to the East Palace.

554
00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:40,641
[The Eastern Palace is mainly where the Crown Prince lives]

555
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:02,781
Thank you for coming.

556
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,221
The adults are here

557
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:07,681
I believe you have heard

558
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:11,211
The Lord said that he would pass the throne to the Crown Prince

559
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:12,141
Although it is late at night

560
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:14,141
But we should form a internal bureau

561
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:17,411
Tomorrow morning, I will report to His Majesty...

562
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:20,781
Once the order is received, all must be captured without leaving any alive.

563
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:21,831
yes

564
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:27,001
The Lord has no intention of passing on the throne

565
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:34,821
This time, I just want to get rid of my two younger brothers.

566
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,881
But so

567
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,351
I heard tonight

568
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:48,501
They will form a Nezaishu

569
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:52,071
Request to see the emperor alone tomorrow morning

570
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:56,561
The Lord will quietly order the troops to guard

571
00:41:56,561 --> 00:42:01,661
The person that Lijiangjun and Lichengjun revealed was the prince's mansion

572
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:50,461
His Majesty the Lord

573
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:53,741
The Queen and the Crown Prince have arrived.

574
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:56,151
I'm afraid your highness has already rested.

575
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:57,851
Get out of the way

576
00:42:57,851 --> 00:42:59,351
Empress of the Middle Temple

577
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:13,241
Father, please take back your order.

578
00:43:14,531 --> 00:43:15,871
nave

579
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:17,581
Why is the central hall like this?

580
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:30,141
The prince is too ignorant to take on the responsibility of being a king.

581
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,061
That's better

582
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:34,791
The Central Palace ruled from behind the curtain

583
00:43:33,101 --> 00:43:38,371
[When a young king ascends the throne
A system whereby the most senior queen or queen dowager in the royal family handles government affairs on behalf of the king.

584
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:43,061
Present the Imperial Seal to His Highness

585
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:57,101
What is the middle temple doing?

586
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:00,211
I want to perform the silkworm ceremony

587
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:01,591
[The Silkworm Ceremony is a ceremony where the princess personally picks mulberry leaves and feeds the silkworms
Etiquette to encourage people to be diligent in weaving
It is also the only royal etiquette led by women.

588
00:44:00,211 --> 00:44:01,551
Where does the silkworm ceremony come from?

589
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:05,171
I must first offer sacrifices to the Silkworm God.

590
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:09,941
In order to ensure the silkworm ceremony, your highness's imperial seal must be used.

591
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:13,831
I have passed the throne to the Crown Prince

592
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:16,201
Please ask Your Highness to withdraw the imperial decree

593
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:18,731
Granted the imperial seal to allow me to perform the silkworm ceremony

594
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:19,511
nave

595
00:44:19,511 --> 00:44:21,331
otherwise

596
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:23,391
Your Highness wants me to hold the prince's hand now.

597
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:26,931
Go to my mother's family who founded the Neizaishu?

598
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:27,651
What

599
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:32,301
Your Highness's sword is really meant to be pointed at me.

600
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:35,521
Pointing to the prince?

601
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:48,081
My father has no intention of killing you.

602
00:44:48,651 --> 00:44:51,471
I did this to save you.

603
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:55,751
As long as the father shows the slightest flaw

604
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:58,631
Those officials then pretended to suppress

605
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:01,461
They are trying to suppress and seize the power of their father.

606
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:03,011
If we let them control us

607
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:05,101
The ancestral temples and the country will be in ruins

608
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:06,491
Father

609
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:07,451
Please also ask the father to give the jade seal...

610
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:08,801
Father

611
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:11,891
When your father was your age, he could recite the Four Books and Five Classics.

612
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:14,551
I have always had the ambition to govern the country

613
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:15,951
Jin Shanggong

614
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:18,401
exist

615
00:45:18,401 --> 00:45:21,021
Please ask the prince to return to the East Palace

616
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:23,101
Send the person back quickly

617
00:45:49,721 --> 00:45:51,821
If tomorrow morning

618
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:56,521
My concubine's brothers have brought the prince into the palace. What should you do?

619
00:45:56,521 --> 00:46:00,721
If they come to the palace and say that the inner court has been established

620
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:03,591
Now, Your Highness can step down from the throne.

621
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:07,851
Will Your Highness agree to this?

622
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:24,631
Why do I want to pass the throne to the crown prince?

623
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,121
Has the Central Palace ever thought about

624
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:34,461
Licheng Jun led a group of officers and refused to give up military duties.

625
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,981
Use the power of the army to threaten me

626
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:40,011
How does Lichengjun view me as the ruler of a country?

627
00:46:40,011 --> 00:46:42,451
In this case, Your Highness should compete on the spot.

628
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:44,711
How to Compare

629
00:46:44,711 --> 00:46:48,441
At the moment, I donâ€™t know how many people in the court follow the Min family.

630
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:51,081
The sword

631
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:56,761
When the enemy can see clearly,

632
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:59,911
Did you just mention enemies?

633
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:05,191
so

634
00:47:05,751 --> 00:47:09,101
I, an incompetent king, can only give up my throne.

635
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:12,221
In this way, the court will

636
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:14,881
Place our prince in the center of the battlefield

637
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:16,951
The blood flowed like a river

638
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:19,921
In this way, no matter who

639
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:23,731
They can't bear the life of our prince.

640
00:47:26,321 --> 00:47:30,011
Please revoke your order to pass on the throne.

641
00:47:39,711 --> 00:47:44,551
I will take the prince to my mother's house now.

642
00:47:45,481 --> 00:47:48,271
The Central Palace doesn't care about me at all

643
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:50,991
Will I finally fight against the gnome?

644
00:47:50,991 --> 00:47:55,421
I will protect the prince.

645
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:12,031
If Your Highness grants the imperial seal promising the silkworm ceremony, I will come back.

646
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,771
I will wait until tomorrow at midnight.

647
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:18,071
Wait till later?

648
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:22,521
I will personally form the Internal Affairs Office

649
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:26,911
Come to receive the imperial edict from His Highness

650
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:43,211
Empress of the Middle Temple

651
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,201
Madam, why is this happening?

652
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:48,941
My Lord, please pretend that this never happened.

653
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:53,231
Or should I pass the throne to the crown prince now?

654
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,261
It must be one of the two

655
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:19,751
Go report it.

656
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:21,451
No

657
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:22,101
What

658
00:49:22,101 --> 00:49:25,261
His Majesty has ordered that no one be allowed to enter.

659
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:28,221
Your Highness's Concubine Ringtone

660
00:49:28,221 --> 00:49:28,961
Lady Shuyi

661
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:30,761
Your Highness

662
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:34,931
Your Highness

663
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:47,031
Empress of the Middle Temple

664
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:48,311
Xu Shanggong

665
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:49,781
Your Highness

666
00:49:50,461 --> 00:49:52,201
I have conveyed the Queen's order.

667
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:56,381
Those who came to the mansion to form the inner court have already dispersed.

668
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:57,451
Thank you for your hard work, Lady Xu

669
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:58,661
Just why...

670
00:49:58,661 --> 00:49:59,341
Niangniang

671
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:00,381
Empress of the Middle Temple

672
00:50:00,381 --> 00:50:02,311
Dixia Dixia

673
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:04,921
How come...

674
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:15,251
Your Highness, please revoke your order to pass on the throne.

675
00:50:17,761 --> 00:50:18,531
Where is the imperial seal?

676
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:22,781
His Highness heard that he was sent to the East Palace again in the early morning

677
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:25,281
Please ask Your Highness to withdraw the order to pass on the throne. I heard that the prince went to the residence of Won-gun in Lixingfu.

678
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:25,961
This won't really...

679
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:27,301
Shhh

680
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:35,651
Your Highness, please revoke your order to pass on the throne.

681
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,391
Your Highness, please take it back...

682
00:50:40,391 --> 00:50:41,201
Please help report

683
00:50:41,201 --> 00:50:44,841
Your Highness does not allow anyone to enter unless summoned. Please take back your order.

684
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:53,401
Your Highness, please revoke your order to pass on the throne.

685
00:50:55,811 --> 00:50:57,151
Didn't you sleep last night?

686
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:01,311
I left the palace last night and came back in the early morning.

687
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:08,561
Your Highness, please revoke your order to pass on the throne.

688
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:16,921
Your Highness, please revoke your order to pass on the throne.

689
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:17,991
knew

690
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:27,451
Your Highness, please revoke your order to pass on the throne.

691
00:51:31,011 --> 00:51:35,861
Your Highness also asks Your Highness to take back the throne...

692
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:42,711
Does the Lord really want to pass on the throne?

693
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:47,221
His Highness originally wanted to screen out those who were loyal to the Min family and catch them all.

694
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:51,061
Last night, the palace returned to the Min Mansion

695
00:51:51,061 --> 00:51:52,901
So

696
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:57,021
Things get complicated

697
00:51:58,001 --> 00:52:00,631
His Highness has passed on the throne

698
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:03,541
It gave them the right to act.

699
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:05,461
I know

700
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:09,461
Many people in the palace followed Lixingbuwangun

701
00:52:06,841 --> 00:52:10,481
[Father of Queen Wonkyeongun of Yeoheungbu]

702
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:13,431
There are also many people from Lijiang Lord and Licheng Lord among the soldiers.

703
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,871
I know

704
00:52:14,871 --> 00:52:17,611
If the Queen Mother takes the lead in establishing the Internal Affairs Office

705
00:52:17,611 --> 00:52:20,501
The situation is completely different from that of Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun.

706
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:22,551
The Queen is the Crown Prince's mother.

707
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:23,391
I know

708
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,311
Everyone knows

709
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:29,551
Your Highness

710
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:35,231
If the Queen Mother of the Central Palace sets up the Internal Prime Minister Office and enters the palace

711
00:52:35,231 --> 00:52:37,691
Your Highness may bear

712
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:44,331
If His Highness can bear it, the Queen will be hurt.

713
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:49,141
If His Highness cannot bear it, I am afraid he will really pass on the throne.

714
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:12,951
The Queen Mother said earlier that she was in a hurry to hold the Silkworm Ceremony.

715
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:15,891
I must agree to the relevant sacrifices

716
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:21,851
I will grant you the imperial seal

717
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:24,831
To convey the decree

718
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:27,671
Your Majesty,

719
00:53:39,521 --> 00:53:42,781
Regardless of whether I will return to the palace

720
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:48,501
You all have to resign and give up your military power.

721

Empress of the Middle Temple Empress of the Middle Temple

722
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:51,651
You have previously taken hundreds of good people as domestic slaves.

723
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:54,331
This matter should also be held responsible

724
00:53:57,491 --> 00:53:58,961
This is...

725
00:54:00,231 --> 00:54:02,641
The Lord's intention

726
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:05,001
It is the Lord's intention

727
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:07,151
This is what the palace meant.

728
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:11,591
Empress of the Middle Temple

729
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:14,591
You guys go down

730
00:54:15,081 --> 00:54:19,121
This is a confirmation that the Lord will not pass on the throne.

731
00:54:20,111 --> 00:54:22,171
You mean the Queen Mother?

732
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:28,141
What will happen to us who formed the Neizaishu?

733
00:54:30,411 --> 00:54:32,521
That's really sloppy.

734
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:34,461
no

735
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:37,191
The master clearly revealed a flaw

736
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:37,771
Then we will go straight to Huanglong...

737
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:41,871
The Central Palace must be completely on our side in this matter.

738
00:54:41,871 --> 00:54:44,811
If not

739
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:46,591
We can't do anything.

740
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:49,941
It is better to follow the wishes of the Queen Mother.

741
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:53,341
Be humble and keep quiet

742
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:03,471
I know that there are hundreds of good people who have been forcibly conscripted into slavery in your mansions.

743
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:06,331
But think calmly

744
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:09,521
I'm afraid this isn't just the case with my brothers.

745
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:11,651
how

746
00:55:11,651 --> 00:55:13,401
When the imperial court moved the capital to Hanyang

747
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:19,291
The powerful officials who did not have enough houses took away the houses of the people.

748
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,311
Yeah

749
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:27,841
Those displaced people could only become slaves to the royal family.

750
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:29,431
You're talking about royal relatives...

751
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:31,851
Powerful and influential officials

752
00:55:31,851 --> 00:55:33,991
Especially those relatives

753
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:36,051
Powerful and influential officials

754
00:55:36,051 --> 00:55:37,311
Especially those relatives

755
00:55:37,311 --> 00:55:44,241
Among those powerful clan members who were nominated was the Yegu Jin Clan.

756
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:47,181
Night Valeâ€¦Kimâ€™s

757
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:52,491
I heard that this person is also a distant relative of the royal family.

758
00:55:56,591 --> 00:56:02,301
Sir, you may have guessed who the patriarch of the Nightvale Jin Clan is.

759
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:06,661
If I don't have someone to back me up, I can't handle this alone.

760
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:09,961
I'll go check it out.

761
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:11,321
besides

762
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:14,871
My brothers

763
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:18,481
Could it be related to the Yegu Jin family?

764
00:56:19,191 --> 00:56:22,741
This is the clan expanding its power

765
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:26,291
How could I bring in my relatives?

766
00:56:29,641 --> 00:56:31,071
Empress of the Middle Temple

767
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:33,021
Empress of the Middle Temple

768
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:35,881
The Grand Master of the Palace has arrived.

769
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:42,221
The Lord has withdrawn the imperial decree

770
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:46,501
Now you can return to the palace.

[Yunqin Silkworm Ceremony]

772
00:57:00,811 --> 00:57:04,071
After receiving the order, the queen returned to the palace immediately.

773
00:57:04,071 --> 00:57:06,461
Waiting in the palace now

774
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:10,361
Your Highness

775
00:57:14,671 --> 00:57:19,191
All the officials who gathered at the palace last night have been found out.

776
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:19,191
[The father of the princess, the monarchâ€™s father-in-law]

777
00:57:19,191 --> 00:57:22,681
I don't know why His Highness didn't give any instructions.

778
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:26,871
I plan to wait and see for a while.

779
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:31,341
In this case, I would like to ask your Highness to appoint me as the commander of the right army.

780
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:39,171
If Your Highness orders me to be a loyal dog, I will be this loyal dog.

781
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:45,871
I will consider it.

782
00:58:07,331 --> 00:58:09,701
Does the Central Temple have to do this?

783
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:14,261
I really have no other way to stop His Highness.

784
00:58:16,391 --> 00:58:18,991
It was you who abandoned me

785
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:23,551
I have never abandoned Your Highness for a moment.

786
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:27,571
You said you never abandoned me

787
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:32,581
I have never abandoned Your Highness for a moment.

788
00:58:32,581 --> 00:58:35,351
I always stand beside your Highness.

789
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:39,311
But where is His Highness standing?

790
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:49,971
At present, the courtiers are like a vast ocean.

791
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,201
I am like that lonely island

792
00:58:56,871 --> 00:58:58,161
Your Highness

793
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:05,951
My brothers will give up all their military power.

794
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:09,061
I have already removed them from the prince's side.

795
00:59:09,061 --> 00:59:11,141
After clearing

796
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:15,751
There will be dozens of Lijiang Lords and hundreds of Licheng Lords appearing.

797
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,361
There are relatives among the clan and there are relatives outside the clan.

798
00:59:17,361 --> 00:59:19,491
Side halls will also be everywhere

799
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:24,541
Can they clean them all?

800
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:28,651

803
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:14,781
He should be able to earn ten times the interest.

804
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:18,891
I saw with my own eyes how they were displaced.

805
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:21,561
Someone must be making huge profits from this

806
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:25,091
Why let a mere woman run wild like this?

807
01:00:25,091 --> 01:00:28,231
If Queen Shende is reborn, will she look like this?

808
01:00:28,231 --> 01:00:30,311
The palace is overstepping its bounds by doing this now.

809
01:00:30,311 --> 01:00:32,041
Please take back your order.
