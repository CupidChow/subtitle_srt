No other princes and princesses are allowed to come

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,360
good

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,890
The prince was suffering from pox

14
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,890
I think it will spread among the people.

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,670
Your Highness must take good care of the people of Dawn

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,840
Cheng Ning here

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,610
I will keep it

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,680
My son is so seriously ill

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,430
You call me a widow...

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,130
Go take care of the people of Dawn first

21
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,929
But...I can still live

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,989
Save Him

23
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,970
He must be saved

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,209
Be sure to...

25
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,790
Save him

26
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,610
Take care of the nave

[Seoul Pan-yin, the head of the government agency that governs the Joseon capital of Hanyang]

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,400
Isolate the patient

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,610
Allocate funds from my treasury to provide relief to the quarantined people

[King Yuku's private storehouse (warehouse)]

34
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,790
yes

35
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,620
How is Chengning doing?

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,020
The prince has taken the medicine and rested.

37
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,930
Where is the nave?

38
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,170
The queen stayed by the prince's side without leaving for a moment.

39
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,600
[Episode 12]

40
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,540
Chungnyeong

41
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,110
How is the Maharaja here?

42
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,780
But I was looking for medical books.

43
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,710
yes

44
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,530
I thought maybe Lord Chengning would be able to use it.

45
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,400
This is why I came here.

46
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,430
Netosan

47
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,980
The imperial physician prescribed the antidote and detoxification soup.

48
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,469
I looked for the "Miscellaneous Prescriptions for Children" in the "Country Medicine for Emergency Recipes"

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,180
["Hometown Medicine for Emergency Use": The oldest medical book in Korean history
"Miscellaneous Prescriptions for Children": Prescriptions for treating children from "Country Medicine for Emergency"]

50
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:31,170
I heard that pox will start to ooze pus from the third day.

51
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,780
To let the pus flow out

52
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,750
It is better to use it together with the prescription of Neituo San

53
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,460
I intend to make this suggestion

54
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,730
The Maharaja is so troubled

55
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,910
I think that Prince Chengning will get better.

56
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,540
I wonder if any of my servants can help.

57
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,350
To eliminate the pus, His Highness

58
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,460
The imperial physician prescribed Netosan

59
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,030
Netosan

60
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,640
very good

61
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,620
I am praying to the gods of heaven and earth.

62
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,050
Many thanks

63
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,900
The order and rules of the palace concubines are assisted by Zheng Shanggong

64
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,960
I take care of it meticulously

65
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,440
My lady, you don't have to worry.

66
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,810
good

67
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,300
I have known the Queen for most of my life.

68
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,070
The lady looks like this

69
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,450
I'm really worried that I might fall ill.

70
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,700
I was wondering what the child's weight loss meant.

71
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:56,090
Now I understand it completely

72
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,290
Princess

73
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,930
I don't know what the princess wants.

74
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,630
I'm looking for some medicine to present to Her Majesty.

75
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,530
What is this

76
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,500
ah

77
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,370
This is Suhe oil

78
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,460
[Oil from the Styrax tree is used to treat skin diseases]

79
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,030
But it's broken

80
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,650
What

81
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,200
Isn't this sesame-sized thing a bug?

82
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,310
ah

83
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,280
Ah this...

84
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,090
Suhe oil is a medicinal material used by His Majesty.

85
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,780
Is it like this when you get the herbs?

86
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,590
Or maybe it was due to improper storage.

87
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,190
And... not properly kept

88
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,070
So who was responsible for delivering the herbs?

89
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,140
It was the knowledge that was dismissed earlier.

90
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,880
[The secretary who conveyed the imperial edict]

91
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,720
Liusina

92
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,870
yes

93
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,030
It is the person who relies on the knowledge of the matter to deliver the medicine.

94
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,830
It is said that he is the elder brother of the Grand Palace's most powerful concubine Jin Shanggong.

95
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,190
His Majesty has arrived

96
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,040
Go take a nap

97
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,030
Cheng Ning has a widow guarding

98
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,710
Let's go take a rest in the middle hall.

99
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,070
When Cheng Ning was born

100
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,750
I think God

101
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,940
This is to prevent His Highness and I from parting ways.

102
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,160
This child was sent here

103
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,290
I always thought he was a gift from God.

104
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm afraid

105
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,950
Afraid of losing this child

106
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,890
I am really afraid

107
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,190
Cheng Ning

108
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,690
Cheng Ning

109
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,260
Cheng Ning...

110
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,560
Cheng Ning

111
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,710
Cheng Ning

112
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:29,480
Let's all go and say goodbye to Lord Chengning.

113
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,250
But where is the prince?

114
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,350
When my brother was dying

115
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,130
You're hunting

116
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,090
Your brother is dying.

117
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,420
Are you still a human being?

118
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:04,130
Are you still a human being like this?

119
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:18,810
The Lord was not able to see Cheng Ning's burial

120
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,910
My Lord is the King

121
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,960
Don't touch the coffin.

122
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,530
I also failed to see Cheng Ning buried

123
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:33,930
But you did all these things

124
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,740
Queen Mother

125
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,180
As a brother

126
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,840
You did a great job

127
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,850
The Crown Prince's family was drinking and having fun outside the palace

128
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,760
Showing the people in an indecent manner

129
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,600
During the last hunt, the Crown Prince injured the people's cows and pigs.

130
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,400
Disaster to the people

131
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,890
The prince believed the slander of the treacherous ministers

132
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,420
Lust for women and committing many unjust acts

133
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,760
The will of the people is God’s will

134
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,070
Please depose the crown prince.

135
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,630
Banish the prince to a foreign land

136
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,490
[Other places besides Waifang Hanyang]

137
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,700
Your Highness

138
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,510
Please depose the crown prince and expel him to a foreign land.

139
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,840
The Uijeongbu and the Three Meritorious Officials

140
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,050
Six Cao

141
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,340
The Three Military Command Office

142
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,680
Everyone is here. Everyone is here.

143
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,490
But no one spoke up for the prince.

144
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,380
Do you want to open the window?

145
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,060
It's sunny outside

146
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,650
Madam Queen, I'm going to open the window.

147
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,430
It's true

148
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,310
Green is a color but also has a fragrance

149
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:41,780
The Lord intends to depose you, the Crown Prince

150
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,890
When the imperial edict arrives, you must not panic

151
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,720
Until the end, you must maintain the dignity of the prince.

152
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,730
yes

153
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,840
You've become a waste.

154
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:05,300
You are the eldest son in the family, and that will not change.

155
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:13,390
There is something I must say.

156
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,550
Chungnyeong...looks a lot like his father

157
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,550
Chungnyeong

158
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,500
Chungnyeong obviously wants to do something for the people.

159
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,930
He has ambition and perseverance.

160
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,820
What's the difference between me and my father?

161
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:42,000
That is, the father does not have a mother like the queen mother.

162
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,430
The Crown Prince

163
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,770
I will get along well with my brothers.

164
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,210
Live a life of leisure and comfort

165
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,240
So don't worry, mother.

166
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,560
Thank you

167
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,440
The prince's behavior is extremely unrighteous

168
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,090
Unable to inherit the throne, all ministers and officials please

169
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,490
Now I abolish the title of Crown Prince Li

170
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,490
Degraded to let Ning Dajun serve him

171
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,790
The deposed prince made Ning have two sons

172
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,700
The eldest son is six years old and the second son is three years old

173
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,410
I will pass the throne to the eldest son of Prince Rangnying.

174
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:52,890
As for whether you should call him the Prince of Wang or the Grandson of Wang Taisun.

175
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,620
Please think carefully before reporting.

176
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,370
yes

177
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,400
The reason why I took so much trouble to invite all the censors to come here

178
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,970
This is to establish the heir apparent.

179
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,380
The master is considering the eldest son of the deposed prince Rang Ning.

180
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,360
But I have objections.

181
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,380
But the empress of the middle palace

182
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,690
Who can change His Highness's mind?

183
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,860
If you want to change the master's mind, you have to risk your life.

184
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,630
Once you make your decision, Your Highness will only focus on the road ahead.

185
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,390
I don't listen to what others say.

186
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,020
I will find a way to make His Highness listen.

187
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,990
Please advise on the most suitable candidate for the crown prince.

188
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,770
Put your faith in admonishing others and make remonstrances

189
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,270
Forget about others, why does the princess treat me like this?

190
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,420
I want to present it to the master. The Suhe oil has gone bad.

191
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,110
Your brother was responsible for bringing this item into the palace.

192
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,210
I don't know

193
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,020
It must have gone bad after it was handed over to the palace.

194
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,680
So we need to understand clearly

195
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,010
Was it before or after entering the palace?

196
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,850
I am just curious why the princess has to be the one to handle this matter.

197
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,390
Because I will never let you off easily.

198
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,980
What

199
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,870
In the early morning of the day of the silkworm ceremony

200
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,180
[The Silkworm Ceremony is a ceremony where the princess personally picks mulberry leaves and feeds the silkworms
A ceremony to pray for a good harvest (the only ceremony led by the Queen)]

201
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,390
You added Xanthium sibiricum to the bath water of the Queen Mother.

202
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,090
If inhaled continuously, it may damage the liver and cause death.

203
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,280
Did the princess see it with her own eyes?

204
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,490
It's just conjecture.

205
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,000
There is no evidence

206
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,910
At that time, the palace

207
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,720
I thought you were my man, so I didn't leave any evidence.

208
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,410
I regretted it.

209
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,790
I also blamed myself

210
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,420
Since when did the princess become so determined to become the queen's person?

211
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,850
Since when?

212
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,650
If you climb from the bottom to the top

213
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,540
It's hard to look back down naturally

214
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,320
After all, my horizons have been raised.

215
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,120
But you know that if you go down from the peak

216
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,240
What will you see first?

217
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,570
I can see your thoughts clearly from the low place.

218
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:21,440
So now the princess is planning to join the Empress?

219
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,470
As long as you are willing to take me in

220
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,030
No matter who it is, I will be loyal to you.

221
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,700
Forget about others, how can you not know

222
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,440
Madam Princess, the servant is coming in

223
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,890
Take people away

224
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,970
Letting go

225
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,300
Let me go

226
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,140
When the crown prince comes to the throne, he will definitely reuse Anseongfuwon Lord again.

227
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,780
If you consider the future, you should not treat me like this.

228
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,040
Unfortunately, your hopes may be dashed.

229
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,600
Have a nice trip

230
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,010
Take her away

231
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,360
open

232
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,140
Princess Princess

233
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,350
Let me go

234
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,450
Princess

235
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,010
Waiting for the prince to confirm

236
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,500
I want to become the prince's teacher.

237
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:28,160
[The Crown Prince's Teacher is an official position responsible for educating the Crown Prince]

238
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
You want to be the prince's teacher?

239
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,630
yes

240
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,900
Why

241
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,520
First

242
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,340
Different from other ministers

243
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,350
The prince's teacher should not be used as a stepping stone to power

244
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,460
second

245
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,560
I want to teach you what kind of person should be a king.

246
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,900
So what kind of person should become a king?

247
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,170
Emperor Yao once said

248
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,520
God appoints a king

249
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,720
I don't love the monarch alone.

250
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,320
But for millions of people

251
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,910
This is what His Majesty the King once said.

252
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,790
A King with a Heart for His People

253
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,510
I will not be selfish

254
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,660
Pass on the wisdom he has learned to the new prince completely

255
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,200
Selfishness

256
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,260
Are you really selfless?

257
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,390
In the eyes of the Queen Mother, you are selfish.

258
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,380
Queen Mother

259
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,120
Once you have power

260
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,700
You will want to use this power to act. You have this desire.

261
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,070
No, I'm just...

262
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,230
Even if I can't become the king of a country

263
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,970
Even if I become the Prince's Master

264
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,300
You also want to use this to quench your desire.

265
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,570
This is your selfishness

266
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:55,790
I know exactly what my father is worried about.

267
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,150
The reason why I no longer have greed is because of this.

268
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,070
Your Highness looks very thoughtful.

269
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,310
Chungnyeong is a suitable candidate for the crown prince

270
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,600
The censors submitted memorials one after another, all with the same opinion

271
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,790
It must have been arranged by the Central Palace.

272
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,390
What is your highness's plan?

273
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,080
There is plenty of time to teach Ning Changzi the ways of a king.

274
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,050
This servant dares to report to His Majesty

275
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,070
The Empress sent a message to ask His Highness

276
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,790
It's late at night

277
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,920
Please go, Your Highness.

278
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,610
The Queen Mother would invite His Highness so late at night for something special.

279
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,190
His Majesty has arrived

280
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,720
Why is the abandoned prince, who should be outside the palace, here at this time?

281
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,580
It was I who secretly summoned him into the palace.

282
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,170
Last time

283
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,330
You once told my mother that Chungnyeong looks like His Highness.

284
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,980
yes

285
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,770
You also said that you would never be greedy for power in this life

286
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,280
But I will get along with my brothers

287
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,040
yes

288
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,690
Are you willing to swear in front of His Majesty?

289
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,690
Yes, mother

290
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,150
The abandoned prince made Ning

291
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,850
To help his father

292
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,690
Daring to enter the palace

293
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,650
Sharing worries

294
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,870
Although I am already the deposed prince

295
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:51,900
But I will never blame my father.

296
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,340
If someone covets power and deliberately approaches the son

297
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,410
I will definitely chop him off.

298
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,980
If one of the younger brothers ascends the throne

299
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,820
I will definitely become his loyal minister.

300
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,070
Among the younger brothers

301
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,430
But the middle temple asked you to say so

302
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,860
There will be no more quarrels between brothers

303
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,020
Rang Ning has sworn an oath

304
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,750
nave

305
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,020
Earlier Year of Wuyin

306
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,690
[The year of Wuyin, the year when the first Prince Rebellion broke out]

307
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,480
Crown Prince Lee Bang-seok and Prince An-gun Lee Bang-bum

308
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,460
The two younger brothers ascended the throne

309
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,010
It's not your highness's fault.

310
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,410
Why did the middle temple suddenly mention these?

311
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,140
That is God's will.

312
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,990
God appoints a king

313
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,110
I don't love the monarch alone.

314
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,460
But for millions of people

315
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,580
This is what the Supreme King said.

316
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,760
[The father of the Grand King Taejo Lee Seong-gye and the King Taejong Lee Bang-won]

317
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,760
That's destiny

318
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:13,370
Please see clearly who holds the fate now.

319
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,250
I will take my leave first.

320
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,720
Queen Mother

321
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:26,450
The stars are especially bright tonight

322
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,180
There is a star over there

323
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,870
Shining blue light

324
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,200
I intend to give the

325
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,020
He personally copied the "University Commentary" for a long time and gave it to Zhongning

326
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,600
Although such a heavy seat

327
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,360
But you said you'd take it.

328
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,880
Then you have to make a decision.

329
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,560
If you have made up your mind, please make your will known to the Lord.

330
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:22,129
Mencius in answer to the question of King Xuan of Qi

331
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:25,780
I have mentioned that the people are more important than the king.

332
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,850
What will happen if the king cannot be benevolent?

333
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,129
I report this with fear

334
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:39,280
The people may rebel with hammers and the king must be vigilant at all times

335
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,060
I think this is the lesson.

336
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,700
Chungnyeong

337
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,879
The reason why my father raised his sword in the year of Wuyin

338
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,620
It is also the hammer pointing at the unqualified prince.

339
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,320
This is what I think

340
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,620
Chungnyeong

341
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,000
My son is here

342
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,970
Do you want to be the king?

343
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,310
have

344
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,760
What kind of king do you want to be?

345
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,110
I want to give the people the best treatment in the world.

346
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,930
Become a king that is feared by the people

347
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,970
From now on

348
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,720
My father is about to get off the tiger he is riding.

349
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,680
Chungnyeong took the copy of the "University" written by Jungjeon himself.

350
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:58,000
[The Great Learning Explanation, a book in the Confucian classics that elaborates on the Great Learning]

351
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,190
You take this book back

352
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,310
What kind of king will give his people the best treatment in the world?

353
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:05,010
What kind of king would be afraid of his people?

354
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,020
You should study it thoroughly.

355
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,240
It's the father

356
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,060
[Taizong Yi Bangwon, the third king of Joseon, reigned from 1400 to 1418]

357
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,830
[King Sejong the Great]

358
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,200
Household hearing order

359
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,190
There was a lot of rain this year and the rice did not mature

360
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,300
The people are suffering from this

361
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,980
The inspectors of various places must investigate all the losses suffered by the people without missing any.

362
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,350
It's your highness

363
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,430
Before I ascended the throne, I had organized some measures to help the people.

364
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,140
You can refer to this.

365
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,120
It's your highness

366
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,280
Soldiers obey orders

367
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,160
We in Korea lack copper and sulfur for producing weapons.

368
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,060
It can be used as a reference for the weapons used by the Ming Dynasty

369
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,550
The most important thing is to study the production of copper

370
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,960
It's your highness

371
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,540
in addition

372
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,280
Min Wujiu

373
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,600
Min Wuji

374
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,680
Min Wuxiu

375
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,050
Min Wuhui

376
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,490
He is the younger brother of the concubine

377
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:11,230
After they were convicted, their families also became criminals.

378
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,400
I hope the Lord will have mercy on me.

379
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,550
Min Wujiu Min Wujiu Min Wuxiu Min Wuhui

380
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,680
I allow his family to live freely abroad.

381
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,920
Criminal sentencing check related bills later reported

382
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,700
But Your Highness

383
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,240
These people are all guilty of infidelity.

384
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,850
We cannot forgive you easily just because Your Highness has ascended the throne.

385
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,340
This is what the king ordered.

386
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,150
[King Lee Bang-won]

387
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,860
So I dare not disobey

388
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,770
[1420, the second year of King Sejong’s reign]

389
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,960
Let's go to Kaijing together

390
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,970
Why did His Highness suddenly mention going to Kaifeng?

391
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,680
I miss you very much

392
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,570
We were always young in Kaijing

393
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,790
Your Highness, are you reminiscing about your youth?

394
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,550
Miss you

395
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,910
If I were young again, would I want to become king again?

396
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,450
What would have happened if I had not become king?

397
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:59,080
The Queen Mother fell in love with me because I said I wanted to become the king, right?

398
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:06,400
Thank you for fulfilling your duty as king.

399
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,370
Because of the Queen Mother, I was able to come this far.

400
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,030
If a woman could be king

401
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,310
The Queen will surely become a more outstanding king than me.

402
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,120
Shouchang Palace

403
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,800
[Shouchang Palace is a Goryeo palace located in Kaesong]

404
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,330
When His Highness sat on the throne for the first time

405
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,580
I once asked my concubine

406
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,970
Do you want to sit on this dragon throne?

407
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,430
At that time, I was unable to answer

408
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:51,310
I was unable to answer and was lost in thought.

409
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:55,770
Thinking about whether I really want to sit on the throne

410
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:00,320
It is the concubine who wants to sit

411
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,750
But I gradually understood

412
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,850
Is it really power that I covet?

413
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:16,640
What I covet is not power but this world

414
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:29,180
Because I love this world, I don't care who sits on this throne.

415
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:46,270
We will set out for Kaijing tomorrow morning.

416
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,480
Rest early today.

417
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,620
Concubine

418
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,440
Concubine

419
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,010
The maid came in

420
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,090
Concubine

421
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:35,950
Concubine

422
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,990
It's malaria

423
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,980
[Malaria is an infectious disease with a high mortality rate]

424
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,300
malaria

425
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,030
No need to make a fuss

426
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,050
What should I do?

427
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,110
Therefore, the disease will fluctuate between hot and cold

428
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,720
Therefore, we need to consider whether to use warm medicine or cold medicine according to the condition.

429
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,180
I intend to go to Kaesong with His Majesty the King

430
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,940
No

431
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:23,550
Queen, maybe it's okay now, but you must not underestimate this disease just because the symptoms disappear.

432
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,550
In this case, does this mean that I need to go to a hospital for treatment?

433
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:29,110
[A place where a person moves to avoid illness]

434
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,880
I don't want to go

435
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,520
in this way

436
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,070
How about being careful on the way there?

437
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:44,360
This is what I wrote in the year of Bingyin at the Hiyan Temple.

438
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,810
Year of the Tiger

439
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,630
Could it be that I killed Pan Zhu?

440
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:02,810
The time when the Queen left the palace

441
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:13,920
I think if it weren't for now

442
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,820
I'm afraid there will be no chance for His Highness.

443
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,550
If you and I had not become king and queen

444
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,840
What will be the outcome?

445
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:00,500
Why did I think saving the world was the only meaningful life when I was young?

446
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,340
Even if I live a life of an ordinary person

447
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,630
As long as you are by my side

448
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,170
I'm happy enough in this life.

449
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,560
This is what I understand here.

450
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,120
concubine

451
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,110
Even if you feel cold all over, you have to bear it.

452
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,380
The heat must be dissipated

453
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,980
Let the widow come

454
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,660
Your Highness, please go back.

455
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,440
Kaijing...

456
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:14,510
Next time...next time

457
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,220
Tomorrow I will go to the minister's house to avoid illness.

458
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,980
If you insist... I understand the danger of this disease.

459
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,980
Could it be that I am the only one...

460
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,970
To hurt you like this

461
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,940
No

462
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,760
Birth, aging, illness and death are God's will

463
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,700
Please don't cry secretly.

464
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:40,450
Even the sadness behind the scenes can be felt.

465
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:50,780
now

466
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,510
I can be sober

467
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,950
Feel His Majesty's hands

468
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,730
That's enough

469
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,850
Who is good at treating the Queen Mother's malaria?

470
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:34,790
I will send out Yima to look for doctors everywhere.

471
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:36,950
[Post Horses belong to the state and are a means of transportation and communication]

472
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,080
If someone is good at diagnosis and treatment

473
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:41,140
I will definitely reward you handsomely

474
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,340
It's your highness

475
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,450
This is cooked with abalone presented as tribute from Gijang, Busan.

476
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,840
They say this is the ginseng of the sea.

477
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:04,720
Mother, please eat a little bit and don't leave any

478
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:26,490
The mother felt as if she had strength again.

479
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,630
Now, in the name of avoiding malaria

480
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,890
First, we went to the residence of General Guo Chengyou.

481
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,960
It's Si Yin Li Meng again

482
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,870
The House of Prince Kim Seung-gye

483
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:44,070
Moving around

484
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,130
Father

485
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,700
As long as I can save your mother's life

486
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,990
Even the ghost father will beg Him

487
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,180
But

488
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,550
That's it.

489
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,240
Father

490
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,890
You can't sell the Queen out of the palace.

491
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:11,420
The Lord must personally welcome the Queen back to the palace

492
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,920
The Queen Mother is a true hero who laid the foundation of the dynasty

493
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,150
My father wants to take care of his funeral.

494
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,700
yes

495
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,890
Father

496
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,410
Xu Shanggong

497
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,250
His Majesty the King came out in person to wait

498
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,380
I think the Queen must be grateful.

499
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,810
This is nothing compared to the way the Queen treated me.

500
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,490
How's the Queen?

501
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,320
I also went to see it yesterday

502
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:11,240
The voice and appearance are still the same as before

503
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,800
[Min, the Queen, who laid the foundation of Joseon Dynasty together with King Taejong Yi Bang-won
Posthumously named Queen Won-kyung]

504
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,050
[Min, the Queen, who laid the foundation of Joseon Dynasty together with King Taejong Yi Bang-won
She was posthumously named Queen Yuanjing
But her name is not recorded in history.]

505
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:32,730
[《Yuan Jing》]

506
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,650
[Thank you for remembering "Yuan Jing"]
