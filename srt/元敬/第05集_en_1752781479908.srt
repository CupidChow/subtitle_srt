12

The lady won't die.

22
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:21,008
But to me, she is already dead.

23
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:45,888
The queen's life is safe

24
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,608

The duties of the harem are not just to give birth to children

31
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,830
Your Majesty wants my life so badly

32
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,460
How can you say such a thing?

33
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,310
Look at you lying like this now

34
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,530
It makes me doubt whether you are worthy of me.

35
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,050
I took your life with my own hands

36
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,780
Madam, please go back.

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,060
From the beginning, you only wanted to seek the meaning of your existence from a man

38
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,670
This is how it fell

39
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,330
Madam, please go back.

40
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,010
Please, my lady.

41
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,640
Why don't you find the meaning of living now?

42
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
In this case, I am willing to help you

48
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,250
Go to Mishang Palace to ask for an audience

49
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,870
Where is your highness?

50
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,290
Your Highness is resting at the moment

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,970
The Lord and the Queen finally started fighting

52
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,050
This is how I see it

53
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,540
Cheng En Shang Gong is very accurate

54
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,620
I just don't know why they are arguing like this.

55
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:15,910
Only by removing the power of powerful officials can we establish a Joseon centered on the people.

56
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,160
His Majesty seems to have made up his mind.

57
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,970
But

58
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,390
Who is standing at the center of this powerful official?

59
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,550
Isn't it the Queen Mother and her Min family?

60
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:45,570
Now, His Highness has neither the Queen Mother nor the Filial Palace Master by his side.

61
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,410
There is no one beside His Highness.

62
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,810
yes

65
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,840
The Queen Mother is going too far.

66
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,850
If the queen can personally come out to stop it

67
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,550
Your Highness will be able to personally bring the Palace Master to...

68
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,850
Shut up

69
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,340
You must not discuss the Central Palace in this way without authorization.

70
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,380
yes

71
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,370

73

78

Whose farmland is so vast?

79
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,100
It belongs to Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun

80
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,750
When the king decided to return to the capital,

81
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,290
Many powerful officials bought these farmlands from farmers.

82
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,170
Very low price

83
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,750
I heard that they bought it at that time.

84
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,060
Brother, have you heard about it?

85
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,830
I heard that the Lord wanted to kill Yingshi in front of the Queen.

86
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,350
Not to kill her but to save her.

87
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
How do you say this?

88
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,810
Even so, Na Yingshi is dead anyway.

89
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,980
The forces that intend to restore the king to the throne are in league with Young-sil.

90
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,180
Only the Queen Mother can save Yingshi's life

91
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,460
Seeing no movement in the middle hall

92
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,830

in the end

94
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,000
This can only make the Queen Mother in trouble.

95
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,520

There should be quite a few

133

After all, these people hold money and information.

134
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,770
Is it the same with you, my dear?

135
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,330
I naturally enjoy some of the benefits that power brings.

136
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:41,010
However, these benefits of my ministers will definitely not harm the reforms that Your Highness dreams of.

You need to take good care of her and cherish her.

You all are...

187
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,740
Brothers

188
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,720
It's the Queen Mother

189
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,650
Niangniang

190
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,640
Empress of the Middle Temple

191
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,520
What

192
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,990
How long has it been since he recruited Yingshi into the palace?

193
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,650
She wants to take another harem

194
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,040
Isn't it ridiculous?

195
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,810
What's more, she is the daughter of Quan Hong.

196
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,890
Even Jianjia Lise

197
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,530
Jia...Jia...Jia Li Se

198
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,440
It must be that Shufan intended to humiliate the Queen Mother.

199
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,340
The Lord was bewitched by that uncle.

200
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,870
I want to establish a good etiquette and take Quan Hong's daughter into the harem

201
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,600
What

202
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,400
Your Highness

203
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,790
Your Highness, do you want to have a harem?

204
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,370
Your Highness is the king of a country, but he just wants to take concubines into the harem.

205
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,640
As subjects, we only need to accept the order.

206
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,040
But His Highness not only wants to take in a harem, but also wants to establish a good etiquette.

207
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,950
Your Highness wants to welcome the daughter of a scholar-official into the harem

208
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,080
Should be courteous

209
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,930
At present, the state affairs are heavy and piled up like a mountain

210
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,950
The reproduction of royal offspring is also a major state affair

211
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,220
Your Highness

212
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,770
temple...

213
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,970
No need

214
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,060
I am willing to wait

215
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,980
I heard that not long ago, Ancheng-kun accompanied His Highness to visit Quan Hong's residence.

216
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,180
How did Lichengjun know

217
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,170
Ancheng-kun, do you think there is an impenetrable wall in the world?

218
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,400
I think Licheng Jun is watching his lord's every move as a subject.

219
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,520
Ancheng-kun, please don't sow discord

220
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,140
How can we sow discord?

221
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,770
What I mean is that you should not provoke His Highness and our Min family.

222
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,550
Your Highness, what are you talking about?

223
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,770
Your Highness

224
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,600
Might as well continue

225
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,780
Your Highness

226
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,420
Ancheng-kun is just jealous of your highness's relationship with our Min family.

227
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,370
In order to provoke this, Quan Hong's daughter...

228
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,820
Licheng Jun thought that the Queen Mother had comforted the Lord.

229
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,970
you...

230
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,090
For a king, women should be a place of rest.

231
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,280
Not you...

232
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,660
you

233
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,970
Go and report

234
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,010
Your Highness, the Queen has arrived.

235
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,390
I intend to build a harem

236
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,570
This is also a concubine's matter

237
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,910
[All the maids in the palace with ranks]
This is also a concubine's matter

238
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,030
According to etiquette, this matter is done by...
[All the maids in the palace with ranks]

239
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,040
According to etiquette, this matter is done by...

240
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,830
No

241
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,610
No

242
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,130
If His Highness intends to hold a state wedding with great fanfare

243
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,470
The people would think that His Highness is going to welcome the new Queen into the palace.

244
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,790
The middle palace has too many thoughts and is too delusional.

245
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,930
If the newly-acquired concubine is favored and gives birth to a little prince

246
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,350
How can His Highness know that the bloody storm that His Highness has experienced will not happen again?

247
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,440
The Queen Mother doubts my feelings towards her.

248
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,850
yes

249
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,660
Where is Li Ti?

250
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,650
nave

251
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,660
My children

252
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,410
nave

253
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,460
Our Ti'er

254
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,420
Our Patient

255
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,850
Our son

256
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,430
I will keep these children's place.

257
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,210
They are all widows' children.

258
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,090
If Your Highness insists on doing so

259
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,080
I will die in front of your Highness.

260
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,100
What

261
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,820
If Your Highness has no more orders

262
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,230
I plan to go back to my parents' home.

263
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,940
I do not allow

264
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,050
If everything...

265
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,000
If the palace doesn't follow orders in every matter

266
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,030
I will eventually lose the love of the widower

267
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,520
Lost His Highness's Love

268
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,050
It will definitely not make me lose myself

269
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,020
This Korea was built by me.

270
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,380
The Queen must be a Korean woman

271
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,610
I wish

272
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,400
Died as a Goryeo woman

273
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,490
Still so leisurely

274
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,630
I heard that the new harem

275
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,660
Plays the Xuanqin very well

276
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,930
yes

277
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,570
It seems that she was influenced by her father.

278
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,260
As early as the Lord's residence

279
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,400
[The residence of the king before he ascended the throne]
As early as the Lord's residence

280
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,980
He would call the musicians to come to his house to play the piano and music.
[The residence of the king before he ascended the throne]

281
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,380
He would call the musicians to come to his house to play the piano and music.

282
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,900
Every time I look at His Majesty, who is intoxicated by the music,

283
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,520
I hope I am that Xuanqin

284
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,910
Daughter of Quan Hong

285
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,950
Is there any handle?

286
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,340
Hard to say

287
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,730
She comes from a wealthy family and is a lady from a noble family.

288
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,290
Nothing special

289
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,690
So I know

290
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,150
What do these people have?

291
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,600
This kind of person?

292
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,100
People who have always been in the spotlight

293
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,610
Someone who gets praised just for smiling

294
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,300
This is the kind of person I'm talking about.

295
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,700
later

296
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,080
I will bite these handles hard

297
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,700
lady...

298
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,390
But it's okay

299
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,940
I will just look ahead

300
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,700
Empress of the Middle Temple

301
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,970
Father

302
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,970
The hard work of the Central Palace

303
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,310
Come in quickly please

304
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,080
Mother

305
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,250
Not how...

306
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,520
Is my mother doing well?

307
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,480
Ouch

308
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,480
Ouch

309
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,160
His Majesty has arrived

310
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,140
This is a wine made with ginseng and Acanthopanax senticosus.

311
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,840
It will definitely warm your heart and soul.

312
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,330
The slave wants...

313
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,140
The birth of the little prince

314
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,130
I will give birth to a little prince...

315
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,990
From now on, I will not take any woman seriously.

316
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,340
Slave...

317
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,220
Already understood

318
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,280
I heard that Jia Li Se had sent the betrothal gifts to Quan Hong's mansion.

319
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,370
[The item that the groom gives to the bride when he proposes marriage]
I heard that Jia Li Se had sent the betrothal gifts to Quan Hong's mansion.

320
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,700
The Lord must be crazy
[The item that the groom gives to the bride when he proposes marriage]

321
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,340
The Lord must be crazy

322
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,410
That day, I blocked the iron hammer of the Supreme King at the Higan Temple.

323
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,280
[Father of King Lee Seong-gye and Lee Bang-won]
That day, I blocked the iron hammer of the Supreme King at the Higan Temple.

324
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,030
And he saved His Highness when the King was in danger of usurping the throne.
[Father of King Lee Seong-gye and Lee Bang-won]

325
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,230
And he saved His Highness when the King was in danger of usurping the throne.

326
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,810
[The second brother of King Lee Bang-gwa and Lee Bang-won]
And he saved His Highness when the King was in danger of usurping the throne.

327
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,010
But they are all the Queen Mother of the Central Palace
[The second brother of King Lee Bang-gwa and Lee Bang-won]

328
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,970
But they are all the Queen Mother of the Central Palace

329
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,440
But how could His Highness betray me like this?

330
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,710
The reason why the Lord would not hesitate to build a good etiquette

331
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,960
Na Quan entered the palace

332
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,300
They must be planning to use the Quan family to suppress our Min family.

333
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,810
What's more, the person in charge of Jia Li Se is Lord He Lun.

334
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,100
It's not about taking a harem.

335
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,080
Using Young-sil and Chae-ryeong to humiliate the Queen

336
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,240
This is completely different from the

337
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,450
Do you have the confidence to change this king?

338
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,770
Empress of the Middle Temple

339
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,060
If not

340
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,220
Just shut up for me.

341
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:50,080
I want to take the daughter of Sungkyunkwan Lejeong Kwon-hong into my harem

342
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,220
My dear ministers, you should do your best to prepare for the lottery.

343
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,500
There is no one in the palace at this moment.

344
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,950
Although the concubine...

345
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,760
Failure to give birth to a son

346
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,540
I'm a brother, and I've always treated her well because of our relationship over the years.

347
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,520
The Queen gave birth to three sons.

348
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,090
What is the Lord dissatisfied with?

349
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,320
The Supreme King once said that if we cannot suppress those powerful officials

350
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,020
After all, we cannot reform for the people.

351
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,780
The Min family in the middle hall

352
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,640
The core of the powerful officials

353
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,470
Therefore, the Lord wants to recruit more concubines to disperse the power of the Central Palace

354
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,520
Is this true?

355
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,140
The Lord never completely suppressed the confidence of the Central Palace from the beginning.

356
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,640
Therefore, no matter how you include her in the harem, the result will probably not change.

357
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:48,760
The Queen seems to have been away from the palace for too long.

358
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,390
Don't worry

359
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,000
I heard that Prince of Yan Zhu Di has seized the power of the Ming Dynasty.

360
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,710
[The Jingnan Campaign was launched by Zhu Di (Emperor Yongle) to save the country from his nephew Zhu Yunwen (Emperor Jianwen).

362
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,990
Where is Zhu Yunwen?

363
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,200
Where is Zhu Yunwen?

364
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,930
When Zhu Di's elite troops attacked Nanjing, Zhu Yunwen's whereabouts were unknown.

365
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:34,540
There are also rumors that Zhu Yunwen died miserably in the city to avoid the war.

366
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,690
only

367
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,300
My dear, report truthfully

368
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,980
Why should I look at the eyes of the gnomes?

369
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,230
I am terrified

370
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,120
In this case, it is necessary to ask Zhu Di for the imperial edict and seal.

371
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,270
[The document of enthronement of the King of Joseon received from China]
[The seal was bestowed upon the emperor when he received the imperial edict from China]
In this case, it is necessary to ask Zhu Di for the imperial edict and seal.

372
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,700
Formal discussion of tribute matters
[The document of enthronement of the King of Joseon received from China]
[The seal was bestowed upon the emperor when he received the imperial edict from China]

373
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,650
Formal discussion of tribute matters

374
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,210
Prepare for the Tribute with a Great Ceremony

375
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,270
As for the tribute and thank you gift, it should be determined by our dynasty

376
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,930
Serving a great power is a small country serving a great power with tribute.

377
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,900
Therefore, I think that the tribute and thank-you gift were determined privately.

378
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,460
Impolite

379
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,410
My dear, do you know why this big thing came about?

380
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,780
As early as the Shang and Zhou dynasties

381
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,620
In order to avoid war with surrounding vassal states, the Shang and Zhou dynasties accepted tribute

382
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,700
Adopt small countries to offer tribute

383
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,250
The great country responded with a thank you gift

384
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,260
This is the actual trade

385
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,060
Aiming to build good neighborliness through trade

386
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,640
But

387
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,750
My dear, why are you so humble and anxious to only think about offering sacrifices?

388
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,130
If you scold your subjects angrily because they don't know something

389
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,580
It will only make the ministers resent the king.

390
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,480
I think it would be better to invite the Queen Mother back.

391
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,210
Why the sudden mention of the Middle Temple?

392
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,780
Because His Highness seems to be uneasy

393
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,110
It was the Queen Mother who asked to leave the palace because she didn't want to see me.

394
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,020
Your Highness

395
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,800
Why can't Your Highness see through his own heart?

396
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,320
Why can't Your Highness see through his own heart?

397
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,360
I have fear in my heart

398
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,720
Don't be afraid

399
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,600
History tonight

400
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,720
She's definitely on our side.

401
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,700
Prepare the horse

402
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,840
Open the door

403
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,660
Open the door

404
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,630
The outsiders said that the prince had come down.

405
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,790
You said the Lord is coming

406
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,450
yes

407
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,180
Where is the good Lord now?

408
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,820
Go back to the wing room

409
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,880
His Highness told me to find a good day to come back.

410
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,940
So there is no need to make noise today

411
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,910
nave

412
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,690
Why is Your Highness here?

413
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,770
I miss you

414
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,820
The widow's heart is depressed

415
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,470
It's hard to suppress

416
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,270
Then came

417
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,910
Please remove the Jiali Se

418
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,390
I said I came here because I wanted to visit the Central Palace.

419
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,370
It was your highness that made our relationship like this.

420
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,970
good

421
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,470
I heard that the Queen Mother is back.

422
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,360
I heard that His Highness personally welcomed her back at dawn.

423
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,230
Empress of the Middle Temple

424
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,780
I have something to say to Anjo-kun

425
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,390
yes

426
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,710
Why did Anjo-kun stand under the dangerous wall?

427
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,000
How can you say it is standing under a dangerous wall?

428
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,560
Is to oppose this palace

429
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,730
Since Ancheng-kun is so concerned about me, I will let go of the matter of taking a harem for now.

430
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,920
only

431
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,240
Don't expect me to allow more

432
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,330
Even if my power is small, I should use it.

433
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,250
grown ups

434
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,380
Why do you say that, sir?

435
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,060
How could the Jia Li Se be removed?

436
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,480
Mr. Quan

437
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,740
This official is helpless.

438
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,380
The Lord granted the request after the Queen Mother begged him.

439
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,640
You are all in league with the Min family

440
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,970
This... this is humiliating my family.

441
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,990
Why do you say that, sir?

442
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,070
If I had known this earlier...

443
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,790
If a little prince is born in the future, things will be completely different.

444
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,390
By then, she will be the only concubine from a powerful family besides the Empress.

445
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,330
Did you hear what Dad said?

446
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,810
At least I'm marrying you to the king of a country.

447
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,260
Dad, I'm sorry that the wedding ceremony is so shabby.

448
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,550
Now the harem of the Lord is of humble origin.

449
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,730
Don't forget this

450
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,750
Let's go

451
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,840
Please come in.

452
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,170
Put it here.

453
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,610
The wedding ceremony will be held at 3:00 pm three days later.

454
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,690
[The wedding ceremony is a ceremony where the bride and groom bow to each other and toast to each other to sign the marriage agreement]
The wedding ceremony will be held at 3:00 pm three days later.

455
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,380
I'm tired after starting so busy early in the morning.
[The wedding ceremony is a ceremony where the bride and groom bow to each other and toast to each other to sign the marriage agreement]

456
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:47,710
I'm tired after starting so busy early in the morning.

457
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,590
Rest early.

458
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,770
This time it's really scary.

459
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:03,020
I never dreamed that His Majesty would come to Chudong in person late at night.

460
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,320
The relationship between the two of you is really special.

461
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm so lucky.

462
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,160
But after this battle

463
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,140
It is certain that His Majesty wanted to use other forces to contain our Min family.

464
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,450
We also need to take this opportunity to show the power of our Min family.

465
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,440
How to show

466
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,730
Planning a party for my father

467
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,160
Banquet?

468
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,310
My father plans to host a banquet in the palace to entertain His Majesty.

469
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,140
Those heroes will be called upon at that time.

470
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,270
And Lord Helun

471
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,680
Good idea

472
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,010
This will allow them to see clearly the power of our Min family.

473
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,480
only

474
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,670
Will the Lord easily agree to come?

475
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,780
The night when the Lord came to invite the Queen back to the palace

476
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,500
Don't we in the Min family offer any hospitality?

477
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,310
If the father personally invites

478
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,570
The Lord will definitely not refuse

479
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,480
I'd like to take this opportunity to invite Li Shufan along.

480
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,030
Put an end to his prestige

481
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,530
This is the silk of Ming Dynasty

482
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,840
Wangzhongdian Niangniang likes

483
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,730
The one who opposes Jianjia Lise is this palace

484
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,910
You can't help but complain

485
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,970
It's rare that you can still laugh

486
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:03,980
There is only one thing I can give you.

487
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,060
Don't risk your everything for the king's love

488
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,760
What

489
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,440
My meaning is that even if it is not for the love of the king

490
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,330
You also need to find your own reason to live in this palace

491
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,100
The Queen Mother

492
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,500
Here

493
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,970
The wedding ceremony has been held for several days.

494
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,320
It's time for Shang Gong Cheng'en to pay her respects today.

495
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,270
If it's delayed too long, it might not be good for Lady Seong-eun.

496
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,110
These koi are so cute!

497
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,540
It's true, ma'am.

498
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,120
Cheng'en Shanggong

499
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,540
Hello

500
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,770
Hello

501
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,470
It's you

502
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,450
Why don't you come and greet me?

503
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,190
I'm asking you

504
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:02,650
I just don't know how to treat you.

505
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,580
What does it mean to treat this palace?

506
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,010
presumptuous

507
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,050
why are you laughing

508
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,960
I have thought that maybe one day

509
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,140
The queen would scold the slave for being presumptuous.

510
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,900
Do you want to die?

511
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,060
How is that possible?

512
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,350
From now on, between the queen and the servants

513
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,800
There is only one person who can maintain order

514
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,930
His Majesty

515
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,100
Madam, can you have confidence?

516
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,590
Slave...

517
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,770
Have confidence

518
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,420
Your Highness

519
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,050
You are really outrageous.

520
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,340
Your Highness

521
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,950
You mean you have the confidence to win my heart?

522
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,040
I understand that except for the Queen Mother

523
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,160
No one can capture His Highness's heart.

524
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,200
So

525
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,610
Where do you get your confidence from?

526
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,650
I ask you where your confidence comes from.

527
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,340
Even if it is difficult to win the favor of His Highness

528
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,150
Even if it is difficult to win the heart of the widower

529
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,200
I am also useful to Your Highness.

530
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,030
That’s why I say I have confidence

531
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,860
That's what I mean

532
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,160
it works

533
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:41,500
His Majesty witnessed the scene where the Shang Gong Chengen insulted the Princess Zhenyi.

534
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,850
Even if the master reprimanded the concubines for lax discipline, the queen would have nothing to say.

535
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:50,640
It's not too late now. Your Majesty, why don't you call Concubine Cheng'en to hold her accountable?

536
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,830
The majesty of the tree palace

537
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,800
Who can such a petty person show the dignity of the imperial palace to?

538
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,230
Niangniang

539
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,630
Where is Cheng'en Shanggong now?

540
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,010
I was the first one favored by His Highness.

541
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,910
Can Cheng'en Shanggong really bear the Queen?

542
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,970
Did you forget to think carefully?

543
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,640
Who caused the filial palace master to fall into such a state?

544
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:40,280
If the Queen Mother wants to serve Cheng'en Shang Gong with a whip, she must also show her willingness to be punished.

545
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,290
Maybe I can win sympathy from outsiders

546
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,540
The Queen Mother Cheng En Shang Gong is here

547
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,490
Empress of the Middle Temple

548
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,080
Come over here and sit

549
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:03,360
I'm afraid you're tired of drinking this tea.

550
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,140
Can I have a drink?

551
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,990
No

552
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,720
Empress of the Middle Temple

553
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,470
Your Majesty, it would be better for you to reward me with a thorn stick.

554
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,230
Why

555
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,680
It was this servant who was disrespectful to Palace Master Zhenyi.

556
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,760
This palace is difficult to do

557
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,770
How can I blame you?

558
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,910
In a few days, I will go to my mother's home in Chudong with my master.

559
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,430
I will go there first to prepare

560
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:10,950
In this case, please allow me to accompany you.

561
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,940
Ringback Tone

562
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,100
exist

563
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,550
Don't push yourself to the edge of a cliff.

564
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,920
yes

565
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,550
Empress of the Middle Temple

566
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,240
Is the countermeasure against rebellion going well?

567
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,790
yes

568
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,030
We are fully prepared.

569
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,840
I just heard that Licheng Jun went to the Chudong Cave.

570
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,070
The middle temple also decided to go first

571
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,300
The nave is past

572
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:16,980
Xuan Chengen Shang Gong

573
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,230
yes

574
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:28,360
The movement in the northeast is unusual

575
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,650
[The birthplace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye in the northeastern region, nowadays Hamgyong Province]
The movement in the northeast is unusual

576
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:30,860
The movement in the northeast is unusual

577
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,910
Northeast

578
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,670
Is it the Supreme King?

579
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,830
Although I don't know where the Supreme King is

580
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,370
But there is solid news that the families in the northeast have taken action.

581
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,430
[The family copied the most elite private soldiers in the palace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye]
But there is solid news that the families in the northeast have taken action.

582
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:42,490
But there is solid news that the families in the northeast have taken action.

583
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:45,750
The weapons were also swept away.

584
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,970
weapon

585
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,840
Does the Queen Mother know about this?

586
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,080
It has already been reported.

587
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,390
What does the queen say?

588
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,590
I have to go see Pan Zhu

589
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,460
After all, there is the matter of the king.

590
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,000
And the Lord is watching

591
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,620
Especially when it comes to leaving the palace...

592
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:12,590
A big deal

593
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,950
Is Pansu... the blind man?

594
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,510
[Blind person]
Is Pansu... the blind man?

595
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:17,650
yes
[Blind person]

596
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:17,700
yes

597
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,530
when

598
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:25,420
The Queen said that she would come out of the palace to meet us a few days before the banquet at our Min family

599
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,450
not good

600
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:33,610
Why do I have to see the blind man at this moment?

601
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,940
Oh my god

602
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,270
When the queen first came, she was just a little girl of this age.

603
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,480
Are you doing well?

604
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,730
yes

605
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,270
Hello, Madam

606
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,800
Who is passing the message to the middle hall?

607
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:08,540
I heard that the Northeast will soon rise up in arms.

608
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,640
Will the father also accompany the army?

609
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,880
yes

610
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,290
It's just that the King is ill.

611
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:21,680
Only after letting the soldiers see that I am still strong

612
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,160
Then we will go to Genzhongpu

613
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,870
[A port in Wonjungpo, Hwanghae Province]
Then we will go to Genzhongpu

614
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:25,920
[A port in Wonjungpo, Hwanghae Province]

615
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,180
Yuanzhongpu

616
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,450
This is what His Highness had told me to do.

617
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,460
But anyway

618
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,580
Others are fine.

619
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,740
How could Cheng'en Shanggong spy on the Queen?

620
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,700
How do you plan to report?

621
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,330
The servant did not...

622
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,930
See something special

623
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,900
Didn't see anything special

624
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,420
yes

625
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,480
Please believe me, Your Majesty.

626
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,950
Please believe me.

627
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,410
Your Highness

628
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,400
Why did His Highness accept the invitation to the banquet from Lixingfuyuanjun at this time?

629
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,570
[Father of Queen Wonkyeongun of Yeoheungbu]
Why did His Highness accept the invitation to the banquet from Lixingfuyuanjun at this time?

630
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:30,760
[Father of Queen Wonkyeongun of Yeoheungbu]

631
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,050
I understand your concerns.

632
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:44,930
drive

633
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,220
His Highness will come

634
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,020
Go to tell the ringback tone

635
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,120
Why

636
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,510
I will ask my servant to come here

637
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,810
I just remember the past

638
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,340
You are here to help me bathe, right?

639
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,930
Come in

640
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,710
How dare I...

641
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,220
Do you want me to go out?

642
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:06,820
Ringback Tone

643
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:11,320
Don't push yourself to the edge of a cliff.

644
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,720
[Preview of the next episode]

645
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,380
The look in the eyes of the people looking at our Min family has become sharper.

646
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,540
They will keep an eye on everything about me.

647
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,820
They will keep watching

648
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,490
Watching closely and trying to find my loopholes

649
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,420
Didn't you say that even if you dedicate your body to the Lord

650
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,960
Does your heart still belong to me?

651
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,960
Asshole

652
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,550
This is all for His Highness.

653
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,430
This battle will never be won

654
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,040
That's a battlefield.

655
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,670
A matter of life and death

656
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,110
Kill him
