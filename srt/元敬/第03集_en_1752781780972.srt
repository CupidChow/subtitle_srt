00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,720
It's your highness.

185
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,590
Know about

186
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,200
[The secretary who conveyed the imperial edict]

187
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,760
Minister in

188
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,560
The Middle Temple believed in bizarre rumors

189
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,940
Not only did it bother the father who was trying to offer the zither to the Buddha,

190
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,510
It also ruined the rare chance for reconciliation between me and my father.

191
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,490
This is obviously disrespectful.

192
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,590
Therefore

193
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,430
I order you to take charge of the proposed process of deposing the concubine.

194
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,900
[Deposed Queen]

195
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,750
Your Highness

196
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,720
The Empress's Servant Xu Shanggong

197
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,320
The maid came in

198
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,020
The slaves are terrified

199
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,160
I heard that His Majesty summoned the Lord to

200
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,130
Order him to discuss the process of deposing a concubine

201
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,290
Empress of the Middle Temple

202
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,370
His Highness is just worried that the incident at Higan Temple earlier would make the Empress angry.

203
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,100
This is why we are preparing to deliberately denigrate

204
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,880
No need to make a fuss

205
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,140
Empress of the Middle Temple

206
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,470
Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun ask for an audience

207
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,550
Empress of the Middle Temple

208
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,790
Xu Shanggong

209
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,600
What is going on?

210
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,570
How could His Highness depose the concubine?

211
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,510
[Chengen Shanggong Ringtone]

212
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,310
That is to say

213
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,910
Someone is coming to the palace

214
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,070
Yeah

215
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,830
They are the younger brothers of the empress.

216
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,190
Then I'll stay here.

217
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,700
Wait until you see the queen before you leave

218
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,870
If the Lord is not crazy

219
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,980
Why would you mention the deposed concubine?

220
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,560
Licheng Jun, be careful with your words

221
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,760
Be careful with your words

222
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,560
Your Majesty, how should I be careful with my words?

223
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,180
If it weren't for the Queen
The master died under that hammer a long time ago.

224
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,330
But he wants to depose his concubine

225
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,490
That's the father killing his son.

226
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,920
Your Highness does this
Isn't it just to prevent the news from spreading?

227
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,140
How can this be stopped?

228
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,259
Besides, the only way to stop it is to depose the concubine.

229
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:21,529
The Central Palace
If it goes against the wishes of His Highness and his father, you must abandon it.

230
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,749
Your Highness wants to show your filial piety, right?

231
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:25,299
It's like killing two birds with one stone.

232
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:26,930
Your Highness needs a title to succeed the throne.

233
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,740
Isn't it ridiculous?

234
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,200
Don't even think about how we treated him.

235
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,420
Why don't you shut up?

236
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:36,160
My brothers are terrified

237
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,770
It's strange

238
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,560
Suppose that day was tragic.

239
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,270
The Lord really died tragically under the hammer of the Supreme King

240
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,990
The heir to the throne should be the eldest prince's son.

241
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,460
But

242
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:02,300
How could the Supreme King want to let my son Ti'er succeed to the throne?
And wield the hammer

243
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,050
That being saidâ€¦

244
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,170
The lady means someone is helping

245
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,940
There must be a powerful force in the palace to help

246
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,900
I heard that there are also people in the Three Military Offices who have their own family

247
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,970
The lady is referring to them.

248
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,700
A person who can use these home copies

249
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,060
So

250
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,110
king

251
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:45,010
The king is brave and good at fighting
I fought on the battlefield with my father.

252
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,060
[King Yi Banggo (Jungjong, the second brother of Yi Bangwon)]

253
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,290
Among the family copies of the Three Military Office

254
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,660
Aren't there still many soldiers following His Majesty the King?

255
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,030
So

256
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,920
The King was also involved in the incident at Higan Temple

257
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,360
Shhh

258
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,490
Madam, this is what you mean

259
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,600
This palace is just guessing

260
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,890
only

261
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,380
If the Queen can already guess this

262
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,580
Wouldn't the Lord know?

263
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,510
My Lord, you don't want to think so.

264
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,610
After all, this means that we will have to raise the knife against our own brothers again.

265
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,530
Empress of the Middle Temple

266
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,380
So

267
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,240
My brother remembered something.

268
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,850
I heard someone
Meeting with Jia Biechao in the Three Military Offices alone

269
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,750
This person has burn marks on his face.

270
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,370
It should be Yuan Fan

271
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,630
[Yi Seong-gye's confidant]

272
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,540
Go find him in secret and don't let the news leak out.

273
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,400
Find out who he's been in contact with.

274
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,310
Empress of the Middle Temple

275
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,690
Cheng En Shang Gong asked for an audience

276
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,280
The Queen's Servant Ringtone

277
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,320
I came here because I was worried.

278
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,160
I will never leave this palace

279
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,700
You don't have to worry about it.

280
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,130
yes

281
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:20,030
When the servant reported the matter of the deposed concubine
The queen was not moved at all

282
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,290
But what can I say

283
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,820
This servant has also served the Empress Dowager.

284
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,200
You should always do your duty

285
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,840
Your Highness, please don't be in such a hurry to leave.

286
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,520
May I ask you to report this to your Highness?

287
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,020
I am only going to pray for the souls of my brothers.

288
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,750
No need to report

289
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,080
The Grand King is also waiting for His Royal Highness

290
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,000
Your Highness goes out like this...

291
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,870
Nothing

292
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,410
Don't come out.

293
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,130
I will serve you again in the future.

294
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,350
It's not my own idea.

295
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,090
Has this happened to me?

296
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,510
Blame you

297
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,180
Although the queen said...

298
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,530
But he never got close to his servants.

299
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,320
Please allow me to serve you as closely as before.

300
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,980
Empress of the Middle Temple

301
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,330
You have already received the favor

302
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,810
No longer my personal maid Cai Ling

303
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,050
Niangniang

304
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,740
The slave is just a ringtone

305
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,070
The ringing bell that had served the queen for many years in the residence of Chudong

306
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,010
[Chuldong Qianseong, the residence of Yi Bang-won before he ascended the throne]

307
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,180
Even if I dedicate my body to the Lord

308
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,070
My heart still belongs to the queen.

309
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,860
The servant has not changed

310
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,860
youâ€¦

311
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,480
It's changed

312
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,900
Now, His Majesty wants to discuss the matter of deposing the concubine.

313
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,100
There is also a lot of discussion among the people

314
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,890
[The filial palace lady Yeong-sil]

315
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,510
Everyone says that His Highness is filial.
Abandoning the Wife of the Poor

316

Abandoning the Wife

317
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,820
This will never happen.

318
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,730
I know your Highness well.

319
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,900
Unpredictable

320
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,280
Who would have thought that the Queen would rest here today?

321
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,550
I want to erase the central palace from the master's heart

322
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,960
But I don't know what to do

323
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,760
My lady, don't worry, just wait quietly.

324
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,160
The past Jing'an Jun period

325

[Title of the prince during the reign of Prince Jeongan Lee Bang-won]

326
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,670
Why did His Highness want the Queen?

327
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,830
Naturally because of freedom

328
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:25,180
Men will eventually abandon those women who can't resist

329
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,560
As long as this is good for our little prince

330
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,490
How's the safflower rouge you mentioned last time?

331
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,520
You can buy it soon

332
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,550
Oh, my lady, she is so beautiful even without dressing up

333
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,850
If I put on that expensive rouge

334
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,590
She must be like Yang Guifei reincarnated.

335
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,410
I want to give birth to a prince

336
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,770
What

337
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,270
I must give birth to a prince

338
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,950
I have to give birth to a prince while I am still young and beautiful.

339
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,180
I have to keep on giving birth

340
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,290
Would you like to help me?

341
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,080
Cheng En Shang Gong needs to endure

342
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,300
good

343
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,260
I will endure it

344
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,830
In this way, the Yang energy will gather in the lower abdomen.

345
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,250
Wait until the Yang Qi gathers in the lower abdomen

346

When His Majesty's Yuan Yang entered the body of Consort Cheng'en

347
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,570
You can stay for a long time

348
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,970
This makes it very likely that you will get pregnant.

349
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,260
It's Jin Shanggong

350
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,710
Why is Your Highness here?

351
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,540
The Supreme King has been looking for me

352
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,330
I know in my heart that I am waiting for the Supreme King
What will the Supreme King order?

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,840
I have thought about

358
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,510
If I come to Hades Palace again for the same thing

[The Palace of Hades, a place to pray for blessings in the afterlife]

Your Highness, don't you feel wronged?

362

The throne was taken away by Fangyuan

363
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,960
Your subordinates will definitely find it back for Your Highness.

364
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,040
The subordinates want to regain the throne

365
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,910
Just waiting for your Highness' orders

366
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,560
All subordinates will prepare

367
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,100
The most important thing is that this is also the intention of the Supreme King

368
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,940
[Father of the Taesang King Lee Seong-gye, Lee Bang-won and Lee Bang-gwa]

369
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,130
I don't want to see any of you die again.

370
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,450
Why does Your Highness only think about sacrifice?

371
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,980
His Highness the King

372
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,890
The glare of the sun

373
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,940
If the sun is scorching

374
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,440
I have to hide in the shade temporarily

375
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,390
I am just worried whether the shade of the tree will last forever.

376
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,490
Are you worried that I will be deposed?

377
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,960
Why would the Queen say this?

378
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,350
Don't worry too much

379
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,260
anyway

380
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,690
I will take good care of all the princes.

381
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,550
[Yi Ti Ryung Grand Prince]

382
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,860
[Prince Lee Boo Hyo-nyeong]

383
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,740
[Prince Yi Seok-chungnyeong]

384
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,190
[Li Bo Jingningjun (son of the filial palace master)]

385
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,010
It didn't take long for the child to be enlightened

386
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,710
Quite a lot of progress

387
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:24,330
The father promised his son
After finishing a book, you will receive a reward.

388
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,630
Yeah

389
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,900
My father also praised me and gave me food.

390
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,470
I also gradually find reading interesting.

391
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,780
So

392
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,700
well done

393
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,920
The Queen Mother praised me for doing a good job.

394
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,710
Yeah, well done.

395
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,700
Did your father really reward you with food?

396
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,770
yes

397
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,860
The Queen Mother of the Central Palace has arrived

398
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,020
You don't have to follow me anymore. Just stay here.

399
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,270
Earlier, when the incident at Higanji Temple occurred

400
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,270
I once asked the middle temple how he knew there was a hammer in the box.

401
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,470
At that time, the middle temple replied that it was a coincidence.

402
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:53,080
In the past, when the private soldiers were reformed
I clearly told you not to keep spies privately.

403
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:01,610
But the Queen Mother has been hiding the fact that she has been raising spies.

404
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,930
So, is this the reason why His Highness mentioned the deposed concubine?

405
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,340
I have only been on the throne for a short time and my regime is still unstable

406
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,640
The Central Palace and the Min family of the Central Palace disobeyed the imperial decree

407
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,970
How can I tolerate such discussions in the court?

408
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,040
It is because of this that we can help our master escape from trouble.

409
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Please stop now, Central Palace.

410
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,540
From now on, I will face it myself

411
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,190
Solve it yourself

412
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:33,810
Can Your Highness be so sure of distinguishing between friend and foe in the court?

413
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,230
The bloody storm still remains everywhere

414
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,270
Your Highness, since you have experienced it, you will naturally know

415
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,240
Who were loyal to the previous dynasty?

416
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,980
Who are loyal to His Majesty the King?

417
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,280
Who are loyal to His Majesty?

418
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,440
Do you have confidence?

419
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,910
Can quietly identify all these people

420
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,320
What does the palace want to say?

421
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,320
Your Highness, please think about it.

422
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,250
If that day was tragic
His Highness really died tragically under the hammer of the Supreme King

423
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:11,890
nave

424
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,410
How could my father act like this without any preparation?

425
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,390
Wouldn't Father make plans for his afterlife?

426
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:19,880
nave

427
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,670
His Majesty the King

428
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,680
Your Highness had already guessed it.

429
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,670
But deliberately avoid

430
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,770
So the middle hall is to call me
Do you regard your father and second brother as enemies?

431
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,210
I want Your Highness to calm down and see the reality clearly.

432
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,150
Wait until His Highness is sober and calm enough

433
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,330
It won't be too late for me to clear out the spies.

434
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,440
Does the Central Palace want to completely ignore me?

435
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,250
I said I would face it myself.

436
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,890
I said I would solve it myself.

437
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,610
I am the ruler of a country.

438
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,500
I said I would handle it myself

439
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,000
Your Highness

440
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,310
If the Queen really thinks I am the ruler of a country
So I stopped there

441
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,990
If you dare to mention His Majesty the King again

442
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,450
I will never let you off easily.

443
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,170
Hearing that His Highness is on a hunger strike, His Highness is very worried.

444
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,250
I want you to call the king.

445
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,780
Call the king

446
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,660
[Yi Seong-gye's confidant]

447
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,830
Yuan Fan came here on the orders of His Majesty the Grand King

448
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,640
The Northeast will raise troops as planned

449
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,570
[Southern Expedition to Li Fangguo's Confidants]

450
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,880
Isn't the King under house arrest in the palace right now?

451
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,850
Your Highness had already expected this.

452
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,770
Your Highness has his own plans

453
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,070
So

454
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,740
All the families in the three military headquarters must be gathered together.

455
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,140
to this end

456
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,680
The king needs to give a signal

457
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,109
His Majesty the King...

458
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,770
Undecided

459
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,819
I don't know what to be afraid of

460
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,970
Let's do this then

461
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,520
Present our signed secret letter to His Majesty

462
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,830
[Signature with palm print]

463
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,250
How to send it

464
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,060
Since the last incident at Higan Temple
The palace was heavily guarded

465
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:55,379
There is a way

466
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,250
Tell me about it

467
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:14,480
Secret summons from Nanzheng Mansion
There were many ministers who were once members of the Imperial Court.

468
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
What

469
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,670
Oh, our Palace Master is becoming more and more favored.

470
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,580
I have the opportunity to live in a house like this

471
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,890
Ouch

472
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,580
welcome

473
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,300
I've been waiting for you.

474
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,410
That's safflower seed rouge

475
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,610
These days, it's priceless.

476
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,660
Oh, is that so?

477
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,470
Then this one

478
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,410
this

479
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:00,990
Oh ok

480
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,190
Let me see

481
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,950
It suits you too.

482
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,120
Yeah

483
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,420
And this

484
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,170
Oh, you

485
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,160
In addition to this

486
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,300
ah

487
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,660
for you

488
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,620
I found this after searching all over Baocheng.

489
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,520
If you use it to clean your private parts

490
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,610
That's a must.

491
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,350
Ah, scared me

492
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,030
Who is it?

493
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,880
You asked me to deliver this item to the Upper King's Palace to the Mishan Palace

494
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,910
[From the palace of the king to the palace of the secret palace, the palace lady who serves Li Fangguo (the king) personally]

495
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,350
good

496
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,610
What is this

497
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,730
You don't need to know this...

498
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:01,530
The King has sent messages many times to find His Highness.

499
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,870
World Trouble

500
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,840
His Majesty is at peace.

501
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,110
The king is worried

502
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,900
You don't know yet

503
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,830
The matter that troubles this king has not yet been exposed.

504
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,440
What is this

505
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,770
The servant is worried

506
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,010
So I cooked some porridge and brought it to

507
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,750
Porridge

508
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,500
I remember the time in the Chudong Cave.

509
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,080
The Queen Mother relies on black sesame porridge to regulate her spleen and stomach
Improves appetite

510
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,630
Oh, Chengen Shanggong is really sensible

511
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,370
Empress of the Middle Temple

512
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,520
Cheng En Shang Gong brought some black sesame porridge

513
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,340
Want to announce?

514
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,860
Xuan

515
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,640
This servant belongs to the Empress Central Palace.

516
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,190
in this way

517
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,390
Would you like to hear the Lord's thoughts?

518
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,900
Tell me

519
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,060
Would you like

520
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:16,770
So, can this servant serve the Queen closely?

521
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,340
good

522
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,370
The slave is willing

523
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,920
His Highness will be here tonight

524
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,450
The reason why His Highness came to see Lady Chengen is because...

525
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,280
I know

526
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,940
His Majesty has arrived

527
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,850
No need

528
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:21,190
Has Lichengjun visited the Central Palace recently?

529
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,170
yes

530
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,220
Lijiang Jun Licheng Jun

531
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,570
Both of you have been there

532
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,430
What did they talk about?

533
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,710
It seems that they talked about His Majesty the King.

534
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,910
How to say

535
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,250
I didn't hear it clearly.

536
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,100
After all, their voices were very low when they talked in private.

537
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,310
About the King
You need to tell me everything.

538
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,780
yes

539
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,760
That's it.

540
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:08,100
If you are as careless and impatient as before
I'm afraid it will ruin things.

541
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,990
What to do on the bed
Just hand it over to His Majesty.

542
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:38,120
I heard that the Lord stayed at Cheng'en Shanggong's place tonight.

543
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,290
Where is the Lord staying?

544
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,270
As the Queen Mother, I must know this.

545
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,510
The Queen taught me

546
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,530
It's late at night

547
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,910
Madam, why don't you take a rest first...

548
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,460
I know.

549
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,130
Go down

550
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,500
yes

551
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,350
don't want

552
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,510
Asshole

553
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,690
You'll never make it.

554
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,600
I'm going to kill you.

555
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,760
Let everything that is distorted return to its original state

556
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,740
Your Highness

557
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,100
Your Highness

558
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,670
Your Highness

559
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,250
Your Highness

560
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,870
Your Highness, please relax and lie down comfortably.

561
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,120
Aren't you sleeping?

562
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,550
Slave...

563
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:13,260
Rather than falling asleep facing His Majesty's back

564
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,980
Why not use the dim moonlight?

565
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,470
Sit here

566
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:24,000
Staring at His Majesty's face all night

567
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,080
You were a servant in the palace.

568
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,280
Later she entered the palace and became a personal maid

569
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
yes

570
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,390
Later, Cheng Le En became Cheng En Shang Gong

571
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,120
yes

572
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,180
You are so ridiculous that you ask me to come to your place twice a month

573
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,720
So you get a lot of things, right?

574
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:08,350
This servant has not yet won the favor of His Highness.

575
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,090
You can't have one foot in the nave.

576
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,180
One foot is here.

577
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:32,850
Your Highness

578
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,380
You can't make your own decisions
Just send the messages you want to send

579
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,900
It is absolutely forbidden to know without reporting

580
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,610
Everything needs to be reported to me for decision.

581
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,430
Do you understand?

582
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,880
Why not answer?

583
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,010
If the slave agrees

584
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,730
Your Highness, would you like to believe

585
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,440
Everyone still thought that I was still a member of the imperial palace.

586
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,550
I believe

587
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,160
The Widow

588
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,070
Willing to believe

589
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,960
If the slave does this

590
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,880
What will His Highness promise me?

591
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,460
I will give myself to you

592
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,410
Put yourself...

593
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,400
Deliver to you

594
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,030
All right

595
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,870
My Lord, you are serving me well.

596
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,970
yes

597
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,780
My Lord, have you ever been unhappy?

598
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,400
There was no sign of

599
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,420
The Lord sleeps peacefully.

600
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,800
Quite capable

601
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,920
You actually filled the vacancy in this palace.

602
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,210
I dare not

603
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:47,340
The slaves are just following orders.

604
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,800
You go down

605
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:03,040
It seems that the opportunity has come for the Queen Mother

606
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,050
The second brother is referring to the Ming envoy

607
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,160
yes

608
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,190
It turns out that the queen knows all

609
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,680
If the Ming envoys come to look for the Supreme King

610
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,570
It would be difficult to discuss the matter of deposing the concubine.

611
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,090
-yes
-yes

612
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,000
Go to the Lord and make up your mind.

613
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,750
yes

614
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,860
only

615
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,440
Being too aggressive is probably not a good idea.

616
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,740
The Queen Mother

617
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,800
Just don't know

618
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,770
Can the King be released from the palace?

619
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,260
The movement in the northeast is unusual.

620
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,950
Ask Panzhu to listen carefully to the news

621
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,990
The Queen Mother

622
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,540
this...

623
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,240
this...

624
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,710
Should I hand it over to His Majesty the King?

625
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,930
good

626
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,610
besides

627
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,080
this...

628
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,690
What is this

629
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,840
A small gift

630
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,310
No need

631
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,740
To Mishan Palace

632
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,980
His Majesty has arrived

633
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,830
Your Highness

634
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:56,190
I heard that the Ming envoys were about to arrive in Kaifeng.

635
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,930
How are the preparations for hosting the Ming envoys going?

636
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:04,400
The palace conventions have always been prepared by the Empress

637
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,690
But now they are still discussing the matter of deposing the concubine.

638
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,030
It is to welcome the governor to say that preparations are complete.

639
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,160
[A temporary organization established by the Welcoming Supervisor to entertain Ming envoys]

640
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,470
I am also worried that something might go wrong.

641
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,800
The Ming envoy expressed his wish to personally meet the Supreme King
Understand the situation clearly

642
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,780
They said they wanted to see the Supreme King to find out the situation.

643
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,830
Its real purpose is to pay tribute.

644
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:39,370
At present, Zhu Yunwen and Zhu Di are fighting fiercely.
The most needed thing is a war horse

645
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:41,830
[Zhu Di (Emperor Yongle) was defeated by his nephew Zhu Yunwen (Emperor Jianwen) during the Jingnan Campaign
The war for the Ming throne]

646
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,420
But if we pay tribute to Zhu Yunwen directly,

647
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,530
Zhu Di will hold the power one day.

648
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,520
I must make plans early

649
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,900
I think we should delay time to see the war situation clearly.

650
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,290
Only His Majesty the Supreme King can do this.

651
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,940
Hearing that the envoys came

652
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,450
When His Majesty the Supreme King was in the northeast

653
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,010
He has a close relationship with His Royal Highness the Supreme King.

654
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,530
But

655
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,550
Is His Royal Highness willing to come forward?

656
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:16,670
Your Highness, why don't you order the Highness to come forward?

657
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,300
Long before His Highness ascended the throne

658
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,870
The Queen has been mediating between His Highness and the Supreme King.

659
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,120
Your Highness wants me to go and see my father in person.

660
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,250
Convince your father?

661
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,290
What does the Central Palace want?

662
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,920
I am willing to go

663
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,860
only

664
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,830
I grant you the title of the middle palace

665
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,900
Mr. Supervisor

666
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,010
The matter of abolishing the concubine was stopped

667
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,540
We have to set a date for the bedtime

668
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,100
The Queen's menstruation has stopped for eleven days.

669
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,500
[Monthly period refers to menstruation]

670
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,020
But tomorrow is the day of Si

671
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,510
It is not good on Si day, nor on Yin day.

672
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:30,300
The first and the thirty-fifth day of the lunar month are all unacceptable

673
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,430
So when can we

674
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,320
Why not wait until next month...

675
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,570
Can't wait till then

676
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:41,250
This official observes the celestial phenomena

677
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,980
Worried about thunderstorms in the near future

678
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,070
snort

679
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:49,120
How about today?

680
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,250
Today?

681
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,980
Si and Yin days are not good.

682
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,140
The first thirty ten...

683
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,000
Not fifteen either.

684
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,620
No thunderstorm either.

685
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,520
Why did Zheng Shanggong suddenly

686
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,620
There is still a little mist...

687
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,020
That's it.

688
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,970
Let's set it today

689
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,830
How can there be such a rule?

690
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:13,390
Rules are based on needs

691
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,910
You stay here

692
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:08,360
I heard that the chief envoy of this mission is my father's close friend.
Many years of friendship

693
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,530
Reuniting with a Lost Friend
I think it can also relieve the fatigue in my heart...

694
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,820
Nonsense

695
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,850
The envoy will ask us to pay tribute of 10,000 fine horses.

696
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:22,850
But it takes some time to prepare properly.

697
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,490
Please give me some advice, my father.

698
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:34,080
You plan to observe the situation of the Jingnan Campaign

699
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,550
While dealing with the Ming Dynasty's request for tribute

700
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:42,390
So I want to ask you to buy some time

701
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,370
If this is the case, why doesn't the Lord come forward?

702
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,560
And it was the central palace again.

703
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,980
After all, the incident at Higan Temple came first.

704
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,540
The Lord may feel a little embarrassed to meet his father

705
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,160
besides

706
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,280
besides

707
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,380
My Lord, I feel that since I was in the palace
He had a close relationship with his father.

708
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,390
That was the royal palace period.

709
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:12,020
Now he is on the throne

710
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,790
There are things a king should do

711
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:19,200
There are things that the nave should do

712
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,590
how

713
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:29,110
Are you going to use the guise of Dawn People again?
Teach me a lesson

714
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,040
No Father...

715
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,700
Didn't you secretly think

716
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,970
The world of North Korea belongs to your Min family.

717
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,410
Why did the father say this?

718
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,350
It was your Min family who pushed today's master to the throne.

719
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,510
Father

720
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:57,590
The master originally listened to you in everything.

721
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,250
Only in the future

722
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,970
Will there be no more blood?

723
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,740
Why did my father say this to make me feel so frightened?

724
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,120
The King's Affairs

725
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,420

00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,090
I called him here.

728
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,620
What does the father want his son to do?

01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,280
The Shang Gong on duty will give a signal every hour.

733
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,830
According to the signal...

734
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:16,000
The central hall just needs to do as it says.

735
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,100
Just follow and obey unconditionally?

736
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,450
My intention is to ask the middle palace to learn to be smarter.

737
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,030
It seems that they will eventually rebel.

It is the righteousness of the widower

Spare her life.

Only the nave.

742
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,210
Your Highness, please kneel before me.
Please spare her life.
