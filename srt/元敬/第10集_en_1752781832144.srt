[Director Kim Sang-ho, screenwriter Lee Young-mi]

00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:42,878
[This drama is a secondary creation of historical figures and events and is purely fictional
Strict production guidelines were also adhered to when filming child actors and animals.]

7
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:48,878
The 100 knots of land that His Highness promised to award were not handed over to Higanji.

8
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,848
Not only that, there are also many people who have not received the relief food awarded by His Highness.

9
00:00:54,848 --> 00:01:00,288
I heard that all this is related to Doctor Mingshan

10
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:04,838
It must be that the Mingshan doctor has formed his own faction and despised the royal power.

11
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:08,808
How can the king's order be conveyed under such circumstances?

12
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:13,568
Your Highness must summon the judge to ask the reason

13
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:13,458
[The abbreviation of Hupan Hucao Panshu, the head of Hucao who is in charge of financial management]

14
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:04,217
Master, just go and ask the Imperial Court Supervisor.

15
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:06,717
Then it will be handed over to His Highness.

16
00:02:06,717 --> 00:02:09,158
I will definitely pass it on to Your Highness.

17
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:18,407
He said he wanted to see the city.

18
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:24,258
Have a good walk and take a good look at the capital city

19
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:25,618
yes

20
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:28,088
Thanks

22
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:00,708
Danshanfuyuanjun is here

23
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:12,708
How are you doing?

24
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,068
[Dansangun Yi Mo, a hero who helped Joseon to establish the country and King Taejong to ascend the throne]

25
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:34,018
Earlier in the year of Wuyin, I helped you two assassinate Sanfeng

26
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:36,408
[Biography of Jeong Do-joon of Sambong]

27
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,448
The Lord of today

28
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,978
I never thought that this day would come.

29
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,828
All right

30
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:48,628
You may have asked about it.

31
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,678
yes

32
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,558
Then they are willing to be like-minded

33
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:54,578
Bingcao Neijinwei Patrol Division

34
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:55,018
[An official office in charge of military affairs during the Joseon Dynasty]

35
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:59,268
All those who followed you two are now furious.

36
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:06,858
The Lord will definitely be unfavorable to them

37
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:09,008
After all, they are from the Min family.

38
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,578
I don't know what your plans are.

39
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:18,148
The master had been suffering from sores.

40
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:19,988
[A boil or sore on the skin]

41
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:19,638
I intend to make the Master's condition worse.

42
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:21,528
And use this as an excuse

43
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,648
Show the prince and take the palace

44
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:31,938
I'm afraid the Empress' help is indispensable for this matter.

45
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,178
Since the Queen is the elder sister, naturally...

46
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:41,328
Go and find out what the middle temple means first.

47
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:43,778
yes

48
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,468
Let's have a drink

49
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:56,968
Empress of the Middle Temple

50
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:58,418
Isn't this shirtless?

51
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:03,088
Who is this?

52
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:05,498
Isn't this Li Mao, the Lord of Danshan Prefecture?

53
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:07,278
Your Majesty has not forgotten me.

54
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:09,538
How can I forget Tanzanfuin-kun?

55
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,328
[Liyuan Gun Min Wuxiu, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong]

56
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:12,878
But why didn't I see Danshanfuyuanjun before?

57
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:16,898
I have left the court on the grounds of ill health.

58
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:19,848
Come in

59
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:38,358
Let the crown prince take over the throne as regent

60
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:40,148
[Regent] When the king is unable to rule personally, someone else takes over the country.

61
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:38,878
yes

62
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:40,168
It's ridiculous

63
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:42,568
Your Highness is still healthy, how can this happen?

64
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:46,598
The master had suffered from a boil a long time ago.

65
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:50,908
In the early years of the palace, once the sore became serious, the master would be so sick that he would lie down for several days.

66
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:54,708
I heard that the Lord's condition has become more serious recently.

67
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,938
What exactly does Danshanfuyuanjun want to say?

68
00:05:56,938 --> 00:06:00,898
We will quietly make the Master's sores worse.

69
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:01,617
What

70
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:04,867
If the Queen Mother takes the opportunity to show the Crown Prince

71
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:07,378
Then place our people in charge of the military government

72
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,688
I'm afraid I heard it wrong.

73
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:13,328
How dare you ask me to rebel?

74
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:15,678
It's just about getting back the power that was stolen.

75
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:17,708
Tanzanfuinjun

76
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:21,318
Do you want to die on the spot under my sword?

77
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:22,438
Empress of the Middle Temple

78
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:25,818
Or do you want me to report this to my Lord?

79
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:29,528
[Reporting rebellion, treason, etc.]

80
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,338
So, Your Majesty, are you going to let your brothers be exiled?

81
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:29,968
Shut up

82
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:32,908
Just pretend I haven't heard of this.

83
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,488
If you come to me again about this matter

84
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:40,528
You guys won't be able to survive then.

85
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:48,338
Oh, sir, you are here.

86
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:48,788
Where are the people?

87
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:49,508
in

88
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:50,658
Let's go

89
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,188
You said Li Mao went there

90
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:02,408
[Yi Modan Sanpuwon-gun, a hero who helped establish Joseon and helped King Taejong ascend the throne]

91
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,108
yes

92
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:08,038
Lee Moo, who had been to Jeju, also went to the central hall of the Hyeamsa Temple.

93
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:13,028
This is really

94
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:16,308
I didn't expect things to go so smoothly.

95
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:17,618
What do you plan to do?

96
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:21,138
Anything else?

97
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:27,428
The Central Palace seems to have sent someone to the palace

98
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:29,388
Send someone

99
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,988
This person seems to have a letter in his hand.

100
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:47,478
Someone come

101
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:51,288
It's Master

102
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:54,378
Who destroyed this flower?

103
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:56,918
Go find the person quickly.

104
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:58,018
yes

105
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:07,938
letter

106
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:14,968
only

107
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:15,328
oh

108
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,788
Where shall we rest for the night?

109
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:21,608
Let's find a pub or a place to stay for the night.

110
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:22,528
yes

111
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:26,768
Where is it around here?

112
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:28,768
Yeah, it should be over there.

113
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:34,988
Who

114
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,158
Take it

115
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:11,858
Is this the letter that the Queen Mother wants to send back to the palace?

116
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:13,348
It's Master

117
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:37,148
I almost lost my life.

118
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:44,528
So Tanzanfuin-kun

119
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:47,998
Contact with the exiled Lijiangjun and Lichengjun

120
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,708
[Younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong, Prince of Yeogang and Prince of Yeoseong]

121
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:51,758
He also secretly met with the middle palace to plot rebellion

122
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,848
Is this what you mean now, my dear?

123
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:57,658
good

124
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,848
Is there any evidence

125
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:03,208
It's your highness

126
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:07,708
If there is no adult, I'm afraid I'll have to give up my life.

127
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:32,838
[Dansangun Yi Mo, a hero who helped Joseon to establish the country and King Taejong to ascend the throne]

128
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:46,308
Beheading

129
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,228
Your Highness

130
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,168
Your Highness

131
00:10:57,318 --> 00:10:59,568
Don't be so hasty to behead him.

132
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,998
Who will get hurt if this becomes a controversy?

133
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,538
Itâ€™s the middle hall and the crown prince

134
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,898
Although Lijiangjun and Lichengjun are far away in Jeju Island

135
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,168
It was not put into practice, but the rebellion was certainly discussed.

136
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,668
Aren't you a close friend of Lixingfuyuanjun?

137
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:13,728
[Father of Queen Wonkyeongun of Yeoheungbu]

138
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:13,048
A close friend indeed

139
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,398
Don't you think you are too ruthless?

140
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:16,548
Your Highness

141
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,368
The matter was resolved by executing Li Mao.

142
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:19,848
Your Highness

143
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:23,318
I plan to go out hunting temporarily.

144
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:25,258
Although His Highness can escape

145
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,808
But sooner or later you have to make up your mind.

146
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,118
Going out hunting suddenly?

147
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:33,898
good

148
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:35,638
So I, your son, will follow my father...

149
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:37,428
[Yi Ti Ryung Grand Prince]

150
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:38,188
You stay in the palace

151
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:40,408
You stay in the palace

152
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,318
Look after state affairs for me

153
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:45,788
Lord Helun will help you

154
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:47,698
yes

155
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:57,988
You two should stop arguing and live a good life.

156
00:11:57,988 --> 00:11:59,278
Yes Yes

157
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:02,368
Don't be sad for nothing

158
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:07,978
Just live well with this moment's mentality

159
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,168
yes

160
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,368
I will keep it in mind.

161
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,288
This spring flower is really bright

162
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,268
In the eyes below

163
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:06,258
The girl is Haruhi

164
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,578
I am sinking for the girl

165
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:14,208
From the first time I saw the girl

166
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:17,568
I fell in love with the girl

167
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,508
Understand

168
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:25,998
I am neither a noble nor the eldest son of the family.

169
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,078
Compared to your Min family who have royal family and marriage contract

170
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:29,488
Son

171
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:34,348
Compared to the spring flowers that wither after heralding spring

172
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:43,318
I prefer the green that fills the whole spring later.

173
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,848
Empress of the Middle Temple

174
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,868
The Crown Princess sent a letter

175
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,948
Is the Queen Mother safe?

176
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:40,538
The reason why I sent this letter is because

177
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:45,368
Starting tomorrow, my father will go out hunting for a week.

178
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:49,528
It looks like the master will be away from the capital for a week.

179
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:52,758
In this case, why don't you return to the palace at this time?

180
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,988
If the queen returns to the palace, it means that the master is angry again.

181
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:58,378
I can't do anything to the empress.

182
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,968
Didn't the master say that no one is allowed to enter the palace without the master's permission?

183
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:08,888
Are you worried that I won't be able to return to the palace?

184
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:13,168
I don't want to eat simple meals anymore.

185
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:18,698
You can't get such a refreshing breeze in the palace.

186
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:24,518
The world overlooking here is also unusually peaceful.

187
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:27,408
It's all external.

188
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:32,468
If you look closely, you will find that the palaces, temples, and the common people are all pretty much the same.

189
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:33,878
[Area where common people live]

190
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,818
What do you mean?

191
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:35,928
It's all intrigue

192
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:37,828
I want to eat this. I want to eat more.

193
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:40,148
This side is wolfing down the food, and that side is wolfing down the food.

194
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:43,218
Donâ€™t you feel your damn stomach is full?

195
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:49,208
My lady, please stop laughing. I am serious.

196
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:55,968
Hey

197
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,808
What's this

198
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:00,188
What's going on?

199
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:09,778
Empress of the Middle Temple

200
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,528
Empress of the Middle Temple

201
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,998
What is it?

202
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,678
Before His Majesty gives His Majesty's order

203
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:34,968
Madam, you can't leave here.

204
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:37,338
The Lord has also given such an order

205
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:38,168
Why

206
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:41,918
Because the situation shows that the queen intends to rebel

207
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,358
How to rebel

208
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:46,518
Otherwise, why would they gather the troops?

209
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:54,488
From today on, no one in the temple can go out.

210
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:58,988
People outside the temple are not allowed to enter.

211
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:09,338
How could the Queen be so luxurious?

212
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:13,678
At first glance, I thought it was the Queen Mother.

213
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,588
You said that because you haven't seen the Queen Mother.

214
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,898
A little gift

215
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:27,208
This is the rouge that is popular in Ming Dynasty recently.

216
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,428
rouge

217
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:35,338
As the youngest in my family, I have the smallest job in the Eunuch's Office.

218
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:39,668
I heard that there is a vacancy for a medicine clerk in the pharmacy.

219
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:40,928
Shangyao

220
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,088
Shangyao is from the third grade

221
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:46,778
Responsible for managing the palace's medicinal materials

222
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:03,478
Take it back

223
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:09,338
However, I have long heard that the youngest child in my wife's family is extremely powerful.

224
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,268
So Madam, don't worry about going back.

225
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:12,538
What

226
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:13,438
So...

227
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:19,588
During my stay in the palace, I have always been a member of the palace.

228
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:22,288
Madam, you just need to promise this.

229
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:24,658
How dare I disobey?

230
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:34,238
I heard that Shuyi often gives advice on all matters in the palace.

231
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,098
How could you not know that this would bring pressure to the Lord?

232
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:39,818
But it's just a job for the Imperial Household Department's medicine

233
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:40,598
This is no small task

234
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,858
If Shangshan doesn't even agree to this request,

235
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:47,088
Call me this favored second-rank concubine

236
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,428
How embarrassing!

237
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,418
Shangshan, please agree.

238
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:57,368
You should promise me

239
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:12,938
You are here

240
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:15,518
Yes, I have done what you ordered.

241
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:21,758
We must not let the central hall leave Higanji Temple

242
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:25,198
But why did the Lord suddenly order such a dangerous thing?

243
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,568
If the Lord knew

244
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:29,108
You must not let the Lord know.

245
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:31,388
Absolutely not

246
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:36,148
While staying at the central hall at Higanji Temple

247
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:41,298
I will make His Highness agree to depose the Concubine no matter what.

248
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:44,158
What if adults can't do it?

249
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,638
When the worst happened, the middle temple...

250
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,868
When walking around Higanji Temple

251
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,048
Died at the hands of vicious bandits

252
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:11,578
Like I said... that was the worst time

253
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,778
yes

254
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,098
master

255
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:22,128
Is this the person who ruined my flower garden?

256
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:24,608
It seems to have been stepped on while playing hide-and-seek.

257
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,208
I'm wrong, sir.

258
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,168
Please forgive me for once, sir.

259
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:29,788
It's really childish.

260
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:31,728
If it's you, please forgive him.

261
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:33,638
Put him in a warehouse and let him starve to death

262
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:34,698
master

263
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:35,518
Sir, don't

264
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:36,228
don't want

265
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:37,468
The master doesn't want him to be a child.

266
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:38,728
Please forgive me this time.

267
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,248
The little guy is wrong

268
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:41,408
Someone come

269
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,318
master

270
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:43,468
Get these people out of here.

271
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:45,338
Master, Master

272
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:46,578
He is still a child

273
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,218
The villain is wrong, the master cannot let him starve to death

274
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:52,918
Master, Master

275
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,628
master

276
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:58,548
master

277
00:21:37,158 --> 00:21:38,158
Master

278
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:40,818
Ouch, kid.

279
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:42,428
What happened?

280
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:44,078
Wake up!

281
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,658
Drink slowly

282
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:53,658
Master

283
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:59,348
They killed Master Minglun

284
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,698
Oh my god

285
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:08,038
Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva

286
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:18,208
Is this really okay?

287
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,528
You don't have to go together

288
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:22,158
No

289
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:25,618
The servants will follow too.

290
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:29,858
I will tell those people whose relief food has been taken away.

291
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,298
Okay, Master, please hurry up.

292
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:33,698
yes

293
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:59,828
The lady seems to be here

294
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:09,458
Be careful, madam.

295
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:17,258
Be careful, madam.

296
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,408
Where is this going?

297
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:24,248
Who

298
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,902
[Lishan Jun Min Wuhui, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyung]
[Liyuan Gun Min Wuxiu, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong]

299
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:17,778
By the way, is the central hall safe?

300
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:19,238
yes

301
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:22,508
It should be more dangerous in the fourth brother's capital.

302
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:24,068
Call everyone you can.

303
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:24,898
clear

304
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:25,858
Let's go

305
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:29,188
What

306
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:31,428
How could so many imperial guards let people go?

307
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,578
The subordinate is terrified

308
00:24:33,178 --> 00:24:36,378
But what if the Central Palace enters the capital?

309
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:37,948
Of course you have to take it

310
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:40,768
We must catch her and end this.

311
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:43,038
What

312
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:21,938
Coming

313
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:34,188
Let's go

314
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:35,578
Let's go.

315
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:42,218
What is it?

316
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:44,228
We are here to beat the drums to appeal for justice

317
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:46,038
This drum can't be played by just anyone.

318
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:47,668
Own process

319
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:50,368
The people want to appeal

320
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:52,548
What process is needed?

321
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:56,858
Middle...Middle Hall Empress

322
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:14,458
Father

323
00:26:18,018 --> 00:26:19,588
Father

324
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:24,378
What happened

325
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:29,458
Father also asked the father to come to the place where the grievances were raised

326
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,448
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

327
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:40,308
If the Queen Mother is in trouble, I will inform you.

328
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,628
Would you like to help my mother?

329
00:27:11,578 --> 00:27:14,108
Everybody's here.

330
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:23,248
We, the innocent people, were robbed of the relief food given by our Lord.

331
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:28,528
He wanted to report the matter to the authorities but was beaten

332
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:30,858
Have any of you had the same experience?

333
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,188
I

334
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:47,938
Me too

335
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:50,248
All back off

336
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:52,478
His Majesty has arrived

337
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:55,708
All back off

338
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:08,548
nave

339
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:09,628
What happened?

340
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:15,748
The relief food given by the Lord was not distributed to the people

341
00:28:15,748 --> 00:28:16,308
What

342
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:18,428
No matter how the people run to the government office

343
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:21,588
I can't tell His Highness about this.

344
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:25,098
I had no choice but to let the people beat drums to complain.

345
00:28:26,658 --> 00:28:28,058
Not only that

346
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:33,148
The field that His Highness bestowed upon Higanji was never delivered to Higanji.

347
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,261
[Farmland and land]

348
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,331
Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva

349
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:40,691
In addition, Shufan dared

350
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:44,531
Without authorization, he took his highness's troops and falsely conveyed the imperial edict.

351
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:50,001
I, the queen, am imprisoned in the Higan Temple.

352
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:53,281
Your Highness

353
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:54,971
This is true

354
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:56,491
This is becauseâ€¦

355
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:05,451
I have received an imperial decree from His Highness to place the Empress Dowager under house arrest.

356
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:07,021
Who spread it?

357
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:09,601
I ask you who spread this

358
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:11,111
Ming...Mingshan...

359
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:13,331
Doctor Mingshan

360
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:16,991
Take it

361
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:24,101
Empress of the Middle Temple

362
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:25,941
Empress of the Middle Temple

363
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:28,611
These are the Min family's confidants who are hiding quietly.

364
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:30,321
It seems that he came to rescue the Queen Mother.

365
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:32,021
Madam, are you okay?

366
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:45,341
Wanwang Your Highness will sympathize with the Queen

367
00:29:45,341 --> 00:30:10,631
The Empress of the Middle Temple...

368
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:51,661
who

369
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,741
Wait, let me tell you a few words first.

370
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,431
Wait till you die

371
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:54,431
Helpâ€¦

372
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:30,511
If it happens

373
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:34,061
Why hasn't there been any news yet?

374
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:37,261
No news is good news

375
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:41,301
Last night's dream was also quite auspicious

376
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:45,261
only

377
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:48,971
I don't know why the sea today

378
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:53,321
Extraordinarily blue and vast

379
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:10,441
The palace has received a detailed report

380
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:12,641
Knowing what happened in the harem during my absence

381
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:15,941
The concubines serving the master must act with a clear conscience

382
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:20,251
The people will trust and follow the king.

383
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,741
Shuyi

384
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:28,271
My concubine is here

385
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:33,211
How dare you...interfere in palace affairs?

386
00:33:35,671 --> 00:33:38,031
Empress of the Middle Temple

387
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:42,481
You should leave the palace from now on.

388
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:48,361
Ringback Tone

389
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,351
I am your highness's concubine.

390
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:51,811
Without His Majesty's decree...

391
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,261
This palace is the head of the inner ladies.

392
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:54,301
Empress of the Middle Temple

393
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:57,531
You forced yourself to stand on the edge of the cliff

394
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:28,451
Go and convey my will to order the exiled Lord Lijiang and Lord Licheng to commit suicide

395
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:29,581
[Suicide]

396
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:40,980
Empress of the Middle Temple

397
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,670
The Lord ordered Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun to commit suicide

398
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:51,170
What should I do?

399
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:58,061
Empress of the Middle Temple

400
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:48,621
The world you and I will face next

401
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:51,331
It will be completely different from before

402
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:57,311
I hope you will not be afraid and move forward bravely.

403
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:02,021
There will be unexpected sacrifices along this road.

404
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:04,401
This is what you and I need to bear.

405
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:11,241
The Queen Mother has properly buried the remains of her two younger brothers.

406
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:13,871
The funeral was done

407
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:16,801
In the future, we will also quietly organize a Jiandu Fast.

408
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:20,071
Pray for the souls of the two deceased

409
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:25,231
Thank you very much, Madam.

410
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:33,311
As a mother, I have been praying for the safety of the Queen Mother.

411
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:36,381
Please ask Zheng Shanggong to convey this to me.

412
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:42,341
But no matter what, my lady, please meet me before you leave.

413
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:46,161
Niangniang

414
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:32,871
It's all my fault.

415
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,151
No

416
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:55,661
The Queen Mother seems to have accepted everything calmly

417
00:38:57,321 --> 00:39:00,411
The news has been sent back to the palace

418
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:03,221
OK

419
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:54,371
I heard that no one starved to death during the spring famine.

420
00:39:57,241 --> 00:40:02,681
No longer will the people be robbed of their food and property by corrupt officials.

421
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:05,141
After His Majesty sat on the throne

422
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:08,091
The world has really changed.

423
00:41:44,591 --> 00:41:45,841
Chungnyeong

424
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:47,621
Now that you're here, why don't you say anything?

425
00:41:47,621 --> 00:41:49,771
I am afraid of interrupting my mother's sword practice.

426
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:52,921
[Prince Yi Seokchungnyeong later became King Sejong]

427
00:41:49,771 --> 00:41:51,901
Just wait quietly

428
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:58,871
I just saw the Queen Mother dancing with a sword. I can't help but feel that it's a pity for you to be a girl.

429
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:01,891
Sword training is just a way to exercise the body and mind

430
00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:04,451
What does it have to do with being a man or a woman?

431
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:08,251
I am just worried whether your mother has any regrets as a woman.

432
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:10,631
Rather than saying that this daughter

433
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:15,001
My mother does have one regret.

434
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:17,811
Let's go

435
00:42:27,451 --> 00:42:31,061
[Yi Ti Ryung Grand Prince]

436
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:34,801
This is the king's posture

437
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,681
Focus on the target

438
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:48,631
If you set a goal

439
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:51,121
Don't be shaken by anything

440
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:55,191
Hitting the Bullseye

441
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:00,381
You look like His Majesty the King.

442
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:03,181
I will continue to improve my archery skills in the future.

443
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:06,021
This kind of shooting skill is enough

444
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:08,551
Next, I should study hard.

445
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:10,071
It's the father

446
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:12,551
Father has sown enough seeds

447
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:15,981
It's up to you to make it blossom and bear fruit.

448
00:43:16,981 --> 00:43:18,081
yes

449
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:20,751
Now I only have one thing left.

450
00:43:23,431 --> 00:43:25,721
Hitting the Bullseye

451
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:32,161
I will definitely make you become that kind of person

452
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:53,161
Wouldn't it be a waste of such good weather if I just buried my head in books?

453
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:57,051
I like reading in the sunshine.

454
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:01,211
There are many beautiful things in this world

455
00:44:01,211 --> 00:44:04,001
I don't know why you love reading so much.

456
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:07,581
Yinghua Outsourcing

457
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:14,131
Reading can reveal the hidden beauty of flowers to the world

458
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:17,821
You have read the "University Commentary"

459
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:19,741
[The Great Learning Explanation, a book in the Confucian classics that elaborates on the Great Learning]

460
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,011
yes

461
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:23,111
Isn't "The Great Learning" about the study of the way of the emperor?

462
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:23,131
[Knowledge that an emperor should master]

463
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:30,741
[Liyuanjun Min Wuxiu, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong; Lishanjun Min Wuhui, the younger brother of Queen Wonkyeong]

464
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:29,141
I heard that the Maharaja had studied it many times.

465
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:31,001
I don't know how many times I've read it.

466
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,881
It's a shame to say

467
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,721
I read it five times

468
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:42,331
I heard that it took the prince six years to read it all the way through.

469
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:45,021
The Lord was very pleased and held a banquet to celebrate

470
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:49,651
I just read it but didn't fully understand its meaning.

471
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:54,051
That is why people say that the great king has always had the demeanor of a king.

472
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:55,581
good

473
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:57,111
Li Yuanjun

474
00:44:59,121 --> 00:45:01,981
I have never thought much about it.

475
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:03,581
Please forgive me, my lady.

476
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:08,921
Empress of the Middle Temple

477
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:10,861
My Lord has appointed me as the Governor of Hancheng

478
00:45:10,031 --> 00:45:11,731
[Seoul governor, second rank official of Seoul Prefecture]

479
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:14,281
He appointed his fourth brother the deputy chief of staff of Dunning

480
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:13,371
[The second-rank honorary position was established for the king's relatives and clan members to be kind to him]

481
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:20,581
Isn't it just to cherish our Min family as before?

482
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:24,201
The master is just seeking a balance of power.

483
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:29,401
So you two must be careful in what you say and do and not act rashly.

484
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:30,831
Yes Yes

485
00:45:33,561 --> 00:45:35,911
Itâ€™s just that the princeâ€¦

486
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:38,061
What happened to the prince?

487
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:41,091
Now that you are here, you should at least greet the prince.

488
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:44,711
I have heard that my two uncles hold important positions in the court.

489
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:49,051
It's time to revive our declining Min family.

490
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:52,431
Revitalize the declining Min family

491
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:58,261
Look at your majesty now.

492
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:02,021
I just feel happy and at peace.

493
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:07,121
If my deceased brothers saw this, they would be so happy.

494
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:09,171
What is the declining Min family?

495
00:46:09,171 --> 00:46:11,051
Dead uncle

496
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:12,791
Don't mention these things again.

497
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,021
Your Highness

498
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,291
This prince is uncomfortable listening to this

499
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,241
Sounds uncomfortable

500
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,251
Your Majesty's words are too chilling.

501
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:22,251
Your Majesty grew up in our Min family.

502
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:26,001
It's fine for others, but the prince should understand.

503
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:28,691
My brothers died unjustly.

504
00:46:28,691 --> 00:46:30,471
in this way

505
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:35,561
Uncle means that my father killed two innocent uncles.

506
00:46:35,561 --> 00:46:39,781
If my uncle thinks this way, how can he be a subject to my father?

507
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,931
This prince left first

508
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:52,621
Your Highness

509
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:54,071
Your Highness

510
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:00,891
It was Li Shanjun who made a mistake.

511
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:01,941
Please forget it, Your Majesty.

512
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:04,021
Uncles, do you think this prince feels comfortable?

513
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,751
So I will never forget it.

514
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,241
Just remember the unjust deaths of my brothers

515
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:12,741
Wrongful Death

516
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:13,461
Your Highness

517
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:17,631
Do the uncles really not know why they died?

518
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:19,731
They intend to rebel

519
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:25,451
My elder brothers gave everything to help you ascend the throne.

520
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:27,341
But the master killed his brothers after using them.

521
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:29,101
uncle

522
00:47:29,101 --> 00:47:31,991
I am the son of the king, the crown prince of this dynasty.

523
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:35,341
They are the criminals who should be killed

524
00:47:38,311 --> 00:47:39,791
Please be careful with your words.

525
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:43,051
If you continue to speak rudely to my brothers,

526
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:47,301
I will never tolerate it again.

527
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,641
Liyuanjun to the Crown Prince?

528
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:11,051
That happened after the prince had an argument with Li Shanjun and left the table angrily.

529
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:15,181
As a national leader, he is so ignorant of the seriousness of the matter.

530
00:48:12,201 --> 00:48:16,831
[The crown prince who will inherit the throne]

531
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:18,081
He will be king one day.

532
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:20,451
What's the difference?

533
00:48:20,451 --> 00:48:22,831
Your Highness, don't you intend to deal with it?

534
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:30,471
Besides you, is there anyone else who saw it?

535
00:48:30,471 --> 00:48:32,781
This happened suddenly.

536
00:48:32,781 --> 00:48:36,131
So let's not pursue it for now.

537
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:39,721
A prince despised by his uncle

538
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:42,671
He will only become a laughing stock among his subjects.

539
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:51,451
This prince must find the black horn bow

540
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:52,721
[Black Horn Bow is a precious bow made of black ox horn]

541
00:48:51,451 --> 00:48:52,331
What

542
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:55,381
This prince will shoot all the arrogant people to protect himself

543
00:48:55,381 --> 00:48:58,271
This prince must find the strongest black horn bow in all of Korea.

544
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:02,301
The man who presented you with a bow a while ago has returned home.

545
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:03,841
Where should I find it?

546
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:06,121
Anyway, this prince just wants to get

547
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,471
The Queen Mother Arrives

548
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:15,861
Thanks a lot

549
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:17,981
The Queen Mother

550
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:28,651
You should also know that the Lord also learned the way of the emperor from this book "University"

551
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:31,891
Queen Mother

552
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:38,321
What happened

553
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:40,081
Nothing

554
00:49:42,061 --> 00:49:44,671
Studying Things to Gain Knowledge

555
00:49:42,351 --> 00:49:46,571
[Gewuzhizhi means to study the principles of things and learn knowledge thoroughly]

556
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:47,241
Even on this screen with the inscription by the Queen Mother,

557
00:49:47,241 --> 00:49:50,891
Don't just swallow it whole. Think carefully.

558
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:54,581
This is how you become an excellent king.

559
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:56,671
yes

560
00:49:58,181 --> 00:49:59,831
in addition

561
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,871
This is the letter Pan Zhu left for his mother five years ago.

562
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:07,031
Next to the Crown Prince's residence was a musician named Li Wufang.

563
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:09,821
There is also Gu Zongxiu from the Patrol Office

564
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:12,401
The prince seems to be leaving the palace often

565
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:14,981
Hanging out with these people

566
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:16,521
What these people are trying to achieve

567
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:18,941
When the prince ascends the throne

568
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:21,811
Can occupy a place

569
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:28,441
There are also rumors that Li Shufan had a close relationship with Gu Zongxiu's brothers.

570
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:30,951
It's just that this matter is still uncertain

571
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:33,811
It says what you received from whom.

572
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:36,661
And how you hang out outside the palace

573
00:50:36,661 --> 00:50:40,841
At that time, the Queen Mother had intended to call the Chief Justice of the Censorate to investigate.

574
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:41,911
[Zhiyi Sixianfu is a third-rank official responsible for criticizing government affairs and supervising officials]

575
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:44,511
But the palace is in a state of panic because of your uncles' problems.

576
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:47,011
The Queen Mother only punished a few of them and then left the matter in a hurry.

577
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:47,991
Queen Mother

578
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:51,791
These are not what you need to be a king.

579
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:52,901
What do you mean?

580
00:50:52,901 --> 00:50:55,321
It's strength

581
00:50:55,321 --> 00:50:59,411
Once you have determined your goal, you will never waver.

582
00:50:59,411 --> 00:51:01,021
Sometimes cruelty is necessary

583
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:02,221
strength

584
00:51:02,221 --> 00:51:03,271
Determined

585
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:05,391
and sometimes cruel

586
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:09,411
Is this what your king looks like?

587
00:51:19,901 --> 00:51:21,891
The Queen Mother Believes in the Prince

588
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:25,221
It's the Queen Mother

589
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:26,991
Go back

590
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:40,121
Your Majesty, it's best not to look for the Black Horn Bow.

591
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:40,861
Why

592
00:51:40,861 --> 00:51:43,071
The Queen will always watch your every move.

593
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:46,151
This prince must find it.

594
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:55,071
If we investigate through Gu Jong-soo, we may be able to find

595
00:51:56,371 --> 00:51:59,091
That one who went out of the palace to drink and hang out with this prince

596
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:01,181
Gu Zongxiu, who was convicted and returned home

597
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:02,811
It's your Highness

598
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:05,571
Go find

599
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:32,391
Ouch

600
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:33,751
You are here

601
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:38,011
Oh, the weather is so hot, thank you for your hard work. Give it to me.

602
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:42,261
What herbs did you bring today?

603
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:44,881
Place it under the east eaves from Shen to You hours

604
00:52:44,881 --> 00:52:47,531
Placed under the west eaves from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.

605
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:48,751
There is ventilation

606
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:51,511
Oh, you are thirsty.

607
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:52,781
Ouch

608
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,561
Drink this cup of tea now.

609
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:58,981
Thanks

610
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:03,241
Let me see

611
00:53:04,091 --> 00:53:06,611
This is honeysuckle

612
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:08,571
Oh my god

613
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:13,931
Marigolds are so pretty.

614
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:16,611
What herb is this?

615
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:19,121
Please let me stay by your side.

616
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:23,071
I am willing to accept any punishment

617
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,671
I was wrong, Your Highness.

618
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:27,351
Your Highness

619
00:53:28,301 --> 00:53:32,741
Shuyi obeyed the orders of the middle palace.

620
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:37,201
Your Highness

621
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:39,571
What are you standing there for?

622
00:53:42,171 --> 00:53:44,001
etc.

623
00:54:32,471 --> 00:54:36,371
It's great to be here with you.

624
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:38,691
Queen Mother

625
00:54:38,691 --> 00:54:43,401
Don't you think Hanyang is really vast?

626
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:47,671
There's no end in sight

627
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:54,781
Sir, don't you think Kaijing is really small?

628
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:58,711
You just said broad

629
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:00,861
yes

630
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:03,591
Why is this place so wide?

631
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:08,001
Because it's full of people

632
00:55:08,001 --> 00:55:10,211
People working on the land

633
00:55:10,211 --> 00:55:12,591
People who raise livestock

634
00:55:12,591 --> 00:55:14,551
Hungry people

635
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:16,801
People with diseases

636
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:20,561
Laughing people

637
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:22,521
Weeping People

638
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:30,381
So you...

639
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:34,201
Do you want to be the king of this country?

640
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:40,313
["Yuan Jing"]

641
00:56:09,271 --> 00:56:16,771
[Preview of the next episode]

642
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:21,541
Don't you know that the court officials are comparing you to Chungnyeong?

643
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,711
It is said that the prostitute was dressed in the clothes of a palace maid.

644
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:25,621
Hiding in the palace

645
00:56:25,621 --> 00:56:27,051
Is this the girl?

646
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:30,651
Bring this person to see the Holy

647
00:56:30,651 --> 00:56:34,461
My mother once said that the king must be held accountable

648
00:56:34,461 --> 00:56:37,031
If any palace maid is willing to come forward and explain the truth

649
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:39,051
This matter must be fought with life

650
00:56:39,051 --> 00:56:40,791
Your Highness must see clearly

651
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:44,971
The prince has no kingly demeanor
