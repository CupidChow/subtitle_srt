Killing Young-sil

00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,088
In the end, this is the only way I can save you.

10
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:11,248
Your Highness

11
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:13,987
You won't die

12
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:16,648
But you can only live like you're dead

13
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:17,738

The lady won't die.

22
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:21,008
But to me, she is already dead.

23
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:45,888
The queen's life is safe

24
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,608
But it may be difficult in the future...

25
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,208

yes

30
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:43,248
The duties of the harem are not just to give birth to children

31
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:45,828
Your Majesty wants my life so badly

32
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,458
How can you say such a thing?

33
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,308
Look at you lying like this now

34
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,528
It makes me doubt whether you are worthy of me.

35
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,047
I took your life with my own hands

36
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:57,778
Madam, please go back.

37
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:03,058
From the beginning, you only wanted to seek the meaning of your existence from a man

38
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:04,668
This is how it fell

39
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:06,328
Madam, please go back.

40
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:08,008
Please, my lady.

41
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:11,638
Why don't you find the meaning of living now?

42
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:14,758
In this case, I am willing to help you

43
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:16,768
How to live

44
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:21,378
A harem that cannot conceive

45
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:25,047
Don't forget

46
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,878
Can save you

47
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:29,807
Only you

48
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:51,248
Go to Mishang Palace to ask for an audience

49
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,868
Where is your highness?

50
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,288
Your Highness is resting at the moment

51
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:06,968
The Lord and the Queen finally started fighting

52
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:11,048
This is how I see it

53
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,538
Cheng En Shang Gong is very accurate

54
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:17,618
I just don't know why they are arguing like this.

55
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:24,908
Only by removing the power of powerful officials can we establish a Joseon centered on the people.

56
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,158
His Majesty seems to have made up his mind.

57
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:29,968
But

58
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,388
Who is standing at the center of this powerful official?

59
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:37,548
Isn't it the Queen Mother and her Min family?

60
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:54,568
Now, His Highness has neither the Queen Mother nor the Filial Palace Master by his side.

61
00:05:57,638 --> 00:06:01,408
There is no one beside His Highness.

62
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:06,808
yes

[Episode 5]

64

Your Highness

65
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,838
The Queen Mother is going too far.

66
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:38,848
If the queen can personally come out to stop it

67
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:40,548
Your Highness will be able to personally bring the Palace Master to...

68
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:41,848
Shut up

69
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:47,338
You must not discuss the Central Palace in this way without authorization.

70
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:48,377
yes

71
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:51,368
Your Highness, I am terrified

72
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:01,968
Your Highness

73
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:05,308
If His Highness shows up, won't it cause more trouble?

74
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:08,148
Isn't Your Highness on a secret visit?

75
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,508
[A secret visit to the monarch’s secret exit from the palace]

76
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:11,548
only

77
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:14,498
Whose farmland is so vast?

78
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:17,098
It belongs to Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun

79
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,748
When the king decided to return to the capital,

80
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:26,288
Many powerful officials bought these farmlands from farmers.

81
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,168
Very low price

82
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:30,748
I heard that they bought it at that time.

83
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:35,058
Brother, have you heard about it?

84
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:39,828
I heard that the Lord wanted to kill Yingshi in front of the Queen.

85
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:43,348
Not to kill her but to save her.

86
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:45,397
How do you say this?

87
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:50,808
Even so, Na Yingshi is dead anyway.

88
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:54,978
The forces that intend to restore the king to the throne are in league with Young-sil.

89
00:08:54,978 --> 00:09:00,178
Only the Queen Mother can save Yingshi's life

90
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:02,458
Seeing no movement in the middle hall

91
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,828
In order to save Yingshi, the Lord

92
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:07,968
in the end

93
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:10,998
This can only make the Queen Mother in trouble.

94
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,518
This should be Quan Hong's daughter.

95
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:50,118
Are you referring to the person who plays the Xuanqin?

96
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:51,198
yes

97
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:54,228
Isn't Kwon Hong the same person as Sungkyunkwan Lejong?

98
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:55,688
[Sungkyunkwan Music Master, a fourth-rank official in Goryeo and Joseon who studied music theoretically]

102
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:13,728
The chrysanthemum wine brewed last autumn should be drinkable now.

103

104
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:17,668
How come you contacted me so suddenly?

105
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:18,958
This way please

Your Highness

108
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,358
Why not recruit her into the palace?

109
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:25,568
It's good to have someone to comfort you when you are depressed

110
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,948
You want me to take her into my harem?

111
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:28,898
yes

112
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:36,328
She is the daughter of a scholar-official.

113
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:38,428
[Scholars entered the officialdom through the imperial examination
Former and current civil servants and bureaucrats (including candidate bureaucrats)]

114
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,308
How can I...

115
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:40,908
So naturally we have to be courteous

116
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:44,548
For example, the establishment of Jiali color is very grand

117
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:46,228
[Galise is a temporary institution established for royal marriages]

118
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:54,918
Your Highness, have you seen the land bought by the Min brothers?

119
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,498
Who do they rely on?

120
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,818
To contain the palace

121
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:04,568
The best is other powerful harem

122
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:25,568
Including my uncle

123
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:28,578
These powerful officials bought good farmland long before returning to Kaijing

124
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,798
[They all moved back to their former capital]

125
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:30,478
How many people are there like this?

126
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:32,548
There should be quite a few

127
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:35,588
After all, these people hold money and information.

128
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,768
Is it the same with you, my dear?

129
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,328
I naturally enjoy some of the benefits that power brings.

130
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:50,008
However, these benefits of my ministers will definitely not harm the reforms that Your Highness dreams of.

131
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:59,028
The blessings of power

132
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,088
That's right

133
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:16,798
I intend to take Quan Hong's daughter into my harem

134

Your Highness

135
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:21,788
If we can weaken the power of the Min family

136
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:24,518
I can join forces with anyone

137
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:30,708
The matter of Jia Li Se will be handed over to Ai Qing to prepare

138

Where is His Royal Highness resting?

148
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:14,388
I heard that His Highness went to Cheng'en Shang Gong's place.

149
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:19,408

Your Highness will never abandon me.

153

Your Highness told me to live like a dead person.

154
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:52,998
But I can't live like this.

155
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,948
After thinking it over and over, I feel that I cannot live like this.

00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,888
Even Jianjia Lise

187
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,528
Jia...Jia...Jia Li Se

188
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:02,438
It must be that Shufan intended to humiliate the Queen Mother.

189
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,338
The Lord was bewitched by that uncle.

190
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:18,868
I want to establish a good etiquette and take Quan Hong's daughter into the harem

191
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:20,598
What

192
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:24,398
Your Highness

193
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:25,787
Your Highness, do you want to have a harem?

194
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:29,368
Your Highness is the king of a country, but he just wants to take concubines into the harem.

195
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:31,638
As subjects, we only need to accept the order.

196
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:34,037
But His Highness not only wants to take in a harem, but also wants to establish a good etiquette.

197
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:36,948
Your Highness wants to welcome the daughter of a scholar-official into the harem

198
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:39,078
Should be courteous

199
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,928
At present, the state affairs are heavy and piled up like a mountain

200
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,948
The reproduction of royal offspring is also a major state affair

201
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,218
Your Highness

202
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:52,768
temple...

203
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:54,968
No need

204
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:56,058
I am willing to wait

205
00:17:56,058 --> 00:18:00,978
I heard that not long ago, Ancheng-kun accompanied His Highness to visit Quan Hong's residence.

206
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:02,178
How did Lichengjun know

207
00:18:02,178 --> 00:18:04,168
Ancheng-kun, do you think there is an impenetrable wall in the world?

208
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:09,398
I think Licheng Jun is watching his lord's every move as a subject.

209
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:12,518
Ancheng-kun, please don't sow discord

210
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:14,138
How can we sow discord?

211
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:17,768
What I mean is that you should not provoke His Highness and our Min family.

212
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,548
Your Highness, what are you talking about?

213
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:22,768
Your Highness

214
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,598
Might as well continue

215
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:26,778
Your Highness

216
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:29,418
Ancheng-kun is just jealous of your highness's relationship with our Min family.

217
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:31,368
In order to provoke this, Quan Hong's daughter...

218
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:34,818
Licheng Jun thought that the Queen Mother had comforted the Lord.

219
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:35,968
you...

220
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:40,088
For a king, women should be a place of rest.

221
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:41,278
Not you...

222
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:42,658
you

223
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:44,968
Go and report

224
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:50,008
Your Highness, the Queen has arrived.

225
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,388
I intend to build a harem

226
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:20,908
This is also a concubine's matter

227
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:22,028
[All the maids in the palace with ranks]

228
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,038
According to etiquette, this matter is done by...

229
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,828
No

230
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:26,608
No

231
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:30,128
If His Highness intends to hold a state wedding with great fanfare

232
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:34,468
The people would think that His Highness is going to welcome the new Queen into the palace.

233
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:36,788
The middle palace has too many thoughts and is too delusional.

234
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:40,928
If the newly-acquired concubine is favored and gives birth to a little prince

235
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:45,348
How can His Highness know that the bloody storm that His Highness has experienced will not happen again?

236
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:48,438
The Queen Mother doubts my feelings towards her.

237
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,848
yes

238
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:50,658
Where is Li Ti?

239
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:51,648
nave

240
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,658
My children

241
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,408
nave

242
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:54,458
Our Ti'er

243
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,418
Our Patient

244
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:56,848
Our son

245
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:59,428
I will keep these children's place.

246
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,208
They are all widows' children.

247
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,088
If Your Highness insists on doing so

248
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:07,078
I will die in front of your Highness.

249
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,098
What

250
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,818
If Your Highness has no more orders

251
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:15,228
I plan to go back to my parents' home.

252
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:16,938
I do not allow

253
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:19,048
If everything...

254
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,998
If the palace doesn't follow orders in every matter

255
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:26,028
I will eventually lose the love of the widower

256
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:31,518
Lost His Highness's Love

257
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:34,048
It will definitely not make me lose myself

258
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:36,018
This Korea was built by me.

259
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:40,378
The Queen must be a Korean woman

260
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:41,608
I wish

261
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,398
Died as a Goryeo woman

262
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:10,488
Still so leisurely

263
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:18,628
I heard that the new harem

264
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:20,658
Plays the Xuanqin very well

265
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:21,928
yes

266
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,568
It seems that she was influenced by her father.

267
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:30,398
As early as the Lord's residence

268
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:31,978
[The residence of the king before he ascended the throne]

269
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:34,378
He would call the musicians to come to his house to play the piano and music.

270
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:39,898
Every time I look at His Majesty, who is intoxicated by the music,

271
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,518
I hope I am that Xuanqin

272
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:48,908
Daughter of Quan Hong

273
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,948
Is there any handle?

274
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:52,338
Hard to say

275
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:56,728
She comes from a wealthy family and is a lady from a noble family.

276
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:58,288
Nothing special

277
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:03,688
So I know

278
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,148
What do these people have?

279
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:07,598
This kind of person?

280
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:10,098
People who have always been in the spotlight

281
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:13,608
Someone who gets praised just for smiling

282
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:16,298
This is the kind of person I'm talking about.

283
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:17,698
later

284
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:22,078
I will bite these handles hard

285
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:08,698
lady...

286
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,388
But it's okay

287
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:14,938
I will just look ahead

288
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,698
Empress of the Middle Temple

289
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:32,968
Father

290
00:23:33,448 --> 00:23:35,968
The hard work of the Central Palace

291
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,308
Come in quickly please

292
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:50,078
Mother

293
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:53,248
Not how...

294
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:55,518
Is my mother doing well?

295
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,478
Ouch

296
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:58,478
Ouch

297
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:07,158
His Majesty has arrived

298
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:30,138
This is a wine made with ginseng and Acanthopanax senticosus.

299
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:34,838
It will definitely warm your heart and soul.

300
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,328
The slave wants...

301
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:20,138
The birth of the little prince

302
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:27,128
I will give birth to a little prince...

303
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:31,988
From now on, I will not take any woman seriously.

304
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,338
Slave...

305
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:37,218
Already understood

306
00:26:55,298 --> 00:27:00,368
I heard that Jia Li Se had sent the betrothal gifts to Quan Hong's mansion.

307
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:01,698
[The item that the groom gives to the bride when he proposes marriage]

308
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,338
The Lord must be crazy

309
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:06,278
That day, I blocked the iron hammer of the Supreme King at the Higan Temple.

310
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:07,028
[Father of King Lee Seong-gye and Lee Bang-won]

311
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:09,808
And he saved His Highness when the King was in danger of usurping the throne.

312
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:10,008
[The second brother of King Lee Bang-gwa and Lee Bang-won]

313
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:11,968
But they are all the Queen Mother of the Central Palace

314
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:15,438
But how could His Highness betray me like this?

315
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:17,708
The reason why the Lord would not hesitate to build a good etiquette

316
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,958
Na Quan entered the palace

317
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:23,298
They must be planning to use the Quan family to suppress our Min family.

318
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:27,808
What's more, the person in charge of Jia Li Se is Lord He Lun.

319
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:30,098
It's not about taking a harem.

320
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:33,078
Using Young-sil and Chae-ryeong to humiliate the Queen

321
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:35,238
This is completely different from the

322
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:39,448
Do you have the confidence to change this king?

323
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:42,768
Empress of the Middle Temple

324
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:45,058
If not

325
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:47,218
Just shut up for me.

326
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:59,078
I want to take the daughter of Sungkyunkwan Lejeong Kwon-hong into my harem

327
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:04,218
My dear ministers, you should do your best to prepare for the lottery.

328
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:33,498
There is no one in the palace at this moment.

329
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:41,948
Although the concubine...

330
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:44,758
Failure to give birth to a son

331
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:47,538
I'm a brother, and I've always treated her well because of our relationship over the years.

332
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:50,518
The Queen gave birth to three sons.

333
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:55,088
What is the Lord dissatisfied with?

334
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:05,318
The Supreme King once said that if we cannot suppress those powerful officials

335
00:30:05,318 --> 00:30:09,018
After all, we cannot reform for the people.

336
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:12,778
The Min family in the middle hall

337
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,638
The core of the powerful officials

338
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:20,468
Therefore, the Lord wants to recruit more concubines to disperse the power of the Central Palace

339
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:27,518
Is this true?

340
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:35,138
The Lord never completely suppressed the confidence of the Central Palace from the beginning.

341
00:30:35,138 --> 00:30:40,638
Therefore, no matter how you include her in the harem, the result will probably not change.

342
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:57,758
The Queen seems to have been away from the palace for too long.

343
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:05,388
Don't worry

344
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:27,708
I heard that Prince of Yan Zhu Di has seized the power of the Ming Dynasty.

345
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:28,988
[The Jingnan Campaign was launched by Zhu Di (Emperor Yongle) to save the country from his nephew Zhu Yunwen (Emperor Jianwen).
The war for the Ming throne]

346
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:29,198
Where is Zhu Yunwen?

347
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:35,928
When Zhu Di's elite troops attacked Nanjing, Zhu Yunwen's whereabouts were unknown.

348
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:43,538
There are also rumors that Zhu Yunwen died miserably in the city to avoid the war.

349
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:45,688
only

350
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:48,298
My dear, report truthfully

351
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:50,978
Why should I look at the eyes of the gnomes?

352
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:55,228
I am terrified

353
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:59,268
In this case, it is necessary to ask Zhu Di for the imperial edict and seal.

354
00:31:57,118 --> 00:32:01,698
[The document of enthronement of the King of Joseon received from China]
[The seal was bestowed upon the emperor when he received the imperial edict from China]

355
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:02,648
Formal discussion of tribute matters

356
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:05,208
Prepare for the Tribute with a Great Ceremony

357
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:09,268
As for the tribute and thank you gift, it should be determined by our dynasty

358
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:13,928
Serving a great power is a small country serving a great power with tribute.

359
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:17,898
Therefore, I think that the tribute and thank-you gift were determined privately.

360
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:19,458
Impolite

361
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:22,408
My dear, do you know why this big thing came about?

362
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:25,778
As early as the Shang and Zhou dynasties

363
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:30,618
In order to avoid war with surrounding vassal states, the Shang and Zhou dynasties accepted tribute

364
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,698
Adopt small countries to offer tribute

365
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:35,248
The great country responded with a thank you gift

366
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:37,258
This is the actual trade

367
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:40,058
Aiming to build good neighborliness through trade

368
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,638
But

369
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:45,748
My dear, why are you so humble and anxious to only think about offering sacrifices?

370
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:56,128
If you scold your subjects angrily because they don't know something

371
00:32:56,128 --> 00:32:59,578
It will only make the ministers resent the king.

372
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:06,478
I think it would be better to invite the Queen Mother back.

373
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:08,208
Why the sudden mention of the Middle Temple?

374
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:11,778
Because His Highness seems to be uneasy

375
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:14,108
It was the Queen Mother who asked to leave the palace because she didn't want to see me.

376
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:16,018
Your Highness

377
00:33:16,018 --> 00:33:20,798
Why can't Your Highness see through his own heart?

378
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:02,318
Why can't Your Highness see through his own heart?

379
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,357
I have fear in my heart

380
00:34:22,348 --> 00:34:24,718
Don't be afraid

381
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:26,598
History tonight

382
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,718
She's definitely on our side.

383
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:36,698
Prepare the horse

384
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:06,838
Open the door

385
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:08,658
Open the door

386
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:24,628
The outsiders said that the prince had come down.

387
00:35:26,448 --> 00:35:27,788
You said the Lord is coming

388
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:28,448
yes

389
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:30,178
Where is the good Lord now?

390
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:31,818
Go back to the wing room

391
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:33,878
His Highness told me to find a good day to come back.

392
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:36,938
So there is no need to make noise today

393
00:35:57,598 --> 00:35:58,908
nave

394
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,688
Why is Your Highness here?

395
00:36:09,928 --> 00:36:11,768
I miss you

396
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,818
The widow's heart is depressed

397
00:36:15,818 --> 00:36:17,468
It's hard to suppress

398
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,268
Then came

399
00:36:21,828 --> 00:36:25,908
Please remove the Jiali Se

400
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:27,388
I said I came here because I wanted to visit the Central Palace.

401
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:31,368
It was your highness that made our relationship like this.

402
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:37,968
good

403
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:07,468
I heard that the Queen Mother is back.

404
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:10,358
I heard that His Highness personally welcomed her back at dawn.

405
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,228
Empress of the Middle Temple

406
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:25,778
I have something to say to Anjo-kun

407
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,388
yes

408
00:37:41,168 --> 00:37:45,708
Why did Anjo-kun stand under the dangerous wall?

409
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:48,998
How can you say it is standing under a dangerous wall?

410
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:52,558
Is to oppose this palace

411
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:58,728
Since Ancheng-kun is so concerned about me, I will let go of the matter of taking a harem for now.

412
00:37:58,728 --> 00:37:59,918
only

413
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,238
Don't expect me to allow more

414
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:08,328
Even if my power is small, I should use it.

415
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,248
grown ups

416
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:23,378
Why do you say that, sir?

417
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:25,058
How could the Jia Li Se be removed?

418
00:38:25,058 --> 00:38:26,478
Mr. Quan

419
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:27,738
This official is helpless.

420
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,378
The Lord granted the request after the Queen Mother begged him.

421
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:32,638
You are all in league with the Min family

422
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,968
This... this is humiliating my family.

423
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:37,988
Why do you say that, sir?

424
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:39,068
If I had known this earlier...

425
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:42,788
If a little prince is born in the future, things will be completely different.

426
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:46,388
By then, she will be the only concubine from a powerful family besides the Empress.

427
00:39:35,618 --> 00:39:37,328
Did you hear what Dad said?

428
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:43,808
At least I'm marrying you to the king of a country.

429
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:46,258
Dad, I'm sorry that the wedding ceremony is so shabby.

430
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,548
Now the harem of the Lord is of humble origin.

431
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:53,728
Don't forget this

432
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:57,748
Let's go

433
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:17,838
Please come in.

434
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:42,168
Put it here.

435
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:54,688
The wedding ceremony will be held at 3:00 pm three days later.

436
00:40:51,608 --> 00:40:56,378
[The wedding ceremony is a ceremony where the bride and groom bow to each other and toast to each other to sign the marriage agreement]

437
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:56,708
I'm tired after starting so busy early in the morning.

438
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,588
Rest early.

439
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:04,768
This time it's really scary.

440
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:12,018
I never dreamed that His Majesty would come to Chudong in person late at night.

441
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:15,318
The relationship between the two of you is really special.

442
00:41:16,948 --> 00:41:18,998
I'm so lucky.

443
00:41:20,638 --> 00:41:23,158
But after this battle

444
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:30,138
It is certain that His Majesty wanted to use other forces to contain our Min family.

445
00:41:32,378 --> 00:41:36,448
We also need to take this opportunity to show the power of our Min family.

446
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:38,438
How to show

447
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:40,728
Planning a party for my father

448
00:41:40,728 --> 00:41:42,158
Banquet?

449
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:46,308
My father plans to host a banquet in the palace to entertain His Majesty.

450
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:48,138
Those heroes will be called upon at that time.

451
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,268
And Lord Helun

452
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,678
Good idea

453
00:41:55,678 --> 00:41:59,008
This will allow them to see clearly the power of our Min family.

454
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:01,478
only

455
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:05,668
Will the Lord easily agree to come?

456
00:42:05,668 --> 00:42:09,778
The night when the Lord came to invite the Queen back to the palace

457
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,498
Don't we in the Min family offer any hospitality?

458
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:15,308
If the father personally invites

459
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:17,568
The Lord will definitely not refuse

460
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,478
I'd like to take this opportunity to invite Li Shufan along.

461
00:42:24,478 --> 00:42:27,028
Put an end to his prestige

462
00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:55,528
This is the silk of Ming Dynasty

463
00:42:55,528 --> 00:42:58,838
Wangzhongdian Niangniang likes

464
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:01,728
The one who opposes Jianjia Lise is this palace

465
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:04,908
You can't help but complain

466
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:06,968
It's rare that you can still laugh

467
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:12,978
There is only one thing I can give you.

468
00:43:12,978 --> 00:43:17,058
Don't risk your everything for the king's love

469
00:43:18,618 --> 00:43:19,758
What

470
00:43:19,758 --> 00:43:22,438
My meaning is that even if it is not for the love of the king

471
00:43:22,438 --> 00:43:28,328
You also need to find your own reason to live in this palace

472
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:35,098
The Queen Mother

473
00:43:57,788 --> 00:43:59,498
Here

474
00:44:02,508 --> 00:44:05,968
The wedding ceremony has been held for several days.

475
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:10,318
It's time for Shang Gong Cheng'en to pay her respects today.

476
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:16,268
If it's delayed too long, it might not be good for Lady Seong-eun.

477
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:29,108
These koi are so cute!

478
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:31,538
It's true, ma'am.

479
00:44:32,898 --> 00:44:34,118
Cheng'en Shanggong

480
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:46,538
Hello

481
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:49,768
Hello

482
00:44:56,888 --> 00:44:58,468
It's you

483
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,448
Why don't you come and greet me?

484
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:06,188
I'm asking you

485
00:45:06,728 --> 00:45:11,648
I just don't know how to treat you.

486
00:45:11,648 --> 00:45:13,578
What does it mean to treat this palace?

487
00:45:14,528 --> 00:45:16,008
presumptuous

488
00:45:19,198 --> 00:45:21,048
why are you laughing

489
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:25,958
I have thought that maybe one day

490
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:31,138
The queen would scold the slave for being presumptuous.

491
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,898
Do you want to die?

492
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:40,058
How is that possible?

493
00:45:43,428 --> 00:45:46,348
From now on, between the queen and the servants

494
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:48,798
There is only one person who can maintain order

495
00:45:48,798 --> 00:45:50,928
His Majesty

496
00:45:52,688 --> 00:45:55,098
Madam, can you have confidence?

497
00:45:56,328 --> 00:45:57,588
Slave...

498
00:45:58,528 --> 00:46:00,768
Have confidence

499
00:46:10,138 --> 00:46:11,418
Your Highness

500
00:46:39,618 --> 00:46:42,048
You are really outrageous.

501
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:45,338
Your Highness

502
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:51,948
You mean you have the confidence to win my heart?

503
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,038
I understand that except for the Queen Mother

504
00:46:57,038 --> 00:47:00,158
No one can capture His Highness's heart.

505
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:03,198
So

506
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,608
Where do you get your confidence from?

507
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:15,648
I ask you where your confidence comes from.

508
00:47:15,648 --> 00:47:18,338
Even if it is difficult to win the favor of His Highness

509
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,148
Even if it is difficult to win the heart of the widower

510
00:47:24,118 --> 00:47:28,198
I am also useful to Your Highness.

511
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:33,028
That’s why I say I have confidence

512
00:47:33,028 --> 00:47:34,858
That's what I mean

513
00:47:36,998 --> 00:47:39,158
it works

514
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:50,498
His Majesty witnessed the scene where the Shang Gong Chengen insulted the Princess Zhenyi.

515
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:55,848
Even if the master reprimanded the concubines for lax discipline, the queen would have nothing to say.

516
00:47:55,848 --> 00:47:59,638
It's not too late now. Your Majesty, why don't you call Concubine Cheng'en to hold her accountable?

517
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:03,828
The majesty of the tree palace

518
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:09,798
Who can such a petty person show the dignity of the imperial palace to?

519
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:11,228
Niangniang

520
00:48:11,228 --> 00:48:13,628
Where is Cheng'en Shanggong now?

521
00:48:24,258 --> 00:48:28,008
I was the first one favored by His Highness.

522
00:48:28,968 --> 00:48:31,908
Can Cheng'en Shanggong really bear the Queen?

523
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:34,968
Did you forget to think carefully?

524
00:48:34,968 --> 00:48:37,638
Who caused the filial palace master to fall into such a state?

525
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:49,278
If the Queen Mother wants to serve Cheng'en Shang Gong with a whip, she must also show her willingness to be punished.

526
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:52,288
Maybe I can win sympathy from outsiders

527
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:56,538
The Queen Mother Cheng En Shang Gong is here

528
00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:04,488
Empress of the Middle Temple

529
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:06,078
Come over here and sit

530
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,358
I'm afraid you're tired of drinking this tea.

531
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,138
Can I have a drink?

532
00:49:21,248 --> 00:49:22,988
No

533
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:33,718
Empress of the Middle Temple

534
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:38,468
Your Majesty, it would be better for you to reward me with a thorn stick.

535
00:49:38,468 --> 00:49:40,228
Why

536
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:44,678
It was this servant who was disrespectful to Palace Master Zhenyi.

537
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:49,758
This palace is difficult to do

538
00:49:49,758 --> 00:49:51,768
How can I blame you?

539
00:49:58,878 --> 00:50:04,908
In a few days, I will go to my mother's home in Chudong with my master.

540
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:08,428
I will go there first to prepare

541
00:50:14,218 --> 00:50:19,948
In this case, please allow me to accompany you.

542
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:27,938
Ringback Tone

543
00:50:29,788 --> 00:50:31,098
exist

544
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:35,548
Don't push yourself to the edge of a cliff.

545
00:50:46,578 --> 00:50:47,918
yes

546
00:50:48,718 --> 00:50:50,548
Empress of the Middle Temple

547
00:51:00,418 --> 00:51:02,238
Is the countermeasure against rebellion going well?

548
00:51:02,238 --> 00:51:02,788
yes

549
00:51:02,788 --> 00:51:05,028
We are fully prepared.

550
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:08,838
I just heard that Licheng Jun went to the Chudong Cave.

551
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:12,068
The middle temple also decided to go first

552
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:18,298
The nave is past

553
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:25,978
Xuan Chengen Shang Gong

554
00:51:25,978 --> 00:51:27,228
yes

555
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,858
The movement in the northeast is unusual

556
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:39,648
[The birthplace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye in the northeastern region, nowadays Hamgyong Province]

557
00:51:39,858 --> 00:51:41,908
Northeast

558
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,668
Is it the Supreme King?

559
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:47,828
Although I don't know where the Supreme King is

560
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:51,488
But there is solid news that the families in the northeast have taken action.

561
00:51:48,368 --> 00:51:51,428
[The family copied the most elite private soldiers in the palace of King Taejo Lee Seong-gye]

562
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:54,748
The weapons were also swept away.

563
00:51:55,228 --> 00:51:56,968
weapon

564
00:51:59,088 --> 00:52:00,838
Does the Queen Mother know about this?

565
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:03,078
It has already been reported.

566
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,388
What does the queen say?

567
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:08,588
I have to go see Pan Zhu

568
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,458
After all, there is the matter of the king.

569
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,998
And the Lord is watching

570
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:19,618
Especially when it comes to leaving the palace...

571
00:52:19,988 --> 00:52:21,588
A big deal

572
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:25,508
Is Pansu... the blind man?

573
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:26,648
[Blind person]

574
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:26,698
yes

575
00:52:27,398 --> 00:52:28,528
when

576
00:52:29,268 --> 00:52:34,418
The Queen said that she would come out of the palace to meet us a few days before the banquet at our Min family

577
00:52:35,188 --> 00:52:36,448
not good

578
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:42,608
Why do I have to see the blind man at this moment?

579
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:01,938
Oh my god

580
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:06,268
When the queen first came, she was just a little girl of this age.

581
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:07,478
Are you doing well?

582
00:53:07,478 --> 00:53:08,728
yes

583
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:28,268
Hello, Madam

584
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:37,798
Who is passing the message to the middle hall?

585
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:17,538
I heard that the Northeast will soon rise up in arms.

586
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:20,638
Will the father also accompany the army?

587
00:54:20,638 --> 00:54:21,878
yes

588
00:54:21,878 --> 00:54:26,288
It's just that the King is ill.

589
00:54:26,288 --> 00:54:30,678
Only after letting the soldiers see that I am still strong

590
00:54:30,678 --> 00:54:33,868
Then we will go to Genzhongpu

591
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:34,918
[A port in Wonjungpo, Hwanghae Province]

592
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:37,178
Yuanzhongpu

593
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:37,448
This is what His Highness had told me to do.

594
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:39,458
But anyway

595
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:40,578
Others are fine.

596
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:44,738
How could Cheng'en Shanggong spy on the Queen?

597
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,698
How do you plan to report?

598
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,328
The servant did not...

599
00:55:54,928 --> 00:55:56,928
See something special

600
00:55:56,928 --> 00:55:59,898
Didn't see anything special

601
00:56:01,218 --> 00:56:02,418
yes

602
00:56:10,128 --> 00:56:12,478
Please believe me, Your Majesty.

603
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,948
Please believe me.

604
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:34,408
Your Highness

605
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:38,568
Why did His Highness accept the invitation to the banquet from Lixingfuyuanjun at this time?

606
00:56:36,398 --> 00:56:39,758
[Father of Queen Wonkyeongun of Yeoheungbu]

607
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:42,048
I understand your concerns.

608
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:53,928
drive

609
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:58,218
His Highness will come

610
00:56:58,218 --> 00:57:00,018
Go to tell the ringback tone

611
00:57:17,578 --> 00:57:19,118
Why

612
00:57:19,118 --> 00:57:21,508
I will ask my servant to come here

613
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:24,808
I just remember the past

614
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:29,338
You are here to help me bathe, right?

615
00:57:31,408 --> 00:57:32,928
Come in

616
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:36,708
How dare I...

617
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:40,218
Do you want me to go out?

618
00:58:14,468 --> 00:58:15,818
Ringback Tone

619
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:20,318
Don't push yourself to the edge of a cliff.

620
00:59:12,468 --> 00:59:14,718
[Preview of the next episode]

621
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:18,378
The look in the eyes of the people looking at our Min family has become sharper.

622
00:59:18,378 --> 00:59:20,538
They will keep an eye on everything about me.

623
00:59:20,538 --> 00:59:21,818
They will keep watching

624
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:24,488
Watching closely and trying to find my loopholes

625
00:59:24,488 --> 00:59:26,418
Didn't you say that even if you dedicate your body to the Lord

626
00:59:26,418 --> 00:59:28,958
Does your heart still belong to me?

627
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,958
Asshole

628
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:33,548
This is all for His Highness.

629
00:59:33,548 --> 00:59:35,428
This battle will never be won

630
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:37,038
That's a battlefield.

631
00:59:37,038 --> 00:59:38,668
A matter of life and death

632
00:59:38,668 --> 00:59:40,108
Kill him
