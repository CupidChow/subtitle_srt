I think it was the Queen who became the ruler of Joseon.

Please help me, sir.

28

You want your daughter to be the crown prince's concubine

29
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:31,357
So we need the clan members to recommend

30
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,367
yes

[Previous Situation]

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,410
This is the first time since the founding of the country that a crown prince's concubine has been chosen.

39
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,200
What we are going to do next will become a model

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,020
And this example will become history

41
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,210
Be fearful when preparing

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,590
Are these the only people?

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,860
yes

44
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,160
There are only three people, including the daughter of Ancheng Jun Yi Shufan

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,210
What's more, the other two are just foils.

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,640
I heard that the clan members are also recommending Anjo-kun.

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,250
This palace does not allow

50
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,240
But...if the person is recommended by the clan

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm afraid your Highness will have no choice but to accept it.

52
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,470
Go back to the expedition

53
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,860
I will not choose the Crown Prince's concubine based on this.

54
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,090
good

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,700
My dear, you requested to see the emperor alone.

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,960
yes

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,860
What is it for?

58
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,230
I want to present my daughter to Your Highness as your daughter-in-law.

Selection is the responsibility of the Central Palace

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,610
I will offer my daughter

62
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,660
It's all out of loyalty to His Majesty.

63
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,850
How could this be the palace's business?

Just don't know

72
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,570
I don't know why His Highness treats me differently than before.

73
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,880
My dear, I treat you differently than before.

74
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,270

Oh, this is good stuff.

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,580
Thanks

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,600
The one who looked like a lady

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,620
Why did her husband break her heart?

87
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,180
What? Could it be that her husband has a prostitute concubine?

88
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,570
What is this?

89
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,770
The master only recognizes our wife in his heart

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,740
I have something to ask of you.

91
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,450
But at your command

92
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,490
It seems that someone gave the prince a luxurious bow.

93
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,490
It's a gift, but it's actually a bribe

94
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,160
I hope you can help me find out who these people are.

95
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,000
If you find out

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,890
You should inform the abbot of Higanji Temple.

97
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,950
yes

98
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,450
Oh, there is

99
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:25,930
Not long ago, there was some trouble in the residence of Ancheng Jun Li Shufan

100
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,950
What is it?

101
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:34,120
A maidservant whom Anjo-kun's daughter regarded as a sister committed suicide.

102
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,240
What

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,620
Why

104
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:43,450
It seems that the Ancheng King ordered the palace to return all the bribes received from the Yegu Jin family.

105
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,140
But the daughter of Lord Anjou refused to return the ring.

106
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,320
When Anjo-kun found out, he reprimanded him.

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,520
The daughter of Lord Anjou said that the ring was stolen by the maid.

108
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,560
In other words, it was actually Anjo-kun's daughter who stole the ring.

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,370
But he framed the maid

110
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,560

Oh my god

113
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,160
Take this tofu down quickly.

114
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,430
The tofu is so heavy, how come you, a lady from a yangban family, carried it yourself?

115
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,940
Oh, I'll take the top.

116
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,150
How can you hold these with your hands like this?

117
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,650
Sit here and eat something before you leave.

118
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,290
I'll get two bowls of soup and rice.

119
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,540
Ah no

120
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,910
I won't bother you if you still have business to do here.

121
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,910
Please help me settle the bill

122
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,270
good

123
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,350
Did the queen say Jin Hanlao's daughter?

124
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,450
Exactly

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,180

I am not talking about him now, Mr. Jin Han.

144
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,590
But the daughter of Jin Hanlao

145
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,100
But the Queen Mother

146
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,570
If you don't give me any chance because of my father's absence

147
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,020
That is the violence of an entire country against an individual.

148
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,730
So I plan to let the daughter of Lord Ancheng compete with the daughter of Lord Jin Han.

Empress of the Middle Temple

150

The Lord is considering Anjo-kun's daughter.

151
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,160
This matter still needs to be reported to His Highness...

152
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,300
Last time, I made the rules clear.

153
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,510
They will never allow the Crown Prince's concubine to be chosen as a means for them to satisfy their own selfish desires.

154
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,100
I heard that Your Highness is considering the daughter of Ancheng Jun Li Shufan.

155
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,250
I don't know what the middle temple thinks

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,120
I heard that Ancheng Jun requested to see the emperor alone.

157
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,700
Even more tears to advise

158
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,570
This person can definitely perform such loyalty

159
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,680
I naturally won't believe these.

160
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,000
So

161
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,900

165
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,130
However, this time we are looking for a lifelong companion for the prince.

166
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,200
In the end, the prince will become the king of a country.

167

The guards are the royal guards who protect the king's power.

168

The prince's wedding is naturally closely related to politics

My intention is to strengthen the kingship.

171
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,420
The middle temple should also think about it carefully.

[Daughter of Li Shufan of the Ancheng Li family]

173
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,340
[Daughter of Jin Hanlao, the Jin family of Gwangsan]

174
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,570
Ti'er, you're about to meet your lifelong friend. How do you feel?

175
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,990
I don't know

176
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,570
Father hopes to be someone like your mother.

177
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,380
Queen Mother?

178
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,500
Why

179
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,620
Your mother is upright.

180
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,750
Once you have determined your goal, you will move forward courageously.

181
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,670
Such a temperament is really precious

182
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,160
But I feel that this kind of temperament can sometimes be tiring.

183
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,480
Your Highness, let me be your servant

184
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,010
No need

185
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,860
Mencius mentioned this in his chapter on the

186
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,980
The people are precious The people are precious

187
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,610
Sheji is second to Sheji

188
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,370
[Sheji refers to the country or the court in general]
Sheji is second to Sheji

189
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,890
The King is Light The King is Light
[Sheji refers to the country or the court in general]

190
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,710
The King is Light The King is Light

191
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,530
This is what Mencius said in the chapter on the mind.

192
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,080
The king is so insignificant in front of the people

193
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,940
What's more, she is the Crown Prince's concubine

194
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,930
During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, there were Xia Jie and Zhou Wang

195
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,340
I heard that the two kings became dictators overnight.

196
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,230
Do you know what a dictator means?

197
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,700
A dictator is a lonely man.

198
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,180
A cruel and unjust king who was driven out of power by the people is a tyrant.

199
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,700
Exactly

200
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:04,260
There is a saying that goes, "If you caress me, you will be hated later, if you abuse me, you will be hated later."

201
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,990
Do you know where it comes from?

202
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,550
From the Book of Shangshu, Taishi

203
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,830
Really smart

204
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,060
The afternoon selection will be carried out at 3 p.m.

205
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,670
[3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.]
The afternoon selection will be carried out at 3 p.m.

206
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,990
The two ladies can take a rest after dinner.
[3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.]

207
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,200
The two ladies can take a rest after dinner.

208
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,620
Wait until the time comes.

209
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,080
I will go and ask the Queen Mother to come.

210
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,250
If I were as wealthy as you,

211
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,510
Will they also go through such a selection?

212
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,190
What do you think, Madam?

213
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,430
Anjo-kun's daughter seems to be smart and clever

214
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,770
The Queen doesn't think she seems to be distracted

215
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,860
Are you only interested in studying?

216
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,430
Focus

217
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,940
I don't have any special intentions.

218
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,020
How could the Queen choose the Crown Prince's concubine based on her intelligence alone?

219
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,320
How will you choose?

220
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,930
The Queen Mother will see the person

221
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,220
The daughter of Jin Hanlao will be selected

222
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,090
Is that what you think, Madam?

223
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,050
I think maybe Li Shufan's daughter will be selected.

224
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,950
After all, choosing a concubine is not just about choosing a person.

225
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,160
But to find a political partner

226
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,980
Not long ago, there was a silkworm ceremony in the palace.

227
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,790
Do you know why the Silkworm Ceremony is held?

228
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,850
The Silkworm Ceremony is for the Improvement of People's Livelihood

229
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,520
The Queen Mother personally demonstrated silkworm rearing to the court and the public.

230
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,960
Exactly

231
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,330
But I think there is a problem with the Silkworm Ceremony.

232
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,830
Why do you think

233
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,690
The silk thread produced by silkworms is called silk

234
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:08,370
But how many people among the common people can wear silk brocade clothes?

235
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,780
Exactly

236
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:18,070
The clothes that the common people wear are not made of silk.

237
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,420
Cotton clothes are mostly made of cotton

238
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,120
Or a linen garment made of coarse flax

239
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,780
Wearing silk brocade

240
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,920
How can we understand the life of ordinary people wearing cotton clothes?

241
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,580
Therefore, I plan to hold a cotton weaving competition.

242
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,260
And the winner will be chosen as the Crown Prince's concubine.

243
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,220
I will have someone teach you two how to weave.

244
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,520
We will try again later

245
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,950
The Queen ordered you two to stay here for three days and weave well.

246
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,970
What

247
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,650
Three days?

248
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,730
During these three days, you two must not meet anyone, including anyone from your mother's family.

249
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,940
I understand.

250
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,040
I don't know how the Queen can choose the Crown Prince's concubines by weaving cotton cloth worn by the lowly people.

251
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,240
It's just a competition

252
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,670
Winning is

253
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,550
So

254
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,040
There is someone in my house who is proficient in weaving.

255
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,790
only

256
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,240
The Central Temple ordered that no outsiders be allowed to enter

257
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,980
Leave it to me.

258
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,320
If the lady is willing to help

259
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,000
This is sent from the lady's house.

260
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Just present this piece of cloth tomorrow.

261
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,210
Thanks

262
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,210
You knit very well

263
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,180
The minister is terrified

264
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,770
After all, this is your first time weaving, so it's natural

265
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,760
But although Anjo-kun's daughter was weaving for the first time,

266
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,370
But the craftsmanship is amazing and it seems that he has put a lot of effort into it.

267
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,660
Why not let Miss Jin learn where she went wrong?

268
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,750
The Queen Mother

269
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:21,840
As the mother of the nation, you should teach the people these principles

270
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,460
Please show her how.

271
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,260
The Queen Mother

272
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,430
This cloth was really woven by you.

273
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,830
I'm asking you if you knitted it.

274
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,910
It's outside...

275
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,790
The maid in my house...

276
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,940
You cheated

277
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,830
Lost the qualification to compete

278
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,070
I intend to punish the maid who helped you cheat.

279
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,260
What do you think?

280
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,020
I don't know

281
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,980
Don't you know?

282
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,270
That nanny is about to be punished because of you, but you don't know

283
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,170
Was this something given to me by Yegu Jin?

284
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,960
Didn't you say that it was stolen by your servant who was as close to you as a sister?

285
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,720
[A servant who works for a household]
Didn't you say that it was stolen by your servant who was as close to you as a sister?

286
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,220
How could it be in your hands?
[A servant who works for a household]

287
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,800
How could it be in your hands?

288
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,780
You are not responsible for what you did.

289
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,930
But he shifted all the blame to others

290
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:52,240
You will memorize the Shangshu's teaching that the ruler should be wary of the people.

291
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,340
But he had no fear or mercy for the people.

292
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,360
Such a person

293
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,370
How can I dream of becoming the crown prince's concubine and becoming the queen mother one day?

294
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,830
The Queen has decided on the Crown Prince's concubine.

295
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,370
Daughter of Jin Hanlao

296
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,650
But now not only the clan members praise

297
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,340
His Majesty also thought that Anseong-gun's daughter would become the Crown Prince's concubine.

298
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,990
Even if you saw it with your own eyes, would you still say this?

299
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,710
This woman is not qualified enough

300
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,780
Daughter of Jin Hanlao

301
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,650
Chosen as the Crown Prince's Consort

302
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,210
Your Highness

303
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,860
I understand

304
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,940
Do I need to convey His Highness's intention to the Queen Mother?

305
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,680
No need

306
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,650
You go down first

307
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,980
In the early Wuyin year

308
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,930
But my soldiers gathered at the gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace

309
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,380
During the Park Bak Rebellion

310
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,100
[Park Bae's Rebellion, the Second Prince's Rebellion, Park Bae's rebellion with his fourth son Yi Bang-gan]
During the Park Bak Rebellion

311
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,660
I was the first to lead the troops and defeat those traitors.
[Park Bae's Rebellion, the Second Prince's Rebellion, Park Bae's rebellion with his fourth son Yi Bang-gan]

312
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,120
But why...
[Park Bae's Rebellion, the Second Prince's Rebellion, Park Bae's rebellion with his fourth son Yi Bang-gan]

313
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,080
But why...

314
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,320
It's all over

315
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,460
Want to gain the master's trust

316
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,840
Is it that we can only rely on the Right Army Commander and the Crown Prince's Concubine?

317
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,380
Madam, what do you mean?

318
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,160
During the last silkworm ceremony, an outsider sneaked into the palace

319
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,600
But this outsider... is exactly the person His Highness wants

320
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,230
Can you catch this guy?

321
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,610
Is that them?

322
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,830
They have been colluding with the Jin family of Yegu for many years.

323
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,030
Accepting bribes to enrich oneself

324
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,140
yes

325
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,240
You wait and be presumptuous

326
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,900
master

327
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,140
Who gave the order?

328
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,730
open

329
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,470
I'll go by myself.

330
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,380
Master, Master

331
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,200
My old man is innocent...

332
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,310
Let go of you guys.

333
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,210
Ouch, what should I do?

334
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:50,910
what to do

335
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,950
lady

336
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,250
Ouch Madam

337
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,580
What's going on? What should I do?

338
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,480
How could the Queen...

339
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,310
I sent people to look for you but there is no news.

340
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,420
yes

341
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,180
only...

342
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,100
Where did you come from so late at night?

343
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,980

You are buying and selling houses in Nakamura.

[The area surrounding Jongno in Nakamura]
You are buying and selling houses in Nakamura.

348
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,470
You are buying and selling houses in Nakamura.

349
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,700
If you hadn't had an affair with that Yegu Jin

350
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,620
There would be no need to go in and out of the Patrol Office so frequently.

351
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,530
Slave...slave is not deeply involved

352
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,230
You wait quietly.

353
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,550
What

354
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,980
The Lord has achieved his goal

355
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,930
This will be resolved soon.

356
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,640
How does the queen...

357
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,720
I have served the Lord for eight years.

358
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,860
ah

359
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,640
This... this... this is rose seeds

360
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
Rose seeds

361
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,700
When I have a nose ulcer, I will use this to disinfect it.

362
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,560
If used improperly

363
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,320
This substance can cause serious damage to the liver.

364
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,530
It can even endanger people's lives

365
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,320
Shu...Shuyi Niangniang

366
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,810
You are going to

367
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,410
Whose mouth is shut?

368
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,820
No

369
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,940
Absolutely not

370
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,390
Take it and throw it away

371
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,610
This is not a good idea.

372
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,840
yes

373
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,130
Today, the palace is here

374
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,970
To the Crown Princess, I am also her mother-in-law.

375
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,640
Although I was born as a personal maid

376
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
But I don't want to be looked down upon.

377
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,100
This time I came here to remind you not to cause any trouble.

378
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,340
How dare I disobey?

379
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,940
The prince's wedding is coming soon. I will grant amnesty to the world.

380
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:18,480

390

Holy Grace

Holy Grace

Holy Grace

395
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,120
Your Highness planned this from the beginning.

396
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,240
How do you say this?

397
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,630
I want to pardon Doctor Mingshan.

398
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,230
What's the problem with this?

399
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:19,810
Doctor Mingshan will only become a stumbling block on His Highness's path.

400
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,290
If stumbling blocks are properly cleared, they can also become stepping stones.

401
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,670
Your Highness should understand that this person cannot be a stepping stone

402
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:33,510
It was His Highness who hid behind the scenes and let Lichengjun swing the sword.

403
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,610
I will show you Licheng Jun

404
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,430
Will they give up?

405
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,260
Next, they will definitely attack Lichengjun.

406
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,290
Since His Highness has asked him to raise the knife, he should be responsible for this.

407
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,080
Responsible?

408
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,320
Taking responsibility for one's shortcomings is called being responsible.

409
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,380
But no matter what situation we face, we must not have shortcomings

410
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,340
The nave sometimes always forgets

411
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,470
Now I am North Korea

412
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,150
Your Highness

413
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,170
I have clearly stated that I want to choose Shufan's daughter as the Crown Prince's concubine.

414
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,830
But the idea of me, the king of a country,

415
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,640
To the central hall, it is lighter than the white paper.

416
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,780
That girl is not qualified enough...

417
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,830
Wasn't it all done to suppress me by publicly humiliating Shufan's daughter?

418
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,450
Do you want me to see clearly how inadequate this girl is?

419
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,270
Isn't this open contempt for the monarch?

420
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,840
I want to find a life partner for the prince.

421
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,060
The same is true during the silkworm ceremony.

422
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,750
Is it necessary to treat Doctor Mingshan like that?

423
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,080
Nave...

424
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,530
But not the king

425
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,630
Your Highness is despicable.

426
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,410
Your Highness, please don't treat Doctor Mingshan like I do.

427
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,280
Isn't this why His Highness hid behind Lichengjun's sword?

428
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,150
Because I know that I...

429
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,600
nave

430
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,730
Such a despicable attitude

431
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,850
How can it be called the North Korean style?

432
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,350
Enough

433
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,090
Your Highness

434
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,000
Let's go back to the central hall first

435
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,720
Take it

436
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,690
yes

437
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,170
Who are you?

438
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,700
how so

439
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,190
Let me go

440
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,230
Why are you doing this?

441
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,340
grown ups

442
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,980
Are you okay, sir?

443
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,030
The cell floor is cold

444
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,930
I've suffered a lot.

445
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,890
The master used the knife of his relatives to kill his relatives and meritorious officials.

446
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,270
I didn't expect His Highness to be like this.

447
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,710
Do you really not understand His Highness?

448
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,270
Although not born from the same mother

449
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,810
But His Highness killed the prince's younger brother and drove him away

450
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,160
That's how he ascended the throne.

451
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,690
But now His Highness has released the master from prison.

452
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,410
What does this mean?

453
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,170
Your Highness means that now we can also fight back

454
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:15,880
Because the Lord will never allow one party to dominate.

455
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,900
But

456
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,350
What should I use to fight back?

457
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,550
Your Highness

458
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,990
When His Highness wanted to pass on the throne

459
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,000
Lijiang Jun and Licheng Jun were delighted.

460
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,590
But when His Highness rescinds his order and returns to his position

461
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,920
Unlike the happy people, the two of them showed sadness.

462
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,360
If he didn't want to use the young prince to gain power, how could he do this?

463
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,230
[Now I will express my intention to rebel]
If he didn't want to use the young prince to gain power, how could he do this?

464
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,780
If he didn't want to use the young prince to gain power, how could he do this?

465
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,030
Not only that, the day His Highness said he would pass on the throne

466
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,700
The two of them also planned to set up a Neizaishu under the name of the Crown Prince's residence.

467

[A system in which the king summons a small number of trusted ministers to handle major state affairs]
The two of them also planned to set up a Neizaishu under the name of the Crown Prince's residence.

So now the general's heart is clear

Deposed as a commoner

474
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:38,550
I am really terrified to see Your Highness in this state.

475
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,190
If the father-in-law had told me earlier, I would have sent the imperial physician to visit me.

476
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,270
How could he be so seriously ill?

477
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,850
I am terrified

478
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,650
Why did my father suddenly fall ill?

479
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:58,660
It is because His Highness abandoned me.

480
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,970
Li Jiangjun

481
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:11,310
I have been waiting

482
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,850
I really have something to ask of you, Your Highness.

483
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,400
I have been holding on and waiting for His Highness to come.

484
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,440
if

485
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,710
What happened?

486
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,060
Please His Royal Highness

487
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,680
Spare their lives

488

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,970
They have many shortcomings

490
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,260
I can guarantee their loyalty to Your Highness.

491
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,380
so

His Royal Highness Wanwang

Spare their lives

Your Highness

496
00:36:47,720 --> 00:37:26,370
Ouch ouch...

497
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,410
His Majesty has arrived

498
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,380
Please go back

499
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,560
I do not allow

500
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:08,750
If you want to pay your respects to my father

501
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,340
Your Highness is not worthy

Take him in.

506

yes

507
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,570
Let's go

508
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,140
I don't want

509
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,490
I won't leave

510
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,610
I won't leave

511
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,500
Let me go

512
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,370
Please let me go

513
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,600
Let me go

bye

bye

The funeral of Lixingbuyuangun Minji is over

519
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,920
So they let them live out their old age in Jeju

yes

521
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,960
What

522
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,410
Empress of the Middle Temple

523
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,920
Please, Madam.

524
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,700
Please calm down, ma'am...

525
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,160
Get out of the way

526
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,070
Empress of the Middle Temple

527
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,240
Servant Xu Shanggong

528
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,230
The maid came in

529
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,920
Empress of the Middle Temple

530
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,080
Something bad is happening.

531
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,120
Please see if this is the person

532
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,650
Yes

533
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,220
It was you who asked the Central Palace to disobey the order.

534
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,340
As early as the time of the prince

535
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,610
I have said that spies should not be used privately.

536
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,670
[a person who acts as a spy or who penetrates into the enemy camp to gather intelligence]
I have said that spies should not be used privately.

537
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,480
I thought I'd report it to the Queen Mother.
[a person who acts as a spy or who penetrates into the enemy camp to gather intelligence]

538
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,930
I thought I'd report it to the Queen Mother.

539
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,180
No different from reporting to His Highness

540
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,510
presumptuous

541
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,900
How come there is no difference

542
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,100
The middle hall is the minister of the Lord.

543
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,300
Please, Your Highness, grant me death.

544
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,170
You'd better ask for my life.

545
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,320
Please, Your Highness, grant me death.

546
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,960
It's death

547
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,180
You don't want to cause trouble for the Central Palace.

548
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,300
Why are you so loyal to the Middle Temple?

549
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,750
Empress of the Middle Temple

550
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,940
A calling

551
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,490
Only the Lord can summon you.

552
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:19,550
I will definitely...keep this mission

553
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,920
If Your Highness kills this man

554
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,930
Your thoughts

555
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,190
It will cost the life of the middle temple.

556
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,400
Just hate me

557
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,430
Empress of the Middle Temple

558
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,190
Is Your Highness crazy?

559
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,160
What

560
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,780
If it weren't crazy

561
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,290
How can you treat innocent people like this?

562
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,240
This person is disobeying the order.

563
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,270
I clearly told you

564
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,980
No secret use of spies

565
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:21,680
Your Highness is now sending not only my brothers to exile

566
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,220
I will also kill the person whom I trust deeply.

567
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,010
Why does Your Highness treat me like this?

568
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,870
I have no regrets about the Central Palace

569
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,990
Your Highness

570
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:36,820
If the Queen Mother hates me for this, then let her hate me.

571
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,090
I will bear it myself

572
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,400
Madam, this is mud rain

573
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,260
It hurts your body.

574
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,860
How could the Queen...

575
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,430
Madam Shuyi sent word that she had a sudden chill.

576
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,400
Let her out

577
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,980
Empress of the Middle Temple

578
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,640
Do you want me to drag her out?

579
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,050
Kneel down

580
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,560
Lady Shuyi is His Highness's harem

581
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,540
How can the lady be so rude?

582
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,380
I ask you to kneel down

583
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,160
Get out of the way

584
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,440
You're the one who caused this, right?

585
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,430
yes

586
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,080
What do you do this for?

587
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,810
I want my master to recognize that I am a useful person.

588
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,350
This excuse is really lame.

589
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,330
You are just intoxicated by the taste of power

590
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:51,360
Now they want more and that is why innocent people die.

591
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,190
no

592
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:03,430
So far, I have never abandoned you.

593
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,650
But now

594
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,150
I will abandon you.

595
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,950
Lady Shuyi

596
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,290
There has been a lot of mud and rain recently.

597
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,220
Panic

598
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:44,080
Seeing that more and more people are hungry

599
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,370
I plan to open the warehouse urgently to distribute relief food

600

[Relief food is rice used to help people who have suffered natural disasters and the poor]

Minister in
[The head of the Hucao department who is in charge of the financial affairs]

605
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,510
To count how many families are suffering from famine
[The head of the Hucao department who is in charge of the financial affairs]

606
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:52,650
Each family was given 10 dou of rice and 1 dan of soybeans
[The head of the Hucao department who is in charge of the financial affairs]

607
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,170
Each family was given 10 dou of rice and 1 dan of soybeans

608
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,870
It's your highness

609
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:02,410
In addition, I have handed over the 100 knots of land I confiscated from the Jin family in Yegu to the Higan Temple

610
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,310
These lands were cultivated by the nearby people and the temple to make a living.

611
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,380
Please find out whether these lands are managed properly and report back.

612
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,390
Why didn't the judge answer?

613
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,470
It's your highness

614
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,350
I obey your Majesty's order.

615
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,080
Sentence

616
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,240
[The abbreviation of the Criminal Justice Department, the head of the Criminal Justice Department in charge of judicial criminal law and litigation]
Sentence

617
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,480
Your Highness
[The abbreviation of the Criminal Justice Department, the head of the Criminal Justice Department in charge of judicial criminal law and litigation]

618
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,790
You also need to investigate whether the land I gave to the temple is managed properly.
[The abbreviation of the Criminal Justice Department, the head of the Criminal Justice Department in charge of judicial criminal law and litigation]

619
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,930
You also need to investigate whether the land I gave to the temple is managed properly.

620
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,000
But Your Highness

621
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,110
His Highness has ordered the temple to manage itself...

622
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,670
This is a sacred decree

623
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,510
The land that the Lord gave to Higan Temple

624
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,580
Haven't you got permission yet?

625
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,080
Previously, I believed the words of Doctor Mingshan.

626
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,880
So he gave the land to Doctor Mingshan

627
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,710
That piece of land...

628
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,940
It was originally agreed that I would take it from Yegu.

629
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,880
That's my husband's land.

630
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,250
No matter who owns the land, if this matter is exposed

631
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,000
This subordinate is about to lose his head.

632
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,040
You are not the only one who lost your head

633
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,200
My life is in danger too.

634
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:08,700
This can't go on like this.

635
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,620
Why not go to Higanji Temple now...

636
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,260
Slow down

637
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,070
As long as the master doesn't know about this, it's fine.

638
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,900
How to do this

639
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,460
I will go back first.

640
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:27,580
The sentence is my husband's.

641
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,450
Niangniang

642
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,360
The burial of Pansu will be handled by the Household Department and the Gyeonggi Province Surveillance Commissioner.

643
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,550
[A local governor in charge of local governance]
The burial of Pansu will be handled by the Household Department and the Gyeonggi Province Surveillance Commissioner.

644
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,930
Please give it to them, Madam.
[A local governor in charge of local governance]

645
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:39,190
Please give it to them, Madam.

646
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,240
Pansu comes to help me

647
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,280
But she died tragically at the hands of my husband.

648
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,850
How dare I ask others to deal with you?

649
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,200
But the Queen Mother

650
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,420
The current situation is not good

651
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:53,170
His Highness has ordered the exile of Lijiangjun and Lichengjun

652
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,540
Your Majesty must not leave the palace now.

653
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,410
They are innocent

654
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,940
How could His Highness not know

655
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,800
Queen Mother

656
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,530
It's not long since I entered the palace.

657
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,630
I'm sorry to have embarrassed you. I'm sorry, mother.

658
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,790
No, mother

659
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,630
My son is fine

660
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,620
Although I have always lived in the palace

661
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,530
The sight must always be looking outside the palace

662
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,790
It's the Queen Mother

663
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,380
The people are outside the palace

664
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,520
yes

665
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,220
Your Highness

666
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,220
Um, what's up?

667
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,550
The Queen Mother left the palace

668
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,040
Leaving the palace?

669
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,570
Said he wanted to collect Pan Zhu's body

670
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,250
The monarch killed the man.

671
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,150
The middle hall is going to collect the body

672
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:16,060
This has never happened before.

673
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,260
Shangshan

674
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,030
Slave in

675
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:24,400
Go tell the inner guards and the palace guards

676
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,700
[The Inner Guards guard the troops in the palace]
Go tell the inner guards and the palace guards

677
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:26,750
Anyone
[The Inner Guards guard the troops in the palace]

678
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,050
Anyone

679
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,230
No one is allowed into the palace without my permission.

680
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,440
yes

681
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,750
Right

682
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,410
Keep going, keep going

683
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,480
You should press hard.

684
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:51,560
It seems that someone gave the prince a luxurious bow.

685
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,540
It's a gift, but it's actually a bribe

686
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,220
I hope you can help me find out who these people are.

687
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,950
If it is clear

688
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:05,170
You should inform the abbot of Higanji Temple.

689
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,370
I obey your orders.

690
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,470
I have to go to Higanji Temple.

691
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,770
Not going back to the palace?

692
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,490
Oh, it's all right.

693
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,690
Oh, good.

694
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,900
I stuffed half a tael of silver in it

695
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,950
Oh, thank you.

696
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,670
He is a blessed man after all.

697
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,600
Why do you say that?

698
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,740
The bodies of many people who died of starvation were just dumped here.

699
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,200
How can someone starve to death?

700
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,070
The imperial court should have distributed relief food.

701
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,600
I think you look like a lady.

702
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,080
That's easy to say.

703
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,980
Do you know who this person is...

704
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,410
This damn relief food

705
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,750
A pit on the top and another pit in the middle

706
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,200
It is a blessing for ordinary people to receive it

707
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,510
I don't know how many people didn't get it.

708
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,040
This is true

709
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,760
I want to meet them

710
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,030
What

711
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:11,720
How did the condition take a turn for the worse?

712
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:21,120
Sores...

713
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,520
[A boil or sore on the skin]
Sores...

714
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:22,850
[A boil or sore on the skin]

715
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,740
It must be because Your Highness is overthinking.
[A boil or sore on the skin]

716
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,670
It must be because Your Highness is overthinking.

717
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:32,540
Please put your worries aside.

718
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,380
This is not appropriate for the king.

719
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,280
How can I let go of my worries and find comfort in my heart?

720
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,190
Your Highness

721
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,860
If you don't take good care of it, you may get a rheumatism.

722
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,380
Your Highness needs to be on guard

723
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,460
What is the Palace Master doing?

724
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,490
I heard that His Highness is ill.

725
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:05,790
Palace Master, please go back.

726
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,730
This is the palace.

727
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:08,460
Shuyi

728
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,960
I will go to see His Highness and take good care of him.

729
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,210
This palace is a virtuous person of the first rank.

730
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,790
But Shuyi had to start from the second rank

731
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,840
This palace should take care of it.

732
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:23,200
There are four princes and princesses born to me.

733
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,610
But during this period, the palace master only gave birth to one princess.

734
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:31,460
I wonder who the master will wait for to take care of him?

735
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,050
Palace Master, take care

736
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,410
Your Highness, Lady Shuyi requests an audience

737
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,170
Let her in

738
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,010
Your Highness

739
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,200
How did you know you were coming?

740
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,300
Your Highness

741
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,610
I will take care of Your Highness.

742
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,850
No problem

743
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,030
There is also a royal doctor

744
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:11,630
How can I eat and sleep now that Your Highness is calling me like this?

745
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:15,350
I will stay by your side all night to wipe away the pus.

746
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,820
Help His Highness make medicine

747
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,030
The imperial physician should withdraw first.

748
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:09,820
Now, this makes me see people's hearts clearly.

749
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,400
No need to sigh about people's hearts

750
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:20,750
You and I just need to... turn our grief and anger into strength.

751
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,080
If you and I start an army

752
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,070
How many people will follow?

753
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:38,480
I am afraid I will forget what Pan Zhu said.

754
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,890
I wrote them all down.

755
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,250
Next to the Crown Prince's residence was a musician named Li Wufang.

Next to the Crown Prince's residence was a musician named Li Wufang.

00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:44,740

The prince seems to be leaving the palace often

761
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,970
Hanging out with these people

762
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,510
What these people are trying to achieve

763
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:58,450
It is to take a place when the prince ascends the throne.

764
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:04,780
There are also rumors that Li Shufan and Gu Zongxiu's brothers are very close.

765
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,280
It's just that this matter is still uncertain

766
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,100
Li Shufan

767
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,490
That's right

768
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,970
I heard that many people were unable to receive the relief food awarded by Your Highness.

769
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,900
What is going on?

770
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,340
It seems that some people rely on powerful officials as their backers.

771
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,430
[a powerful minister]
It seems that some people rely on powerful officials as their backers.

Lower-level officials secretly withheld the relief grain

774
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,390
You mean the powerful official?

775
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,370
yes

776
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,180
I have heard that you have recently relied on Doctor Mingshan.

777

[The third-rank rank bestowed upon the clan members by Doctor Mingshan]
I have heard that you have recently relied on Doctor Mingshan.

778
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,820
There are many people who do this

Doctor Mingshan

781
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,900
Not long ago, the Lord granted land to the Higan Temple.

782
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,540
I wonder if the master has received it.

783
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,550
I have never heard of this before.

784
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,900
Empress of the Middle Temple

785
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:07,240
Just now, I was blind and failed to recognize the great man.

786
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,520
The villain deserves death

787
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,810
fine

788
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,390
Get up

789
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,390
Get up, everyone.

790
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,190
Are these the people?

791
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,500
People who should have received relief food but did not

792
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,920
yes

793
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,710
Exactly

[Preview of the next episode]

795
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,940
What do you want to say?

796
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,510
The Queen Mother showed the Crown Prince

797
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,210
Do you want to die on the spot under my sword?

798
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,090
Meeting in the palace to plot rebellion

799
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,920
Is there any evidence

800
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,790
Beheaded

801
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,850
The central hall should be during the stay in Higan Temple

Died at the hands of vicious bandits

803
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,210
Yeoganggun and Yeoseonggun, who were exiled to Jeju Island, were clearly planning a rebellion.

804
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,970
Go and tell them to commit suicide.
