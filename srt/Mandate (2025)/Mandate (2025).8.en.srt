1
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,420
This is for you, Doctor.

2
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:19,860
Is it a baby croissant?

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,540
You want the project,

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,060
but how can you make
it work like this?

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,020
What you just heard
is a selected part of the full recording.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,860
Nowadays, everyone knows AI can
easily fake voices to seem real.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,180
Given the current situation, I think you
should be the one listening more, Uncle,

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,220
to what the coalition parties want.

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,340
You need the other parties
to vote confidence in you.

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,060
Then trade other ministries.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,620
On the contrary, there's nothing
more you can do.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,780
Have we really reached a dead end?

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,540
Suppose if I go talk to
the coalition parties,

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,220
would there be any chance?

15
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,420
That's enough for now.
If it's a dead end...

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,660
Thinking about it is just
wasting your energy.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,060
Tomorrow, I'll try talking to Father again.

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,020
Will the result be different from today?

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,140
I don't know.

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,140
But if I get to talk to my father
without anyone else present,

21
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,860
I'll tell him directly

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,420
that he is making a mistake

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,300
by following Sun's plan.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,220
Will it work?

25
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,660
Gel! Gel! Sis!

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,380
My friend updated the info,

27
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,300
but it needs
confirmation again tomorrow.

28
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,580
That...

29
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,420
Our channel got the number one rating
among online news outlets!

30
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,740
Sis, good ratings mean we can
sell ads for good prices!

31
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,140
Mhm.

32
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,540
Just watch out for political parties
trying to buy us out.

33
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,620
Oh wow. You don't seem happy at all.

34
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,220
Is something wrong?

35
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,260
No.

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,780
You can go home first.
I'll turn off the lights myself.

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,540
If there's nothing else, let's all
go home, Sis. Get some rest. Yeah?

38
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,540
Maybe there is.

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,700
Huh?

40
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,860
What is it?

41
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,540
Come look at this.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,340
The PM being debated and meeting
with coalition parties isn't strange, Sis.

43
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,140
But meeting in secret, without...

44
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,780
Phasakorn, the coalition party leader
with the most votes?

45
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,980
It means Mr. Wuth has a secret deal.

46
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,700
That backstabs Phasakorn.

47
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,460
Hey, Sis!

48
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,260
Is it about Dr. Nong?

49
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,740
I remember you told me that

50
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,180
Phasakorn guy
is eyeing the Doctor's seat.

51
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,980
Right?

52
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,580
I don't know.

53
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,060
Haven't figured it out yet.

54
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,420
Don't know if the deal is
to keep Dr. Nong,

55
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,340
or to reshuffle the cabinet.

56
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,420
Or to give Dr. Nong's seat
to a smaller party

57
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,620
instead of For Hope Party.

58
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,900
Who knows? This debate round
might have something fun.

59
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,740
Surely you're not here to
persuade me to change my mind.

60
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,300
I'd like you to hear
this matter first, Father.

61
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,500
- So you can reconsider...
- Wait, wait.

62
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,180
Wait for Jes to arrive first.

63
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,580
Why?

64
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,900
Is it such a big secret?

65
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,100
Let him come and listen.
What's wrong?

66
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,540
Yes.

67
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,340
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, hello.

68
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,820
Vee has been waiting since morning.

69
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,940
Well, you won't give me a motorcade.
Getting around is just...

70
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,060
so terrible from the traffic jam.

71
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,500
Oh, sorry about that.

72
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,620
I heard it's urgent, isn't it?
Start away.

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,780
I want to say that you are
being deceived by Phasakorn, Father.

74
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,740
And?

75
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,580
Every problem that has occurred
regarding Dr. Nong

76
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,780
has Prasakorn pulling the strings.

77
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,220
He aims to weaken our party.

78
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,260
And likely incited the coalition
to negotiate for better positions.

79
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,500
And I think the information
used in the debate

80
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,940
was also provided by him
to Nititham Party.

81
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,020
Is Sun feeding drugs to Dr. Nong?

82
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,460
Or did he take Dr. Nong's hand
to punch an MP in his own team too?

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,340
I thought so too.

84
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,460
Are you favoring
that Dr. Nong too much?

85
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,660
Huh?

86
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,740
Yes, I know the Doctor isn't perfect.

87
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,180
But if we let him be destroyed now,

88
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,940
after parliament dissolves
and there's a new election,

89
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,500
we'll just have to start
all over again anyway.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,900
You're not wrong.

91
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,340
Sun is trying to bait us
into doing just that.

92
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,420
And the timing of all these incidents

93
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,500
coincides perfectly with
him challenging us.

94
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,220
If it's not him planning this,

95
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,860
then I don't know who the hell it is.

96
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,780
Then why are you playing along
with his game, Father?

97
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,380
I'm not exactly following him.

98
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,070
We won't dissolve parliament,

99
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,660
but we'll play his game
only up to a cabinet reshuffle.

100
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,580
If we feed the coalition
until they're fat and full,

101
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,900
give them seats to sit in,

102
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,860
who would want
to dissolve parliament, huh?

103
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,340
It's a waste of time making a living.

104
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,980
And after the debate,
we won't lose much either.

105
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,420
Because the public will only
be focused on Dr. Nong,

106
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,020
the first minister in history

107
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,180
to be removed by a no-confidence vote.

108
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,860
- But if we lose Dr. Nong...
- Then find a new one.

109
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,860
There are plenty of good,
capable people.

110
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,740
Even so, Sun will keep playing us
until we're battered.

111
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,580
In the end, we'll still have to
dissolve parliament.

112
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,100
No.

113
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,460
As long as I am Prime Minister...

114
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,700
Don't think Dr. Nong is
the only capable and good one!

115
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,540
I just think it's not fair
to Dr. Nong at all.

116
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,820
Not fair?

117
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,700
It's just like back then.

118
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,780
When Dr. Nong cut that director
from the campaign team.

119
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,020
Do you remember?

120
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,980
You understood it perfectly well then.

121
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,980
So why are you acting like
you don't understand now?

122
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,140
- Please help me.
- I really can't help you, Doctor.

123
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,500
Mr. Wuth has given a final order.

124
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,020
Ugh, Doctor, I'm just
a small coalition party.

125
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,260
What leverage do I have
to negotiate with him?

126
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,020
You should know I can't
help you with anything.

127
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,340
Please go, Doctor. I have to go.

128
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,820
But, Sir...

129
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,180
From a rising star
MP to a falling minister.

130
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,740
Many people feel sorry for him,

131
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,980
someone who worked hard
for the people.

132
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,100
But there are also many
who are quite disappointed.

133
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,220
This time, it's unclear what,
if anything, can help Dr. Nong.

134
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,420
(Dr. Nong Cornered?
Lobbying for Coalition Votes...)

135
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,460
A missed delivery. For your boss.

136
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,140
Thank you.

137
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,860
Whose box is this?

138
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,020
I'm not sure either.
A staff delivered it.

139
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,380
- For me?
- Yes.

140
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,060
- Chat.
- Yes.

141
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,540
You can take a break.

142
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,580
Come back in 15 minutes.

143
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,140
Sorry to disturb you, Sir.

144
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,700
But my boss wanted me
to clarify with you.

145
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,860
This project was finalized,
that I'd get a 30 percent kickback.

146
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,100
Please.

147
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,060
For this phase, with the budget
you're offering, I really can't proceed.

148
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,620
Why are you talking nonsense?

149
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,940
- No, Sir, but I need to inform you that...
- You want the project,

150
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,660
but how can you make it work like this?

151
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,020
Then I...

152
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,100
might have to propose
amending the specs again.

153
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,460
Uh-huh.

154
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,340
Then get to it.

155
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,140
Thank you, Sir.

156
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,500
And make sure
the amendments are seamless.

157
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,380
If problems arise, you shouldn't
expect to keep your seat.

158
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,620
It will be done, Sir.

159
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,140
I can't leave my position now, Sir.

160
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,060
I still have so much to do.

161
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,740
On the contrary,
there's nothing more you can do.

162
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,500
I can do it, Sir.

163
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,460
I can do it.

164
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,740
I'm begging you, Sir.

165
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,380
Let me stay.

166
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,220
Then you can...
order me to do anything.

167
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,220
I'll do everything you say.

168
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,460
I'm begging you.

169
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,100
Sorry.

170
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,540
Did I wake you?

171
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,620
You can talk to me about anything.

172
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,660
I've seen you looking stressed
since you got back.

173
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,420
It's nothing.

174
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,020
Just the debate matter.

175
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,460
You should sleep.

176
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,220
If you don't sleep, I won't sleep either.

177
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,700
I'll just keep you company.

178
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,460
Do you want to vent?

179
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,860
It might make you feel better.

180
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,780
You once told me

181
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,180
that your dad isn't a good father.

182
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,660
What about me?

183
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,820
Am I a good boyfriend for you?

184
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,900
Whether you succeed or fail,

185
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,460
you are the best person in my life.

186
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,100
No matter what anyone says,

187
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,820
my feelings won't change.

188
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,180
Don't overthink things anymore, okay?

189
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,140
Can I ask you something?

190
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,140
Suppose that...

191
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,420
if I had to clash with your father...

192
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,900
what would happen?

193
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,860
That matter... is an even bigger
thought you must avoid.

194
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,620
Let's think about how from now on

195
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,180
we can get you back
on your feet better than this.

196
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,660
There must be a way out.

197
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,780
Trust me.

198
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,100
I believe you.

199
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,260
Don't worry, Vee.

200
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,980
I'll find a way to manage
my own thoughts.

201
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,020
Go on.

202
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,940
Let's sleep.

203
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,940
If you stay up this late,
tomorrow you'll wake up

204
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,900
with puffy eyes and an ugly face.

205
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,020
If you can't sleep...

206
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,060
I won't also.

207
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,260
My baby boy.

208
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,180
Go on.

209
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,300
Let's sleep.

210
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,780
Come on.

211
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,380
Sorry to disturb you, Sir.

212
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,980
But my boss wanted me
to clarify with you.

213
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,980
This project was finalized,
that I'd get a 30 percent kickback.

214
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,500
For this phase, with the budget
you're offering, I really can't proceed.

215
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,060
Hey, why are you talking nons...

216
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,740
Vee doesn't know about this, right?

217
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
He doesn't know, Sir.

218
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,660
Actually, you should have
consulted him about this.

219
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,300
So we wouldn't have to be
in such a difficult position.

220
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,100
Because I know

221
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
that if Vee found out,

222
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,540
he would stop me.

223
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,020
So you do know, don't you?

224
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,420
That you shouldn't be doing this.

225
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,700
I have no choice.

226
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,820
No.

227
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,380
You can still stop here.

228
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,980
Go back home.

229
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,420
Take care of your dad and your sister.

230
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,580
Continue your old projects
to help the villagers.

231
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,380
I will support you in every way.

232
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,940
Whatever legal case you face,

233
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,660
I will handle it for you, don't worry.

234
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,980
Let's pretend you never came here
to blackmail me like this.

235
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,580
Okay?

236
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,780
I still have things I need to do.

237
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,580
In my capacity as a Minister.

238
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,820
Just let it go, Doctor.

239
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,020
What about you, Sir?

240
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,940
Can you let go of
the Prime Minister position?

241
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,260
I believe the reason you're clinging
to your position now

242
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,620
is because you have something
you need to finish.

243
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,540
Am I right?

244
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,140
We are not the same.

245
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,780
I'm already on the tiger's back.

246
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,180
If I get off, I'll be mauled to death.

247
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,700
But you are not yet.

248
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,620
You still have a chance to
survive that you should seize first.

249
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,660
It's alright, Sir.

250
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,540
I'm ready to get on the tiger's back.

251
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,140
If you make a mistake...

252
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,220
It means death, Doctor.

253
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,780
With all due respect, Sir.

254
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,940
I won't die alone, that's for sure.

255
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,020
Okay.

256
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,540
If you've prepared yourself
to this extent,

257
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,500
then I have to accept it.

258
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,420
Does this mean
you agree to help me?

259
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,740
I can't let you go.

260
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,500
Where can you easily find
a full-fledged politician like this?

261
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,340
From now on,
I consider you my people.

262
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,940
I will talk to you directly,
not through Vee anymore.

263
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,940
Agreed.

264
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,700
Oh, one more thing.

265
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,900
Vee absolutely must not know about
what we discussed in this room.

266
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,420
Okay?

267
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,820
Mrs. Chonticha.

268
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,540
Do I have any appointments
this afternoon?

269
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,860
This afternoon, you are chairing...

270
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,740
the strategy meeting
with the coalition parties.

271
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,660
Then please inform the Deputy PM
to chair it in my place.

272
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,660
I have important business.

273
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,900
Yes, Sir.

274
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,260
Now, Doctor.

275
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,780
Let's discuss this grand play
of ours right away.

276
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,460
Hello, Vee.

277
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,580
You've lost a lot of weight.

278
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,580
If you want to eat anything,
I'll take you.

279
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,660
No, I just want to go home.

280
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,660
Here, I packed your things
from the condo.

281
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,300
But you have to stay at a new place.

282
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,260
I rented one for you.

283
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,860
Why not just go back to
Phu Chaloem? Why stay?

284
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,900
Just stay for a while.

285
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,420
I can't see the boss
anymore anyway, right?

286
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,580
No.

287
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,300
If you wander out now,
the other side might just take you.

288
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,900
Sis.

289
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,460
I'm not selling out the boss, am I?

290
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,500
After all this?

291
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,700
Sis, are you worried about me?

292
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,140
Aren't you?

293
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,500
Is it too late to object to the bail now?

294
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,500
Let's take him back right now.

295
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,100
Don't talk like that, Sis.

296
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,020
Why don't you try being
in there yourself?

297
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,380
Then you'd know what it's like.

298
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,460
I'm sorry for making you did it.

299
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,740
Oh, bro. Don't be so dramatic.

300
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,580
That's just you!

301
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,500
Even after this,
you're still not remorseful?

302
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,460
He apologizes,
so just accept it nicely.

303
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,700
It's not that. I mean, like...

304
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,140
Vee doesn't need to apologize.

305
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,980
You probably did your best, right?

306
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,140
But from now on, you don't have to
do things like this anymore.

307
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,300
I don't even know
what I'll do next anyway.

308
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,940
First of all,

309
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,420
go find a university and enroll.

310
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,820
I'll be your guardian.

311
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,020
No.

312
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,780
Why?

313
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,140
Don't want to study?

314
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,100
I don't want a guardian.

315
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,820
Do you get it?

316
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,220
Take it or not?

317
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,180
Fine, I'll take it.

318
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,460
Is something wrong?

319
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,340
I hope not.

320
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,340
What is it?

321
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,780
Hey.

322
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,660
Even if you hate my guts,

323
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,980
but you don't need
to be so cautious.

324
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,900
I'm going to help Dr. Nong.
Will you listen or not?

325
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,020
I actually agree with
what you said that day.

326
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,460
Because I also don't want Father
to play along with Sun's game.

327
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,540
Saving that Doctor
for the party list next time

328
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,140
gives us a better chance.

329
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,380
So, what's the plan?

330
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,420
Don't be so dramatic.

331
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,500
I probably don't need to convince you
of what's in your head, right?

332
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,820
Just admit it.

333
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,100
That the two of us
can think alike sometimes.

334
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,820
It's just that your MPs...

335
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,300
don't have enough votes.

336
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,500
I'll talk to the coalition party MPs then.

337
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,980
There are quite a few
who owe me favors.

338
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,660
You might see them as small voices,

339
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,700
but every single vote counts, man.

340
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,980
And another thing,

341
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,500
I've also bought off some people
in the Nititham Party.

342
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,140
Why?

343
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,300
Did you think you were
the only one raising cobras?

344
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,740
What do you want?

345
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,620
You're always so clever, aren't you?

346
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,460
I'm certainly not helping
that Doctor for free.

347
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,900
How's Jump?

348
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,140
He's okay.

349
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,340
I sent him home.

350
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,340
Are you tired?

351
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,380
No.

352
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,940
Well then,

353
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,740
are you hungry?
Want to eat something?

354
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,980
It's alright.

355
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,060
Take a shower first.

356
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,900
Vee!

357
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,660
Vee!

358
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,860
Vee!

359
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,500
Can you confirm once again,

360
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,740
that all the accusations from
the opposition are untrue?

361
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,780
- Are you being thrown under the bus?
- Doctor, can you say something?

362
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,380
Everyone can see that Dr. Nong today
is not in his best form like before.

363
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,420
Moreover, his strategist,
Mr. Vee, isn't by his side.

364
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,820
Will Dr. Nong be able to handle
the opposition in today's debate?

365
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,940
(Live: No-Confidence Debate)
The public should watch closely.

366
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,660
Let's share your opinions in the chat.

367
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,860
So, Doctor, let's discuss
this grand play of ours right away.

368
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,100
Do you know why...

369
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,940
the opposition party had to start this
no-confidence debate against us?

370
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,300
To scrutinize
the government's performance.

371
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,500
Then why has this country...

372
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:31,300
never had a single minister removed
from office by a no-confidence vote?

373
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,180
Don't tell me that all our past
governments have been good.

374
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,300
It's probably because the government
always had the majority.

375
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,140
Yes.

376
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,020
The outcome is already known.

377
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,740
So why even hold the debate?

378
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,140
Because there's an audience, Doctor.

379
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,420
The debate result isn't as scary
as the public's perception.

380
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,220
They remember, and they talk about it.

381
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,580
Which will affect the next election.

382
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,100
Correct.

383
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,280
If the social sentiment is strong,

384
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,860
no matter how many raise their
hands in confidence on stage,

385
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,500
backstage everyone is scrambling.

386
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,500
Killing each other off on one side
to ensure their own survival.

387
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,820
And if the government can't strike
a beneficial deal with the coalition,

388
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,260
it dissolves parliament.

389
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,460
Here comes a new election.

390
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,700
But if the interests align,

391
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,780
they just reshuffle the cabinet,

392
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,220
reduce friction, and continue working.

393
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,740
All this depends on how
strong the social sentiment is

394
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,940
and who stands to benefit from it.

395
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,020
So...

396
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,900
What about this time, Sir?

397
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,260
What will happen?

398
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,180
The sentiment will definitely be strong.

399
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,620
The opposition party intends
and tries to make it a social sensation.

400
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,340
But we will make this debate

401
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,180
a trashy drama
that frustrates the audience.

402
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,580
It will be the most prolonged,
the most boring drama.

403
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,740
While the opposition is debating
other ministers,

404
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,180
there will be periodic protests.

405
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,540
It will be about trivial,
nonsensical matters.

406
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,140
To interrupt the debater's rhythm

407
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,340
and prevent a smooth,
substantive debate.

408
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:31,060
Which leads to the viewers at home
feeling bored because it's pointless.

409
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,900
But for you, Doctor,
there will be a plot twist.

410
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,900
From the first draft TOR
of the telemedicine project

411
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,580
and the actual versions
of both phases.

412
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,140
During the time
the opposition debates you,

413
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,300
not a single guard will
stand up to protest.

414
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,420
Giving the opposition party the
opportunity to debate substantively

415
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,820
and with intense content.

416
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,380
The highlight of the entire debate
will be you, Doctor.

417
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,980
People who turned off their TVs
will turn them back on to watch again.

418
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,100
At first, I didn't believe it either.

419
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,980
That we would have a minister
who is a drug addict,

420
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,100
hallucinating, unable to control himself,

421
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,780
and was once a murderer.

422
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,820
But given his performance,
constantly in the news

423
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,220
throughout the past year,

424
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,660
once it's revealed he was high.

425
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,820
The mystery is instantly unveiled!

426
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,220
This time, we haven't just
caught a murderer.

427
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,940
We've also caught a disgraced minister.

428
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,900
Want to play the innocent one, huh?

429
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,180
And during the time
you have to stand up and clarify,

430
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,780
to rebut the accusations,

431
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,940
you will stand up,

432
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,020
but you won't be able
to defend yourself at all.

433
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,620
So, to summarize the entire debate...

434
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,100
I deny all of it.

435
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,220
That's all.

436
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,180
After the debate,
the villagers who listened

437
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,820
will forget about all the other ministers,
except for you alone.

438
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,660
The full force of public sentiment
will crash down on you.

439
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,500
We will end this matter
with a cabinet reshuffle.

440
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,420
With you remaining
in your original position.

441
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,740
And you will become the single
most despised minister by society.

442
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,860
I will bear the resistance
from the coalition parties.

443
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,140
As for you, Doctor,
you'll have to work a bit harder.

444
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,700
Because you'll have to handle
the public sentiment yourself.

445
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,220
And you'll have to work even harder

446
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,300
during the next election period.

447
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,940
The real test will be when you try
to hold on to this seat.

448
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,620
Can you create achievements
to redeem your reputation?

449
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,380
I can do it.

450
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,500
It can be said that this time,
the opposition dragged out every issue,

451
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,460
almost without needing evidence.

452
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,340
Using just one's conscience
is enough to see what is true.

453
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,060
Most importantly is
Dr. Nong's demeanor.

454
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,620
He looked unable to argue back,
completely out of character.

455
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,540
From a young, new-face
politician who never gave up

456
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,300
to a broken-winged minister
after just one year in the arena.

457
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,060
Or is this truly the final act
for Dr. Nong?

458
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,620
Tomorrow is the voting day.
We will find out.

459
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,420
Next in order,

460
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,220
I will ask the assembly:

461
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,460
Vote of confidence or no confidence

462
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:28,180
in Dr. Thanit Ponthongdee,
Minister of Public Health.

463
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,100
Members who vote no confidence,

464
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,260
meaning you agree with the motion,
please press the 'Agree' button.

465
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:41,940
Members who vote confidence,
meaning you disagree with the motion,

466
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,260
please press the 'Disagree' button.

467
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:51,300
And members who abstain,
please press the 'Abstain' button.

468
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,900
Please cast your votes.

469
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,220
I'm going to help Dr. Nong.

470
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,420
Will you listen or not?

471
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,620
What do you want?

472
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,620
You're always so clever, aren't you?

473
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,380
I'm certainly not helping
that Doctor for free.

474
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,700
Help me by resigning from the party.

475
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,860
Stop being involved with the party.

476
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,100
Stop being involved with that Doctor.

477
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,460
And that Doctor gets to continue.

478
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,820
How's that?

479
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,580
My faction is large enough.

480
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,460
Dad must listen to me no matter what.

481
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,060
I'll take good care of
that Doctor, don't worry.

482
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,740
Deal.

483
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,660
I'll handle the paperwork right away.

484
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,140
Oh, and another thing.

485
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,860
I believe you won't get involved
with that Doctor.

486
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,060
But to make sure that Doctor
doesn't get involved with you,

487
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,020
do me a favor and cast
a surprise vote for me, will you?

488
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,300
The assembly has passed
a vote of no confidence.

489
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,900
170 votes.

490
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,580
Not exceeding half of the total members
of the House of Representatives.

491
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,380
Therefore, the assembly is deemed
to have passed a vote of confidence.

492
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,060
It appears the entire cabinet survives!

493
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,540
With this result, I don't know
whether to call it

494
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,300
beyond expectations or as expected.

495
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,660
But what the entire Thai nation
sees clearly is that

496
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,260
no matter what evidence
the opposition presents,

497
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,940
they cannot hold
the government accountable.

498
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,540
Especially Dr. Nong.

499

(Justice Party Goes All Out, Heated Debate)

500
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,460
Cheers.

501
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,660
This bottle of whiskey has been
aged for twenty years.

502
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,740
I think you'll like it, Doctor.

503
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,300
As for me,
I can't handle it anymore.

504
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,900
I'll just stick to wine.

505
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,460
Thank you very much.

506
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,700
I'm the one who should be
thanking you, Doctor.

507
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,220
If it weren't for you,
I'd be in trouble.

508
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,180
I checked the report.

509
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,100
Vee really did vote
no confidence in you, Doctor.

510
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,420
It's not surprising.

511
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,580
He probably found out

512
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,540
that I was talking to you
behind his back.

513
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,660
Impossible.

514
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,780
Only you and I
know about this matter.

515
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,420
- That guy shouldn't know anything.
- Please, Sir.

516
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,460
You should stop
underestimating your own son.

517
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,140
I think Vee deserves
more recognition from you.

518
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,500
I've already disappointed him.

519
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,980
Don't let him have to be hurt
by his own father again.

520
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,500
So,

521
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,780
the two of us are... equally screwed.

522
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,420
Vee has resigned from the party.

523
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,180
Jes is expediting the process
for him right away.

524
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,260
So, have you thought about
how you’re going to recover from all this?

525
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,900
I will push for the policy

526
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,260
to reduce doctors' working hours.

527
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,740
I already told you that this won't work.

528
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,820
But this time, you won't oppose me.

529
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,820
Is that correct?

530
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,420
Yes.

531
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,700
I have a life-or-death matter about
Dr. Nong to discuss with you.

532
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,500
What is it?

533
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,060
That Dr. Nong survived

534
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,980
wasn't because Jes went to talk.

535
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,820
Dr. Nong blackmailed your father
with a recording of him talking

536
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,180
to the O.P.M. rep.

537
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,620
Huh?

538
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,540
And now your dad has ordered
to keep Dr. Nong.

539
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,260
Doctor, you're good.

540
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,900
I admit it.

541
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,660
But a bit too stubborn.

542
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,100
Hard to work with.

543
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,100
Are you ready?

544
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:44,900
Mhm.

545
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,340
But it's not too late to help him.

546
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,260
I'm the only one who
can help Dr. Nong now.

547
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,100
Oh.

548
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:57,900
Wait, no.

549
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,460
You can too.

550
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,660
What should I do?

551
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,620
I think you need to make
a decision quickly, Vee.

552
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,860
Fine.

553
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,580
I agree.

554
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,300
So, we have a deal then.

555
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,220
Don't you dare do anything
behind my back.

556
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,820
I'm watching you.

557
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,420
It's done, sir.

558
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,620
Today, Prime Minister Khunawut
is preparing a statement

559
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:26,980
to quash rumors of a party split,

560
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,260
after narrowly surviving
the no-confidence debate.

561
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,700
There are signs of a cabinet reshuffle,

562
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,700
with top ministries
going to coalition partners.

563
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,620
Most notably, there’s MP Withu,

564
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,620
who broke the party line
during the vote, resigned,

565
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,660
and then disappeared.
No one has been able to reach him since.

566
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,820
The Prime Minister, as his father,
and Dr. Nong, as his close confidant,

567
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,820
how will they respond to this?
Follow closely for updates.

568
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,780
You want me to go out
and speak nicely,

569
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,060
when you just ordered my execution?

570
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,660
You know, if I didn't have to
continue working,

571
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,340
I would have destroyed
all of you already!

572
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,220
Hey, watch your mouth! You...

573
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,660
Let me handle it!

574
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,940
You stay out of it.

575
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,780
I'm not going along with this!

576
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,860
You can go lie to the media yourselves.

577
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,940
You bastard!

578
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,380
Jes, stop!

579
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,580
Calm down.

580
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,620
If I didn't order it,

581
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,780
you don't stand up.

582
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,500
Doctor.

583
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,660
Right now, we need to
maintain appearances.

584
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,540
Otherwise,
our government won't last long.

585
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,780
And you, Doctor,

586
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,340
won't be able to continue your work.

587
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,980
I’m not standing next to you
while you trash Vee in front of the press.

588
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,660
Then what do I say about a son

589
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,420
who abandoned his father
and his party?

590
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,820
Then just tell them!

591
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,700
That his father is an asshole!

592
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,740
You bastard!

593
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,220
- Jes, enough!
- Hey!

594
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,580
You know what?

595
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,900
Even if I curse your ancestors to hell,

596
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,900
your father can't do anything to me.

597
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,020
Because your father knows that
if anything happens to me now,

598
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:11,940
he's definitely finished.

599
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,860
You’re the only idiot in this room
who doesn’t get that,

600
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,220
Because you're stupid.

601
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,420
Stop clinging to your father
and leeching off him.

602
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,460
Whenever you're done venting, Doctor,

603
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,980
let's put our heads together

604
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,620
and figure out what
we're going to tell the public.

605
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,620
Damn it.

606
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,020
What’s your response to MP Withu’s
no-confidence vote against you?

607
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,620
It's nothing, really. It's his right.

608
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,220
He's just exercising
his constitutional right.

609
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,540
But MP Withu is said to be closest to you.

610
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,300
How do you feel about his vote?

611
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,340
Honestly, it’s not a matter of feelings.

612
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,500
I trust he voted on his own reasons,

613
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,980
not emotions.

614
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,100
Let's just say, if anyone reaches him,
please get his explanation.

615
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,740
I’m interested in it too.

616
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,740
Losing such an important advisor like this,
what will you do going forward?

617
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,060
It's nothing, really.

618
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,300
I'll just continue working.

619
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:14,660
Have you made any attempt
to contact MP Withu?

620
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,220
That's right.

621
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,460
Not at all.

622
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,060
Right now,
I'll just focus on my work.

623
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,300
- Are you still there?
- Yes, Sir.

624
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,340
From now on,

625
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,540
I'll have to be even more careful.

626
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,060
How are you?

627
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,300
Please don’t do that again.

628
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,020
It’ll look like we planned to meet.

629
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,180
I don't care.

630
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,580
You should.

631
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,500
You still have a lot to do.

632
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:38,860
And so do I.

633
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,100
Aren’t you going to tell me anything?

634
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,980
I’m fine.

635
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,260
No need to worry.

636
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,780
It's not like that, Vee.

637
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,540
How do I get us back to how we were?

638
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,380
Can you tell me, Vee?

639
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,340
No matter what,

640
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,900
we can't go back
to how we were anymore.

641
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,020
I'm sorry for what I did
to your father, Vee.

642
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,700
Okay.

643
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,060
Is there anything else
you hold against me?

644
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,340
No, there isn't.

645
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,540
I know I messed up, Vee.

646
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,500
I ruined everything myself.

647
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,060
But can you come back?

648
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,660
Can you trust me one more time?

649
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,100
We don't even have to work together.

650
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:06,260
I just want you to be by my side
like before, that's enough.

651
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,100
We're past that point.

652
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,220
If there's nothing else, I should go.

653
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:26,860
I'm begging you, Vee.

654
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,060
Give me one last chance.

655
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,820
I won't let you down again.

656
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,620
I'm begging you.

657
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,300
Don't.

658
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,220
I... don't want it anymore.

659
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,780
Can I ask you one more thing?

660
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,100
That night...

661
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,900
when I survived...

662
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:18,260
was it because you saved me?

663
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,260
Why would I help you?

664
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,860
That's true.

665
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,180
Goodbye.

666
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,420
So you've decided to face the media?

667
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,860
Not exactly.

668
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,260
Let's be direct then.

669
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,860
I want to ask you

670
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:23,020
to join the Wiwat Siam Party.

671
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,900
Wow.

672
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,940
This move...is unexpected.

673
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,980
I thought you'd come to ask
about the secret clip.

674
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:43,860
Sorry to disturb you, Sir.

675
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,420
But my boss wanted me
to clarify with you.

676
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,060
smiling like that...

677
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:51,020
might make people think you quit
because you hate your father.

678
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:52,860
No, it won't.

679
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,060
I just think the timing is too perfect.

680
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,900
It coincides with my father's order
to get rid of Dr. Nong.

681
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,820
And he used the final
minutes of his life...

682
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,540
to send this clip to you.

683
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,260
This Doctor is something else.

684
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,220
I told you, that's why I like him.

685
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,660
But not that kind of like.

686
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,260
Don't get the wrong idea.

687
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,180
All the more reason I know
I choose the right person.

688
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,300
I want you to help the Doctor.

689
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,140
Take over Wiwat Siam for me.

690
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,780
You already know

691
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,420
that the place we're in

692
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,900
is full of cheaters,
people seeking their own gain.

693
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,260
But we can still change
this fucked-up game together.

694
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,660
I want you to take over
Wiwat Siam Party.

695
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:04,980
Everything I sent you

696
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:08,740
is information I've gathered
since I started working for the party.

697
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,540
I hope it will be of some use to you.

698
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,620
You're very bold.

699
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:28,860
To invite me into politics.

700
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,060
Even people more difficult than you...

701
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:33,260
I've recruited them all.

702
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,260
But I still believe

703
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:40,300
that Dr. Nong is the person
who can truly change politics.

704
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,740
If politics doesn't change him first.

705
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,500
So you want me to be
your watchdog, is that it?

706
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,580
A journalist who bites
and doesn't let go.

707
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,420
The kind you can't buy off
no matter what.

708
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:03,580
If I had to guess your motivation,
there are only two possibilities.

709
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,420
If it's not to get revenge on politicians,

710
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,820
then you must truly want
to see this country change.

711
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,060
I don't need to tell you
my personal reasons.

712
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,540
You don't need to tell me.

713
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,620
Because no matter which one it is,

714
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:31,740
Dr. Nong...

715
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,660
is the person who can help
you achieve both.

716
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:39,060
Your instinct tells you
that too, doesn't it?

717
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,580
Do you trust him that much?

718
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:49,940
For some people, even if I know
they shouldn't be trusted...

719
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:53,140
but he already has my heart.

720
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,740
I have faith in you.

721
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:02,460
From the first day we met

722
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,220
until now.

723
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,420
And I will come back to you.

724
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,140
(I love you always)

725
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,900
I love you.

726
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,540
Thank you for keeping your word.

727
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,500
Welcome to the Puea Khwam Wang Party.

728
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:50,180
I promise,

729
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:52,740
I won’t let you down.
