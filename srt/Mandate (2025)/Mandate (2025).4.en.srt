1
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,260
Hey, turn away.

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,260
You've to prepare a lot more.

3
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,580
We have to go to the national campaign.

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,940
He's a local doctor who helps the villagers.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,660
He's so good it's worth digging up.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,180
You can call me anytime.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,540
He killed my father.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,900
I want to attack Doctor Nong.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,940
Are you interested in
making a special interview?

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,540
("Hot issue, Phu Chalerm speech chaos")
From what you told me,

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
you said that the whole thing.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,380
The main character is
Dr. Nong, is that correct?

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,820
Anyone can hear it.
It's deliberately looking for trouble with me.

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,140
But he didn't specify anyone's name.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,620
Well, when he turned to scold my father,
no one saw him.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,340
(Viewer Comment: I wonder who started it.)
Let me tell you, this guy.

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,660
He's terrible.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,380
He can even curse the people he kills.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,500
(Come on, dare to appear on TV.)

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,140
(You can tell he’s a gangster
just by looking at his face)

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,260
Dr. Nong intentionally killed my father.

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,540
To pave the way for his father to
become the village headman in his place.

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,460
You say this, he can sue you.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,660
I don't care.

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,660
I want to talk about this.

26
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,980
(The team is waiting to hear,
but has not yet made a decision)

27
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,260
Let people get to know
who the real he is.

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,460
That you praised him as a hero

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,500
(If this is true, the case is turned.)

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,140
Actually, he's an evil.

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,060
(Can I believe you?)

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,260
Okay.

33
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,460
With such a big issue,
we can't just listen to one side of the story.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,260
I would like to invite Dr. Thanit,
the candidate of the Wiwat Siam Party.

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,300
What I said on stage, it is all true.

36
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:48,940
(Viewer comments: Watching live is fine.)

37
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,100
I'm not talking specifically
about anyone.

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,500
I don't understand how Tee
could interpret that as me talking about him.

39
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,420
He's a lie.

40
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,420
(He's so hot-headed he wants to appear on TV.
Hahahahaha)

41
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,460
Calm down. Calm down.

42
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,060
Let the doctor Nong say first.

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,820
What about creating a situation?

44
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,740
The ones they're fighting with
are supporters of the Nititham

45
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,220
and the Hope Party.

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,220
I am not involved at all.
(So, what’s the truth?)

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,860
But suppose that those
two parties fight each other.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,100
And then he changed his mind
and voted for my party.

49
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,540
Okay, this one I might be like...
(Hey Tee, don't interrupt.)

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,620
Okay, I admit that
it has something to do with me.

51
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,060
(I still believe Dr. Nong more.)

52
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,420
And about my father?

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,180
It's recorded that my father had a better chance
of survival than your father.

54
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,700
Why did my father die?
And your father survive.

55
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,780
If it weren't for you taking revenge.

56
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,140
Calm down, Tee.
(Dr. Nong looks chill.)

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,540
Because this story
has been recorded as well.

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,980
That I have done my best.

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,660
(You're too hot-headed.
Should you go rest?)

60
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,780
You forged evidence..

61
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,140
If I did that,

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,460
Wouldn't it have been better
if I had faked it from the start

63
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,610
so that your father wouldn't have had
a chance to survive?

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,020
Both of you, calm down.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,260
At this time, the audience still doesn't know
how Kamnan Tong died.

66
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,300
Can you please let Tee
tell us a little bit more?

67
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,820
(Or is there an issue?)

68
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,100
At that time my father
was a village headman.

69
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,820
Nong's father is just a village headman,

70
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,860
and he came and accused my father.

71
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,140
So my father went to clear things up
with his father at home.

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,660
His father shot my father first.

73
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,180
My father shot back.

74
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,500
All the hospital,
There is only one doctor, Nong.

75
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,460
Everyone knows that his father
does not survive.

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,580
So he was forced
to take care of my father.

77
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,500
But the result is that my father dies.

78
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,740
It was clearly a deliberate attempt
to kill each other

79
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,860
so that they could treat their own father.

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,140
And they were satisfied.

81
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,340
Neng became the village headman
in place of my father.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,180
This kind of event.

83
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,820
Anyone who's seen it knows that
Nong is a murderer.

84
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,140
Well, on that day, I wasn't in the event.

85
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,940
(Poor thing.)

86
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,340
But I have a statement to give,
please allow me.

87
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,420
The witness heard the sound
of a car horn blaring frequently

88
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,980
in front of my house.

89
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,580
So he came out to see
and met Kamnan Tong.

90
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,340
He was so angry in front of my house.

91
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,700
He was not happy that my father
had arrested his subordinate

92
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,860
for drug dealing.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,620
My father fired a warning shot
into the sky.

94
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,660
When Kamnan Tong saw this,
he shot at my father.

95
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,940
My father shot back.

96
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,740
As for the matter at the hospital.

97
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,980
As Tee said.

98
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,420
Kamnan Tong has a better chance
of survival than my father.

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,300
But during the surgery,

100
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,300
We found that at that time,

101
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,460
Kamnan Tong had more blood
in his abdomen than we had estimated.

102
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,900
Which I would like to confirm that.

103
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,780
I conducted surgery and tried my best.

104
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,220
But as everyone knows.

105
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,580
He did not survive.

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,820
As for my father,
It must be said that this is also a miracle.

107
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,980
Because at first
I thought I had lost my father.

108
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,500
(Do you have any dog ​​food, Dr. Nong?)

109
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,900
Honestly, today.

110
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,140
I still feel guilty about that incident.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,340
Liar.

112
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,540
(I feel sorry for Dr. Nong.)

113
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,020
Nevermind.

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,100
Uh, today I have another
set of documents too.

115
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,500
Please give me documents.

116
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,100
It's a court decision.

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,940
And it's a record of all the surgeries
that happened that day.

118
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,780
(Oh, Dr. Nong)

119
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,540
I want to tell everyone that,

120
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,940
I want everyone to move on from this.

121
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,140
What the fuck?

122
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,820
The witnesses are you guys.

123
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,180
The evidence is that you guys
are the ones who recorded it.

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,860
You can make up any story you want.

125
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,700
Calm down,

126
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,420
you're defamating Dr. Nong right now.

127
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,220
And most importantly,
we are live streaming,

128
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,380
which would be considered a violation
of the Computer Crimes Act.

129
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,540
It's okay, Ms. Gale.

130
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,580
(Watch who knows who the male protagonist)

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,460
(Enough of Tee,
the whole house is a mafia)

132
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,100
I would like to confirm that.

133
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,900
I didn't mean to.

134
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,380
And...I have done everything
to the best of my ability.

135
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,820
You have to accept it.

136
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,860
That you intentionally killed my father
and then went to jail.

137
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,860
(Dr. Nong's team)

138
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,260
Yes, and today we have brought
both sides of the story.

139
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,780
The case of Kamnan Tong
has been presented.

140
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,100
It depends on you.

141
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,380
And for today,
the time for The Leverage is over.

142
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,620
Independent media
is no longer subject to orders.

143
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,700
And meet us again
when we have the truth to present.

144
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,780
Why are you sleeping like this?

145
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,020
Wake up.

146
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,900
Your brother can't come with me.

147
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,740
Er...

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,660
Hey,

149
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,180
He has something for you.

150
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,020
This.

151
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,300
Your rotten doll.

152
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,900
The hospital won't let me bring it in.

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,460
If I wash it first,
I'm afraid the smell will go away.

154
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,220
You'll be angry with me.

155
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,580
So he went to buy a new one for you.

156
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,380
Let him lie down here next to you.

157
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,260
Baby,

158
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,580
Wake up.

159
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,980
Wake up to talk to dad. I miss you.

160
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,380
Why are you sleeping like this?

161
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,620
My youngest daughter.

162
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,220
This must make people remember
Young Siam as a new generation.

163
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,140
We must sell policies that
change the structure

164
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,730
and address the people's plain points.

165
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,340
The issue that is good may not be enough.

166
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,580
We have to find a way to hook
for the necessary and continue to speak.

167
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,100
We should play big but it's too strong.

168
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,100
How about die
while waiting for the examination?

169
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
I think it's just,

170
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,620
It's better to take a long time
to see a doctor.

171
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,060
Have you ever seen it
when you go to hospitals in the provinces?

172
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,100
You will see the patients
or their relatives.

173
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,450
Like sitting on a mat waiting
in line along the walkway.

174
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,780
Sometimes the queue is so long that
it reaches the hospital grounds.

175
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,620
Some families use mortars and pestles
to pound papaya salad to eat.

176
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,260
There must be some idealists
or romantics who think that

177
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,980
it's a small happiness
and they won't accept getting sick.

178
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,820
But the villagers are familiar.

179
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,300
Poor them.

180
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,340
It's like he was born with this kind of thing.

181
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,820
And he thinks that his life is enough.

182
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,260
The truth is not this.

183
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,860
It's everything.

184
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,460
This is good enough.
Nothing can be changed.

185
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,020
This is a problem.

186
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,860
Boss, sister.

187
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,580
It's definitely coming.

188
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,940
The hope party introduce Ashwin,

189
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,340
the superstar who is very popular,
to run for MP as well.

190
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,860
Who?

191
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,460
A singer.

192
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,780
Don't you know?

193
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,380
What does a singer know about politics?

194
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,980
It's a big deal.

195
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,300
Really?

196
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,980
(The whole country is screaming! Brother A Ashwin has arrived!)
The top entertainer even came himself.

197
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,260
The popularity of the Hope Party
has consistently been third.

198
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,420
Now postponed to the second.

199
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,180
- Finally overtook Wiwat Siam.
- Yes, sir.

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,420
- Everyone is watching to see,

201
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,220
- what A will say as a new politician.
- Yes.

202
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,980
Okay, okay. Okay.

203
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,220
Ah, first, I have to welcome A
to be the family of the Hope party.

204
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,980
I'm very pleased, and I'd like to thank you,
Sun, for your hard work.

205
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,100
you finally managed to persuade me to join.

206
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,100
Actually, I didn't come to sing today.

207
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,460
Because the Election Commission
is absolutely forbidden.

208
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,300
Oh, can you sing just one sentence?

209
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,740
Better not.

210
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,300
- I'm kidding.
- Yes.

211
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,740
Actually,

212
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,060
there are questions that many people
would like to know.

213
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,580
Why did you decide to enter politics?

214
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Throughout the past forty years,

215
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,300
I've always received love
from all the people.

216
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,460
And I have a strong intention
to give back

217
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,380
to everyone more than just music.

218
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,740
And importantly,

219
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,530
our party has a policy of
developing a creative economy.

220
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,620
I believe that you can play an important role
in helping with this issue.

221
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,300
If all of us help choose the party.

222
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,820
For hope party!

223
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,820
Game changer,

224
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,980
have you thought about
how to beat that star?

225
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,140
We can actually raise
the policy of Young Siam

226
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,540
that can be resolved painpoint
of the people.

227
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,780
Thai people don't choose policies,

228
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,580
they choose people.

229
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,740
And then there's the image
of the new generation

230
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,740
who dare to confront the old system.

231
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,460
No, this looks like a collection
of academics, rich kids.

232
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,460
If you lose the election,

233
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,700
you can go back to your family business
and continue with your life.

234
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,060
Everyone is quality.

235
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,940
Did you know that Thai people
work from morning to night?

236
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,980
They go home, sleep,
and wake up early to continue working.

237
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,940
They don't care about your quality people.

238
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,300
Open your eyes and see
why people are so obsessed with singers.

239
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,260
Who among you can do it like this?

240
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,020
If the villagers are not interested,
social voice will not happen.

241
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,380
Go solve this problem.

242
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,180
If you can't,

243
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,420
Jet has a backup plan
ready to take your place.

244
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,180
You intentionally launched Ashwin
against the Young Siam group.

245
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,740
I didn't.

246
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,420
You open first.

247
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,620
A little.

248
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,820
Why is it serious?

249
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,100
You've a whole team
of all-stars in your hands.

250
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,460
I only have one singer.
I must be afraid of you.

251
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,620
I didn't come to give you anger.

252
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,180
I was not provocative.

253
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,980
I really give you a credit.

254
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,100
That can make Dr. Nong go viral.

255
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,300
For hope party.

256
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,620
The party of the great superstar.

257
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,420
Thai people's favorite.

258
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,260
Ashwin is here.

259
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,300
If you want A to become an MP.

260
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,420
Want good people to get into the council.

261
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,140
Come this way.

262
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,020
For hope.

263
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,300
The party of the great superstar.

264
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,140
Thai people's favorite.

265
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,900
Ashwin is here.

266
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,540
What should I do?

267
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,500
Didn't help?

268
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,300
No matter what.

269
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,460
We must do it.

270
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,380
Right?

271
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,060
Hello Vee.

272
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,980
This thing about the Young Siam.

273
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,020
I want to add something.

274
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,940
I'm telling you right now that the party
meeting is likely to be postponed.

275
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,020
Tell him not to postpone it yet.

276
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,260
I think I have a way to bring the trend back.

277
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,420
Really?

278
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,580
Under the framework
of the welfare state policy

279
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,460
to solve the country's problems.

280
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,260
And step forward to stand
on a world-class level with dignity.

281
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,940
We are representatives
of the structural reform of Thailand.

282
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,540
Starting with me, Withu Thetsakdisakul.

283
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,060
To reform politics
to become truly democratic.

284
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,180
Because the health of the people

285
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,460
is the basis of national development.

286
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,820
All Thai people must be difficult to sick.

287
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,300
Be easily to recover.

288
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,180
Waiting time to see a doctor is short.

289
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,980
Everyone in the family is healthy.

290
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,380
The woman that everyone sees
in this picture.

291
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,020
She is doctor Kittika Phonthongdee.

292
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,140
Everyone called her Dr. Ning.

293
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,500
There is only me who calls her dog.

294
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,460
She is my sister.

295
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,620
In the picture is the first day.

296
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,500
That Ning has performed
the doctor's duties.

297
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,820
As she had intended.

298
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,340
Because she had intended
since childhood that.

299
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,740
She grew up.

300
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,540
She wants to be like me.

301
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,100
She wants to be as good as me.

302
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,580
She wants to endure like me.

303
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,700
So that she can come
and help me with my work.

304
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,180
Therefore, Ning has never complained.

305
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,100
That must be done
with sleep deprivation.

306
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,580
Sometimes two nights.
Sometimes three nights.

307
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,780
But she always fights.

308
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,420
But the thing I feared most happened.

309
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,500
Dr. Ning,

310
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,900
My sister had an accident.

311
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,100
Because I fell asleep while working shifts
for four nights in a row.

312
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,380
Now, my sister still has some hope that

313
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,340
she will wake up
and be able to move around.

314
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,540
But there probably won't be
an opportunity to be...

315
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,020
Dr. Ning.

316
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,740
The truth is Ning is not the first person.

317
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,140
That has to encounter something like this.

318
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,780
There are still many doctors.

319
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,740
That must encounter events
in the same way.

320
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,420
But I already promised my sister.

321
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,740
That she will be the last person.

322
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,740
This is the reason.

323
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,340
That I decided to come to politics.

324
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,020
Because I want to
improve this structure by myself.

325
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,700
I would like to confirm in front of my sister.

326
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,020
And everyone who is here.

327
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,620
That every policy that I said.

328
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,340
Will not just the advertising campaign.

329
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,460
But everything I have said.

330
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,700
I have a promise.

331
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,380
That I will get it done.

332
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,180
Every word.

333
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,300
Wait a minute.

334
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,460
Ning,

335
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,380
Are you tired?

336
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,380
Enough.

337
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,420
From now on,
don't let outsiders get involved in this.

338
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,940
- Dad
- This is enough, okay?

339
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,180
From what we used to see,
Dr. Nong was a decisive person,

340
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,540
daring to speak and act.

341
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,660
He's brave.

342
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,860
How dare he intentionally take
his sister in that condition.

343
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,380
Come take a risk for your votes.

344
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,300
It is a personal matter of Dr. Nong's family

345
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
and has nothing to do
with medical ethics.

346
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,180
Today the question arises,
is this inconsiderate cruelty?

347
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,860
He probably thought well.

348
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,700
It is intention that is karma.

349
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,500
We must see Dr. Nong
as having good intentions.

350
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,220
Actions are considered good karma.

351
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,140
Wow, the monk is here to help too?

352
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,140
I have already transferred the funds
for casting the Thao Wessuwan amulet

353
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,500
into his personal account.

354
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,580
I think if we set up a policy
to collect taxes from monks,

355
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,940
We'll be famous.

356
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,980
But the Buddhists sued
and asked for the party to be dissolved.

357
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,740
Oh, so the Young Siam Voice app
is finished, right?

358
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,900
Finished but content not yet finished.

359
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,740
And still haven't entered Play Store.

360
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,020
Then contact the party, the supplier,
and the reporter.

361
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,220
My content team
will talk to Tom myself, Jump.

362
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,420
- Prepare the VTR to launch.
- Yes.

363
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,660
Can you help with something?

364
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,300
Calm down.

365
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,940
How can the work be good in such a rush?

366
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,180
I think wait for it to be complete first
and then launch in the next phase.

367
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,580
It doesn't have a next phase.

368
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,180
Whatever you have now,
you have to pour it all out.

369
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,780
Because if we can't do it.

370
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,300
Young Siam will be taken over by Jet.

371
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,620
I'll go take a shower first.

372
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,460
You can go to sleep first.

373
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,380
No way.

374
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,660
I'll go to sleep
after the announcement is made.

375
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,020
You go to rest.

376
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,020
Doctor too.

377
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,260
The dark circles under my eyes
are like a panda's.

378
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,180
Do you know why he is called Doctor Nong,
the Hundred Horsepower Doctor?

379
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,020
Because he did many things.

380
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,980
Because he uses medicine.

381
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,660
He therefore worked all day and night.

382
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,300
I probably don't have to tell you
what medicine it is.

383
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,940
Is it a joke?

384
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,700
I just brought Dr. Nong's information
to inform you.

385
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,700
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

386
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,540
I will go to ask Doctor Nong.

387
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,220
Ask him directly like that.

388
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,940
Do you think he will accept it?

389
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,620
What are you looking?

390
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,660
- Nothing.
- No, what?

391
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,740
I just watch.

392
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,300
I made a coffee for you.

393
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,860
Thank you.

394
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,340
Thee made a big press release.
Open a TV urgently.

395
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,820
- Thai people,
- What's the matter?

396
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,020
We have additional evidence.

397
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,780
That it was not only
former Prime Minister Panu

398
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,500
who received money to pass laws
that benefited foreign investors.

399
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,380
But there is still a minister.

400
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,780
And politicians from the hope party.

401
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,260
And many other former members
of the coalition government

402
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,940
who are involved.

403
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,780
Please invite Mr. Theerat.

404
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,660
We have already submitted all evidence
to the National Police Office.

405
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,860
Nititham has done our job.

406
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,340
Now it's time for the people.

407
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,500
Do your duty and don't elect
bad people into the council.

408
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,140
I think Thee is playing this game.

409
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,060
Our Young Siam Voice,

410
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,660
It's done!

411
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,740
What the hell is your plan?

412
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,940
Has anyone done something like this before?

413
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,300
I think we have to dare
to try something new.

414
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,220
Do you think this is
a playground like that?

415
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,020
No.

416
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,100
Answer me.

417
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,780
Why your Young Siam
has been drowned out.

418
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,420
- Because encountering other trends...
- How is it?

419
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,860
Huh?

420
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,100
You know you can't do it, right?

421
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,660
And if you can't do anything
until the big debate day,

422
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,340
I'll let Jess do it instead.

423
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,980
Yes,

424
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,340
But I still insist on my previous statement that

425
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,540
Dr. Nong is the most suitable person

426
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,860
to represent the party in the debate.

427
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,860
You know, right?

428
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,500
That if you failed on that stage.

429
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,660
It is like suicide in front of
the whole country.

430
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,860
Yes,

431
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,100
Your resignation letter.

432
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,500
I'm still keeping it

433
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,500
The liver first.

434
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,940
Do you like to eat liver?

435
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,980
- Yes,
- Let's do it.

436
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,980
Come on.

437
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,340
Come.

438
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,340
Let's help each other.

439
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,020
What are you making to eat?

440
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,700
Your favorite menu.

441
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,700
Boiled noodles with liver.

442
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,420
Jump, Liver, liver, liver, liver.

443
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,220
- Jump,
- Yes, boss.

444
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,540
- Chicken feet.
- Do not bring food to play.

445
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,340
- Looks like you.
- No.

446
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,940
- This looks like you.
- Oh wow.

447
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,260
Come on,

448
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,580
This,

449
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,820
Nourish your blood a bit.

450
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,220
It's hard all night.

451
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,700
I went to the trouble of finding
this liver flour myself.

452
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,540
Am I good?

453
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,260
And who was it that got lost
on the way to the market

454
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,100
and had to call to ask for directions?

455
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,900
It's not my place. I'm not familiar.

456
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,860
Speaking like this, I lost my credit.

457
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,100
Ah, I'll feed you.

458
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,140
So put it here.

459
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,940
What's up?

460
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,060
If you want to cry, cried out.

461
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,020
Let it be fully.

462
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,220
Enough.

463
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,580
It's just enough.

464
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,580
It's time to change the mood.

465
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,620
Oh, even though the MPs of this party
are not very kind,

466
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,900
But good taste.

467
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,140
Look at the discarded song.

468
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,900
It shows the previous MP.

469
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,940
- Definitely from the northeast.
- Sure.

470
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,980
Come.

471
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,540
Let me see.

472
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,180
Let do it.

473
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Do you want it?

474
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,220
Eat.

475
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,260
Eat.

476
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,700
I have ideas.

477
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,060
I thought for a while.

478
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,820
We can do it.

479
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,300
But you and the doctor.

480
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,980
I don't know, the doctor will be okay?

481
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,540
For now.

482
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,780
I took it all.

483
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,580
It trended on every platform
in just one day.

484
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,580
I told you there are people
waiting to ship this couple.

485
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,020
What's wrong?

486
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,940
Isn't it okay?

487
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,140
Well...

488
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,900
When I took Ning to launch.

489
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,140
Because I want to overcome the people
who look at politics as entertainment.

490
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,340
But watch us now.

491
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,460
We will be entertaining.

492
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,900
Don't think too much.

493
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,900
If there is no drama at that time.

494
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,220
By now, our Young Siam
might won't happen.

495
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,020
I understand.

496
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
But anyway,

497
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,020
I want people to see the problem.

498
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,780
Rather than looking at it as a drama,
creating a trend like this.

499
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,300
And when it was like this.

500
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,540
I feel that we'll lose.

501
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,540
You don't lose.

502
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,380
This time, it's just
you learn something more.

503
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,100
Knew that politics.

504
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,900
It is an entertainment.

505
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,380
That's true, boss.

506
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,260
The kids in the neighborhood
when they watch the news.

507
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,860
They asked me.

508
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,460
Which side is a good party,
which side is the evil party.

509
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,980
Like watching movies

510
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,980
These kids are...

511
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,300
You, right?

512
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,300
Go to tell them.

513
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,340
People like us have to be the heroes.

514
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,460
- Right?
- Um.

515
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,180
Anyway, it's a good mood.

516
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,060
Then come to listen
to the hero's description?

517
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,820
Witu is another name of the moon.

518
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,420
As for Thanit.

519
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,020
It means a star.

520
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,900
Hash tag Witutthanit

521
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,180
They are the moon and stars
that shine amidst the darkness of politics.

522
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,660
You write so well that I should hire you
to do copywriting.

523
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,140
But the hero must be the moon,

524
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,860
and the main character
must be the star, right?

525
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,500
You don't have to be that serious.

526
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,060
It's not true.

527
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,940
If really, it's okay.

528
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,940
Vee,

529
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,340
I mean the couple.

530
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,700
Why is there a ambiguity that
it might be true?

531
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,460
What smiles?

532
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,300
- Ni,
- Yes.

533
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,620
Think of a strong topic.

534
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,380
Selling media in a double pack
with other Young Siam brands.

535
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,620
Contact influencers to make
TikTok clips for teenagers

536
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,700
Yes, Mr. Vee.

537
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,940
And you.

538
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,620
- Go get dress.
- Huh?

539
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,740
We will go on a date.

540
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,820
Huh?

541
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,380
Dating creates a trend.

542
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,420
How?

543
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,780
- Do you have to feed you?
- Just eat it.

544
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,540
Whatever.

545
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,100
Eat it.

546
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:44,540
Vee, Doctor Nong,
can I take a picture with you?

547
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,900
I'll add the hashtag #Coupleno8 for you.

548
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,260
Please also add the hashtag
Young Siam 8.

549
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,260
- Thank you.
- Number 8.

550
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,540
- Bye bye .
- Thanks.

551
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,980
At this hour,
Young Siam is also very popular.

552
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,540
It's so powerful that it's brought
the Wiwat Siam Party

553
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,380
back into second place.

554
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,500
It has come up to breathe
on the neck of Nititham.

555
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,180
- Social power is really sure.
- Yes.

556
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,100
Especially the story
of Vee and Doctor Nong.

557
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,540
I can't believe
you'd get involved with politics.

558
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:25,940
Yes.

559
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,780
And what's more,
anyone who's a fan of Dr. Nong, get ready!

560
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,180
Because Doctor Nong himself, he promised.

561
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,140
He said he would like to come debate with us
at the Next Generation event,

562
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,900
"Thai Politics Driven
by New Generation People."

563
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,780
From the candidate of MPs, Rising Stars.

564
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,220
To the new generation of politicians.

565
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,500
And the next step is the party representative.

566
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,780
To the big debate.

567
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,100
Right?

568
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,780
I may be do it by myself.

569
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,220
Come on.

570
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,540
Not smooth.

571
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,700
Go train Dr. Nong well.

572
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,220
I will be a little fun.

573
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,460
You're not fun.

574
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,220
Because he will break your face
in the middle of the stage.

575
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,620
The name of this event
drives Thai politics.

576
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,540
I read it all.

577
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,140
You said you wouldn't be stubborn.

578
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,860
I'm not.

579
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,660
But you see.

580
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,900
Wouldn't that be a bit too wide?

581
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,740
You have to.

582
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,500
Because we don't know
how Passakorn will attack us.

583
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,340
I know that he will do.

584
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,460
People like him.

585
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,860
If we don't close the door on defeat,

586
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,380
there's no way he'll come down and play..

587
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,700
Plans are nothing.

588
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,180
Planning is Everything.

589
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,900
Isn't it a bit
too easy to test me like this?

590
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,660
Whether it's easy or difficult
You don't say it anymore.

591
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,460
But the expression on your face shows it.

592
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,220
Is it that bad? I saw him looking quiet.

593
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,460
Um,

594
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,460
Previously

595
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,580
He has always been under his father.

596
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,140
So he didn't really shine much.

597
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,540
But when studying abroad.

598
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,980
College debater.

599
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,540
Refutation and Gaslighting

600
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,700
He's really good at provoking people.

601
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,380
Why do you seem to know him so well?

602
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,180
I studied at the same place as him.

603
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,300
But Passakorn is older than you
for ten years, isn't it?

604
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,540
You should just tell him.

605
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,340
The doctor might think
you're making another political deal.

606
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,740
How is it?

607
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,900
He's my ex-boyfriend.

608
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,100
Huh?

609
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,660
Are you afraid of my people?

610
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,500
Your people?

611
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,420
I'm not afraid.

612
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,980
You must be afraid.

613
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,940
And I want to warn you again
that this time,

614
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,660
you really chose the wrong person.

615
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,380
Do not let your heart rule your head.

616
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,620
Mind your own business.

617
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,100
You are.

618
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,380
Not anymore.

619
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,740
But don't worry.

620
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,260
I stop talking to him for a long time.

621
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,900
Really stop talking?

622
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,820
Yeah,

623
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,620
He called one time.

624
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,820
He told me that.

625
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,700
Do not choose you.

626
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,180
Because he has already
investigated everything.

627
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Really?

628
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,980
What he knew?

629
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,860
He said just that.

630
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,820
But I should believe him since then.

631
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:27,780
Are you kidding me?

632
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,620
Let's see this.

633
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,700
Everyone,

634
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,100
Let's prepare to face Vee's old friend,
the top debater.

635
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,340
-Turn on the computer.
- Oh yes.

636
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,020
How is it?

637
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,700
Okay, this is probably the one fans
are most looking forward to today.

638
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,180
Doctor Nong Thanit,
Wiwat Siam party representative.

639
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,460
Hello,

640
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,700
Are you excited?

641
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,420
So much.

642
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,140
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

643
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,980
In that case,

644
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,340
the party representative
who will present his vision today

645
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,580
with Dr. Nong.

646
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,380
Please invite Mr. Sun Phasakon
from the Hope Party.

647
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,420
Hello Hello.

648
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,820
Paired together like this,

649
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,420
wouldn't the other couples
be so bland, Mr. Sun?

650
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,900
No, but actually
I didn't focus on other pairs.

651
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,860
I'm focusing
on my debate partner today.

652
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,140
- I am also spicy.
- Oh wow.

653
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,860
I think this is a good match.

654
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,100
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

655
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,780
This is this.

656
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,140
As expected,

657
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,340
the question is not drawn by lot.

658
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,860
This can be locked.

659
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,220
Your topic is...

660
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:25,020
How to propel Thai soft power
to the global level?

661
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,140
Do the doctor know about it?

662
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,980
His life is all about work and protests.

663
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,260
Do you think he'll know?

664
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,300
On this topic, would you like to speak first
or last, Dr. Nong?

665
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,620
Oh,

666
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,940
Then I would like to praise the hotness
of the leader of the Hope Party first.

667
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,660
If so, Mr. Pasakorn speak first.

668
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,460
You're welcome.

669
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,260
Repeat the rules again.
The first round is 3 minutes.

670
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,460
As soon as you say the first word,
time started.

671
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,940
Please be prepared.

672
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,540
Soft Power is not just cultural exports.

673
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:23,900
But it is the creation
of the country's brand through culture.

674
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,700
To be remembered
and accepted in the world stage.

675
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,180
So that we can have bargaining power

676
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,850
to get other countries to agree with us.

677
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:38,980
And from the rankings of
the Global Soft Power Index in the latest year.

678
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,020
Updated in February
at the beginning of last year.

679
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,300
Our Thailand was ranked in thirty -nine

680
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,620
from a total of
a hundred and ninety countries.

681
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,780
Which is considered to be on the top tier.

682
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,620
Now I will talk about things
that we are familiar with,

683
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,260
like culture.

684
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,220
Today, many Thai teenagers,

685
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,420
they don't listen
to Thai music anymore.

686
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,740
They listen to international music,
listening to K-Pop.

687
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,300
Therefore,
what our country should do is

688
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,730
that we have to develop
Thai music to go internationally.

689
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,620
Thai children must sing and dance
according to the world standards.

690
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,980
Our Taeguk Line has ten members

691
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,100
and our Thai kids are very talented.

692
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,460
I believe that we can do it.

693
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,860
Because of soft power that has potential

694
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,900
and efficiency comparable
to world-class levels.

695
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,700
It is the opportunity for all of us.

696
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,460
We will be able to create a new S-curve

697
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,180
and elevate the entire economy.

698
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,820
With the five pillars and five beams
of the party's policy for hope.

699
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,900
I am confident that

700
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,620
I will develop Thailand
to the world level in all aspects.

701
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,220
And at that time,

702
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,380
we will certainly be able
to create a true power power.

703
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,740
Okay, now Dr. Nong's turn.

704
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,700
Oh,

705
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,500
Okay

706
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,340
Okay, the same rules.

707
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,900
First round, three minutes.

708
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,140
As soon as you say the first word,
time started.

709
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,780
Inviting the doctor to prepare.

710
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:50,980
Uh, Doctor Nong, if you're ready ...

711
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,580
Please start.

712
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,740
Crush him.

713
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,100
Why are you still?

714
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,300
Put it out.

715
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,140
I think what Mr. Pasakorn said.

716
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,540
It's wrong.

717
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,460
The culture,

718
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,340
It's true.

719
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,460
A lot of teenagers in my house.

720
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,420
That they don't listen to Thai music.

721
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,060
But they listened to Isan music.

722
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,940
They listen to Mor Lam.

723
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,500
Listen to the car parade.

724
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,420
Why?

725
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,180
Because our culture
is tightly passed on.

726
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,260
Like when I came to Bangkok.

727
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,820
My father still gives me blessings.

728
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,380
It may sound old-fashioned.

729
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,380
But it was one of the most
appreciation in my life.

730
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,020
And then it made me fight.

731
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,580
Until standing beside you now.

732
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,380
As for the brand.

733
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,860
Northeastern people like us
have been insulted for a long time.

734
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,260
You called us crony.

735
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,860
Laos.

736
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,140
What does crony mean?
It means best friend.

737
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,940
As for Laos,
it is a neighbor country.

738
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,980
It is a culture that has been
firmly attached to us for a long time.

739
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,180
And in the eyes of the world?

740
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,020
He thinks that Thailand
is lower than him.

741
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,220
Is it like people in other regions
who view Isan people as inferior?

742
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,180
Not at all.

743
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,300
The country that he has prosperous.

744
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,980
He thinks that the difference is charm.

745
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,060
Like when I was at Phu Chalerm.

746
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,780
I went to sit and help people
weaving a basket.

747
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,620
Thai people buy it.

748
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,940
But do you know
why foreigners buy it?

749
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,340
They bought it to show.

750
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,620
We must let him try eating Isan Gimchi.

751
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,980
Like he had tried to eat Korean kimchi.

752
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,260
To develop soft power.

753
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:29,180
It's not like we have to just be soft-headed
and follow their lead.

754
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,340
But we have to say that
we are good enough.

755
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,260
What are our strengths? Let's tell them.

756
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,500
We show the world who we are.

757
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,300
As Mr. Pasakorn said.

758
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,820
It may not be all wrong.

759
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,580
But it is not quite right.

760
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,780
Development
must understand the roots.

761
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,500
It must understand the people
we will develop.

762
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:05,060
It's not like you just suddenly
put some random standard on it.

763
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,620
I have been working
with the community for a long time.

764
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,900
To be honest, each policy
that comes out of the government

765
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,940
Almost all are unusable.

766
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,820
Why?

767
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,620
Because the state has never listened.

768
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,060
Stick to the numbers,
stick to hard power.

769
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,020
What is this five pillars
and five beams policy?

770
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,740
If the soil is not tight.

771
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,100
The pillars cannot be located.
Definitely collapse.

772
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,740
Thank you.

773
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,180
And finally, today's debeat.

774
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,580
With questions
from the public that he asked...

775
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,500
The doctor's question is...

776
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,780
From many behaviors
that have been in the news before

777
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,300
If Doctor Nong is a MP,

778
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,380
Do you think you will be a problem?

779
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,940
I must answer that.

780
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,540
I will definitely create problems.

781
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,020
It will be a lot problem.

782
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,900
Because what I will do from now on.

783
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,180
Will definitely have to be
fully objections.

784
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,780
I will change the work culture
of the new public health.

785
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,900
Will proceed to cut the budget that
is not necessary from various agencies.

786
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,740
For example
starting from the budget...

787
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,980
Oh,

788
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:42,940
What's wrong?

789
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,100
Is it over?

790
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,940
Wait a moment,
the picture has arrived.

791
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,020
I apologize.

792
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,260
There is currently an emergency
with the studio's power transformer.

793
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,620
Right now,
we are sending the team to fix it.

794
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,460
Anyway, Please follow
in the application first.

795
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,020
Okay, everyone.

796
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,180
Even though the lights are out.

797
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,500
But I would like to talk a little longer.

798
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,580
When the power goes out like this,
bear with it for a while.

799
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,420
Wait, our eyes will adjust itself.

800
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,260
From the invisible.

801
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,540
Will start to see.

802
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,940
Do you know what it looks like?

803
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,020
It's like our country.

804
00:52:58,970 --> 00:52:59,900
It's dark.

805
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,260
And then we adjusted to get used to the darkness.

806
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:06,940
This habit is scary.

807
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,700
Because it makes us forget.

808
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,380
What is this light that we have seen?

809
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,220
But there is one thing
that is more scary than habbit.

810
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,980
Do you know what is it?

811
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,220
It's to have someone.

812
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,740
Who think that he is good.

813
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,540
Who think he is more special than others.

814
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,580
That can see in the dark.

815
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,300
Thank you everyone.

816
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:37,820
That you guys turn on the light.

817
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,460
Because it made me see that you guys.

818
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:45,020
Will not endure in the dark anymore.

819
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,020
I'm the same.

820
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,900
We'll not endure.

821
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,940
In a country as dark as this,
is that right?

822
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,180
- Yes,
- Yes,

823
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,260
- Is it correct?
- Yes.

824
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,380
Do you know?

825
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,860
I have always denied political work.

826
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,340
Because I think that this country.

827
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,740
It can't be changed anything anymore.

828
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,340
But today,

829
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,060
You all,

830
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:11,900
Make me see.

831
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,420
Make me believe.

832
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,140
Give me a hope.

833
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,140
That this country.

834
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,820
It can also change.

835
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:23,860
Is it correct?

836
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

837
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,740
I would like to admire every heart
that still has hope.

838
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,940
No more.

839
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,700
This dark country.

840
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,420
Where we all have to
bump into each other

841
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,460
Stepping on each other's feet.

842
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,140
And then let those who have power.

843
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,660
Secretly do anything in this dark corner.

844
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,100
We must move forward.

845
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,620
- We will fight together.
- Fight.

846
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,340
- Fight together!
- Fight!

847
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,660
Thank you. Thank you.

848
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,020
How could you say that?

849
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,100
Listening to it again is so weird.

850
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,620
And then there was a comment that said
the music was so loud it made it sound

851
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,820
like I was fighting a tank.

852
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,580
But it took our party
to the number one poll.

853
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,540
Whoever says, let's say it.

854
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:39,940
I'm comfortable.

855
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,100
Hello.

856
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,380
This must be Doctor Nong's relative.

857
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:50,820
- Yes sir.
- Um.

858
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:54,300
Vee didn't use you too hard?

859
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,100
No, it's still ok.

860
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,940
I ask Vee to brought you in here.

861
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,940
I would like to thank this team.

862
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,540
- Saw that you're working hard.
- We've to done our best.

863
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,140
Yesterday you did very well.

864
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,340
The reason we were able
to surpass Nititham was entirely

865
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,860
because of Dr. Nong.

866
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:15,980
Thank you.

867
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,740
Oh, it's time to celebrate.

868
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,460
What's up

869
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,020
Turn on the TV.

870
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,020
There is no information
this secret deal true or not.

871
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,100
And this story will be just a child model
or connecting to the father's generation

872
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,060
The hope and Wiwat Siam.

873
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,700
Must come out and clarify urgently.

874
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,900
There's nothing important
you need to know.

875
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,060
It's not important.

876
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,660
Or that I am not important.

877
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,580
Three days until the election

878
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,060
If I have to suffer all this
because of this

879
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:17,980
You probably know.

880
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,020
What the consequences will be.

881
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,780
The real political game is just starting.

882
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,660
Because we just got some points
that we can use.

883
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:27,860
This guy really flipped the table.

884
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,940
We have to play the game you hate.
