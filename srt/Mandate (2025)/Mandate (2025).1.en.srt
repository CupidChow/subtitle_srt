1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,420
You probably already know.

2
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,740
That we are only cheating.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,900
Wherever you go, you only find corruption.

4
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,540
Find your own interests.

5
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,780
But you are,

6
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,980
More special than those people.

7
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,780
Here, I wait for you to say first.

8
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,980
What to say?

9
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,700
It's you.

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,780
What's up?

11
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,180
Finish at one million baht.

12
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,820
One million baht?

13
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,940
Hey,

14
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,340
Collecting water samples.

15
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,860
Send to the lab.

16
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,660
Do the health examination
of the villagers that are affected.

17
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,860
At least it must be thirty.

18
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,020
Think about it.

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,260
How many years to work in the hospital
before getting it?

20
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,580
Including professional insults,

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,140
I think forty.

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,580
Shit,

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,740
Including the insults, it's fifty.

24
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,660
It's so difficult. Come on.

25
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,220
Just in time.

26
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,660
Yeah,

27
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,980
a little more.
I almost went to see the GOD.

28
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,060
There is nothing to say.

29
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,900
Let's meet at the court.

30
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,100
Let's say goodbye.

31
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,020
I'll leave it here for now.

32
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,260
And if they've a gun?

33
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,420
Oh,

34
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,420
Saying this, I can't call anyone next time.

35
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,900
Even more difficult to follow.

36
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,060
Next time you don't have to do this.

37
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,620
You speak like a comics.

38
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,580
Contrary to other people's legs all over.

39
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,220
You like him?

40
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,820
I believe in you

41
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,500
Since the first day we met.

42
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,940
(Snow falls at Phu Chalerm)

43
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,980
(New Morning News)

44
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,540
(Politics heats up after parliament is dissolved.)
After Prime Minister Panu's government

45
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,140
The opposition has exposed the issue
of benefiting foreign capital.

46
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,100
Until the parliament had to be dissolved.

47
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,500
Recently, the Hope Party announced that

48
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,660
Mr. Panu has resigned
from the position of party leader.

49
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,780
There is a news report that.

50
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,380
He has already entered the ordination ceremony.

51
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,500
The new party leader is...

52
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,340
His own son.

53
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,700
Mr. Pasakorn Acting Minister of Commerce.

54
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,140
Yes, I don't want to break my words.

55
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,580
But I really have to call you this time.

56
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,340
What?

57
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,660
Leader.

58
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,380
- Try listening to the statement.
- Yes.

59
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,180
(Mr. Phasakon Inthradanai: Leader of the For Hope Party)
Regarding the former government and party executives who resigned

60
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,900
In order to show responsibility.

61
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,660
I also ask that it be done according
to the judicial process.

62
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,300
The Hope Party
wants everyone to look forward.

63
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,820
With me and the executive of the new blood.

64
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,140
We will create policies that are more beneficial
to the people than before.

65
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,220
And in this upcoming election,

66
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,740
I would like to ask for
the opportunity of Thai people.

67
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,540
Give us the opportunity to
serve you as in the past.

68
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,540
Thank you very much.

69
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,940
I can't avoid this change and you know it.

70
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,500
Okay.

71
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,180
The current polls show the party is number one.
Of course. It's Khun Trirat's Nititharam Party.

72
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,260
The second-ranked opposition leader
is also a Hopeful party.

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,820
Followed by the old party like Wiwat Siam
of the former Prime Minister.

74
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,820
Now, he has announced
the re-branding of the party.

75
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,500
I called to remind you.

76
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,260
That you went to Head Hunt Dr.Thanit

77
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,540
Your nose is very sensitive.

78
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,260
Yes, I am

79
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,580
But you should be careful.

80
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,540
- That's all.
- Hold on.

81
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,420
You can tease me and make me angry
in any way you want.

82
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,180
But I called to warn you.

83
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,180
I don't want to see you to break
because you choose the wrong person.

84
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,180
Too late.

85
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,780
Sigh!

86
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,980
So let's continue with the news.

87
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,300
Let's take a look at the new province.

88
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,260
Phu Chalerm Province

89
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,260
The 78th province separated
from Sakon Nakhon Province

90
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,980
It is considered a new constituency.

91
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,340
- This is quite something to keep an eye on.
- Yes,

92
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,340
Currently, the owners of these three districts
are MPs from the For Hope Party.

93
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,340
As for other parties, they are probably
looking for new candidates.

94
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,580
To compete for the MP position
in this new province.

95
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,460
It is considered a pin that people
are currently interested.

96
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,500
Hoy!

97
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,780
What will our home be like?

98
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,620
People who will become a new MP.

99
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,700
He can't do anything.

100
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,100
As for the person who can do it.

101
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,340
He refused to become an MP.

102
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,860
Hey!

103
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,020
To be honest.

104
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,060
Not indirectly.

105
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,540
I won't be the MP.

106
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,620
End?

107
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,100
Let's eat.

108
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,180
I know that you don't like political work.

109
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,860
If your mother is still here.

110
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,740
Wait a moment.

111
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,660
Will you say it for a long time?

112
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,380
I'll call to postpone the patient.

113
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,940
Not that long.

114
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,300
I already told the party that
you're going to run for MP this time.

115
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,380
You must be.

116
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,140
Hey, if you don't. I will definitely die.

117
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,140
I definitely lose credit.

118
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,660
Then you it by yourself.

119
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,300
Even you can't have a son,
you can have a dad.

120
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,260
Is this good?

121
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,860
Kamnan Neng. The election campaigner.

122
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,260
First term MP candidate for Phu Chalerm.

123
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,820
Super cool.

124
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,980
He wants you.
He doesn't want me.

125
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,100
Very demanding.
So don't have to take anyone.

126
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,060
You are very demanding.

127
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,500
What is the political job?

128
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,380
It's not difficult.

129
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,620
I didn't understand
why you would hate politics.

130
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,820
Hey!

131
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,300
I don't dislike politics.

132
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,100
But I don't like politicians.

133
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,540
Do you understand?

134
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,740
So upset.

135
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,660
Yeah, wait.

136
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,900
Where are you going?

137
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,540
New doctor fate.

138
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,460
Go on duty for a long time.

139
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,340
I think I'm going to watch it.

140
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,580
Think about it well.

141
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,380
Please help me.

142
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,940
Sure.

143
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,500
But have to wait a little long queue.

144
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,020
Because of the things
that I have to think now.

145
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,980
It is much more useful.

146
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,860
I have to go.

147
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,060
My son

148
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,100
Hello,

149
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,420
I would like to see
Dr. Thanit Phonthongdee

150
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,180
Do you have an appointment?

151
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,940
Did the doctor do not enter today?

152
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,980
Do you have an appointment?

153
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,780
I didn't make an appointment,

154
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,700
but I had an important business.
I have to talk to the doctor.

155
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,260
Then you can leave the message

156
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,300
Probably not.
This story must talk directly to the doctor.

157
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,180
Then give me the contact number.

158
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,300
The doctor will be convenient
and will contact you back.

159
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,700
I have to apologize for my girlfriend.

160
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,580
Are you Maifah, right?

161
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:04,860
Yes,

162
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,940
It's okay.

163
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,620
We arrived at the doctor's hand.

164
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,660
- However, he must help, right?
- Yes,

165
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,660
What help?

166
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,260
Is the hundred-horsepower doctor
who helps a lot of people here Dr. Thanit?

167
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,380
Yes.

168
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,780
Well...

169
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,260
My girlfriend was raped.

170
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,940
- Huh?
- Yes,

171
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,220
And have you reported it yet?

172
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,300
Not yet, we want the doctor
to examine first.

173
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,660
Because the person who made my girlfriend,
he is a cop.

174
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,900
The doctor is the only one
who we trust to collect evidence.

175
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,660
And also want to be a witness.

176
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,300
What should I do?

177
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,540
If you wait a long time,

178
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,740
Will it be more difficult to collect evidence?

179
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,780
- Uhh...
- What should I do?

180
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,540
- It's right.
- Yes, yes.

181
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,420
Yes.

182
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,580
But the doctor didn't tell anyone
where he was going.

183
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,860
Didn't he tell anyone at all?

184
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,260
Uh...

185
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,340
- But today...
- Today,

186
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,860
The doctor should go to the Western line.

187
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,700
- Western line, right?
- Yes, Western lines.

188
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,220
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes.

189
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,060
Darling, let's go.

190
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,740
Uh, wait.

191
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:25,940
Sigh!

192
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Hello,

193
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,140
Doctor,

194
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,900
Urgent matter.

195
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,420
Someone came to visit.

196
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,940
But this time,

197
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,460
They didn't invite to get to the MP.

198
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,660
And he didn't leave
his name or number, did he?

199
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,100
Yes,

200
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,140
how do you know?

201
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,220
You have been deceived.

202
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,700
Huh?

203
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,860
Do I have to be raped?

204
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,780
What does the western route
from here pass through?

205
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,140
Village headman's house, Village No. 2

206
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,060
Ban Tapiang Weaving Literature Group

207
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,780
Municipal school.

208
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,540
Or will go to the group of cotton woven?

209
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,940
- No, but just now.
- Looking at the route.

210
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,020
Our car should not be able to enter.

211
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,580
Um, yes,

212
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,420
- no, but just now.
- Just a moment.

213
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,100
Then find a car.

214
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,940
Do you have a four wheel vehicle?

215
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,620
Doctor Nong, he came to check at home.

216
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,020
So I knew that my son was asthma.

217
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,500
Because my house burned sulfur,
smoked, hammered.

218
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,980
So the doctor suggested to
soak in water and mixed with sodium.

219
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,460
I can't remember the name.

220
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,740
The doctor said that the symptoms
will be better.

221
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,420
And when will the doctor
come to visit again?

222
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,820
The doctor didn't tell.

223
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,260
He only said that
he would keep coming and stopped by.

224
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,940
Come to see if the I'm still burning sulfur.

225
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,220
If I did, he'll take legal action against me.

226
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,300
Legal action?

227
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,060
How?

228
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,420
Well, it's serious.

229
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,940
It's both scolding and threatening.

230
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,100
If anyone does something wrong,
there will be punishment.

231
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,420
Just wait and see,

232
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,380
if he comes, all the grandparents in this area

233
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,540
will be sitting weaving with their backs straight.

234
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,580
- Oh wow.
- Yes,

235
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,700
He says that if you don't want
to have back pain like Aunt Thong,

236
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,500
then don't sit with your back bent.

237
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,060
We have to sew the fabric every day.

238
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,660
If not, we don't have money.

239
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,220
The fabric here is pretty.

240
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,700
Hmm.

241
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,020
I can't choose which one to take.

242
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,340
So I took all this.

243
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,180
Ow?

244
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,660
Thank you very much.

245
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,660
- Then I'll put it in a bag.
- Yes.

246
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,820
- Yes.
- Let's help quickly.

247
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,740
Take all this to put in a bag.

248
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,860
Come on.

249
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,100
Let's help.

250
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,820
Don't stand still.

251
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,540
Put it in the bag.

252
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,860
Need to go?

253
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,740
Yes, what should we do?

254
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,060
Then, let's separate.

255
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,140
I'll be here.

256
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,860
You should also go
and offer your duties to the party.

257
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,380
Get people and I'll go.

258
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,180
Slap the face of the old man.

259
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,100
Yes, let's get it first.

260
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,660
The fabric is here.

261
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,740
Oh!

262
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,580
So cute.

263
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,180
This one.

264
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,740
Not that cute.

265
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,100
We cursed each other.

266
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,220
Oh, cursing a lot like this,
like a couple.

267
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,420
Ouch, then I am better to curse other people.
I don't want to marry him.

268
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,580
Where are you going?

269
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,300
Have to go to the city to the meeting.

270
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,380
Here, call the car.
But no one accepted.

271
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,300
No need to call.

272
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,380
Can you sit at the back of the motorcycle?

273
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,100
I'll let my son go to send.

274
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,260
Can you?

275
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,180
Please.

276
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,060
Fantastic.

277
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,660
I'm not a motorcycle taxi.

278
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,180
Who will I have to send again?

279
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,860
This sister. She will go to the city.

280
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,180
Where?

281
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,300
Go to the municipality market.

282
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,780
Twenty minutes in time?

283
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,460
Just ten minutes is enough.

284
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,540
Okay,

285
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,260
If you can do as you say.

286
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,620
I'll increase the fee.

287
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,620
Hop on.

288
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,980
Drive carefully.

289
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,700
Uh, Lek.

290
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,180
I have a business matter.
I want to talk.

291
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,380
It's time to drink.

292
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,140
Here,

293
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,060
Uhh...

294
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,300
That's good.
You're trying to help me sell things.

295
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,060
I have to repay.

296
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,860
Come on.

297
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,700
May our trade and sales prosperous.

298
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,140
Is the villagers' liquor not to your liking?

299
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,780
Oh no.

300
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,540
But drinking like this
Doctor Nong doesn't mind?

301
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,660
Oh, that guy?

302
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,060
When he told me
he was going to be a doctor.

303
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,620
Ouch, I still don't believe him.

304
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,540
But before, he was um...

305
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,100
Cheers

306
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,300
Cheers

307
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,860
Bottom up.

308
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,700
Umm.

309
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,620
Like that, wow.

310
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,140
But before.

311
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,820
He was very reckless, drinking alcohol,
smoking, and boiling kratom.

312
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,780
Just looking for trouble everywhere.

313
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,620
What the...

314
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
What?

315
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,300
It's... He was flirting around.

316
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,340
But that was high school.

317
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,740
After he started studying medicine,
He is much better.

318
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,740
Well, the only thing left is the alcohol.

319
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,860
The project over there is a lot.

320
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,060
He wake up early and run every day.

321
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,500
He's crazy.

322
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,500
- Yeah, cheers.
- Really?

323
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,900
Drink it.
There are still many stories of the doctor.

324
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,340
Well.

325
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,220
Ah,

326
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,500
So, what time will the doctor come?

327
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,100
Oops, it's almost time.

328
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,980
Then another shot.

329
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,700
When the doctor is here
so we can talk smoothly.

330
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,860
More more.

331
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,060
Oh,

332
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,780
Too weak.

333
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,980
Aunt Lek.

334
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,580
Oh, you're here.

335
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,900
He was waiting for you for a day.

336
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,420
He want to talk about MPs.

337
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,060
Well.

338
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,700
So I don't have to talk.

339
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,180
What?

340
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,820
Do you know him?

341
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,300
Familiar face.

342
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,100
I've seen in the news.

343
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,660
Have seen in the news?

344
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,780
We have celebrity visit us.

345
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,580
Slow down.

346
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,820
He'll wake up.

347
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,780
Look at him.

348
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,900
He'll wake up late.

349
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,220
What else?

350
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,740
Then we take him to sleep there.

351
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,100
Mosquito will bite him.

352
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,540
Another problem for the doctor.

353
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,420
Okay.

354
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,540
Who?

355
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,940
There are only old people here.

356
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,820
Who?

357
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,700
Who?

358
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,060
- Sigh!
- Huh?

359
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,900
Help me.

360
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,780
Oh, what is it?

361
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,060
Be careful.

362
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,700
How are you?

363
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,980
Feel better?

364
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,900
Yes.

365
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,820
Ow, slow down.

366
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,340
Sorry.

367
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,700
Thank you very much.

368
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,980
Instead of going home to rest.

369
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,460
Going to drink with Aunt Lek.

370
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,180
Aunt, don't drink too much.

371
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,900
Drink just enough.

372
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,860
In order to live for a long time.

373
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,780
- Stay for a long time.
- Yes, Yeah.

374
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,220
He's exhausted.

375
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,740
Mrs.

376
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,260
How are you?

377
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,060
Drunk like a dog.

378
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,220
Who knew that local liquor
could be this strong?

379
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,620
Anyone knows.

380
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,060
- And how did you come back?
- Uncle Alex sent me.

381
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,900
And have you talked to the doctor?

382
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,660
I'm not pressured.

383
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,140
But he confirmed that
there are 13 more days for MP applications

384
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,020
and 55 more days for elections.

385
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,060
- 13 days?
- Yes!

386
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,180
Then hurriedly recovered to take a shower.

387
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,900
In order to think of something good.

388
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,860
Smile, let's smile.

389
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,020
Face mask

390
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,420
is in the refrigerator.

391
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,140
Yeah, thanks.

392
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Go to get it for me.

393
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,980
Huh?

394
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,620
- I'll slap you.
- Just kidding.

395
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,860
Hurry up.

396
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,260
Didn't you drink last night?

397
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,180
Do you know each other?

398
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,580
My name is Wittu,

399
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,540
you can me called Vee.
Nice to meet you.

400
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,460
Please let me tag along.
I didn't bring my watch.

401
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,020
You will practice intervals?

402
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,980
Doctor?

403
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,380
Run too fast,
it is also at risk of injury as well.

404
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,580
Hey!

405
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,500
Enough.

406
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,340
Why did you follow me?

407
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,140
If you hadn't ordered Aunt Lek
to get me drunk last night,

408
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,500
Faster than this, I was ok.

409
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,500
Why did you fool my nurse before?

410
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,300
Then we are equal.

411
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,860
If you want to say something, hurry.

412
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,580
I give you five minutes.

413
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,740
You probably know why I came.

414
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,180
Then you probably already know my answer.

415
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,180
So I asked one question.

416
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,300
Did you do a good job?

417
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,820
I didn't look down on you.

418
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,260
But honestly.

419
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,980
If you die,

420
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,180
What good things have you done?
What will happen next?

421
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,020
Whatever it is.

422
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,140
I am dead and what am I going to know?

423
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,420
If you want to do anything, do it.

424
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,460
Um.

425
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,620
You're more politician than I think.

426
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,900
Cheeky!

427
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,020
You work by yourself.

428
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,060
When the term is over, you go.

429
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,380
Don't care about others.

430
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,660
What is the difference?

431
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,860
I am a lot better than you.

432
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,380
What are you doing?

433
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,500
I see people fighting for
power and benefits.

434
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,620
Actually, you should compete with them.

435
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,380
Nonsense.

436
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
I don't care.

437
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,020
You don't care.

438
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,300
But the villagers do.

439
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,260
Both the power and benefits.

440
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,980
It belongs to everyone.

441
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,540
But we just don't have a representative
to take them back.

442
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,660
Do you know?

443
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,980
What you said just now,
you curse your father.

444
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,060
Yes,

445
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,260
Yes,

446
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,900
Really?

447
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,100
So you're still inviting me to join
your father's party?

448
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,540
I didn't want you for the party.

449
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,540
I want you to do it for me.

450
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:56,860
Time up.

451
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,340
I've to go.

452
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,500
Tomorrow I would like to have ten minutes.

453
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,340
Today, ten minutes.

454
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,940
Come again?

455
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,300
- Today, you run slowly.
- Can you follow?

456
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,140
It's delicious.

457
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,540
You're welcome.

458
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,740
Try this one.

459
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,780
It's not strange that
it will snow at Phu Chalerm.

460
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,820
Mr. Nithitham.

461
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,220
Sitting drinking with the son
of the leader of the Wiwat Siam Party.

462
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,620
This is not yet able
to overcome the conflict?

463
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,980
What did you laugh?

464
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,820
Do you see?

465
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:50,460
I said that he's not knowing about politics.

466
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,420
So please eat it.

467
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,020
Sure.

468
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,180
If you have anything to say, please say it.

469
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,380
I thought you would run away.

470
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,300
Who am I?

471
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,660
Do you think who am I?

472
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,260
Doctor Nong. Real doctor.

473
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,020
If you were here,
I would tell you about your heroic deeds.

474
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,060
Your heroism.

475
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,820
As a young man, he is not normal.

476
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,700
Ning, let's eat.

477
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,540
- Hello,
- Hello,

478
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,620
Don't tell me you'll find a husband for me.

479
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,820
Handsome, rich like this.

480
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,740
Seriously?

481
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,060
I'm too lazy to work.

482
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,020
Even having husband.

483
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,020
You must also work.

484
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
Well, wait a minute.

485
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,220
I'm sorry.

486
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,020
Do you think that if you come
into Kamnan Neng's house,

487
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,980
you'll be able to leave easily?

488
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,500
I...

489
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,460
I've wanted to be with
the Wiwat Siam Party for a long time.

490
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,980
- Being with?
- Yes!

491
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,300
The word is very old -fashioned.

492
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,820
Stop talking.

493
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,540
Speaking of which,
the smell of formaldehyde hit my nose.

494
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,260
You can pickle liquor.

495
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,300
I really want to being with them.

496
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,060
- Um.
- Um.

497
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,060
You look pale.

498
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,860
So that's it. I'll go to sleep.

499
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,020
So sleepy.

500
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,300
What?

501
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,620
Come to play the jokes and then go?

502
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,380
Come to eat first.

503
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,580
Worked for two days.

504
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,900
My battery is low.

505
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,740
No, no.

506
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,380
Worked for two days.

507
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,820
It's like not eating anything properly
for two days.

508
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,380
Eat first.

509
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,660
Eat first.

510
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,940
That mustache guy
has to take responsibility.

511
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,260
He convinced me to be a doctor like  him.

512
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,020
Oh!

513
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,340
Hey, which one?

514
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,900
When you were a child, you said that.

515
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,460
Ouch, I want to be like Brother Nong.

516
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,660
Want to be like Brother Nong.

517
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,780
Growing up to be a doctor to help Nong.

518
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,060
Who would have thought
that it passed for ten years?

519
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,620
Then I encountered the new doctor
and still had to work the same shifts as before.

520
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,540
If I had known this,
I wouldn't have studied.

521
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,660
This is a lot better.

522
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,220
Your brother was...

523
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,540
He lay there with his eyes wide open for a month.
I thought he was dead.

524
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,980
Structural problems...

525
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,500
If the doctor Ning came to help lecture
at the Ministry.

526
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,540
It would be good.

527
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,100
I don't have to lecture anything.

528
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,700
These things, people already known.

529
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,220
Just no one can help.

530
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,980
I'd rather ask you to work on the policy.
Maybe there will be some hope.

531
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,100
Do you know?

532
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,620
Everyone knows that you're courting that
mustachioed guy to become an MP.

533
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,140
I hasn't decided yet.

534
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,700
Anyway, let's take the policy
with the first party.

535
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,180
Once he became a government.

536
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,380
He'll control the ministry.

537
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,580
He can also control government staff.

538
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,700
Who said that I had not yet decided?

539
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,660
I did.

540
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,460
That...

541
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,540
No.

542
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:13,980
Did you hear it?

543
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,740
You're really stubborn.

544
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,380
- Who is stubborn?
- You are stubborn.

545
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,460
You're.

546
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,180
Aunt Noo's case,

547
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,660
Why do you change the medicine?

548
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,540
All the medicine are out of stock.

549
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,780
Is the drug running out of the hospital?

550
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,820
Why don't you order more?

551
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,180
The director,

552
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,380
This time.

553
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,620
All the budget went down to the ECMO.

554
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,540
Don't tell anyone.

555
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,500
He said that sale person.

556
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,980
Share the incentive.

557
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,140
Oh aunt Lek,

558
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,100
You come home?

559
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,380
- Is it beautiful?
- Yes,

560
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,580
Who did it?

561
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,180
The girls in our village.

562
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,180
I contacted the designer
from Bangkok to design.

563
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Oh!

564
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,340
So handsome.

565
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,420
Wearing a dress like this is like an actor.

566
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,460
What?

567
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,100
He give a little bribe.

568
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,820
He've got you?

569
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,300
What bribe?

570
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,140
Don't blame him.

571
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,740
He didn't know that I am helping him.

572
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,340
Yes.

573
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,620
He's stupid.

574
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,820
What do you help?

575
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,100
Don't be so blunt.

576
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,540
Well, if the woven fabric
that is a product in Bangkok,

577
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,180
it will be more priced.

578
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,780
The aunts work less, get more money.

579
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,700
Yes,

580
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,340
Better quality of life.

581
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,380
No need to risk back pain.

582
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,540
Your work is lighter.

583
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,060
Oh, hello.

584
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,740
Boss,

585
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,220
Just come.

586
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,140
Here, everyone is waiting for you.

587
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,740
What's it?

588
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,380
I will take a sample of the promotional set.

589
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,100
Therefore looking for a good person
to wear as a model.

590
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,420
No,

591
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,300
Come on.

592
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Don't be shy.

593
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,900
No.

594
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,300
Come on.

595
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,420
No.

596
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,460
- Come on.
- No.

597
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,540
Hey!

598
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,340
You're talented.

599
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,580
If you can study photography seriously
or take a course,

600
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,460
You can be a photographer.

601
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,220
Wow.

602
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,860
If my mother can think like this,
it would be great.

603
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,860
I'm at home
and I get scolded all the time.

604
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,820
Jump,

605
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,260
Doctor Nong, does he have a girlfriend
or someone to talk?

606
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,300
No.

607
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,500
If asked like this,

608
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,860
Don't tell me that you like him?

609
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,380
Invite people to be the MP.

610
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,980
I have to investigate his history.

611
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,180
Alright.

612
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,020
But I'm honest

613
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,780
He hates politicians like shit.

614
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,580
He won't join you.

615
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,900
Hate like this is good.

616
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,780
You know doctor, don't you?

617
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,300
Think about it if he is being someone.

618
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,260
Entered the parliament and passed laws.

619
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,660
What will he be?

620
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,220
He will...

621
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,180
Eliminate corrupt politicians
across the country.

622
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,620
That's right.

623
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,140
It would be great, right?

624
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,980
I'll help you.

625
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,940
The leader must become an MP.

626
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,180
You're also the same.

627
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,460
You can go further.

628
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,980
Since you're going to help me.

629
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,060
I will help you.

630
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,500
We are the same team.

631
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,460
Okay.

632
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,940
It's beautiful.

633
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,420
There will be 2 sizes.

634
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,540
I'll have a customer orders.

635
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:06,900
Here

636
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,900
Yes, please order.

637
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,020
Oh!

638
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,980
Do you have to go all out like this?

639
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,100
Oh,

640
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,580
I forgot.

641
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,300
This is the work of politicians.

642
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,420
Come to deceive the villagers,
they are happy for a moment and then.

643
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,900
You leave.

644
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,380
The pattern of clothes,
I gave to all the aunts.

645
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,180
They can cut the shirt for another ten years.

646
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,900
As for the live selling thing,

647
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,020
I'm just here to pave the way.

648
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,260
When I leave,

649
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,780
The aunts can continue do this
by themselves.

650
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,340
Villagers do not need to rely on me.

651
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,580
It's almost time to go live.

652
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,900
You too, be prepared.

653
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,260
Huh?

654
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,700
Prepare for what?

655
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,660
This one is good.

656
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,780
You can use it again and again
for many years.

657
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
If you keep it well,
mold won't grow at all.

658
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,980
Hmm, I heard that this place uses food-grade
anti-fungal agents, is that right?

659
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,860
Yes,

660
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,780
Doctor Nong, Doctor Nong.

661
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,220
What is the name?

662
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,340
That we use...

663
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,700
Sodium benzoate.

664
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,700
Huh?

665
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,740
Speak loudly.

666
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,540
It's sodium benzoate.

667
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:41,940
Yes,

668
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,300
I've good things to show.

669
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,140
Wait a moment,
I've good things to show.

670
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,620
Okay.

671
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,100
Let's try this.

672
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
Have you ever heard?

673
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,700
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

674
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,020
If you want them to vote for you.

675
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,780
You have to weave a basket.
Here, this is a new one.

676
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,180
Plug in like this.

677
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,940
Then, alternately, stab in a grid pattern,
stab up, stab down, stab up, stab down like this.

678
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,860
Okay.

679
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,820
Try...

680
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,660
Next, what is it?

681
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,700
Go down and get up. Oh, wow.

682
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,620
Wow, it went up
and then came down like this.

683
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,300
Finished and plugged in like this.

684
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,140
This is tight, tight.

685
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,020
Just this?

686
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,340
I don't know how to do it,
so I have to be taught.

687
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,460
- Here it is.
- Auntie,

688
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,100
Yes,

689
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,100
Switch this.
Do you understand the word switch?

690
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,500
Huh?

691
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,500
Okay, this one is up.

692
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,260
Um.

693
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,260
(Ae St Tml: 2 Chalom please)

694
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,660
(Ton Noi: The killer)
(Ae St Tml: You're a killer.)

695
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,440
(Hang Over: You'll see me.)

696
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,060
What? I have to help the boss.

697
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,180
If you want to help, then come here.

698
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,220
Oh!

699
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,220
There are people who are impatient
and want to get the item.

700
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,940
Come and see it here.

701
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,540
Say hello to the twelve thousand people
who are watching.

702
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,340
Twelve thousand?

703
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,060
Twelve thousand.

704
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,260
Good.

705
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,300
I didn't come to buy things.

706
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,820
I will tell everyone that...

707
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,620
How fuck is this guy?

708
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,620
But be careful of words.

709
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,460
In case there are children watching.

710
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,420
Let everyone know.

711
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,500
He's a murderer.

712
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,380
If you want to reporting.

713
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,300
You must go to the police station.

714
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,180
The police will be afraided of his father.

715
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,220
Hey, stop.

716
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,660
What does my father have to do with this?

717
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,020
Alright.

718
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,900
There are comments asking about this.

719
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,580
They said...

720
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,260
You didn't go to the police...

721
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,100
Is it because you're not innocent?

722
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,620
Yeah.

723
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,060
I would like to see everyone's face clearly.

724
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,780
Who has a criminal history?

725
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,500
Ouch!

726
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,340
There is another comment.

727
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,460
Oh, this one didn't ask.

728
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,220
This one said that this style
will definitely carry a barbarian gun.

729
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,140
Really?

730
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,220
Can I have a look closer?

731
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,860
You're expose.

732
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,780
You are a murderer.

733
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,260
It always be like this.

734
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,380
So I don't want to be on camera.

735
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,180
Aren't you stressed at all?

736
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,900
Being discredited like this.

737
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,580
I there is nothing I can do.

738
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,140
Who said that you couldn't do anything?

739
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,540
See,

740
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,500
You must have me to take care.

741
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,900
The price is five hundred baht only.

742
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,740
It can be matching with a lot of outfit.

743
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,300
Here, it's a big bag.

744
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,220
Oh, so that means
what we just talked about...

745
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,860
That's all we heard.

746
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,820
But I want to talk.

747
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,580
What did happen?

748
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,620
But I don't want to talk.

749
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,340
And if you still insist on taking me
to be an MP with you,

750
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,500
Prepare to be in trouble.

751
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,060
Hello father.

752
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,020
What's up?

753
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,140
Huh?

754
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,500
Where are you now?

755
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,860
Okay I'll be there.

756
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:22,620
Dad,

757
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,220
I already asked.

758
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,980
She is here just in time.

759
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,900
And the doctor who operated on her
was my teacher.

760
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:50,860
Dad, don't worry

761
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,260
I saw the clip in front of the car.

762
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,300
The car ran straight.

763
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,980
Suddenly slipping down
the side of the road.

764
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,860
You know, she fell asleep.

765
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:19,420
Do you know how many days
she was on duty?

766
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,700
Four days in a roll.

767
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,820
How can she not fall asleep while driving?

768
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:40,060
How is she?

769
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,100
The patient was seriously injured
in the neck.

770
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,900
The nervous system is
quite severely damaged.

771
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,220
I've tried my best.

772
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,740
The heaviest may not be able to move.

773
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,900
But it might still be possible to recover.

774
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,580
Thank you very much.

775
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,860
What did we skip?

776
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,540
Why no one talk?

777
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,860
I asked.

778
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,460
Jump said he didn't know about it.
At that time he was still a little child.

779
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,540
And if Doctor Nong killed people.

780
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,860
Why does everyone protect him?

781
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,220
Let's go.

782
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:31,820
Go home first.

783
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,300
Go get some rest.

784
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,540
Come again tomorrow.

785
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,460
Staying here won't help anything.

786
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,980
Dad, you go back first.

787
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,620
Alright.

788
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,700
Dad,

789
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,660
I've decided.

790
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,740
I will run for MP.

791
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,860
I'm worried about the doctor.

792
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,180
To live with them.

793
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,580
I don't know if he can eliminate anyone
or got eliminated.

794
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,100
If the boss finds out,
I'll definitely get beaten up.

795
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,260
I can determine your life.

796
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,980
Including your family as well.

797
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,860
Are you threatening me?

798
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,060
Actually,

799
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,660
As a doctor, you should have
more difficult decisions to make.

800
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,540
You want to hear the story...

801
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,460
That Tee said I killed his father?
