1
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,700
Why don't you wear clothes first?

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,100
Should I take it off?

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,180
Hey!

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,420
A newcomer like you,

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,860
What can you do to defeat the landlord?

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,380
Welcome to Wiwat Siam Party.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,980
I will keep an eye on you.

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,540
Pong, our candidate for the third zone,
was withdrawn.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,060
Already entered Nititham party.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,980
If I had known about this sooner,
I would have invited Nat.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,980
There is another story.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,300
Tee?

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,780
After the first term as a representative,

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,460
he was immediately allowed
to change parties.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,620
Doesn't it look too bad?

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,420
You don't cheat anyone.

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,660
But if you are with me.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,940
You will make more policies.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,460
You should tell me in advance.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,460
I will go directly to the boss.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,180
This is already in advance.

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,780
And Vee went to talk to your boss.

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,860
Are you serious,

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,860
Did you consult with
Mr. Jet or your father before?

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,100
No.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,860
That's it.

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,940
But there are some things I can do
without my father's approval.

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,420
Like helping the Kaset Rak Kaset Party.

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,740
Wait a minute.

30
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,100
Didn't you come to ask
for my people? Huh?

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,540
Don't call me asking.
It would look bad.

32
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,900
I never accept anything for free.

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,660
Honestly,

34
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,100
Real politics,

35
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,100
It's much more brutal than we thought.

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,260
If you didn't watch my back,

37
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,980
I will definitely die.

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,500
But you choose you Mr. Vee, right?

39
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,820
Don't tell me that it's not okay.

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,220
Yeah.

41
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,260
I don't know either.

42
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,180
Oh,

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,940
But I believe that.

44
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,300
Mr. Vee is the most OK.

45
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,020
At least we've the same goal.

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,500
Even if it's different way.

47
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,260
Last time, the Rak Kaset Party
lost three seats.

48
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,940
To the Hope Party.

49
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,460
Unfortunately.

50
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
You've only lost a little bit.

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,060
Then...

52
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,740
I have a reliable information that
your competitors at the Hope Party.

53
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,260
District 1, secretly hides shares.

54
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,620
District 2, uses fake
educational qualifications

55
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,940
District 3, brings in mistresses
to earn government salaries

56
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,860
One for three.

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,220
I'll take it!

58
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,900
Honestly,

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,340
You play this hard.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,740
For a small province like Phu Chalerm?

61
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,860
Just here is not small for me.

62
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,020
Difficult to sick.

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,900
Yes,

64
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,140
Easily to cure.

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,020
Yes.

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,220
Didn't have to wait long for the doctor.

67
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,100
Yes.

68
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,900
- Every home is healthy.
- Yes.

69
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,460
One of the Welfare State Policy.

70
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Number 8, Wiwat Siam Party.

71
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,620
Please leave it with me.

72
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,020
Let's take a picture together.

73
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,980
Alright, one two three.

74
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,980
We only have one month to campaign.

75
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,140
We will use Doctor Nong as the leader.

76
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,780
And use online media to help a lot.

77
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,420
The first phase,

78
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,980
We will use the connection
of director Pichit.

79
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,860
Hello,

80
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,620
This is Somsak,
the owner of the market.

81
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,140
He's my student.

82
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,780
Anyway, please vote for number 8.

83
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,540
Don't worry, teacher.

84
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,260
We, Kim Hong Market.

85
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,460
Vote for number 8, right?

86
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,620
Yes,

87
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,260
Doctor Nong. Go ahead.

88
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,540
Hello, everyone.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,420
Both come to trade.

90
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,140
Both come to shop
at Kim Hong Market.

91
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,540
The sound you are heard.

92
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,340
Not the sound of
the car that sells watermelon.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,140
Not the sound of
vehicles selling mussels.

94
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,780
But the voice of Doctor Nong No. 8,
Wiwat Siam Party.

95
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,300
That will sell the policy to you all.

96
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,660
Brothers and Sisters,

97
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,020
Is it enough?

98
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,780
One election,

99
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,340
Electricity bill, Fuel,

100
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Decreased once.

101
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,620
- Am I right?
- Yes,

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,100
And it keep increasing all year.

103
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,100
- Right?
- Yes.

104
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,020
Is it enough?

105
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,540
One election,

106
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,260
The price of rice and
sweet potato also dropped once.

107
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,660
And all the year, It keep decreasing.

108
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,580
- Right?
- Yes.

109
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,220
This kind of government party,

110
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,180
Do you still vote for them?

111
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,540
No.

112
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,020
Political parties are not fish sauce.

113
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,420
Not alcohol.

114
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,020
That must be an old collection.

115
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,740
Let's vote for the new party.

116
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,060
Number 8, both people and party.

117
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,060
Let Dr. Nong be your representative.

118
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,340
Allowing the Wiwat Siam Party
to be a government.

119
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,060
Supha and Nat
approach people face to face.

120
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,740
Supha,

121
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,500
You have to make they see
that we are the same team as them.

122
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,780
And will also be used to
make online content as well.

123
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,980
But you have to be careful
not to sing and drink.

124
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,620
It's okay, it's fine.

125
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,900
Please vote, Number 8, Doctor Nong.

126
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,540
Don't forget to take your mother
to vote too.

127
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,940
Oh, they don't care.

128
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,340
Be on Tik Tok all day.
And watch this.

129
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,660
Watch it dress.
You'll get dragged into the bushes.

130
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,780
Children today,
Thinking only about rights.

131
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,780
We have to warn them.

132
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,740
It's not your business.

133
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,300
Absolutely no trouble.

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,700
As for Nat,
acting like when you were a NGO.

135
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,900
Can talk to the problems
with the villagers as usual.

136
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,780
I just need content.

137
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,060
Villagers curse the old government
and the system.

138
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,380
Criticize the capitalists and then
we propose welfare state policies.

139
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,500
Restructuring.
I'll let Ni help you here.

140
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,060
For you,

141
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,500
I take care of you.

142
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,460
Go ahead!

143
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,220
It's for you.

144
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,420
Good service.

145
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,380
I ate and you eat it.

146
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,420
Try it first. Smell it.

147
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Smell good?

148
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,820
- Eat it.
- No.

149
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,540
Yes, yes.

150
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,300
Okay, too. Please vote.

151
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,060
Please vote for number 8.

152
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,900
- I'm cheering you on. You're so talented.
- Thank you. Thank you.

153
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,940
Thank you.

154
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,900
Better to go over there.

155
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,620
Which party do you choose?

156
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,980
Wiwat Siam.

157
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,620
What number?

158
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,180
Number 8.

159
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,780
- What number?
- Number 8.

160
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,020
34

161
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,100
34

162
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,060
Number 34, Nititham.

163
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,860
Fight corruption
and be aware of traitors.

164
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,020
Do not believe in the creator.

165
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,540
Selling dreams.

166
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,220
It must look at the work.

167
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,020
That's tangible.

168
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,700
Our party has defeated
the traitorous government.

169
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,100
Do not allow the new evil people.

170
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,740
Being a politician.

171
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,540
The best opposition.

172
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,940
I hope you can serve
as the opposition again.

173
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,220
Wiwat Siam will ask for volunteers.
Go to be a government.

174
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,300
Everyone,

175
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,620
I've work...

176
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,820
I'll ask to enter the council to make it big.

177
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,060
For everyone.

178
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,100
If possible,
I'll enter the Government House.

179
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,700
To be a government.

180
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,900
To do a welfare state for everyone.

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,380
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

182
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,780
No.

183
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,100
You've no choice.

184
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,380
I ask you to receive it.

185
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,380
Because our welfare state.

186
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,100
Meaning that every home must get it.

187
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,500
Every home must have it.

188
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,260
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

189
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,340
This is how Nititham teach people.

190
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,260
It must have been trained to
a certain level.

191
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,140
There probably won't be any more
of the face-to-face fun like before.

192
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,740
But the concern is,

193
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,140
It will play behind our backs

194
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,020
and we will have
a harder time dealing with it.

195
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,340
What is it difficult?

196
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,980
It comes with force,
so it goes with force.

197
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,620
Why are you afraid of it?

198
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,380
You made me feel that.

199
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,060
Nititham is better than me.

200
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,780
Hmm...

201
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,620
You did great.

202
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,100
But there is still no picture
that can be a viral.

203
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,860
And next time, take a picture of the left side,
it's more beautiful.

204
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,620
No,

205
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,980
For me

206
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,340
You looks beautiful on both sides.

207
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Shy?

208
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,300
I'm not.

209
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,900
- You're. You're smiling.
- I'm not.

210
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,580
Yeah, the next round,
would like to have a lot of pictures like this.

211
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,300
Is this political job?

212
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,420
It's not a BL series.

213
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,180
Yeah, believe me.

214
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,820
It can go together.

215
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,100
Um.

216
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,700
Lunch is ready.

217
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,780
- Hurry up.
- Oh,

218
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,020
Uncle's boiled noodles.

219
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,580
Looks great.

220
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,260
Smells so good.

221
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,420
It's so delicious.

222
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,340
Hey, if Uncle gets fired,

223
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,740
Prepare to open the restaurant.

224
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,660
You say this.

225
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,420
My feet should be more delicious
than the chicken feet.

226
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,660
Mine too.

227
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,620
Let's eat.

228
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,860
Go ahead.

229
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,100
Why?

230
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,940
This is a bit iron-deficient,
so you look pale.

231
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,660
I can eat supplement.

232
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Not the same.

233
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,740
I'm working on a nutrition promotion policy.

234
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,740
This will reduce the workload on doctors.

235
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,420
Therefore, you have to cooperate.

236
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,540
It's bitter, doctor.

237
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,780
When I was a kid, I ate it and threw up,
so I don't dare eat it again.

238
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,180
As people grow up,

239
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,700
their bitter taste buds
become less sensitive.

240
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,980
When I was a child,
I stole my father's liquor to drink.

241
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,140
It was bitter.

242
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,340
But when I grew up.

243
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,540
It's so sweet.

244
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,180
You can eat liver.

245
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,860
Hey,

246
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,260
Liver, liver, liver, liver.

247
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,100
Liver, liver, liver, liver.

248
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,020
Stop singing and I will eat.

249
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,780
Get it.

250
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,940
Is it delicious?

251
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,740
Delicious, right?

252
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,980
This is called the liver of flour.

253
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,580
- Liver flour?
- Um.

254
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,740
It's a liver with blood and red liver.

255
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,340
So it's not bitter.

256
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,340
I ordered it from my regular butcher shop.
They specially select it for me.

257
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,980
They don't sell it every day.

258
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,100
- Thank you uncle.
- Hey,

259
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,820
you must thank me.

260
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,540
I'm the one who came up with this idea.

261
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,340
I bought, cut and then blanch it.

262
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,140
Well, if you say it at the first place.

263
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,420
I would be thankful.

264
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,140
Doing good doesn't bring good.

265
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,780
Oh!

266
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,700
I know you're smiling.

267
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,380
Online media will definitely
not affect people around here.

268
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,580
So today we will take
the leading policy.

269
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,140
Focus on introducing yourself
and talking about things he might really want.

270
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,500
Should have many things.

271
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,380
Then I think we should film
something difficult, bro.

272
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,900
Anyway, we have arrived here.

273
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
No,

274
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,020
it looks too intentional
for people to see through.

275
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,820
Just taking a normal shoot, it looks difficult.

276
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,940
This area is difficult to travel.

277
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,460
Working-age people
are all moving into the city.

278
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,580
Don't even mention choosing us.

279
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,980
It is still unknown whether
they will return on election day.

280
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,260
They will.

281
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,100
If there is a good offer,
it is worth the car to come back.

282
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,580
Whatever.

283
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,660
After finishing campaigning,

284
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,620
We can talk.

285
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,100
Hello Grandma,

286
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,380
How are you?

287
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,460
I am a doctor to come to the MP.

288
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,660
I already knew.

289
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,700
Okay.

290
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,660
Grandma,

291
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,780
If you choose number 8,

292
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,260
Grandma will also have the right to
a health check.

293
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,980
If you are sick, you will see a doctor
more easily than before.

294
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,260
Is it good?

295
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,500
Better to not starve first.

296
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,460
What do you want?

297
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,420
I will do my best.

298
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,340
I talked yesterday.

299
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,460
He can help me.

300
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,980
Who would be that good?

301
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,980
Mr. Jom.

302
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,300
I will choose him.

303
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,140
So that we can use the budget
to dig another pond.

304
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,980
It took a long time to get it done,
Grandma.

305
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,540
He had already submitted the matter.

306
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,540
It's almost.

307
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,900
He said if he was not a MP this time.

308
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,660
No one can do it instead.

309
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,700
If you have anything, you can tell us.

310
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,300
Once you choose,
what can you do to help?

311
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,100
The villagers around,
they are already waiting for people to help.

312
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,380
Drought,

313
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,140
There is no money to buy fertilizer.

314
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,460
No money but gold is good.

315
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,940
Fake gold.

316
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,140
The husband doesn't have the money
to buy gold to wear.

317
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,260
It looks real.

318
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,220
I just went to the area.

319
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,260
Didn't go to see for a few years.

320
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,180
Villagers are poorer than before.

321
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,980
If being a MP this time,

322
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,660
I will have to push the budget to dig again.

323
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,540
I pity the villagers.

324
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,700
How deep does you want the well?

325
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,580
From 30-40 meters to 300-400 meters.

326
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,060
There is a five hundred thousand per ponds.

327
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,820
Oh, no.

328
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,820
Just the appraisal price starts at millions.

329
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,100
You just dig it so that there's water.

330
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,060
Just think about how deep it is.

331
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,860
But if it's very dry, you have to dig deep.

332
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,940
Five hundred thousand,
I guarantee that it's not really.

333
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,740
I didn't only dig two ponds.

334
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,260
You go to manage the service.

335
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,060
And then tell me.

336
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,180
I'll go call other people to
ask for the price instead.

337
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,100
Don't forget, number 8,
both the person and the party.

338
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,540
Yes, thank you.

339
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,500
Doctor,

340
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,540
Yes,

341
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,820
I'll return to Sakon Nakhon.
But I've no car fee at all.

342
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,740
Can you help me?

343
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,660
Uh...

344
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,820
I swear, I didn't lie to you at all.

345
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,300
You don't have to swear.

346
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
Just a moment

347
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,340
Here.

348
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,060
- Wiwat Siam Party.
- Thank you.

349
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,180
Thank you, doctor

350
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,940
Thank you.

351
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,340
What's up?

352
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,580
Oh, nothing.

353
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,420
Aunt probably doesn't have money
to go home.

354
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,980
She asked for money so I gave her 100.

355
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,540
Oh,

356
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,580
Shit.

357
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,980
- Stop.
- Jump,

358
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,860
Can't believe they're doing this.

359
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,860
Well, it's not yet able to pass on.

360
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,380
Look at this.

361
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,500
They shot.

362
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,940
Next time, be more careful.

363
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,100
If it doesn't play directly.

364
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,980
It will play dirty like this.

365
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,260
Really dirty.

366
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,460
So foul.

367
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,100
Dad,

368
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,700
What did you do?

369
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,180
Why do you look like a dog?

370
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,900
I went to bite with the dog.

371
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,700
I'll take a shower first.

372
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,020
Doctor.

373
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,700
Let me first.

374
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,940
I can't bear it.

375
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,620
No need to fight over it,
there are two bathrooms.

376
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,860
Lady First,

377
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,780
One room must be Ni.

378
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,980
Enough, do not have to argue.

379
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,500
Water does not flow.

380
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,420
Oh,

381
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,940
The mechanic is fixed,
shouldn't be finished by tonight.

382
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,380
But I have an option for you,

383
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,060
a pothole in the back of the house.

384
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,140
Sigh!

385
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,620
Can you?

386
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,380
A lot of geckos.

387
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,940
Startled.

388
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,980
Choose between a gecko and...

389
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,580
Endure dirty, I choose a gecko.

390
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,820
Are you sure?

391
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,260
Startled...

392
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,100
You said, you're not afraid.

393
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,180
You must not tease me.

394
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,740
Do not escape and do not turn.

395
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,220
And why can't I see yours?

396
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,260
You have seen mine.

397
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,140
You showed it yourself.
I didn't want to see it.

398
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,860
But anyway, you have already seen it.

399
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,100
Clearly.

400
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,660
Stop,

401
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,060
- I would take a shower.
- Okay.

402
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,380
Please said something. It's quiet.

403
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
What do you want to talk about?

404
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,860
It is...

405
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,980
a gecko story or...

406
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,220
a ghost story.

407
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,220
Doctor!

408
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,780
I don't play.

409
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,100
The ghost story is joking.

410
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,460
But this gecko is real.

411
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,860
There are a lot there too.

412
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,140
- Hey,
- Hey what?

413
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,780
Hey, turn away.

414
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,900
I told you not to turn around.

415
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,780
Well, you cry.
I have to turn around.

416
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,700
So why did you cry?

417
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,820
What's wrong?

418
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,780
How is it going?

419
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,300
The branches dropped.

420
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,780
Oh,

421
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,020
Cry like seeing a snake.

422
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,020
Uh...

423
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,300
And what did you see?

424
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,540
No, I didn't.

425
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,380
Boss,

426
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,300
- Boss,
- Huh?

427
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,820
What did you say?

428
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,380
The day after tomorrow,
we must talk and film the white school.

429
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,940
Okay.

430
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,020
Deadline four o'clock in the evening.

431
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,140
This time I will release on the page
at six o'clock.

432
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,180
And the day after tomorrow,
we will share in the group at 10.30

433
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,260
Just right.

434
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,860
Next time, there will be
more fifty groups adding.

435
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,020
Thank you.

436
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,260
This is the aptitude of
Thai government staff.

437
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,860
Add Line Group.

438
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,580
As for the Tik Tok channel of our team,

439
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,660
now I have ninety thousand followers.

440
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,140
But follow and scold.

441
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,620
Following the clip of
the vendor's child scolding Supha.

442
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,380
It's quite a viral.

443
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,660
Think of it as increasing
our engagement rate.

444
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,620
Get ready to create content that
will appeal to teenagers.

445
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,020
But during this time,

446
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,540
everyone must be even more careful.

447
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,140
Someone is preparing to attack us harder.

448
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,700
Especially in debates.

449
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,060
We will definitely be watched.

450
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,060
Have you read what I sent?

451
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
I've read it.

452
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,860
If we do this from the beginning,

453
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,700
There probably aren't many people
who failed for election so many times.

454
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,460
The rules for this round of debate
are the same as the previous round.

455
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,900
As for the question, this is still a secret.

456
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,220
Okay,

457
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,060
then I'll try to guess the question
in many different ways.

458
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,420
Everyone, prepare yourself
and practice well.

459
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,500
This time we have to catch up.

460
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,060
Because Jom's popularity
is still far ahead of us.

461
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,980
It's so heavy.

462
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,100
Even the wife of a poor village leader,

463
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,500
I saw her wearing a huge gold chain.

464
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,380
This is not to mention
the whole province.

465
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,020
Hmm, the Nitithanam Party
is no slouch either.

466
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,980
I saw them running around
collecting ID cards.

467
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,300
Hey,

468
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,460
You have done this in the past,

469
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,180
right?

470
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,220
It's normal, you know.

471
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,740
The villagers get three hundred,
five hundred per head.

472
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Where will he be able to get his own way?

473
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,980
It's better to hold shit than to hold fart.

474
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,820
Like that?

475
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,620
Politics is like this.

476
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,220
The whole parliament is full of shit.

477
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,340
By the way,

478
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,900
Vee's party must have
prepared a lot of ammunition.

479
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,860
But probably won't shoot here, right?

480
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,700
Vee wouldn't have taken action
like that from the start

481
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,500
if he had done things like those people.

482
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,620
I'll resign.

483
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,060
Is this true?

484
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,820
If you can do that, it would be good.

485
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,140
Make it a blessing for me to see

486
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,140
that the current
has overcome the bullets.

487
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,980
In order to die peacefully.

488
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,020
I have to accept it.

489
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,140
That our online media is not yet targeted.

490
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,260
I have to play on the ground.

491
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,220
So I would like to
emphasize this to everyone.

492
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,620
That in this debate.

493
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,700
We have to steal the light.

494
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,300
In truth, walking like this every day.

495
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,140
I think it's better not to run in the morning.

496
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,780
Even running every day,
I still have leg pain.

497
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,820
- Ouch,
- Oh,

498
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,620
The symptoms are serious.

499
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,860
Oh wow.

500
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,660
So heavy.

501
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,540
I'll massage you.

502
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,660
Leave like this for a long time,
it can be inflamed.

503
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,300
No, no. I'm fine.

504
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,060
Sit here quickly.

505
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,020
Nevermind.

506
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,580
You, patients,
don't be stubborn with the doctor.

507
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,500
Can you drag me gentle?

508
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,500
Oh,

509
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,660
Extremely tight.

510
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,860
Oh,

511
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,060
What's up

512
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,460
Feel good?

513
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,700
It's hurt.

514
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,500
(Many days ago.)

515
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,780
Hey, why is this guy so popular?

516
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,580
It was just launched not long ago.

517
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,060
A big family member,
or maybe a mafia exterminator?

518
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,180
For sure.

519
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,180
It's not.

520
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,180
Oh,

521
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,300
A doctor in the area
that helps the villagers.

522
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,820
There is only a project to
leverage with the capitalist.

523
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,100
A son of a head village.

524
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,060
But he ended up running for a rival party.

525
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,020
Wow!

526
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,180
Why does he look so good?

527
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,100
So good that it's tempting to
dig up history.

528
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,020
(The village headman's son complains
The doctor is not transparent)

529
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,420
(Emergency room doctor
at Chalermprawet Hospital)

530
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,260
Hoy!

531
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,020
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

532
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,260
I never thought I'd see you doing
general campaign news like this.

533
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,500
Why? Is there anything exciting?

534
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,460
I'm not a journalist under you.

535
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,300
If you want to know,
stay at the end of the work.

536
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,180
Gale came,
it means there is something.

537
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,900
Keep the doctor close to you.

538
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,260
From experience in teaching students

539
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,420
For at least 40 years.

540
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:16,420
I confirm that Doctor Nong
is a new generation of politicians.

541
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,140
That has futures.

542
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,940
That is the hope of the people.

543
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,300
That I would like to
support with my heart.

544
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,180
Therefore,

545
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,020
if everyone believes in me.

546
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,460
Please vote for number 8 doctor Nong.

547
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,220
Number 8.

548
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,980
Number 8.

549
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,740
Number 8. Number 8. Number 8.

550
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,740
Number 8.

551
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,860
Number 8.

552
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,220
What is the matter?

553
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,900
There is an arrest warrant.

554
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,020
Mr. Phichit Pradubsaat.

555
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,460
You were arrested on charges of
abduction of a minor for indecent purposes.

556
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,220
You have the right to not speak.

557
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,980
Because all your words may be used
as evidence in the trial.

558
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,940
Sergeant, handcuff please.

559
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,100
Is this misunderstand?

560
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,580
No.

561
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,580
Doctor Nong, help me.

562
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,780
I didn't do anything.

563
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,380
Let me walk by myself.

564
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,380
You guys have to believe me.

565
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,540
I didn't even do anything.

566
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,740
I swear that I didn't intend to there.

567
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,140
But once the friend has arranged

568
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,500
I don't want to displease it.

569
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,620
I enter the room.

570
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,180
I remember
the picture suddenly cut off.

571
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,940
I can't remember any face.

572
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,780
The truth is, that's all there is to it.

573
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,900
I told the police,
and they told me the same thing.

574
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,180
Doctor,

575
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,260
I was set up.

576
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,660
But if you try to control yourself.

577
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,860
This kind of problem won't happen.

578
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,900
The most important thing is
children under 18 years of age.

579
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,100
And the case of abduction
of a minor cannot be settled.

580
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,300
Even more news.

581
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,060
But anyway, the party must help me.

582
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,380
Who helped bail you out?

583
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,660
We have help you.

584
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,660
Stay quiet first.

585
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,700
If we can prove that it was a set-up,
then we can talk about it.

586
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,580
As for the campaign assistant.

587
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,180
I would not bother you anymore.

588
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,540
Doctor,

589
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,020
Doctor,

590
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,860
What's up?

591
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,020
How much is the view?

592
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,100
The number of views of the news
is likely to increase even more.

593
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
But I'm not going to be an enemy to you.

594
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,540
My instinct tells me that

595
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,900
this must have been staged to
thwart your candidacy.

596
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,420
How many percent confirmed?

597
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,500
I've evidence to help your director.

598
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,060
What do you want?

599
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,020
Tomorrow's press conference,
I would like to ask.

600
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,980
Don't think for a long time.

601
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,820
Or your doctor still has other wounds?

602
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,620
Keyword is still
in the consideration process.

603
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,340
If If a reporter asks
if the director will be removed,

604
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,780
You must say that
it must be fair to all parties.

605
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,380
- But I think I want to.
- Doctor,

606
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,100
We still have to rely on him.

607
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
When choosing a questioner,
choose Gale.

608
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,900
You can remember her face, right?

609
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,020
Why?

610
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,620
Is she so scary?

611
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,780
Let's say that
if I didn't have to be a politician.

612
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,980
I was probably her fan club.

613
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,660
But when I came to play politics.

614
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,900
She is the one person I absolutely
do not want to have problems with.

615
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,380
Hello all the media.

616
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,820
I am Dr. Thanit Phonthongdee.

617
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,020
Candidate for the House of Representatives,
District One.

618
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,420
Phu Chalerm Province.

619
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,820
Wiwat Siam Party.

620
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,780
From the case that happened.

621
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,140
My campaign assistant,

622
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,180
Mr. Phichit Pradubsaat,

623
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,340
He was arrested on charges of
abducting a minor for obscene purposes.

624
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,700
At this time,
the case is still under consideration.

625
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,140
We'll just have to wait for
the outcome of the case.

626
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,180
However,

627
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,060
I and the Wiwat Siam Party.

628
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,260
Must apologize to society.

629
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,340
About what happened too.

630
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,180
We confirm that
we will fully cooperate with the police.

631
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,780
In order to find the truth to the end.

632
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,100
If Mr. Pichit has been proven to be guilty.

633
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,300
He'll definitely be
punished according to the law.

634
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,660
Do you have any questions?

635
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,140
Please,

636
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,300
There are news sources reporting that

637
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,940
Director Phichit may have been set up
by a rival party.

638
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,540
How is this news?

639
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,100
As for the investigation,
it's probably best left to the police.

640
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,900
But in any case,
we must be fair to Mr. Phichit here.

641
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,980
The case of child abuse
has not yet been proven.

642
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,060
What about the case
of purchasing sexual services?

643
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,700
Does the doctor think this is acceptable?

644
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,060
I have to say that
as long as you buy sexual services,

645
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,140
It is still an ambiguous area.

646
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,340
Well, it must be considered incorrect.

647
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,380
Therefore, if we are to get involved
or get involved in this matter,

648
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,420
Probably have to
make this matter legally.

649
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,180
If so,

650
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,540
will the party still have Director Phichit
as a campaign assistant?

651
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,180
No.

652
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,380
This matter does not need to
wait for the results of the trial.

653
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,380
We have decided to remove Mr. Phichit
from his position as campaign assistant.

654
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,220
As soon as it was known that
sexual services had been purchased

655
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,660
Today,

656
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,860
Let me add a little more.

657
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,660
As I am a doctor,

658
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,380
I've been involved
in promoting health issues

659
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,700
for personnel related to sex workers.

660
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,700
Let me be honest, right now,

661
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,020
buying and selling sexual services

662
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,820
It is still an area that is not safe.

663
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,900
Both in terms of public health.

664
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,100
In terms of human trafficking.

665
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,020
Or even receiving tribute.

666
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,940
Therefore, anyone who gets involved

667
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,860
or is involved in this matter

668
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,100
is considered to be supporting
the continuation of these problems.

669
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,500
We, the Siam Evolution Party,

670
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,660
as politicians,

671
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,020
have a duty to solve this problem,
not just support it.

672
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,700
Whether this is a fabricated answer
or a sincere answer.

673
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,740
It can be said that Dr. Nong has
sparked questions for society.

674
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,540
That the current situation
of purchasing sexual services

675
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,940
is a black business.

676
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,220
How should we deal with this problem?

677
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,460
Should this be done properly?

678
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,620
We'll continue to
follow this issue of sex workers.

679
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,940
And then definitely present it
to the audience.

680
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,140
We are politicians, Wiwat Siam Party.

681
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,380
Must solve the problem.

682
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,340
Not support.

683
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,100
How are you?
Now your doctor has a full light.

684
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,620
But you've lost me an important vote-getter.

685
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
I didn't fire him.

686
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,140
That's all.

687
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,580
You still have a lot of problems to solve.

688
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,660
But I still have to thank you.

689
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,580
That you brought Dr. Nong.

690
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,060
I haven't seen a politician
so openly attacking people in a long time.

691
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,100
I like him.

692
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,500
But not that way.
Don't miss understanding.

693
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,100
If you need anything, call me.

694
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,260
Bye.

695
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,100
Gale sent a picture.

696
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,500
See all the characters.

697
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,140
Tee, the manager, the decoy.

698
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,860
Saw Krirkpol's face too.

699
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,900
Make a press conference again?

700
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,620
Don't.

701
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,500
The director's fault is purchasing services.

702
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,140
Even if there is evidence that it was set up,
it is useless.

703
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,820
But if we bring the director back,
we will only lose points.

704
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,220
But at least it can destroy Nititham.

705
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,300
Better to save it for the right time.

706
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,580
Well, how are you?

707
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,340
The Kim Hong Market Line group
kicked me out.

708
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,700
Some complained that
Dr. Nong abandoned his friends.

709
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,060
Would like to get the director back.
He is a good teacher.

710
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,780
What?

711
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,820
If we don't do anything,
we're sure to lose.

712
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,900
There are no bullets,
and there is no trend.

713
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,060
We need both of them.

714
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,580
After the event,

715
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,540
make these people disappear
as quickly as possible.

716
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,940
Okay, brothers and sisters.

717
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,580
Today we will listen to three parties
that have been brought in the poll.

718
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,140
And today everyone is all together.

719
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,220
The first party number 8 Wiwat Siam.

720
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,780
Which is considered
a popular party at the moment.

721
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,100
And the next party number 21.
The hope.

722
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,820
It's an old local party.

723
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,380
And another party number 34,

724
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,220
Nititham.

725
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,380
The host will ask questions..

726
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,020
Each party will send an agent
to answer five minutes each.

727
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,700
Which we must use to the fullest extent.

728
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,060
Debate, both the audience
and the reporters.

729
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,460
They wait to see the curse.

730
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,580
If someone attacks us,
we must defend ourselves.

731
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,500
Politicians like us.

732
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,460
It has to be up to date, it's true.

733
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,980
But some people have dinosaur-like thinking,
like a million-year-old turtle.

734
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,820
It is said that children these days claim
the right to wear short skirts.

735
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,300
Until the child went and scolded
and pulled out my grey hair.

736
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,060
Children today have the right to dress.

737
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,540
In our society today,
not everyone is well-educated.

738
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,860
We will educate the thief
when he rapes us.

739
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,260
Will it be in time?

740
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,260
About rights over the body.

741
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,300
Our party is very respectable.

742
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,700
I and Doctor Nong
will push this matter into the council.

743
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:19,420
And give knowledge seriously,
without regard to anyone.

744
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,580
Submitting it again is easy work.

745
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,340
The old man's wound is very bad.

746
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,460
But I want to attack Doctor Nong.

747
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,260
The big stage you must learn
to sell the home team first.

748
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,940
He killed my father.

749
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,460
In your father's case,

750
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,300
the court has already ruled that
Dr. Nong is not guilty.

751
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,260
If you take take about this,

752
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,220
it is at risk of insulting the court.

753
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,660
Our goal is Jom only.

754
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,020
Do not waste time with other matters.

755
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,300
There is evidence.

756
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,060
That there are some projects
that the budget has passed.

757
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,500
But there are people who are delaying things
in order to gain votes.

758
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,100
Only himself can continue this project.

759
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,460
He is a wicked person.

760
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,060
Holding back the progress of people.

761
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,900
- Right?
- Yes.

762
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,540
Yes.

763
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,260
I don't care anything.

764
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,060
As long as people is fine.

765
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:31,020
Able to eat, sleep warmly.

766
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,540
I will continue my work.

767
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,860
You must play the role of the hero
to defeat Jom.

768
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,580
Focus on populist policies,
the fund is open to the public

769
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,820
Giving away thirty thousand per family.

770
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,420
Super populist.

771
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,420
And may not possible.

772
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,420
Jump,

773
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,540
- What's up?
- Final round,

774
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,460
Focus on the doctor all the time.

775
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,260
I usually take pictures of
whatever the boss does,

776
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,180
so don't worry.

777
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,060
I mean all the time.

778
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,460
What didWhatever the doctor does,
take a picture of it all.

779
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,340
Okay.

780
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,940
Magnate, he said.

781
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,740
Thirty thousand per house.

782
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,260
Only the hope party can do it.

783
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,300
What?

784
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,340
Open eyes and mouths fund.

785
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,820
Brothers and sisters, try to follow.

786
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,420
Open your eyes

787
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,980
and mouths.

788
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,940
It's like a person who is not fully developed,
his brain is all gone.

789
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,180
It would be better to
change the name of the fund to

790
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,620
"Bend your hands and feet".

791
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,580
This is the policy
of people who think that,

792
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,780
People must come and ask.

793
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,660
Even though in reality,
what kind of money is it?

794
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,340
It is our tax money.

795
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,300
Right?

796
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,660
Yes.

797
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,300
Being an MP, being in the government.

798
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,540
He must be responsible for working.

799
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,220
Did not come to claim.

800
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,380
Being a politician,

801
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,660
does not have to wait for
people to order.

802
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,420
No need to wait for problems.

803
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,980
It must be made the people,

804
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,020
Be difficult sick.

805
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,380
Be easily recover.

806
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,620
How is it to see a doctor?

807
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,980
Wait not so long time.

808
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,540
Every home...

809
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,020
Healthy.

810
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,420
Yes.

811
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,740
This is one of the welfare state policy.

812
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,540
That we all have already arranged.

813
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,980
Do you want it?

814
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,020
Yes.

815
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,860
I can't hear you.

816
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,260
Yes.

817
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,620
Number 8,
both the whole party and person.

818
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,740
You have to attack Tee.

819
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,220
Why?

820
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,260
Because Nititham would plan
to attack Jom.

821
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:10,460
If we always play the same role.

822
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,460
We will be included as the same as Tee.

823
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:15,540
True.

824
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,820
Damn it!

825
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,500
That's the last three minutes.

826
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,660
The plot twist came
when it was unexpected.

827
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,220
Be strong.

828
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,940
It's even better
if the fuse blows on stage.

829
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,420
Do you say it yourself?

830
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,180
Strong comes, Strong returns.

831
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,100
I won't let him attack you alone.

832
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,700
Alright everyone.

833
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,900
Regarding policy,

834
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,980
I will leave it at that.

835
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,780
But I would like to say another thing.

836
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,660
Do not believe in political parties.

837
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,780
That speak one thing.

838
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,820
Do another thing.

839
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,580
Said he would come to fight corruption.

840
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,260
But he's also corruption.

841
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,380
Use dirty methods.

842
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,260
Drugging other candidates.

843
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,260
And then do evil,

844
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,460
set up a scene to attack.

845
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,740
Target on election campaigner.

846
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,740
So evil.

847
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,780
Like not using the brain.

848
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,460
Use only power.

849
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,260
Being at this point,

850
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,940
because of his father's prestige

851
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,420
Someone is feeling hot under the collar.

852
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,740
Calm down.

853
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,300
You don't have to be hot.
I'm not talking about Tee.

854
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,180
But I talk about...

855
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:04,780
Let me go.

856
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,060
I'm in the position.

857
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,380
If this number calls again, do it.

858
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,340
Yes.

859
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,820
Don't fight. Don't fight.

860
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,820
Don't fight.

861
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,580
("Doctor Nong" the real hero)
(The chaos of the Chalerm Phu debeat event)

862
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,700
Wow,

863
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,660
Real cool boss.

864
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,060
Like the movie hero.

865
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,420
How is it? Have you seen the skill
of the country's top photographer yet?

866
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,380
See?

867
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,100
You was only taking pictures.

868
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,660
Why don't you help me?

869
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,060
I'll give you the back of my hand.

870
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,220
He did his job.

871
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,180
This picture, the genuine viral.

872
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,180
Even Gale post it.

873
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,100
Oh!

874
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,340
Now you're Vee's little brother, huh?

875
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,380
Let's talk about work.

876
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,900
The backlash has now been reversed.

877
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,020
Because those who used to criticize Dr. Nong for not loving their own people are now...

878
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,220
U -turn back.

879
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,620
And the clip interview of the doctor.
Now, go to ten million views.

880
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,580
Oh, a million?

881
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:55,980
You play big again.

882
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,060
This one can be influence.

883
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,940
Prepare to deal with the fan club.

884
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:00,780
Really.

885
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,220
Yeah, like this,
you can arrange the fan meeting.

886
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,700
- Good.
- What a good thing? I'm kidding.

887
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,540
Serious doctor.

888
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,260
You've a lot to prepare.

889
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,820
I will kee you in the trend
until the election day.

890
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,380
We have to go to the national campaign.

891
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,020
Go.

892
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,500
How do you look after your fans?

893
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,500
To let go to chase other people like this.

894
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,260
I don't know who they are.

895
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,340
Don't blame me.

896
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,900
Don't blame?

897
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,700
The supporters are not that much.

898
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,300
But you get up and punch him.

899
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,420
So what?

900
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,220
The party kicked you out.

901
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:55,380
Good.

902
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,460
Then refund my money too.

903
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,540
Do you know how much money
the party has spent on you?

904
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,340
It's already way
more than your donation.

905
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,060
From now on, do whatever you want.

906
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,500
We're not involved.

907
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,620
Okay.

908
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,820
If we're not the same team.

909
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,380
I don't have to respect you anymore.

910
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,740
Damn.

911
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,860
Are you interested in
making a special deal?

912
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,420
I really give you a credit.

913
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,460
From the rising star MP candidate.

914
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,540
Towards a new generation of politicians.

915
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,860
And the next step is
the party representative.

916
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,900
Enter the big debate

917
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:56,980
You won't have fun

918
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,740
because he will humiliate you
on the stage.

919
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,100
Why do you know him so well?

920
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,820
- My ex -girlfriend.
- Huh?

921
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,540
Sister Tee has already given
a big press conference to

922
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,260
our Siam Voice.

923
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,260
If you can't do it,

924
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,380
Jet is on standby, he has a backup plan
waiting to do it for you.

925
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,780
It's just enough.

926
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,940
I think I have a way
to chase the trend back.

927
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,100
Really?
