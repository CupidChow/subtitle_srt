1
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,960
- Where are you going?
- New doctor fate.

2
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,380
Go on duty for many days.

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,380
Leave Vee to make a policy.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,100
In case there will be some hope.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,420
He hasn't decided yet.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,564
Better to leave the policy with the first party.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,780
No,

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,860
I don't want you for the party.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,860
But I want you to do it for me.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,680
Dad,

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,820
I decided

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,020
I will be the MP.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,780
Hey,

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,660
If you can't do it.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,700
How do you take responsibility?

16
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:55,980
You can remove me from the party list.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,380
Shoddy.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,280
Do you know?

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,520
When I pulled people from the northeast.

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,540
I promise what the party is.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,440
If I can't do it,

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,240
- I will resign.
- But I remember that he called to talk to me first.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,860
You just show up.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,380
But it's also my credit.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,620
If I can't do it, I'll lose too.

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,400
What did you say?

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,260
Sounds good.

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,700
If you can't do it,

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,860
You should resign.

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,860
And if you want to be a stylish.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,200
Being a hairdresser or makeup artist.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,900
Go.

33
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,500
Just go.

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,900
What's up?

35
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,540
I can believe you, right?

36
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,580
Vee,

37
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,620
Hello,

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,580
Take a seat first.

39
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:31,420
Nevermind. I'd rather sit outside.

40
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,960
You don't have to wait outside.

41
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,180
We finished talking and sitting together.

42
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,020
Sit down first.

43
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,640
Oh, this person.

44
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,840
Your son.

45
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,660
More handsome than you.

46
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,622
Uh, Vee, this is Mr. Krirk.

47
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:04,660
Previous MP for Sakon Nakhon

48
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:06,860
Nititham Party.

49
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,266
- Hello,
- Hi,

50
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,500
Be easy.

51
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:17,380
And how do you know Nong?

52
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,060
We are friends.

53
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,900
Wow.

54
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:25,900
You didn't tell me that you had a friend
who was the son of a former prime minister.

55
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,933
Like this, MPs in the old country
would probably not have meaning anymore.

56
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,620
Really?

57
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,820
Not like that

58
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,620
Can I talk to Doctor Nong privately?

59
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,980
Okay.

60
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,460
I just said that we are close friends.

61
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,380
Let's talk here.

62
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:56,260
Doctor,

63
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,060
Haven't signed the application yet?

64
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,660
Um.

65
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,880
So, can I give some proposals to the doctor and you?

66
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,220
Don't misunderstand.

67
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:13,740
I didn't submit any proposals.

68
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,260
People in this house,
they understand each other like ancient gangster.

69
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,580
The new generation probably doesn't know.

70
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,100
Is it?

71
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Now, we work like a professional.

72
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,020
You don't have to be a gangster.

73
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:33,020
Sorry,

74
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,420
People in this house are gangster.

75
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,860
The gangster's heart.

76
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,260
Uh ...

77
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,004
Anyway, I have to thank you very much for honoring me and Nong.

78
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,840
But I would like to contact him first.

79
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,746
In that case, I'll put it on hold for now.

80
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
In case of changing your mind.

81
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,808
However, the Wiwat Siam Party is welcome.

82
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:18,020
Please excuse me.

83
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,460
Hello,

84
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,660
Hello,

85
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:49,340
You really have to go?

86
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,780
Umm.

87
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,720
Still didn't want to hurry back that much.

88
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,140
But don't worry.

89
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,620
I won't leave the work here.

90
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,620
But may be a little difficult.

91
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:07,220
Why?

92
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,860
I don't know how much that MP will open the way.

93
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,620
Well...

94
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,986
If the boss has become a MP, it's not difficult anymore.

95
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,260
It'll be great.

96
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:28,820
I'm all confused.

97
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,740
Hmm, understand.

98
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,700
Hey, I'm not that stupid.

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,260
Meaning that if the boss is okay

100
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,540
But that party is not okay.

101
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,740
He didn't let you and Vee come to create work.

102
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,020
Right?

103
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,980
Very good.

104
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,426
I played some fighting games.

105
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,980
Sigh!

106
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,980
I'm worried about the doctor.

107
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:01,520
If I go with them,
I don't know if I'll be able to deal with anyone.

108
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,320
He might even got some trouble.

109
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:11,500
Holy shit.

110
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,080
Oh, you look great.

111
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,520
Entering the party on the first day is really lucky.

112
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,000
I will take you to welcome party.

113
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,020
Get to know our friends.

114
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,820
I don't want to go.

115
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,660
Ning has not left the ICU yet.

116
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,460
I don't have any feeling.

117
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,020
Superb.

118
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,540
This is the kind of determined person I like.

119
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:49,100
Go with a straight face like this.

120
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,860
You don't have to be fun.

121
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,100
Go to see other people.

122
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,700
I think better not.

123
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,460
It's just a waste of time.

124
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,500
Let's do this.

125
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,380
I'll go instead.

126
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,820
You can't.

127
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,180
I'll tell you one thing.

128
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,980
For a job like ours,
if we do something good, people must see it.

129
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,240
I know you're serious.

130
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,520
But doing the gilding of monks like this.

131
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,120
It won't work.

132
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
What is the gilding?

133
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,500
I haven't finished the application yet.

134
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,460
You've paid five million.

135
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,860
This big work.

136
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,420
If you don't come to take the credit.

137
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,700
Be careful of others.

138
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,700
Five million.

139
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,940
Wait a moment.

140
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Five million?

141
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,500
Five million, where did it come from?

142
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,460
Okay.

143
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,100
Haven't you told your father?

144
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,060
Oh,

145
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,060
Well...

146
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,120
Doctor Nong went to negotiate the war with Wichai.

147
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,540
And asked him to transfer money to the party for five million.

148
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:03,460
That's not possible.

149
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,180
It's fine. I understand.

150
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,111
No, no, he hates Wichai.

151
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,740
Even if we hate each other, we can still make up.

152
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,740
These days,
people don't kill each other like they did in my day.

153
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,900
Right?

154
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,800
People,

155
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,657
You must know how to ease off.

156
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,128
Like this.

157
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,580
I told you so.

158
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,900
What is it?

159
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,480
(2 days ago)

160
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,980
Sigh, I'm worried about the doctor.

161
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:06,900
Being with them, how can he work.

162
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,740
He might even got some trouble.

163
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,500
Not that much?

164
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,020
Are you sure?

165
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:30,500
I remember.

166
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
Don't stress.

167
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,620
Wow,

168
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,900
Not stressed?

169
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,060
How can I?

170
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,260
This is a bid deal.

171
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,780
If the boss knows,

172
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,260
I was hit by him.

173
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,528
We're the same team.

174
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,860
It's better not being hit.

175
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:58,880
You can still change your mind now.

176
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,960
If changing my mind now,

177
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:05,920
How do you know how sincere the party is with your boss?

178
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
What do you think?

179
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,500
Is there any better idea?

180
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,380
Holy shit.

181
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,340
That's it.

182
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,982
He now has a big back.

183
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,808
If you don't accept the proposal.

184
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,462
You can prepare to close the factory.

185
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,740
Well...

186
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,275
What do the doctor want?

187
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,860
Donate to Nititham.

188
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,340
Five million.

189
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:07,795
And my boss will immediately
stop messing with your factory.

190
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,040
Yes!

191
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,764
What did you do?

192
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,471
You,

193
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:19,960
And you.

194
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,660
You're really bad.

195
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,460
You go back.

196
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,102
- At least we come to confess.
- You too.

197
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,500
Don't you stop yet?

198
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,940
It's this much.

199
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,540
I can't stop.

200
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
You're the same.

201
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,060
If you want to do this for Ning.

202
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,180
- Don't talk about my sister.
- I can't.

203
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,460
Don't forget.

204
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,880
- She left the hope ...
- I said don't talk about my sister.

205
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,660
Yes,

206
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,711
Then why would you run for MPs?

207
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,100
I'm sorry to do this.

208
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,980
Think about that kind of person,
will it really fight with you?

209
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,020
It's my business.

210
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:11,260
You didn't want to enter that party from the beginning.

211
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,000
And you knew that people like that.

212
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,702
The farthest they can take you
is just winning the election. So what?

213
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,100
More importantly.

214
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,940
Important to Dr. Ning.

215
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,800
You haven't seen any way, right?

216
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,860
- Right?
- Yes.

217
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:32,140
I don't trust the guys.

218
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,946
But I don't trust you.

219
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,020
You don't believe me, it's fine.

220
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:41,940
But do you trust yourself?

221
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,680
Seriously,

222
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:49,560
When you came out from there.
Not relieved at all?

223
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:55,140
You guys are really the same.

224
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,608
No, I dare to speak.

225
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,300
Even if I have to betray you for a hundred million,
I won't do it.

226
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,100
Because you're worth more than that.

227
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,100
And what we will do together,

228
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,100
- It can't be valued.
- I'm serious.

229
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,120
Is my face look very stupid?

230
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,340
On the other hand.

231
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,000
I think people that are not selfish like you.

232
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,240
It's the most difficult.
You won't accept any benefits.

233
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,520
Nor the reputation.

234
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,620
So I have to be honest like this.

235
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,300
Shit!

236
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,440
You're a complete asshole to me,
and then you come and say you're sincere.

237
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,300
I...

238
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
Must be bad.

239
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,617
- Because you are going to choose a way that is worse.
- You won't accept this, will you?

240
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,460
Yes.

241
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
You're the same.

242
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,580
We will do a big deal.

243
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Don't pay attention to my little trick.

244
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:49,980
Alright.

245
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,540
I will consider to do it for my sister.

246
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,460
But don't lie again.

247
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,900
Don't do anything behind me again.

248
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,500
I don't like.

249
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,180
Yes!

250
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:12,180
If there is again,

251
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:14,500
You can come back to punch at any time.

252
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,740
I will definitely do it.

253
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,260
Jump,

254
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,320
Go to make a wound.

255
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,980
Excuse me, dad

256
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,900
And I'll buy souvenirs.

257
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,680
- Um.
- Dad,

258
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:15,260
Will you not say anything?

259
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,060
You can curse me.

260
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,340
I cursed and will you listen to me?

261
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,860
You go live with Mr. Vee. What can I do to stop you?

262
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,422
But you can prepare your mind
that you will encounter a lot of bad things.

263
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,180
Umm.

264
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,180
Dad, don't worry

265
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,260
I can take care of myself.

266
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,860
Okay.

267
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,340
Since we can't stop you,

268
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,940
I don't know what to say. Come sit next to me.

269
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,320
Sit down.

270
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,860
What else?

271
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,580
Sit on the floor.

272
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,860
- Huh?
- Sit on the floor.

273
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,300
Okay.

274
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Hand.

275
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,660
Anyway, it cannot be forbidden.

276
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,020
I will wish to bless before going.

277
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,973
Sathu Phaya Tan,

278
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,337
Please protect and preserve my children. Sa-Tu.

279
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,791
I'll bless you.

280
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,120
May you be happy and may good karma come to you.

281
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:04,380
May you have physical strength and
nothing can change your child's happiness.

282
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,853
I wish you a long life for a thousand years.

283
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:16,577
Be famous and be talked about forever.

284
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:21,297
Only laughter.

285
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,097
May you have a life surrounded by people and never be lonely.

286
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:33,662
No one came to be offended.

287
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:39,860
There is no illness.

288
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,480
Sa-Tu, Sa-Tu, Sa-Tu.

289
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,040
Okay.

290
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,580
I wishe...

291
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,460
For my son.

292
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:57,580
Victory over all the demons.

293
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,582
Be happy as you wish.

294
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,546
To be like the angels down.

295
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,260
My son,

296
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,900
Good luck.

297
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:27,540
I'll go.

298
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,480
- Hey,
- Let me go.

299
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,900
- Take care.
- Yeah.

300
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:35,780
See you.

301
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:52,940
Ning,

302
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,220
I promise that...

303
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,380
There will be no doctor.

304
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,780
Who will have to be like this.

305
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,220
Hurry and wake up.

306
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Wake up to see my success together.

307
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,300
Please support me.

308
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:47,540
This,

309
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,020
Apartment that the party rents for candidates.

310
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,340
Wait a minute.

311
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:58,740
Arrived and changed the shoes here.

312
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
Do I have to change too?

313
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,900
The bedroom is here, right?

314
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,300
Feel free to do as you please.

315
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,300
This is now your house.

316
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,680
Oh!

317
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,060
So comfortable.

318
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,900
Go take a shower first.

319
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,460
Alright!

320
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,540
You said this is my home.

321
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,540
Actually,

322
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,820
It's not quite yet.

323
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,422
Must wait for the party to approve you as a candidate first.

324
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,500
Don't think too much.

325
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,620
Just interviewing with my father is OK.

326
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,980
I didn't think too much.

327
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,620
Just thinking about what to eat.

328
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,300
Why?

329
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,020
This eating is important.

330
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,780
And I haven't visit Bangkok for a long time.

331
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,940
I don't know if the shop I like this is open or not.

332
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,502
And why didn't you tell me first?

333
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,700
I'll take you to see it.

334
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,460
Bangkok is horribly congested.

335
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,460
It took me a while to get here.

336
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,220
My ass is completely numb.

337
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,460
If Jump had come along, he would have driven to buy it.

338
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,660
You can use delivery app?

339
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,860
Well...

340
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,520
What would you like to eat?

341
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,900
When will Jump and Ni come?

342
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:29,220
Really?

343
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,420
If you know how to collect your work.

344
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Others don't have to run to make a profile for you.

345
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,060
Bangkok is hot.

346
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,020
Better take a shower.

347
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:56,620
Stop.

348
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,540
Put in the basket in the bathroom.

349
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,860
Order as a mother.

350
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,180
Vee,

351
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,100
Come here.

352
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,140
Vee,

353
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,960
Sigh!

354
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,840
Why don't you wear clothes first?

355
00:27:58,204 --> 00:27:59,940
What if the towel comes off?

356
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,380
Do you think I want to see it?

357
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,820
How can I get out? It's tied so tightly.

358
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,380
Do you see?

359
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:13,300
Turn to see.

360
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,220
Is it loose?

361
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,580
Hey!

362
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,740
You intend to show?

363
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,220
You said you wouldn't fall off.

364
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,860
Why do I intend to show?

365
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,140
If I wanted to show off,
I would have pulled it out and shown it to you.

366
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,820
Then why would you call me in?

367
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,060
What kind of bottles these are, they're all over the place.

368
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,780
Have you put it on yet?

369
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,900
Yes, I did.

370
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,980
Turned to see.

371
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,900
See.

372
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,140
Do you see?

373
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:02,580
What is it?

374
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,020
This hand washing soap.

375
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,048
Hand cream, face foam, hair oil, serum, toner.

376
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,380
Wait a moment.

377
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,340
Saying like this, who can remember?

378
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,860
Come back first.

379
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,000
(Mr. Vee and the doctor have arrived at the condo.)

380
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,860
Hello,

381
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,100
Vee really found candidate.

382
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:55,620
No, but I...

383
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,740
I'm not serious.

384
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,328
But I think the judges like you have to do something.

385
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,586
Because if he is easy to pass like this.

386
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,020
Then where will your people go?

387
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,888
Administrative law, basic laws for...

388
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,364
Hey, will you let me read it all?

389
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,840
Seriously?

390
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,220
Can I read it tomorrow?

391
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,900
Just seeing it makes me discouraged.

392
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,780
Doctor,

393
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,260
Don't be stubborn.

394
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
Ouch!

395
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,142
Or else there is something else to do? I'm lazy.

396
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
Let's do the interview.

397
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,420
Yes,

398
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,920
Seriously.

399
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,740
Come on.

400
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,660
Do you have a girlfriend now?

401
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,260
Have you ever seen?

402
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,380
Don't bother.

403
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,460
Have you ever had sex with anyone?

404
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,248
- Which type or gender?
- Wait.

405
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,900
Is this a personal?

406
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,420
It's a personal matter like this
that has destroyed a lot of politicians

407
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,860
I have to know everything.

408
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,900
In order to be careful.

409
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,320
Must be that much?

410
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,540
Okay.

411
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,090
I used to have two girlfriends.

412
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,260
First person at high school.

413
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,300
The other person was at the university.

414
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,220
But since graduating

415
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:47,180
I never have anyone.

416
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,060
I do it myself.

417
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,740
Bought anyone?

418
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,420
Seriously?

419
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,820
In case you want it.

420
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,500
No.

421
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,060
I don't believe you.

422
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,780
I'm not a liar like you.

423
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,260
I don't like lying.

424
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,360
I just don't like to lose.

425
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,137
And if you don't want to lose, then stop playing.

426
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,540
And you?

427
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,740
Do you have a sweetheart?

428
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,500
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

429
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,140
Have you ever slept with anyone?

430
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,820
What kind do you like?

431
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,100
I have to be the one to ask.

432
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,900
- Not an answering person.
- Not fair.

433
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,800
Asked alone, would it be good?

434
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,020
Or you don't dare to answer.

435
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,900
Okay.

436
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,220
I used to have three girlfriends.

437
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,580
All men.

438
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,911
Ever a night stand with foreigners but not like it.

439
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,900
I like older man.

440
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,500
Good -looking.

441
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,220
Good shape.

442
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,820
Not limited career.

443
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:02,900
But must be good.

444
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,120
Sincere.

445
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,093
But if secretly has a small gentle corner.

446
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,740
It would be perfect.

447
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,380
Yeah.

448
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,300
Enough.

449
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,826
Ask a little, answer a lot.

450
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,951
- Here it is. I'll tell you everything. I won't lie.
- Hmm.

451
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,860
I won't lie, and you won't be stubborn.

452
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,100
Let's exchange.

453
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,340
Okay?

454
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,020
Okay.

455
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,100
What are you going to say next?

456
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,860
I will follow all the time.

457
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,220
Okay.

458
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,260
I don't have to be fashionable.

459
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,484
The same way, I am cool.

460
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,420
It's not just the image.

461
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,420
But dressing,

462
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:57,300
It is communication.

463
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,980
What do you communicate?

464
00:34:00,177 --> 00:34:02,660
I saw any politicians in the area.

465
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,420
Only put on a jacket.

466
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:07,340
That!

467
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,822
Do you want to be like those?

468
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,928
If you say that you don't want to be like the old politicians,

469
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,180
You have to dress up differently.

470
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,275
Communicate.

471
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,417
Well, what kind of communication would you like?

472
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,420
Um... I think.

473
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:34,213
Should we start from here if we still can't think of anything good?

474
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,580
Hey, you.

475
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,700
I'm ready.

476
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,860
Doctor.

477
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:55,380
Better fold the sleeves.

478
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,300
Look more comfortable.

479
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,500
Really?

480
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:00,940
Okay.

481
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,860
Which room to interview?

482
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,260
Wait a minute.

483
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,900
Better fold like this.

484
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:17,980
Relax.

485
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,900
Ready to work.

486
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,780
But still formally.

487
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,340
It's complex.

488
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,860
Ah, it's okay.

489
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,660
I can do it.

490
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,460
Relax.

491
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,660
And official.

492
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,768
Complicated. Is this okay?

493
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,740
Yes,

494
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,180
Go.

495
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,460
Oh, hello, doctor.

496
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,300
We finally met.

497
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,060
Hello,

498
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,260
Nice to meet you.

499
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,980
Nice to meet you too.

500
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,897
Whenever you're ready, let's go.

501
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,780
Go.

502
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,620
What's up?

503
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,380
Yes,

504
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,260
Can you remember?

505
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,075
As I said, interviewed only my father.

506
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,608
The party committee has come together.

507
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,220
This doctor is the hope of our party.

508
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,964
The first button of the Young Siam Project

509
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,240
How can you come to two people?

510
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,880
Are you okay with this?

511
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,380
Yes, sir.

512
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,300
I've seen that you have always liked to crash and burn.

513
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,780
This kind of personality is a problem.

514
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,500
People will see it aggressive.

515
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,180
Unable to control the mood.

516
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,180
Right?

517
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,600
Normally, I am very hard only for those who should be hit.

518
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,460
Have you ever done anything?

519
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,271
I just assume that in case you found this

520
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,540
What will you do?

521
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,466
I would not respond.

522
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,093
Because I know that

523
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:42,860
The side the keep speaking

524
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,540
It's not me.

525
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:46,900
As a doctor,

526
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,740
I would like to say that
the policy to reduce the work hours of the doctor,

527
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,980
it can't be done.

528
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,620
I think this matter, if we have a suitable budget.

529
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,200
Including effective management.

530
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,140
For example, if we dare to punish doctors
who are forced to sell shifts or pass shifts

531
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,700
We can do it.

532
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,911
It will force all doctors to move to the private sector.

533
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:12,620
This is about the budget for medical care.

534
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,195
Even though the people are still struggling with their livelihoods.

535
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,780
But I think differently.

536
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,300
If the people are healthy.

537
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,900
They will have energy to make a living.

538
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,700
It is about people.

539
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,053
You come to the MPs, with personal matters.

540
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:29,740
To help your sister.

541
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,180
People who know the story about
what you just explained are called lies.

542
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,340
Even if your sister died in a car accident,

543
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,180
it would only be news for a week.
Then people would forget. So what?

544
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,875
Who cares? Who will vote for you?

545
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,860
There was only a little over a month to campaign,
and a new person like you.

546
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,231
What can you use to defeat the big boss of the big house?

547
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,580
I would like to talk personally.

548
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,980
I like the intention of you.

549
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,684
But the policy is to make the villagers pleasing.

550
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,400
Regarding... reducing the working hours of doctors.

551
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:17,300
It must also tell the villagers what they will get in a concrete way.

552
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,140
I understand.

553
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:26,100
What do you think about politics right now?

554
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,800
I think must be reformed.

555
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,580
What about politicians?

556
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,000
The kind that sits across from the doctor.

557
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,540
Well ...

558
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:47,220
May need to be adjusted to the era.

559
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,540
Why do I have to change?

560
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,140
Since we are the ones who define the era.

561
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,000
But sometimes you can't determine everything.

562
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,115
I can determine your future.

563
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,413
It's you who has to adjust to me.

564
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,260
I understand you.

565
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,928
But I myself have my ideology.

566
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,580
If you don't like it.

567
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,700
I just have to go.

568
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,420
You still don't understand.

569
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,355
Whether you are here or not.

570
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,951
I can determine your life.

571
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,220
Including your family.

572
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,500
You are threatening me.

573
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,140
Nope.

574
00:40:40,577 --> 00:40:47,100
I just want to tell you about the game you're about to play,
how it's played.

575
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,940
If you've to sign off on a mining concession
that causes pollution and deaths,

576
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,026
In exchange for increasing the doctors.

577
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,180
Will you agree to sign?

578
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,900
No.

579
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,140
Good.

580
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,860
So strong.

581
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,440
Otherwise,

582
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,940
Let me add some conditions.

583
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,180
If you don't sign,

584
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,586
Your father will be hit by a big case.

585
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,980
As for your sister,

586
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,340
There will be people who come to her in a rather impolite manner.

587
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,780
And still have close relatives close friend...

588
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,740
Well, I think.

589
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,100
Better stop first.

590
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,700
OK, will you agree to sign yet?

591
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,137
Regarding your policy, I haven't let it pass yet.

592
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,300
You and Vee go back to fix it.

593
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,324
As for the matter, whether to sign or not to sign.

594
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,180
Think about it carefully.

595
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,780
I will wait for the answer.

596
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,260
Oh,

597
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,420
The story that I said a moment ago.

598
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,180
Doesn't have to think too much.

599
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,340
It's just a fictional story.

600
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,980
These glass,

601
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:52,740
If they served in any glass, then drink that glass.

602
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,020
Water, white wine.

603
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,780
Red wine, champagne.

604
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,780
Can I have a liquor?

605
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,860
I want it hard now.

606
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,900
This knife is a butter knife.

607
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,140
It will be served first.

608
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,540
And you,

609
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,260
Must unfold the napkin.

610
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,220
Place on the lap like this.

611
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,500
Um,

612
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,140
Pay attention.

613
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,040
We will have to go back to work about policies again.

614
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,320
- You father...
- So shit, right?

615
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,080
I'm about to say he's bad.

616
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,060
But you can take that word.

617
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
So clear.

618
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,980
Any word.

619
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,020
I have listened to it.

620
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,380
I used to think.

621
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,620
What kind of people do I? are to be?

622
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,480
I must be a person like this.

623
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,440
To be in politics field.

624
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,640
Or...

625
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,740
It's a politics.

626
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,440
That makes people become like this.

627
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,860
So confused.

628
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,520
Well...

629
00:44:24,053 --> 00:44:25,060
My mom,

630
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,680
And Jet's mother, they don't like each other.

631
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,260
So what does that have to do with anything?

632
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,580
It's a soap opera.

633
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,600
Will you listen?

634
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,300
Yes!

635
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,040
Go ahead.

636
00:44:44,755 --> 00:44:46,540
This is my mom favorite restaurant.

637
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,342
My parents brought me when I was a child.

638
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,800
But there was one year.

639
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,140
Jet's mom would like to buy this restaurant.

640
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,180
My father had to go to deal with the same partner.

641
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,700
No one agreed to sell.

642
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,900
Then use the money to solve the problem as usual.

643
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,924
Don't you tell your father to buy this restaurant?

644
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,140
It's end.

645
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,700
If he buy it.

646
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,740
It became his restaurant.

647
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,964
Not where my mother would be comfortable.

648
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,457
It takes a lot of effort to get a deal done with each partner.

649
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,257
My father was investigated and almost lost his ministerial position.

650
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,100
He deserve it?

651
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,120
Doing that much.

652
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,940
So this restaurant is still be here.

653
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,213
And Jet's mom didn't dare to argue with my mother anymore.

654
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,060
If in exchange for not having a headache.

655
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,460
About wives fighting for almost twenty years.

656
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,100
It's worth.

657
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,500
My father is not a good person.

658
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,860
But not a bad father.

659
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,780
He just played this game a little too good.

660
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,880
Too good?

661
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,035
Sigh, I'm so hated this game.

662
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,100
So I invited you.

663
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,660
To change it together.

664
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:30,660
Good.

665
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,431
Let this game have some bug like us.

666
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,740
Will get a little fun.

667
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,100
Will wade through.

668
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,888
If talking about the bugs of the political industry,
what do you think?

669
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,420
Want to look seriously.

670
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,420
But must not be very formal.

671
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,324
Because I want people to easily access.

672
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,555
Do we better start thinking from his identity?

673
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,008
The character or his work style is like this.

674
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,580
Umm.

675
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,080
Then try this one. I think this one will work.

676
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,782
- Many doctors, patients worried free.
- Not good.

677
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,460
Still focusing on the doctor.

678
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,644
Good health people.

679
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,340
The doctor is effective.

680
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,820
Effective.

681
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,300
Difficult words.

682
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,533
He is a straightforward and honest person.

683
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,980
Not indirectly.

684
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:36,060
Dust like this makes people in Bangkok get sick easily
and have a hard time getting better.

685
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,700
This keyword is good. It's hard to get sick, but easy to get well.

686
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,740
But I think it's too good to be true.

687
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,320
I want to let the doctors know that they have to do their job.

688
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,100
Not letting people get better by themselves.

689
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,480
He is serious and workaholic.

690
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,733
A little strong, a little harsh.

691
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,340
What's wrong?

692
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,660
Want to pee?

693
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,340
Go pee.

694
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,500
The elevator is still waiting for a long time,
and there's a traffic jam too.

695
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,680
If you hold it in, it will get inflamed.

696
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,140
Okay.

697
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:16,780
The wait to see a doctor is not long.

698
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:18,620
Write it down.

699
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,860
Okay?

700
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,746
But he's secretly warm and caring.

701
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,980
And can rely on.

702
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,293
Now it should be okay.

703
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,260
Only your father's question.

704
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,380
The most troubling.

705
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,340
Seriously,

706
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,740
Being a doctor.

707
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,426
You should have passed more difficult decisions.

708
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,791
Do you want to listening to?

709
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,462
The story that Tee said I killed his father?

710
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,300
At that time,

711
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,620
I am a doctor.

712
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,860
In the emergency room alone.

713
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,928
Tee's father, Mr. Tong.

714
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,820
There was a shooting incident with my father.

715
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,284
And both of them was sent to the hospital at the same time.

716
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,220
It was very fast.

717
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,700
Didn't have time to think or decide.

718
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,817
Just need to assess who has a better chance
of survival and treat that person first.

719
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,740
Do you know what is funny?

720
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,755
My father is survive, but Mr. Tong, Tee's father?

721
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,420
He die in my hand.

722
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,733
So he think you deliberately make his father die.

723
00:50:14,506 --> 00:50:15,140
Right?

724
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,724
Now, if I would say that I chose correctly.

725
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,300
It's not, right?

726
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,820
But you made a good choice.

727
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,380
And do you know?

728
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,300
That politicians like us,
when we have to answer difficult questions.

729
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,860
We look for good answers.

730
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,340
Not the correct answer.

731
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,260
Hard to get sick, easy to recover.

732
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,220
The wait to see a doctor is not long.

733
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,060
Every home is healthy.

734
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,782
Put the story that you want to do, realistically.

735
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:16,380
Although the doctor quota may not be increased in the end,
the service system has been improved instead.

736
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,660
Considered not breaking the contract.

737
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,740
But I think it's too long.

738
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,600
Let's just say that the policy is for every home to be healthy.

739
00:51:30,106 --> 00:51:33,300
The rest is the concept, can continue when giving the speech.

740
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,640
Yes.

741
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,620
As for the other thing.

742
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,580
Can you think?

743
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:48,140
That if I order you to sign off on a project that is against the people.

744
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,020
Will you do it?

745
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,320
I don't do it.

746
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,900
Don't forget the conditions regarding your father and sister.
They still exist.

747
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,260
I didn't forget.

748
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,700
But I won't do it.

749
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,440
I mean, I use medical principles.

750
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,660
Come in to help decide.

751
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,780
Well...

752
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,417
When the crisis occurs or emergency.

753
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,780
Doctors like us.

754
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,168
There are two criteria for deciding who to help first.

755
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:34,408
First, doctors must choose to help those
who have a higher chance of survival first.

756
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,580
Which if I signed.

757
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,900
What will happen?

758
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,860
People do not survive.

759
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,620
I myself, as a politician, did not survive either.

760
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,060
I will be inspected.

761
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,100
And you will be using this weakness as a bargaining
chip in future matters.

762
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,420
Therefore, I didn't sign.

763
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,820
There are definitely more people survive.

764
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,100
The second part.

765
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:06,620
The doctor must treat people
who are more beneficial to the public.

766
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,500
This is even easier.

767
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,380
Because in this equation.

768
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,300
You probably already know.

769
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,420
People are important.

770
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:19,980
And more beneficial to the public.

771
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,000
That's all.

772
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,740
It's a good answer.

773
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,740
Welcome to Wiwat Siam Party.

774
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,260
I will keep an eye on you.

775
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,520
Thank you.

776
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,940
I can play Likay now.

777
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,900
If you're going to take photos for a campaign,
you have to look handsome.

778
00:54:12,915 --> 00:54:15,980
There are three people in the whole team,
you've to be outstanding.

779
00:54:18,097 --> 00:54:20,180
Where did the other two go?

780
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,020
It's not yet time for my appointment.

781
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,137
I have an appointed you to check my appearance first.

782
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:28,060
If passing, will follow this way.

783
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,020
What are you checking?

784
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,000
This,

785
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,700
Oh!

786
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,151
So cool.

787
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,060
So overact.

788
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,460
I'm not.

789
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,540
You're really handsome.

790
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,620
So handsome.

791
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,088
With a handsome face like that,
I think you should become prime minister.

792
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:18,740
You're a pain in the ass.

793
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,540
He's right.

794
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,380
Why are you criticizing him?

795
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,420
This is just the first outfit.

796
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,093
- There are still many.
- Huh?

797
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,380
Mr. Vee,

798
00:55:35,644 --> 00:55:37,940
I have something to inform you.

799
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,940
What's wrong?

800
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,060
Mr. Pong, who is in District 3.

801
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,580
He've withdrawn.

802
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:52,000
Now he has already resigned from our party.

803
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,780
Already entered to Nititham Party.

804
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,100
Oh!

805
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:01,840
So shit.

806
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,400
So, will we be able to find someone to replace him in time?

807
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,860
Don't tell me that.

808
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,940
You've got a deal as well?

809
00:56:14,506 --> 00:56:17,140
Failing every election like me.

810
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,620
They don't want me.

811
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,460
If I know about this faster,

812
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,860
I'll invited Nat.

813
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,140
You have someone?

814
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,420
This guy is my junior.

815
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,220
Since university, whenever I have a club or camp,
he always comes to help.

816
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,420
People called him, Dr. Nong's right hand.

817
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,340
So you call him now.

818
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,100
Should I do it?

819
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,300
There will be another story.

820
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,340
Tee?

821
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,740
I will do my best.

822
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,084
It's that old man, I'll choose him.

823
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:27,560
He paid a lot.

824
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:31,380
The wife of the vote-getter was also seen wearing a huge gold chain.

825
00:57:32,284 --> 00:57:34,260
Nititham is probably a trend,

826
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,860
but what I'm worried about is that it
will be played behind people's backs.

827
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,240
In this debate, we must be shine.

828
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,580
Strong comes, strong returns.
