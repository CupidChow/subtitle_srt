1
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,540
Supa told me that Dr. Nong just arrived in Phu Chaloem.

2
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,900
He’s in the office, packing up.

3
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,220
I screwed up.

4
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,340
I should’ve had the guts to tell them from the start.

5
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,500
Beating yourself up won’t help now.

6
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,060
Go bring the doc back.

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,740
He’s not coming back.

8
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,540
You’re giving up just like that?

9
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,060
If you look into his eyes, then you’d know.

10
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,180
Dr. Nong might’ve been angry at that moment, but he wasn’t angry at you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,780
He’s probably mad at whoever cut the deal with Phasakorn

12
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,700
Which you still haven’t owned up to,
have you?

13
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,820
You already knew, didn’t you?

14
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,260
All I knew was that my father
wanted to make you minister.

15
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,060
But I only found out about
dropping the policy right in that meeting.

16
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,340
Can you calm down for a second?

17
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,740
And you still want me to calm down?

18
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,860
I think once he cools off,
he might hear you out.

19
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,100
Think he’ll cool off in time to be sworn in?

20
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,100
He won’t even look me in the eye right now,

21
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,900
there’s no chance of talking.

22
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,020
Or use the same tactic to convince him?

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,600
Talk ideals, play to his ego like,

24
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,340
“If it’s not you, Doc,
no one can pull this off.”

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,580
Honestly,

26
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,180
you two could stop
being politicians for a minute.

27
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,420
I don’t know how messy this is,

28
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,260
but if someone knows they were wrong,

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,140
they should apologize.

30
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,100
That’s it.

31
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,100
No prep, no plan.

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,660
Just talk like you mean it.

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,140
I think Jump’s right.

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,740
you go bring the doc back.

35
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,940
I’ll buy us some time on this end.

36
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,180
You think running the Interior Ministry
means you can do whatever you want?

37
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,540
If it were that easy,

38
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,060
why would I need to grovel to that bastard?

39
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,260
I don’t see what the big deal is.

40
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,940
And Uncle Wut’s already fine with the deal.

41
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,220
You don’t know him,
he’s tricky as hell.

42
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,140
I can handle it.

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,780
You can handle his son, that’s all.

44
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,180
From now on, you don’t say a damn word.

45
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,900
I’ll handle it myself.

46
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,400
- Chon, get Wut on the line.
- Don’t.

47
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,460
Calling him won’t change a thing, Dad.

48
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,820
I figured after your ordination,

49
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,060
you’d have absorbed enough Dhamma
to keep your cool.

50
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,620
You’re fired.

51
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,260
Chon, you’re the party leader.

52
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,220
Looks like we’re not going
to see eye to eye.

53
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,860
Here’s the deal.

54
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,420
I’ve got key evidence
Nititham still doesn’t have.

55
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,660
If it comes out, we all go down,

56
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,060
not just you.

57
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,540
But Chon and I
are going to be screwed, too.

58
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,300
So you’ve got two options:

59
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,580
One: step back and serve your sentence
with VIP treatment.

60
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,820
Or two,
which I wouldn’t recommend,

61
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,100
go to prison like everyone else
and be left with nothing.

62
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,060
You got the guts?

63
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,540
What do you think?

64
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,700
With respect, I’ll take my leave.

65
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,740
There we go

66
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,500
good,

67
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,900
good, good. Very good.

68
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,900
Try again. You can stand… there,

69
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,660
you’re up! you’re up!

70
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,780
Dad

71
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,580
Ow, my back.

72
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,020
You okay, Dad?

73
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,300
Easy, easy. I’m fine.

74
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,980
Go check on your sister.

75
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,380
Ning, Are you okay?

76
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,780
Kid, look your brother’s here.

77
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,780
He hasn’t said a word since
he got back.

78
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,820
No idea what’s weighing on him.

79
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,100
Go try talking to him.

80
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,860
Go try talking to him.

81
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,380
Hey…

82
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,500
I lost.

83
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,580
I helped them all the way
to winning the election,

84
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,660
I was supposed to be made minister.

85
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,220
But they’d been stringing me
along the whole time.

86
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,180
I’m sorry.

87
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,900
I can’t keep my promise.

88
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,860
Nong,

89
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,500
if it’s too much, just come home.

90
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Take care of the family.

91
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,340
T Don’t worry about the rest,
it’s not worth it, son.

92
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,660
What are you doing here?

93
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,900
Just go.

94
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,300
Doc,

95
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,500
let me say one thing for the last time.

96
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,820
Then I won’t bother you again.

97
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,620
Please?

98
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,940
I want to apologize. I lied.

99
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,740
When they scrapped your policy,

100
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,780
I was in that room too.

101
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,700
And I owe an apology to Uncle
and to Dr. Ning

102
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,220
for failing to deliver
the policy she entrusted to me.

103
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,340
I tried to push back,
but I couldn’t win.

104
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,540
What’s the point of telling me now?

105
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,540
I’m sorry.

106
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,780
I had the chance to tell you,
but I didn’t.

107
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,540
I never meant to hide it.

108
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,820
I was just afraid that if you knew,

109
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,380
we’d end up like this.

110
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,540
Instead of sitting here,

111
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,900
go finish the job.

112
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,900
Take that as a personal ask from me.

113
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,820
I can’t without you.

114
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,980
All I’m good at is talking people
into doing things.

115
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,180
We got this far because of you.

116
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,700
Thank you,

117
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,060
and I’m sorry you trusted me.

118
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,700
I already signed a resignation letter
and left it with Jes.

119
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,340
It takes effect the moment
my father approves it.

120
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,420
I’m just saying,

121
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,780
you can’t count on me
for anything anymore.

122
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,020
If you quit, I quit.

123
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
I’ll get going now.

124
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:14,740
What is it… Ning?

125
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,260
Slowly. I’m listening.

126
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,700
F… fight…

127
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:52,300
Mm.

128
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,700
Fight.

129
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
All right, let’s do this.

130
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,220
I’m ready.

131
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,020
The Minister is ready.

132
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,660
And remember, left foot first,

133
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,020
Mr.Vee instructed me to remind you.

134
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,900
Minister! Sir!

135
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,300
Good morning.

136
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,100
Okay, everyone,

137
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,260
easy, please.

138
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,180
First off, don’t call me ‘Minister’

139
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,260
Just call me Dr. Nong.

140
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,780
Because with the title or without,
I’m still the same old Dr. Nong.

141
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,900
Is cutting down doctors’
working hours your first task in the office?

142
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,460
Yes,

143
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,220
I’ll go straight into it. But first,

144
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,460
we’ll need to set up a committee
and a team to study feasibility.

145
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,420
There’s talk you’re just a puppet minister
with no real power.

146
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,620
Can you actually deliver
your own policies?

147
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,620
I’m not working alone,

148
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,860
and we’re working as a team.

149
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:38,100
I don’t have the kind of power
where I can snap my fingers and it’s done.

150
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,780
Wiwat Siam has a lot on the policy slate,

151
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,100
so I can’t say yet what comes first.

152
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,740
But whatever I take on,
I’ll give it everything.

153
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,740
Minister, how do you feel
on your first day?

154
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:02,460
Good.

155
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:08,340
I’m glad to be meeting the team
we’ll be working with on my day one...

156
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,780
I already told you,

157
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,180
this didn’t need to go
all the way up to the Minister.

158
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,820
I wanted to learn the ropes myself.

159
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,780
I don’t see any problem.

160
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,140
I’ve reviewed the basics.

161
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,228
We’ll call it the Tele-Doctor Program
so it doesn’t overlap with Telemed.

162
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,980
And Phasakorn has no objections.

163
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,820
All right.

164
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,780
Ying,

165
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,420
but technically, something like this
has to go through a tender, right?

166
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,460
It does,

167
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,220
I but Med Tech will win the bid.

168
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,540
- If you’re thinking that…
- It’s fine.

169
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,060
I know exactly where I stand.

170
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Nationwide,
the Tele-Doctor has twelve hubs.

171
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,500
Puea Khwam Wang has already taken six.

172
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,860
Doesn’t get clearer than that.

173
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,220
It’s tele-doctors.
You can work from anywhere anyway.

174
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:19,620
Or should we shift one hub
to Phu Chaloem?

175
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,180
I think that’s workable.

176
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,700
I’ll definitely move them,

177
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,500
but let me study the data a bit more.

178
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,700
This is only phase one, though.

179
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,140
- I think, Doctor
- Don’t worry.

180
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,980
I’ll sign off on your part.

181
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,820
And tell Passakorn,

182
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,980
I won’t touch his quota.

183
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,460
But as for the other six,

184
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,780
I’m going to tweak the specs a little

185
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,260
for the public good.

186
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,620
I’m sure he won’t be petty about it.

187
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,500
You walk in and go straight for a drink, huh?

188
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,300
Come on,

189
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,580
it’s the adjustment period.

190
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,300
I need a beer to decompress.

191
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,420
The one who’s really stressed

192
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,180
already called to complain about you.

193
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,260
For real?

194
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,980
I do want to stay on Ying’s good side,

195
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,940
but Dr. Chalong is a pain in the ass.

196
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,460
Heard it was you giving him the pain.

197
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,980
How could I not?

198
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,660
They’ve left me
with only six sites to run.

199
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,140
It’s not like I can do much.

200
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,300
Oh yeah?

201
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,540
Yeah.

202
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,420
Basically, you line them up by population

203
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,100
and put the hub
where they’ll help the most.

204
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,980
Meds and equipment go where

205
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,980
the local illness stats say they’re needed.

206
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,620
And I’m looping
in community health workers.

207
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,860
That’s it.

208
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,180
That’s it, huh.

209
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,300
Not exactly ‘not much.’

210
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,500
Don’t forget, you’re a minister.

211
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:21,740
This isn’t the only thing on your plate.

212
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,220
It’s you who shouldn’t forget
who you’re talking to.

213
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,900
This is the powerhouse, Dr. Nong.

214
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,420
Don’t underestimate me.

215
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,580
You do look like you’re enjoying the job.

216
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,460
Not fun at all.

217
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,980
But I’ve got a target now.

218
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,420
If we can’t change everything,

219
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,300
we change what we can.

220
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:52,780
Young Siam gets
the green light once again.

221
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,820
This time we hit the campuses,

222
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,340
so we’ll get to sail the ship
just as you wanted.

223
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,060
As I wanted.

224
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,420
And you?

225
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,020
Sounds good to me.

226
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,660
But you,

227
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,140
will you have time
to take me out for dessert?

228
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:30,500
You’ll have to check with my secretary.

229
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,660
I hear your secretary’s supposed
to brief me on your schedule.

230
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,820
Then you already know,
I’m always free for you.

231
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,660
if I call,

232
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,780
free or not,

233
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,020
you make yourself free.

234
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,940
You outrank the minister, huh.

235
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,100
Of course.

236
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,580
All right then. You’ve got a deal, MP.

237
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,420
Yes,

238
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,740
Minister.

239
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,500
Looks like this might be
the best deal of my political life.

240
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,540
You talk like you’ve been one for ages.

241
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,940
Given the way things look,

242
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,580
just rotten,
cutthroat deals everywhere,

243
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,180
in a year, ten, twenty…

244
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,780
There won’t be a better deal than this.

245
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:35,260
If there isn’t, make one.

246
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,700
Give it time,
you’ll have the chops to take them on.

247
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,700
Bring it on.

248
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,380
Watch me.

249
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,380
Titles fade, legends last forever.

250
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:54,220
Can’t argue with that.

251
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,340
(1 Year Later)

252
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,300
Since it’s December,

253
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,300
it’s been almost a year
since Khunawut’s cabinet took office.

254
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,940
Over the past year,
there’s been little to show,

255
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,740
just budget cuts to prop up
the Eyes Wide Open Fund,

256
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,780
which ultimately couldn’t pay
every farming household.

257
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,380
What was 30,000 baht
is now cut down to 10,000.

258
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,180
Before we move on to
the no-confidence motion,

259
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,260
here’s the latest news:

260
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,740
former monk and former prime minister Phanu

261
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,980
has disrobed and been arrested
on charges of corruption,

262
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,940
abuse of office to benefit
himself and his allies,

263
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,380
and soliciting bribes.

264
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,900
He will be remanded immediately
without bail.

265
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:53,180
Try this angle.
They spook at bad press.

266
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:56,860
Right,

267
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,620
because they’ve got skeletons.

268
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,140
Okay.

269
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,580
The meeting ran long.

270
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,940
It’s about telemedicine.

271
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,300
Dr. Chalong told me that
Dr. Phat won’t budge.

272
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,660
He insists the hub
goes to his district first.

273
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Makes zero sense.

274
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:27,780
Hold on,

275
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,660
let me reply to one more chat,
it’s an important one.

276
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,740
One sec.

277
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:36,340
Water’s fine on that end.

278
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,860
Ministry rules say no alcohol on duty.

279
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:46,100
Who’s on duty? Not me.

280
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,500
And we’re off the clock,

281
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:52,940
go ahead.

282
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,780
A toast, Vee.

283
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,820
What’s the occasion?

284
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,580
That we haven’t had dinner out,
just the two of us…in,

285
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:27,900
wow, over a month.

286
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,820
Guess that makes it a special occasion.

287
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,220
‘Special occasion,’ huh.

288
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,900
Guilty as charged.

289
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,940
I’m really sorry.

290
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,100
Please,

291
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,180
I’ve been holding this glass so long,
I’m getting a cramp.

292
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:24,460
What are you looking at?

293
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,860
Did I spill something on myself?

294
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
No.

295
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,500
I was thinking about
the first time we came here.

296
00:24:37,457 --> 00:24:38,460
I remember.

297
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,140
First rule, when the food’s served,

298
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,580
you gently unfold the napkin

299
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,340
and place it on your lap, like this.

300
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:52,460
Just a blink and a year went by.

301
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,020
You look a lot more… ministerial now.

302
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,260
Look at me, full of grease.

303
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,220
Mm.

304
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,300
I mean grace.

305
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,540
You could correct me.

306
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,420
Cheap jokes, huh.

307
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,580
Who else am I supposed to joke with?

308
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,580
Ying?

309
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,260
Or should it be Dr. Chalong?

310
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,940
It’s gotta be you.

311
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Truth is,

312
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,940
I’ve been waiting for tonight all week.

313
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,780
Waiting just to crack jokes?

314
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,220
Actually…

315
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,180
there’s something I wanted to tell you.

316
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,300
What about?

317
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:59,740
We’ve been living together
for a year now.

318
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:03,860
I feel…

319
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,460
something’s changed...

320
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,140
in me.

321
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,660
What?

322
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,140
Yes, Father…

323
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,340
It’s all set.

324
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,420
I’ve had the paperwork taken care of.

325
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,420
Tell Dr. Chalong to knock it off.

326
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,700
That’ll be all.

327
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,820
Take it down a notch, Minister,

328
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,900
they can hear you from out there.

329
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,900
You’re exaggerating.

330
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,060
Still hitting hard as ever, huh?

331
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:15,780
Yeah.

332
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,820
I’m still responsible
for people’s lives, aren’t I?

333
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,300
So, what can I help you with?

334
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,380
Your same old problem.

335
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:32,820
Which one?

336
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,340
I’ve got a hundred old headaches
and a thousand new ones.

337
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,180
Boss Jom.

338
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,180
He’s wrecking my fertilizer
and pesticide reduction program.

339
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,300
His dad runs Interior,

340
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,980
so all the subdistrict
and village chiefs are on their side.

341
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:57,020
I came to ask how we take them on.

342
00:27:59,695 --> 00:28:01,660
Now’s not the time to go head-to-head.

343
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,100
You’ll just make the job harder.

344
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,100
Try cutting a deal first.

345
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,420
We can probably negotiate with him.

346
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,340
You want me to deal
with that old bastard Jom?

347
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,140
The guy you cursed out
in front of the whole province?

348
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:24,780
Listen to me, Nath.

349
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:31,180
Like it or not,
these are the rules right now.

350
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,340
If we can’t change the rules yet,

351
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,700
we play by them. Right?

352
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:42,140
You’ve changed.

353
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,380
I haven’t.

354
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,420
I’m doing whatever it takes
to get the work done.

355
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,660
You just don’t like it this way, that’s all.

356
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:57,180
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

357
00:28:58,692 --> 00:29:02,740
I know what I’m doing,
and I know what I’ll get out of it.

358
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:05,820
And you don’t think
about what you’re losing?

359
00:29:06,848 --> 00:29:08,180
Back then or now.

360
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,580
I’ve always been willing
to trade whatever it takes.

361
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:14,620
You’ve gone too far.

362
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,500
Or are you stopping here?

363
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:23,980
That’s it for today.

364
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,940
We’ll talk later.

365
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:29,340
Go on, I’ve got a lot of work to do.

366
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:41,620
I don’t think
I’ve got anything left to say to you.

367
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,940
I still haven’t properly thanked you
for always having my back.

368
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,620
Happy birthday, son.

369
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,940
Go on,

370
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,940
open it.

371
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,380
Thank you, Dad.

372
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:51,980
The Tele-Doctor program’s been
getting good feedback.

373
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,380
Almost a year passed,

374
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,980
and Trirat is gearing up
for the no-confidence motion.

375
00:30:58,464 --> 00:31:02,940
Frankly, Dr. Nong’s project is about
the only thing that really holds up.

376
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,820
Only if he could work with fewer hurdles.

377
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,500
What do you think?

378
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,860
People would benefit more.

379
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,660
But Sun won’t make it easy for him.

380
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:20,300
Exactly. That’s why I called you in.

381
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,340
When we formed the government,

382
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,660
I handed him everything.
Now he’s acting up,

383
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,660
we need to rein him in.

384
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,100
There isn’t much we can do,
unless we reshuffle the cabinet.

385
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,460
A reshuffle won’t fix it.

386
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,940
A man who could have
his own father thrown in jail

387
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,540
isn’t giving up power quietly.

388
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:48,500
But we can clip his wings.

389
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,540
If Tele-Doctor Phase 2 switches vendors
from Med Tech to O.P.M., from our side.

390
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,540
If we can pull that off,
Nong’s job will get a lot easier.

391
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,020
And tell Dr. Nong to be proactive
about taking credit.

392
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,420
If the work’s good, then people
should know who’s behind it.

393
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,340
The more Sun plants
those hubs on his own turf,

394
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,620
the more openings Nong
has to go in and build support.

395
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,300
Depends on how much Sun lets us.

396
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:25,500
That’s on you now.

397
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:42,020
Don’t let anything fall through the cracks.

398
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:44,300
Why is it that he more we work,
the more there is to do?

399
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:45,740
Ask the boss.

400
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,540
Same old story.

401
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,380
And Med Tech
just sent their Phase 2 plan.

402
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,540
This time it’s worse than before,

403
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,700
so we’ve got more prep to do.

404
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:05,340
Even when you tell it,
you never tell the whole story, do you?

405
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:06,980
Jump,

406
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:09,820
zip it.

407
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,940
It’s nothing.

408
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,420
When the workload piles up,

409
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,660
the load is too heavy
for the people in the ministry.

410
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:26,380
They can’t move at our pace,
so I’m doing it myself.

411
00:33:28,092 --> 00:33:32,100
They ‘accidentally’
broke the printer and the PCs,

412
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,220
every dataset took weeks.

413
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,740
Nobody calls that workload, boss.

414
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,940
Mouth shut, back to work.

415
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,220
Go easy.

416
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,700
You’re making enemies.

417
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,460
So are you reading everything
they shove at you to sign closely?

418
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,420
Plenty of ministers have been
set up and knocked over, mind you.

419
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,060
No matter how big we are,

420
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,140
we’re political appointees.
We come and go.

421
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,660
The civil service stays.

422
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,420
If they’re unhappy, nothing moves.

423
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,220
Got it, Vee.

424
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,660
I’m here! Time for a break.

425
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,100
I heard your dad gave you a present.

426
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,820
Where is it? Let me see.
Is it worth millions?

427
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,820
No. Come on.

428
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,060
Still, I bet Big Boss
wants something in return.

429
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,380
People like that don’t give freebies.

430
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:53,980
Kidding! Don’t tense up.

431
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,940
You’re right, though.

432
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,460
He wants the Tele-Doctor supplier
switched to a company on our side.

433
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,140
Fine by me.

434
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,700
Doubt there’s any outfit worse
than Med Tech.

435
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,020
They’re number one at that.

436
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,900
But we need two things. One:

437
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,220
you need to get out front
and claim your wins,

438
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,620
especially on Sun’s turf.

439
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,540
Sure. That’s easy.

440
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,020
Two: I have to go
cut a deal with Sun.

441
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:35,900
Yeah?

442
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:42,220
And what are you putting on the table?

443
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,180
Nothing yet.

444
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,580
I’ll talk first.

445
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,700
If it doesn’t fly, we’ll rethink.

446
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,660
Are you okay with that?

447
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:09,260
It’s fine.

448
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,457
We trust each other, don’t we?

449
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:34,580
Dr. Nong, Mr. Vee.

450
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,620
Hello, I’m the admin of your ship page.

451
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:41,140
Which page? Or are you on Instagram?

452
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:42,940
Withu–Thanit.

453
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,340
Mr. Vee, you’re Croissant, right?

454
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,340
Oh-ho,

455
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,340
so you’ve got a burner account?

456
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,060
Come on, spill.

457
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,500
What do you guys talk about?

458
00:36:58,885 --> 00:36:59,780
Doctor.

459
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:07,940
Okay, I won’t tell anyone.
I’ll get going. Bye!

460
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,500
Well,

461
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,940
Croissant…

462
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,260
Where are you running off to,
Mr. Croissant?

463
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:24,260
Keep it up, and I’ll stop calling you Vee.

464
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:30,100
Can we do this later?
Someone might hear.

465
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:36,900
Then come here.

466
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,260
No.

467
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,620
All clear.

468
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,060
Now spill it, Mr. Croissant.

469
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:58,620
“Croissant” is a nickname
my mom gave me.

470
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,580
My dad hates it.

471
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,460
…Yeah,

472
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,980
I get why.

473
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:13,060
Imagine an MP named Croissant.

474
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,020
Wouldn’t it be ridiculous?
Think about it.

475
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,540
“Good evening, everyone.

476
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,140
I’m MP Croissant
from the Wiwat Siam Party.”

477
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:25,220
That’s why it’s a burner account,
my secret identity.

478
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:29,740
I only use it to lurk and follow.

479
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,900
I’m not doing anything behind your back,
by the way.

480
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,220
I didn’t say you were.

481
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,500
Jumpy much?

482
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:42,700
I just want to know
what you talk about with the shippers.

483
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,660
I blend in like any fan.

484
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,820
Stir the hype a bit and ask
if they think the two are for real.

485
00:38:52,735 --> 00:38:53,820
And are they?

486
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,060
You asking the shippers,

487
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,460
or us?

488
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:08,740
I’m asking you.

489
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,100
Is this real?

490
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:16,380
If it were a sure thing,

491
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,260
it wouldn’t be a “ship,” would it?

492
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,660
Then let’s stop being a ship.

493
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,540
Let’s be the real deal.

494
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,980
Ha,

495
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,380
you’re smiling.

496
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:48,460
- What, I can’t smile?
- You can.

497
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,300
I just want to know
if we’re smiling about the same thing.

498
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,220
Here’s your late-night congee.

499
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:33,740
Nice.

500
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:40,140
Sir, I’m so honored to have
your company on this all-nighter.

501
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:42,820
Haven’t you already pulled three?

502
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:49,340
And whose dad made me
sign those stacks of paperwork, huh?

503
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,860
Been butting heads
with Dr. Chalong forever.

504
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:57,500
And now I’m supposed
to rubber-stamp it? No way.

505
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,940
So yeah, I’m pushing back.

506
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:05,940
And tomorrow
I’m hitting Sun’s bull’s-eye.

507
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,100
Watch what you say.

508
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:10,220
Don’t act shy.

509
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,380
We’re going in
to make gains on his turf.

510
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,980
If that’s not going straight
for the bull’s-eye, what is?

511
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:18,620
Suit yourself.

512
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,660
Let’s eat, I’ll prepare it.

513
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,740
Sit.

514
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,660
Thank you, boss.

515
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,740
Our Tele-Doctor program
has received a very positive response

516
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,900
because we have worked
with full dedication.

517
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,140
With the cooperation
of local medical staff,

518
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,340
we have been able to work efficiently.

519
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,780
Let’s invite the person behind it,

520
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,460
so our friends in the press
don’t have to wait.

521
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,740
Please welcome
Dr. Thanit Phonthongdee,

522
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,460
Minister of Public Health.

523
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,940
Cancel the event,
and take the doctor to rest first.

524
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,580
No photos, please.

525
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,860
I’ve been on it for twenty years.

526
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,740
There’s never been a problem.

527
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:03,300
You’re not addicted to it, are you?

528
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:07,580
I told you,

529
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,140
it’s a psych med, not a narcotic.

530
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,140
It’s just not legal in Thailand yet.

531
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:21,340
And where did you get it?

532
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,580
I’ve got my pharmacist friend...

533
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,620
to buy it for me.

534
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:31,420
You need to stop. Today. Now.

535
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,420
- I’ll be more careful, okay?
- No.

536
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,020
Yffou crashed and burned
on camera today.

537
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:43,140
Ying already covered for me.

538
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,620
She said I was exhausted
from working too hard.

539
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,940
It makes sense.

540
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,940
You don’t think people will start digging?

541
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,900
No one’s going to get suspicious?

542
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,220
And Trirat is about to bring
a no-confidence motion against you.

543
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:01,300
You’re handing them ammunition.

544
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,260
If you don’t quit, you’re finished.

545
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,980
Do you have any sympathy for me at all?

546
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,180
If I didn’t have to swallow these rotten deals
and put up with selfish people,

547
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,580
I wouldn’t be doing this.

548
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,860
Then admit you can’t handle it.

549
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,700
You’re not just
a provincial hospital doctor anymore.

550
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,700
Build as big a team as you need.

551
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,140
And if you don’t trust anyone, tell me.

552
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,060
I’m sorry, Vee.

553
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,460
Forget that for now.

554
00:44:56,371 --> 00:44:59,060
Bottom line: you have to stop, for good.

555
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,380
- I told you I...
- Enough.

556
00:45:06,257 --> 00:45:07,500
We’ll talk later.

557
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,980
You need to rest.

558
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,700
Hi, Gale.

559
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,500
How solid is the evidence?

560
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,580
Okay, go ahead.
If you hit any snags, tell me.

561
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,940
If you won’t take it from me,
at least listen to the doctor.

562
00:46:02,914 --> 00:46:04,100
You need to rehab.

563
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,260
Last night, police received
a report of a drug party

564
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,580
You need to watch this.

565
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,860
at a luxury condo downtown.

566
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,740
When officers arrived,
there was no gathering

567
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,300
but the unit turned out to be the residence
of Dr. Thanit Phonthongdee,

568
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:29,620
better known as Dr. Nong,
the Minister of Public Health.

569
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:32,780
At first, it looked like
a politically motivated tip.

570
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,300
But here’s what officers say they found.

571
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:38,660
What you’re seeing here
is a stimulant drug,

572
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,340
classified under Thai law
as a Category 2 controlled substance.

573
00:46:52,085 --> 00:46:53,420
We have to hold
a press conference today.

574
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,140
If we don’t have an answer
within the hour,

575
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,260
the Prime Minister’s Office will take over.

576
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,020
What’s the move?

577
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,820
We can’t let Jes take care of this.

578
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,500
Doc,

579
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,740
will you do whatever it takes?

580
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:47,780
Ni,

581
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,980
go get Jump.

582
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,580
The drug shown in the reports...

583
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,060
is a psychiatric stimulant.

584
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:16,260
It helps with alertness and focus.

585
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,420
However, it isn’t approved by the Thai FDA

586
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:28,340
and is classified under Thai law
as a Category 2 controlled substance.

587
00:48:30,857 --> 00:48:32,980
I want to sincerely apologize
to the public.

588
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,100
This is my responsibility.

589
00:48:43,428 --> 00:48:46,300
I failed to look after my nephew,
who lives with me,

590
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,420
and he became involved
in something illegal.

591
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:53,180
What is wrong can never be right.

592
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,580
My nephew will go through
the legal process.

593
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,380
To be clear, are you saying the drug
belonged to your nephew?

594
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:02,940
Yes.

595
00:49:05,457 --> 00:49:07,620
We live together
in the same apartment.

596
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:09,660
And you had no
prior knowledge of this?

597
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:13,540
Right, how could you not know
if you live together?

598
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,540
I didn’t know.

599
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:22,980
I have Dr. Nong’s nephew
remanded for now.

600
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,140
We’ll post bail later
when the timing’s right.

601
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,180
And when this is wrapped up,
don’t forget to buy me some wine.

602
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:31,660
Understood.

603
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,140
That’s all for now.

604
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,340
Hey, Boss.

605
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,460
Hey,

606
00:49:56,314 --> 00:49:57,300
I’m fine.

607
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,020
It’s the VIP holding.

608
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:07,540
Decent bed

609
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,220
and no one’s gonna touch me.

610
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:15,780
No shanks, no ‘initiation.’

611
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,620
I’ll walk out without a scratch.

612
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,140
Can’t promise about pearling, though.

613
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:29,940
I’m really sorry, Jump.

614
00:50:36,178 --> 00:50:37,540
This is on me.

615
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,740
It’s alright.

616
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,500
I’m more useful in here if it means

617
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,820
you can be out there
getting things done.

618
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:04,460
I’ll be out soon anyway.

619
00:51:05,942 --> 00:51:09,140
When you get out,

620
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,940
you’ll have a record, Jump.
You know that, right?

621
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:16,900
Worst case, I’m an ex-convict.

622
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,460
But without you,

623
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:25,980
I’m just a nobody.

624
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,060
And “ex-con”

625
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,380
sounds cooler
than “nobody,” doesn’t it?

626
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:42,220
Believe me,

627
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,980
you’re more than that.

628
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,100
Damn it.

629
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:11,660
Amid growing skepticism surrounding
Health Minister Dr. Thanit,

630
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:18,380
an online petition urging his resignation
has gathered 64,512 signatures.

631
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,180
Joining us now is Mr. Hari,
legal adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister.

632
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,940
Mr. Hari, what’s your view?

633
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,220
If you felt guilty about Jump,

634
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,260
half of that’s on me.

635
00:53:10,714 --> 00:53:12,300
I’m a selfish bastard.

636
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:15,060
That’s not true.

637
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,900
For the Tele-Doctor project,

638
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,060
who is the one who keeps
pushing back on Dr. Chalong?

639
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,260
- Who leaned on the suppliers?
- And we still couldn’t beat them.

640
00:53:28,028 --> 00:53:29,460
They took it all.

641
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,820
How much was left for the ministry?

642
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:33,700
Go and take a look at

643
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,340
how much is left?

644
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,900
They’re all rotten to the core.

645
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:43,380
Trust me,

646
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,260
without you,

647
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,300
it would’ve been a lot worse.

648
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:50,540
Maybe we didn’t win,

649
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,580
- but we didn’t lose either.
- Don’t talk like you know.

650
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,140
I’m worse than you think.

651
00:54:00,714 --> 00:54:02,500
If you feel guilty about Jump,

652
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,500
then go to rehab..

653
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,260
It’s not just Jump.

654
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,020
There’s worse.

655
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,500
And if you knew,

656
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,460
you could walk away right now.

657
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:47,900
I was high,

658
00:54:55,628 --> 00:54:57,020
really high.

659
00:55:01,142 --> 00:55:02,860
So I chose Chief Tong,

660
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,260
because I knew I couldn’t handle it.

661
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,340
I was afraid if I chose my father…

662
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,220
I’d end up getting my own father killed.

663
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:28,380
How messed up do I have to be...

664
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,580
to do that?

665
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,460
I’m a piece of shit,

666
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:39,020
right? Am I?

667
00:55:41,057 --> 00:55:42,460
Just stay away from me.

668
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,340
Hey, easy.

669
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,900
What’s done is done.

670
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,900
It’s okay.

671
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:06,060
I’m here.

672
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,860
And… thanks for telling me everything.

673
00:56:34,371 --> 00:56:38,020
Tee, you say you’ve brought new evidence.
What is it exactly?

674
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,820
It’s the original operative note from that day.
It’s Dr. Nong’s own surgical log.

675
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:46,860
If the evidence used in the case proves false,

676
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:51,140
we can reopen the case.

677
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,740
The note says he asked for five minutes
before entering the operating room.

678
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,380
And when he came back,
he appeared disoriented,

679
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,180
which the attending nurse says contributed to a delay in treatment.

680
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:05,700
That’s significant,

681
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,620
those symptoms can be consistent
with drug use.

682
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:14,660
And Dr. Nong has also said the drugs
were obtained by his nephew.

683
00:57:14,828 --> 00:57:18,380
I’m here today to ask the public
to watch closely

684
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:23,700
for any political interference in this case.

685
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:27,620
This isn’t just about grudges or personal failings.

686
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,300
It’s a question of political ethics,

687
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:35,740
and it could weigh heavily on
the upcoming no-confidence debate.
