1
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,660
Did you know why he was called?
Doctor Nong super horse power?

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,460
Because he uses drugs.

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,980
Yesterday you did very well.

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,020
That we can overtake Nititham.
Because of Doctor Nong.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,860
Hashtag Witutthanit.

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,980
They are the moon and stars shining
through the darkness of politics.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,740
No need to be so serious about it.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,220
If it’s true, so what?

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,000
There’s no information yet on whether
this secret deal actually exists.

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,460
The Hope Party and Siam Wiwat
must come out and explain urgently.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,620
Go on.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,980
Sun says he knows Dr. Nong’s secret.

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,020
I thought it could blow up the election,
so I agreed to meet him.

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,580
And what did he tell you?

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,900
He said Dr. Nong had a wife
and a kid, but he abandoned them.

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,300
But I checked, and it’s a lie.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,940
Sun’s never been one to make things up.

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,580
Unless there’s more to it.

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,460
Unless…

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,260
You two are still seeing each other?

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,260
I didn’t want to pry.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,900
But if this turns into a problem,
I have to step in.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,300
There’s nothing between us.

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,260
We’ve broken up.

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,940
And what are you going to tell the reporters?

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,620
You’re having a casual dinner with your ex?

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,260
I’ll tell them it’s an old photo
from before the campaign.

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,660
Back when we were planning
our alumni event.

29
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,500
The election’s in three days.

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,660
If we’re screwed because of this,

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,140
you know what will follow.

32
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,340
It wasn’t just me and Mr. Phasakorn that day.

33
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,740
There are two other
alumni committee members with us.

34
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,140
But neither of you
is on the alumni committee list.

35
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,500
That’s because we were still
in the recruitment stage,

36
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,860
but both of us decided not to join.

37
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,020
Do you think the party that just dropped
in the polls is behind this photo leak?

38
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,780
I won’t speculate.

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,860
My duty now is to come forward transparently

40
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,100
so the public is certain
there’s no political agenda.

41
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,140
Could this be a personal agenda?

42
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,540
What do you mean?

43
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,300
But there are rumors among your fans

44
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,900
that there’s a third party coming
between the ‘Star and Moon’ couple.

45
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,620
And that Mr. Phasakorn
is the true partner in question.

46
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,020
So you’re telling me
that he made up stories

47
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,740
just because he wanted to see you?

48
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,140
I think so.

49
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,100
Are you sure?

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,700
I told you there’s nothing to it.

51
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,300
Not personally, not politically.

52
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,540
And it won’t happen again.

53
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,340
I’ve made it clear that we’re over.

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,660
I don’t think he’ll let it end that easily.

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,820
Not if he’s willing
to invent lies to get you in the room.

56
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,180
That’s his problem.

57
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,220
I’m done playing.

58
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,460
You won’t have to worry about
me keeping secrets again,

59
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,540
alright?

60
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,420
I’m not okay with that.

61
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,620
You promised me that

62
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,340
there’s no more going behind my back.

63
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,540
Not when it’s about work.

64
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,100
This was personal,

65
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,060
And there’s nothing significant
you needed to worry about.

66
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,340
What’s insignificant?

67
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,580
The talk you had with him, or me?

68
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,300
I can confirm again.

69
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,420
That between Phasakorn and me
is nothing more than a junior-senior bond.

70
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,380
If you ask him,
you’ll receive the same answer.

71
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,100
How about Dr. Nong?

72
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,460
What about you and Dr. Nong?

73
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,980
Excuse me.

74
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,660
I didn’t know you’d taken up
entertainment reporting, Gale.

75
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,540
Then I’ll give the celebrity answer.

76
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,460
Vee and I are dear friends.

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,580
Regarding the leaked photo
and the so-called secret deals.

78
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,620
So, if I may address this.

79
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,900
Before all this,

80
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,060
I had no intention of entering politics.

81
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,740
Let alone becoming a politician.

82
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,100
But there’s this one person
who insists on following me around.

83
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,700
He has always been there for me,
wherever I am, whatever I do.

84
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,980
I joined the political scene

85
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,580
because I trust this friend of mine.

86
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,420
He promised not to act behind my back,

87
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,540
and he’s never failed me.

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:25,020
I don’t know what the person
behind these photos wants.

89
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,500
But if there were any secret deal
or personal matter,

90
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,260
I’m confident that my dear friend
would’ve told me everything.

91
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,700
Isn’t that right?

92
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,180
From now on,

93
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,900
my dear friend and I
share the same goals for change.

94
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,300
And to achieve that,
trust is our foundation.

95
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:05,900
And I’m confident that
I can fully trust my dear friend.

96
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,940
It seems like
you’ve been keeping busy.

97
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,500
Look who’s talking.

98
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,300
It took me ages to get
an audience with you, Father.

99
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,500
Must be a full calendar these days.

100
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,100
Ah… don’t tease.

101
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,180
I’ve been stepping back
from party matters

102
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,740
and letting Sun take on more.

103
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,780
More than he should, perhaps?

104
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,140
You mean that photo? Trust me,

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,660
there’s nothing to it.

106
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,340
Just youngsters talking, as they do.

107
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,540
I still take you at your word, Father.

108
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,780
And look at me now,

109
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,900
I’ll be needing your help with my case.

110
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,820
All I ask is just make sure
there’s a decent seat for my boy to take.

111
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,180
I believe you wouldn’t lie.

112
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,260
You’d be damn if you did.

113
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,620
Cheers.

114
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,220
When the verdict’s in,

115
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,780
you should leave the robe
and take the seat yourself.

116
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,300
We worked better that way.

117
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,500
Nowadays, it’s nothing but headaches.

118
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,580
Times have changed.

119
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,300
Tri’s been after me,

120
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,300
nearly gutted the whole party.

121
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,580
This is your time now, Wut.

122
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,180
You have my full backing.

123
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,260
Chon, when’s Sun coming in?

124
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,420
Eight-thirty, sir.

125
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,140
Tell him to come earlier.
So we can talk to the PM together.

126
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,700
No, no

127
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,780
let’s wait for the results first.

128
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,460
The results are in our hands.

129
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,420
Sun needs me,

130
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,340
and I need you.

131
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,220
If we don’t stand together,
who’s going to help us out?

132
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,620
Hearing you say that eases my mind.

133
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,420
Rough day, Doc?

134
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,260
Just something on my mind.

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,220
Tell me about it, you’ll feel better.

136
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,580
I already did.

137
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,300
Sorry for not telling you
about that earlier.

138
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,220
And even though

139
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,940
you were being sarcastic,
what you said actually helped.

140
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,780
It helped a lot. I’ve got the reports.

141
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,660
t's trending on every platform.

142
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,140
‘Ship Number 8’
is now 2nd on the trend,

143
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,020
and the new hashtag DearFriend
is sitting at the 5th.

144
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,740
You’re a game-changer, Doc.

145
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,980
Hey,

146
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,740
Don’t forget the hero behind the lens.

147
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,780
Great content’s
nothing without great photos.

148
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,260
Great job.

149
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,420
- Satisfied now?
- I am,

150
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,020
If we keep this level
of engagement until the election day,

151
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,340
we’ll beat Nititham for sure.

152
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,260
Thanks, Doc.

153
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,540
Mm.

154
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,060
Just don’t let it happen again.

155
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,140
Wait Doc.

156
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,220
What now?

157
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,060
You can’t toast with just the two of you.

158
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,140
Don’t forget the team.

159
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,860
Alright.

160
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,060
To…

161
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,300
…All of us.

162
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,660
Dear friends.

163
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,540
Dear friends.

164
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,980
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

165
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,820
It’s two days before the election,

166
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,020
and the picture is becoming clearer

167
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,660
that the next government

168
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,300
will almost certainly come from
the top five parties in the polls.

169
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,620
Kamol.

170
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,340
Right now, our poll reveals that

171
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,660
Wiwat Siam is in the lead at 35%,

172
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,220
followed by Nititham at 31%,

173
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,460
Puea Khwam Wang at 18%,

174
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,340
Pattana Thai at 8%,

175
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,380
and Sangkom Seri at 5%.

176
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,060
If the results match the polls,

177
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,700
it would mean that
if Wiwat Siam joins hands with Nititham,

178
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,300
they could form a government
with just two parties.

179
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,300
If not, they’ll have to court
the remaining three.

180
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,660
So in this final stretch before election day,

181
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,180
we’re here to paint a clearer picture
of where the country is headed.

182
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,860
So, everyone,

183
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,140
let’s welcome the leaders
of the top five parties.

184
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,940
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

185
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,100
Firstly, I would like to ask
the leaders of the top two parties,

186
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,340
Mr. Khunawut and Ms. Trirat.

187
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,500
If you get to form a government,

188
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,820
what qualities will you look for
in coalition partners?

189
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,020
Mr. Khunawut, you first.

190
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,020
Thank you, Suwit.

191
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,460
I would like to say that

192
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:47,180
Throughout this campaign,
Wiwat Siam has said the same thing.

193
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:55,380
If we earn the public’s
trust as the party with the most votes

194
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,300
and the mandate to form a government,

195
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,180
we will build a welfare state.

196
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,940
Our first priority is constitutional
reform to reset the system

197
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,060
and expand opportunity.

198
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,060
Therefore, any prospective coalition partner

199
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,220
must agree to this.

200
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
And you, Ms. Trirat?

201
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,580
Nititham has always been clear

202
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,260
we have zero tolerance
for corruption.

203
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,700
Any party with such a record
is out of the question.

204
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,700
Even if they try to clean up their image
by removing the guilty ones,

205
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,100
we won’t take them in.

206
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,820
Coming in strong right from the start.

207
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,420
Of course,
we need to take a firm stand.

208
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,540
I’m done speaking in vague,
roundabout terms.

209
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,100
That would be a waste of time.

210
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,300
Does Trirat have a personal grudge
against your father,

211
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,580
or is she like this with everyone?

212
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,340
Back then, she and my dad
were just like us.

213
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,540
People shipped them?

214
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,740
No, but many thought
something was going on.

215
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,100
And Trirat’s practically a carbon copy of my dad.

216
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,580
But two tigers
can’t share the same cave.

217
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,100
Well, I guess it’s a good thing

218
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,660
we’ve got nothing in common.

219
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,380
Is there a chance that
Wiwat Siam and Nititham

220
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,620
will join forces to form a government?

221
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,660
You’ll have to ask whether

222
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,380
Mr. Khunawut is on board with running
a truly corruption-free government.

223
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,180
Should we name them outright,

224
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,540
so the accused has a chance
to respond?

225
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,620
Sure. We will never join hands
with the party responsible

226
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,700
for one of the biggest
corruption scandals,

227
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,020
the Puea Khwam Wang Party.

228
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,100
And the reason I’m asking
Mr. Khunawut is because,

229
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,620
back then, Wiwat Siam was standing
alongside Nititham in the opposition.

230
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,420
But when it’s time to face the press about the Prime Minister betraying the nation,

231
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,340
Wiwat Siam left Nititham

232
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,860
to take the heat alone.

233
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,700
If you want my party’s trust,

234
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,220
you have to be crystal clear
with the public.

235
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,660
Are you referring to the leaked photos
of an alleged secret deal

236
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,700
between Mr. Withu, your son,
and Mr. Phasakorn?

237
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
It’s not just the sons.

238
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,660
Their fathers seem to go way back, too.

239
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,460
Mr. Khunawut was practically
deferential to Mr. Phanu.

240
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,700
It wasn’t about deference.

241
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,940
At that time,
the evidence we had was too weak.

242
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,020
And Nititham also wanted
to make a name for themselves.

243
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,140
And now the results are clear
that there was merit to it.

244
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,460
And it wasn’t just Phanu who was corrupt

245
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,460
it was the entire party.

246
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,540
Looks like Tritrat’s
really catching fire people

247
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,420
are buzzing about her all over social media,
even during work hours.

248
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,380
Let’s all take a breath.

249
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,220
Shouldn’t Puea Khwam Wang
get a chance to respond?

250
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,260
Thank you, Mr. Kamol,
for the opportunity to clarify.

251
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,040
Let me lay out the facts

252
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,980
so Ms. Trirat and the public
are informed at the same time.

253
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,140
Currently, no one in Puea Khwam Wang
is facing criminal charges.

254
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,980
So what you have mentioned
about our entire party being corrupted

255
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,460
might be an overstatement.

256
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,820
Moreover, our party has always
cooperated with the investigations.

257
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,020
To be fair, I think these matters
should be judged individually.

258
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,980
I stand by the fact that Puea Khwam Wang
is just as clean as Nititham.

259
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,980
So does that mean Puea Khwam Wang
would be willing to join hands with Nititham?

260
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,020
Of course,

261
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,380
we can work with any party
that puts the people first.

262
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,460
How about Nititham?

263
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,180
Absolutely not.

264
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,420
We won’t collaborate
with a party that has half

265
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,340
of the executive board
just recently resign,

266
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:24,700
after we exposed their corruption
for a second time.

267
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,420
And I’m confident
we could uncover a third,

268
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,140
even a fourth round of wrongdoing.

269
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,020
That’s quite a call.

270
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,860
Puea Khwam Wang,
what’s your response?

271
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,460
What more can we say?

272
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:45,140
We’ll keep proving that Puea Khwam Wang
is truly the people’s beacon of hope.

273
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,060
And can you confirm that your father,
who’s currently in monkhood,

274
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,460
isn’t running the party
from his monastery, as rumored?

275
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,900
I can confirm that he’s left
the worldly matters behind.

276
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,380
He’s a true monk.

277
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,140
And currently, I’m the only person
leading Puea Khwam Wang.

278
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,500
Ease up, bro.

279
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,820
He came out swinging
for the Puea Khwam Wang Party

280
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,820
not at us.

281
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,860
Don’t be too optimistic.

282
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,860
I think we should ask every party outright,

283
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,420
who’s willing to team up
with the corrupt?

284
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,420
Alright,
Pattana Thai, Sangkom Seri

285
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,340
could you work with them?

286
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,140
No.

287
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,660
A hundred percent no.

288
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,540
And Wiwat Siam? Can you commit?

289
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,460
I think Ms. Tritrat
is a bit too quick to judge.

290
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,740
If it takes a second corruption scandal
before people finally resign,

291
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,540
that’s pretty telling.

292
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,340
The only thing unclear here
is your answer.

293
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,460
I respect the courts
and the will of the people.

294
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,940
And, most importantly,

295
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,860
I’m not going to play judge
and jury like you.

296
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,820
Nititham stands firmly
against the corrupt.

297
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,900
Is Wiwat Siam too afraid to say the same?

298
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,660
If the court finds them guilty,

299
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,420
Wiwat Siam will step away
and won’t work with them.

300
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,660
What the hell did you just say?

301
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,460
Huh? What the hell did you say?

302
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,260
How can you blame my father like that?

303
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,440
Huh?

304
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,700
What are you looking at?
What are you staring at?

305
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,060
I’m warning you,
don’t say stupid shit like that again.

306
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,140
Hold this.

307
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,060
So, you’re not mad at me anymore?

308
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,900
And you can still joke around
after all that?

309
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,460
I’m not joking.

310
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,860
Just tell me you’re not mad anymore.

311
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,540
So at least that’s one good thing today.

312
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,980
Why?

313
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,620
Was it really that bad?

314
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,300
Our party just slipped to second place.

315
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,740
That’s not surprising,

316
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,060
when your father went
that hard against the tide.

317
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,340
That’s why I pushed for us
to make our stance

318
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,300
that we are not going to join forces
with Puea Khwam Wang.

319
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,220
And that’s when Jes decked you?

320
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,340
He accused me of blaming
our drop on our father.

321
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,980
When I’m the one
in the photos with Sun.

322
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,420
Didn’t you already clear that up?

323
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,460
Did I? Really?

324
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,500
I didn’t know this party
had a corner like this

325
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,460
pretty chill.

326
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,420
When I was a kid,

327
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,940
I’d sneak here whenever I couldn’t
follow the grown-ups talking politics.

328
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,340
This was my hiding spot.

329
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,500
Everything’s easy when you’re a kid.

330
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,420
There’s nothing to stress about,

331
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,700
so damn happy.

332
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,260
Wait,

333
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,620
did I say something wrong?

334
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,420
No.

335
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,540
It’s just, this isn’t the first time
Jes attacked me,

336
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,220
and I ended up sitting right here.

337
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,260
Want to tell me more?

338
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,980
Jes, Tee, Nun,

339
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,980
they’re kids from his first wife.

340
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,060
My mom was the second.

341
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,820
When she was pregnant with me,

342
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,740
my father didn’t even know
because she ran away from him.

343
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,580
By the time he brought us back,
I was already in kindergarten.

344
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,580
We were always the outsiders.

345
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,740
And when she died,

346
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,740
I was the only one left.

347
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,540
It isn’t you.

348
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,340
Your dad and your brothers

349
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,060
are the real weird ones.

350
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,220
Still, I wanted to feel like
I’m one of them.

351
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,460
I guess it’s just some childish
wish that never left me,

352
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,100
to be accepted,

353
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,860
to matter,

354
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,900
To feel like

355
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,840
I’m a part of the family too.

356
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,340
You’ve got every right to feel that way.

357
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,460
You’re really strong.

358
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,260
Still trying to do right by those people.

359
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,980
If it were me,

360
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:51,900
I’d be bitter,

361
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,620
maybe even hate them forever.

362
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
But listen,

363
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,900
if the pain’s worth it,

364
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,020
I’ll stay right here beside you.

365
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,060
And if the day comes
when you can’t take it anymore,

366
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,500
just walk away.

367
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,820
You’ll still find me right beside you,

368
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,220
as always.

369
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,460
It’s my birthday today.

370
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,180
Not that my father remembers.

371
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,940
Happy birthday to you…

372
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,900
Happy birthday to you…

373
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,100
Happy birthday, happy birthday

374
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,780
Happy birthday,

375
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,980
Withu.

376
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,860
Happy birthday,

377
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,020
At least this year,

378
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,900
there’s one more person
to remember your birthday.

379
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,140
That’s me.

380
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,420
Don't cry.

381
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,820
Come on.

382
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Blow out your candle.

383
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,140
Happy birthday.

384
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,620
Ni booked tickets
to Phu Chalerm for us.

385
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,420
Then let’s go

386
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,820
Election Day is buzzing with energy.

387
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,820
The prime ministerial candidates
were out early to cast their votes.

388
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,780
Ms. Tritrat and Mr. Khunawut
showed up with their families.

389
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,860
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

390
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,940
Mr. Phasakorn arrived early

391
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,860
and headed straight to the party
headquarters after he voted.

392
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:03,140
Up next, the ‘Star & Moon’ ship shows
no sign of slowing down.

393
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,220
After casting his ballot
with his father in the morning,

394
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,220
Mr. Withu flew that afternoon
to Phu Chalerm to cheer on Dr. Nong.

395
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,540
Valid ballot, No.8.

396
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,060
Valid ballot, No.2.

397
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,900
- It’s now 10 PM.
- Yes.

398
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,260
Nearly all of the unofficial results are in,

399
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,740
- and they’re lining up closely with the polls.
- Yes.

400
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,980
Wiwat Siam and Nititham
snatched nearly 150 seats each.

401
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,580
The election results are in, Suwit.

402
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,260
We have to admit that Wiwat Siam
did better than expected this year.

403
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,020
But not enough to overcome
Nititham’s momentum.

404
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,500
Yes.

405
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,660
In the end, Nititham comes first

406
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,860
- with 156 seats.
- That’s right.

407
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,980
Wiwat Siam takes second
with 148 seats,

408
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,700
with Puea Khwam Wang close behind
with 96 seats.

409
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,780
Hey,

410
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
what are you stressing about?

411
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,700
We haven’t even celebrated me,
the rookie MP.

412
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,980
Your cheer squad’s all knocked out.

413
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,780
Come on,

414
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,620
even if Nithitham wins this election,

415
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,900
that doesn’t mean we’ve lost, right?

416
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,300
No.

417
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,980
The real game just started.

418
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,540
When we finally have the points to play.

419
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,660
Exactly.

420
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,180
We’ll have to play
the game you hated the most.

421
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,100
Well,

422
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,100
we’re already on the field.

423
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,700
If we don’t play, we get played.

424
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,060
You know,

425
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,340
you’re more like my father than I am.

426
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,340
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

427
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,020
It is. He was exactly like this,

428
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,100
all about the work, helping people,

429
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,340
charging head-on.

430
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,460
Does that mean I can be Prime Minister?

431
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,980
Is that what you want?

432
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,140
Didn’t use to, not before all this.

433
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,460
But once I stepped in
and saw how it works,

434
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,340
I kept thinking:

435
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,140
if I’ve got the power to change things,

436
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,620
why shouldn’t I try?

437
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,540
Don’t worry,

438
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,700
leave that to me.

439
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,220
Fine.

440
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,460
I’ll do as you say.

441
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,660
Because we must be in government,
whatever it takes.

442
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,900
Otherwise, if Ning wakes up,

443
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,420
I won’t be able to look her in the eye.

444
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,260
I told you before

445
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,900
we’re here to do something big.

446
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,620
Now that we’re at the gates
of Government House,

447
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,980
I’m not backing down.

448
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,580
Your job is to stay loved
by the people

449
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,020
that matters most when we take power.

450
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,500
As for the deals, leave those to me.

451
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,460
Just trust me.

452
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,780
Trust you?

453
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,140
Alright.

454
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,980
I'll trust you.

455
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,060
From now on,
I’ll do exactly as you say.

456
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,420
There’ll be no questions,

457
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,380
no doubts.

458
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,020
You good with that?

459
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,420
Thank you.

460
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,100
No, thank you.

461
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,380
Without you,

462
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,420
I’d never have made it this far.

463
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,860
Really, thank you.

464
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,660
That’s alright.

465
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,620
It’s all because you are my dear friend.

466
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,660
Yeah.

467
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,940
A dear friend.

468
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,300
With results like these,

469
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,540
I trust you won’t mind
if I claim a few more seats.

470
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,820
I’ll also be taking first pick
of the ministries.

471
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,500
I think I’ve already discussed that
with your father.

472
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,100
If this is about his case,

473
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,540
remember, Tritrat might be
better positioned to help.

474
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,860
So what do we tell the people?

475
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,220
Sun,

476
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,620
there are bigger challenges ahead.

477
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,620
The country has to move forward,

478
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,820
and I’m not the kind
to cling to old grudges.

479
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,940
I’m ready to put conflict behind us
and put our people first.

480
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,180
I think ‘new blood’

481
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,780
isn’t just a slogan for the voters.

482
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,380
Auntie, you can speak to me directly.

483
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,660
Talking to me is like talking to my father.

484
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,820
Can you make the calls now,

485
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,620
or do you still run back
and report everything?

486
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,020
You’ve known me since I was a kid

487
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,180
but I’m not that kid anymore.

488
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,580
I know.

489
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,220
And honestly, I’d rather be
making this deal with you than with him.

490
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,060
This is how we flip the game
and get back in power.

491
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,500
Thank you.

492
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,500
Leave the public sentiment to me.

493
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,780
All you need to do is lock down
the deals behind the scenes.

494
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,700
I’m here today to say this,

495
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:49,260
the rumor of a staged smear
campaign is true.

496
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,580
I’m at the Election Commission

497
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,900
to petition for the dissolution
of the Nititham Party.

498
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,060
We cannot allow a party

499
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,220
that runs on 'fighting corruption'

500
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,300
while committing crimes
to lead this country.

501
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,220
How can we let them
form the government?

502
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,460
Nititham is deceiving our fellow citizens.

503
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,140
The keyword here is ‘the public no longer trusts Nititham.’

504
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,180
If they dodge the question,
press until they answer.

505
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,340
Alright, let’s go with that.

506
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,660
Alright.

507
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,020
What is it?

508
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,660
Uh… Nothing.

509
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,780
I was wondering,
now that the election’s over,

510
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,140
we can just use
our money again like normal, right?

511
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,260
Yeah.

512
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,180
What are you trying to buy?

513
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,140
Nothing.

514
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,380
I was asking just in case.

515
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,780
I don’t wanna accidentally
cross a line, that’s all.

516
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,300
Come on,

517
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,100
what’s this really about?

518
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,340
Nothing.

519
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,260
That’s it.

520
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,460
So,

521
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,220
how are things on your end?

522
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,140
So this was about the deal?

523
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,620
Not exactly.

524
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,260
I just wanna know
how you’re holding up.

525
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,540
Stressful? Getting chewed out
by your dad? By Jes?

526
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,660
It doesn’t matter what I do,
I get chewed out anyway.

527
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,940
If it gets too much,

528
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,660
just say the word.

529
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,060
I’ll happily knock
one of them out for you.

530
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,860
Been wanting to, actually.

531
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,260
What, you’re gonna punch my father?

532
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,940
Jes, obviously.

533
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,220
Don’t bother.

534
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,900
So, can I ask

535
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,300
who you’re cutting deals with?

536
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,660
You’re worried I’ll have to deal
with Phasakorn, aren’t you?

537
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,300
I’m not trying to get in your business.

538
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,460
But I just can’t stand that arrogant prick.

539
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,380
Knew it.

540
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,540
Nailed you spot-on.

541
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,860
Guess you really do know me.

542
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,340
Your company’s power concession
has already been renewed.

543
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,060
I won’t be canceling the contract,

544
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,180
so there’s no need
for you to come in person.

545
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,340
So, in that case… what if we ask for

546
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,500
an extra Grade A
deputy minister slot instead?

547
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,140
Let me calculate.

548
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,500
If we minus 47

549
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,620
and find another 2
or 3 small parties to fill in.

550
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,700
There’ll be enough to
form a government.

551
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,420
See?

552
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,660
Keeping the bloc big is more stable.

553
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,100
Anuwat, You should trust him.

554
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,340
Easy for you to say. You got Agriculture.

555
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,460
I didn’t get a single Grade A ministry.

556
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,620
Wut trusted me
when it comes to Agriculture.

557
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,100
You got Tourism and Digital,
didn’t you? Just let it go.

558
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,300
Ah, Rak Kaset, right?

559
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,420
Yes, sir.

560
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,420
Alright.

561
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,780
How about Deputy Minister of Industry?

562
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,860
Well, Agriculture
already has two deputies.

563
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,540
Could I get just one of those?

564
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,140
How many seats
does your party have again?

565
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,780
Just 5, right?

566
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,580
And you want a Grade A?

567
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,660
Well,

568
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,460
then, the Ministry of Industry
would be fine too, sir.

569
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,860
Okay, that’s settled.

570
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,860
So, Sun, what do you want?

571
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,100
Staying on at the Ministry of Commerce?

572
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,220
There’s no way
I’m giving Commerce up.

573
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,860
I’ve got too many projects lined up.

574
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,180
What else?

575
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,020
I want Interior,

576
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,540
Transport,

577
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,020
and Public Health.

578
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,540
That’s already more than
what I promised your father.

579
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,540
He only asked for
one Grade A ministry,

580
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,700
and to clear the case.

581
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,060
My father said he won’t
trouble you any longer.

582
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,740
He asked me to inform you that

583
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,380
I’ll be handling everything,
including today’s deal.

584
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,820
He’s not usually the kind
to let go that easily.

585
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,580
Guess he’s been studying the Dhamma
and shedding attachments.

586
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,460
Fine.

587
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,780
Interior and Transport.

588
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,500
But I’m keeping a deputy slot.

589
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,980
And saving Public Health for Ying.

590
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,900
Saving it for Aunty Ying,
or Dr. Nong?

591
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,580
His credentials aren’t there yet.

592
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,360
But making him a deputy
would give the cabinet some shine,

593
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,740
don’t you think?

594
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,620
Sounds like your nephew
talked you into this, huh?

595
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,700
Right, Vee?

596
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,460
Aunty Ying just happens
to agree with me.

597
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,900
Either way, there’ll be drama,
coalition squabbles,

598
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,140
or a cabinet packed
with familiar surnames.

599
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,340
Vee, you’re overthinking.

600
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:36,860
I don’t think you get the point.
‘Family’ is good branding in Thailand.

601
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,740
Father as PM,

602
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,340
me as his deputy,

603
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,420
that’s a strong message of stability.

604
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,260
Isn’t that right, father?

605
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,140
Alright. I agree,

606
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,780
let’s give the people’s darling
a deputy slot.

607
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,900
Just give me the title, okay?

608
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,860
As for the work,
you can speak directly to Aunt Ying.

609
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,020
Then, can you push Dr. Chalong
as Permanent Secretary?

610
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,460
I’ve been talking with him
about telemedicine.

611
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,740
Sure.

612
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,900
I’ve been planning
remote healthcare anyway.

613
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,340
But I want to establish it nationwide,
not just run a pilot program.

614
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,340
It’ll cost a lot.

615
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,780
So I plan to drop the ‘See the doc,
skip the line’ policy.

616
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,060
I ran the numbers,

617
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,420
and there’s no way we’ll have enough
to pay for more staff.

618
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,260
That’s our flagship policy.

619
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,300
Telemed is my flagship, too.

620
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,260
And it still fits the ‘See the doc, skip the line’ concept.

621
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,460
It’s just not exactly
what Dr. Nong wanted.

622
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,300
That won’t work.

623
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,780
A lot of people voted for us
because of Dr. Nong’s policy.

624
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,100
Without it, we wouldn’t have
gotten over a hundred seats.

625
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,740
If it really worked,

626
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,500
you’d be saying ‘the number one party’
instead of ‘over a hundred seats.’

627
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,580
Even the actual top party
doesn’t have that kind of ego.

628
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,980
They’ve even agreed to push
our Grassroots Fund policy,

629
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,740
and we only came third.

630
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,460
Enough.

631
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,060
Sun’s policy stays.

632
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,860
But what about ours...

633
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,260
Vee, what did I tell you and the doctor
when you came to pitch?

634
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,420
Even if we can’t add more doctors,
improving the system also counts.

635
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,420
That’s not breaking the promise.

636
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,700
I don’t think it’s a big deal,

637
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,420
unless you insist on making it one.

638
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,580
Alright, then it’s settled.
Right, Sun?

639
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,380
I haven’t even asked
for a small ministry yet.

640
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,380
You’re even more cutthroat
than your father.

641
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,060
Pick up the phone.

642
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,140
Yes?

643
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,300
Vee, There’s someone
who wants to see you.

644
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,340
Dr. Ning?!

645
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,620
The house is lively again!

646
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,100
Drop by when you’re free, Vee.

647
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,660
Yes, Uncle.

648
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:41,060
I’ve got to run,
there’s an urgent meeting.

649
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,060
Okay,

650
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,380
focus on work.

651
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,300
See you tomorrow.

652
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,500
Okay.

653
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,460
What’s wrong?

654
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,460
I can’t take this.

655
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,860
I feel so damn guilty.

656
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:13,300
After the House’s first ordinary session,

657
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,540
the prime-minister vote is set
three days from now.

658
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,020
It’s bound to be tense.
It’s sure to be a tense stretch.

659
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,220
Nititham has expelled Krerkphol
from the party.

660
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:39,340
I can confirm that his actions were his own

661
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,380
and the party wasn’t involved.

662
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:44,780
Ms. Trirat,

663
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,860
How concerned are you about
a party-dissolution case?

664
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,660
The Constitutional Court hasn’t yet received
a petition from the Election Commission.

665
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,740
Do you expect to succeed
in forming a government?

666
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,580
Talks are ongoing.

667
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:06,060
Given these cases,
is public distrust part of the reason?

668
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,580
We may have made a mistake by admitting
a member who turned out to be corrupt,

669
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:16,260
but the Nititham Party remains clean.

670
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,660
You said

671
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,300
Puea Khwam Wang’s removal
of indicted members was just for show

672
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:28,580
and that you’d never join a coalition
with a party with a corrupt past.

673
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,860
So how is Nititham any different now?

674
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,860
As for the matter of Mr. Krerkphol’s case,

675
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:40,780
there’s no evidence that anyone
in our party was involved.

676
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,980
You sound just like Phasakorn.

677
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,180
By the standard you used
against other parties,

678
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,860
can the public still trust Nititham,

679
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,260
or is this a double standard?

680
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,260
Good afternoon, members of the press
and fellow citizens.

681
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:12,380
Thailand is at a political impasse

682
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:19,020
Nititham won 156 seats and,

683
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,780
by convention, as the first right
to form a government.

684
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:27,960
However, recent conduct
has shaken public confidence.

685
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,140
There are questions about whether
those votes were earned cleanly.

686
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,740
Therefore, we, Wiwat Siam,

687
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,460
Pattana Thai, Sangkom Seri,
and Rak Kaset

688
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,140
that share the same values
with the people,

689
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,340
will not vote Ms. Trirat
as the prime minister,

690
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:02,260
and we will not join a coalition led
by the Nititham Party.

691
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,860
Why isn’t Puea Khwam Wang included?

692
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,500
The parties here hold 232 seats.

693
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,980
Adding Puea Khwam Wang’s 96
makes 328,

694
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,780
which is an outright majority.

695
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,780
That could be viewed as
attempting to form a rival government,

696
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,540
which is not the purpose
of today’s statement.

697
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,500
Are you worried Nititham may partner
with Puea Khwam Wang

698
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,100
and smaller parties
to secure a majority?

699
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,300
It’s possible.

700
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,620
But if Nititham, after campaigning
on ‘fighting corruption,’

701
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,820
then swallows its pride
to join Puea Khwam Wang,

702
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,020
That would be a very ugly government.

703
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,540
Vee,

704
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,740
what time are you getting back
to the condo tonight?

705
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,380
I’m staying home tonight

706
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,060
probably talking with Dad till late.

707
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,620
Oh, okay.

708
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,300
Then never mind.

709
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:07,700
See you at Parliament tomorrow.

710
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:08,940
Okay,

711
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,860
that’s it.

712
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,420
Whoever becomes prime minister today,
there will be doubts.

713
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,380
Khun Trirat still has
a party-dissolution case under review,

714
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,020
and Khunawut’s party finished second.

715
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,700
Neither side has more than 250 votes,

716
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,500
so the swing lies
with the Puea Khwam Wang Party,

717
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,380
which holds 96 seats.

718
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:51,900
If they abstain, Khunawut who’s backed
by the anti-Nititham bloc of 232

719
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,700
would almost certainly win
a second term.

720
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,300
Doctor,
why isn’t Vee with you today?

721
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:01,700
No idea

722
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,660
we’re not living together.

723
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:14,820
All right. The Speaker has certified
the two nominees for prime minister

724
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,620
Mr. Khunawut and Ms. Trirat.

725
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,220
We will now proceed to an open vote.

726
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:30,780
If you approve of Khunawut
as prime minister,

727
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,540
say ‘approve.’

728
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,820
If not, say ‘disapprove.’

729
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,420
If you abstain, say ‘abstain.’

730
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,780
Approve.

731
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,780
Approve.

732
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,820
Disapprove.

733
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,140
Approve.

734
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,940
Approve.

735
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,060
Disapprove.

736
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,380
Disapprove.

737
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,180
Disapprove.

738
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,820
Number 274,

739
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,980
Mr. Phasakorn Intharadanai.

740
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,020
Abstain.

741
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,260
Here we go,

742
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,860
this bowl’s Dad’s, This one’s Ning’s.

743
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,940
I’ve warmed them just right.

744
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,820
Let Dad feed you.

745
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,460
Say “ahh,” kiddo, ahh.

746
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,100
Do we really need the “ahh,” Dad?

747
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,020
Ning isn’t a kid.

748
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,900
I’m her father,
my kids are always children to me.

749
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,580
Then feed me too,

750
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,060
ahhh.

751
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,580
Looking for trouble this early,
you little punk?

752
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,260
Hi, Vee. What up?
Why are you calling this early in the morning?

753
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,180
My dad wants to see you right away.

754
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:38,940
How urgent?

755
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,780
If it’s not one thing,
it’s another for Prime Minister Khunawut.

756
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,700
Before the PM vote,

757
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,300
the idea of a second-place party
forming the government

758
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:04,620
was already taking heat.

759
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,060
And yesterday,
a supposed cabinet lineup leaked online.

760
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:08,860
Yes.

761
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,300
The first big hit was nepotism:

762
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,740
father as PM, son as deputy PM,

763
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,540
and the sister as health minister.

764
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,060
What should have been ‘Khunawut I’

765
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:25,860
is being mocked
as the ‘Therdsaksakul Cabinet.’

766
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:26,820
That’s right.

767
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,180
And despite saying
no partners have been invited,

768
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,940
that leaked list shows Phasakorn
and Puea Khwam Wang

769
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,900
figures in top-tier ministries.

770
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:38,140
Whether it's Interior or Transport,

771
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,220
making it look like the deal’s
already been made.

772
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,700
The bottom line is they’re getting
hammered before they’ve even started.

773
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,260
You heard right.

774
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,140
I called you in to take the Minister
of Public Health position.

775
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,380
Are you okay with that?

776
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:07,660
Yes.

777
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,060
I’ll do my very best.

778
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,500
We’re on the same team now, Doctor.

779
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:16,540
Sorry, what do you mean?

780
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,380
I’m your deputy minister.

781
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,220
Straight talk, Doctor

782
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:27,100
partly, this is to blunt
the ‘family cabinet’ criticism.

783
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,540
But I have been eyeing this post
for you from the start.

784
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,460
So, please look after my sister.

785
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,500
I should be learning from Ms. Ying.

786
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,540
Let’s just say we’re colleagues.

787
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:50,220
And you can call me Ying.

788
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:51,780
Yes, Ying.

789
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:58,660
I’ll give it everything and move fast
on our campaign pledges.

790
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,340
There’s one thing you need to know

791
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,100
about the
‘See the Doc, Skip the Line’ campaign.

792
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,100
Yes.

793
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,140
We’ll have to shift funds
from hiring more doctors to telemedicine

794
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,500
since we need to align
with coalition policy as well.

795
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:20,140
I understand. But can’t we do both?

796
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,940
You know the total budget isn’t enough.

797
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,180
It has to go into the flagship policy.

798
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,900
Flagship policy?

799
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,500
Which one are you talking about?

800
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:36,260
Well,

801
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,140
it’s the Eyes Wide Open Fund.
