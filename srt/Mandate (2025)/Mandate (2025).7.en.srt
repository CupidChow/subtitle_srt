1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,380
I must strike a deal with Sun.

2
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,580
What leverage are you going to use
to make them comply? a deal with Sun.

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,220
I’ll try talking to him first.
If that doesn’t work, we can reconsider.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,500
I’ve been using it for twenty years;
it’s just not legal in Thailand yet.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,260
My nephew will be investigated
through legal procedure.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,940
At that time, I was under
the influence of medication.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,100
So I chose Kamnan Tong.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,660
I'm afraid I might end up
causing my own father’s death.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,020
Mr. Tee has new evidence.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,620
There are records indicating
that Dr. Nong has shown...

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,060
signs of confusion
and absent-mindedness.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,820
This is very significant.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,460
It will be relevant in the upcoming
debate of no-confidence.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,100
The current government has failed

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,340
to uphold the promises it
made to the people.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,420
Moreover, it enabled influential groups
to build unchecked power,

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,900
fueling widespread corruption
in the bureaucracy.

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,220
The opposition parties have therefore
invoked Section 151 of the Constitution,

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,860
submitting a motion of no-confidence
targeting seven individual ministers.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,380
Firstly, Mr. Khunwut Terdsaksakul.

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,820
For failed governance,

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,180
lack of integrity and moral conscience,

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,580
and exploitation of the
Tele-Doctor program for personal gain.

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,500
About the bidding,
I’ve settled it with Med Tech and O.P.M.,

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,020
so there’s no way
any insider info leaks to Trirat.

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,460
During the debate,

27
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,900
you just need to present
the evidence for both phases.

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,420
It’ll look like a fair
and tight competition to the public.

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,860
No hint of collusion.

30
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,740
Then go tweak the spec details
for each company.

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,940
Check which parts give an edge
or disadvantage.

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,100
Make it look smooth.

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,140
Understood.

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,820
Next, Dr. Thanit Phonthongdee,
Minister of Public Health.

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,820
For alleged corruption tied to
the Tele-Doctor program,

36
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,380
violations of the code of ethics,

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,620
narcotics involvement,

38
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,180
and filing falsified documents
with the court.

39
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,580
So, is it true?

40
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,380
The evidence that Tee presented is fake.

41
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,260
I wasn’t asking you.
And I’m asking,

42
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,220
is it true or not?

43
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,420
I messed up back then.

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,540
And yes, Chief Tong really died
because of it.

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,540
But like Vee said,
the evidence Tee showed is fake.

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,900
And that day, the nurse didn’t record
the mistake in the report either.

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,620
So, can you make this issue
disappear once and for all?

48
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,460
Yes, sir.

49
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,940
Then, in this no-confidence debate,

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,660
we should be able to get through it
without raising public suspicion.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,300
I want everyone to go back
and tell the MPs in their own factions

52
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,940
that getting into power wasn’t easy.

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,580
So don’t let anyone
make headlines again, ever.

54
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,100
Let me be clear, the surgical record
Mr. Kosum, also known as Tee,

55
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,020
presented as genuine is,

56
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,620
in fact, a fake
and fabricated document.

57
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,700
The nurse who actually recorded
the operation that day...

58
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
is this person.

59
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,100
Please, come in.

60
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,140
This is Maifah,

61
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,380
the nurse who recorded
the procedure that day.

62
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,180
I’ll let her explain
what really happened.

63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,420
Yes.

64
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,860
This was sabotage.

65
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,700
What happened in the operating room
that day was…

66
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,900
I stand by what I testified in court.

67
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,140
It was an unforeseen incident.

68
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,420
Dr. Nong did everything he could.

69
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,340
You did great.

70
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,620
Leave the rest to us.

71
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,020
I said what you told me to say.

72
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,700
I won’t go to jail, right?

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,180
I won’t let anything happen to you.

74
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,940
Thank you.

75
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,100
Maifah was your witness at trial, correct?

76
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,020
That’s right.

77
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,180
Then she’d have to stand by
her testimony that you’re innocent.

78
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,420
Otherwise, what she said in court
would amount to perjury,

79
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,700
wouldn’t it?

80
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,100
Is that true? Or is it not?

81
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,180
The court questioned us...

82
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,580
and ruled that both
Maifah and I told the truth.

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,100
As for this so-called new evidence,

84
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,380
it hasn’t been verified as authentic.

85
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,620
So there will be no retrial.

86
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,380
For the time being, I’d like to ask everyone
to respect the court’s verdict.

87
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,100
If Nong makes a statement like that

88
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,740
and we don’t move fast,

89
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,580
he’s going to walk for sure.

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,060
As long as we can’t prove
the surgical record is fake,

91
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,660
we can’t flat-out call Dr. Nong guilty either.

92
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,100
Then make it real, fast.

93
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,780
Get that bastard Nong thrown in jail.

94
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,940
It is fake.

95
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,940
How are we supposed to claim it’s real?

96
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,100
Do that, and Nong won’t sit still,

97
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,140
he’ll dig hard to prove the truth.

98
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,420
So what now?

99
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,100
You’re the one who said
we could get him locked up.

100
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,460
I said it would shake him. That’s all.

101
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,860
Well, he’s clearly fine.

102
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,980
Do something about it!

103
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,740
You don’t get it.

104
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,540
Just stay out of this.

105
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,660
I’ll handle the rest.

106
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,020
This isn’t what we agreed on.

107
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,220
Or do you want an investigation to show
the documents are forged?

108
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,060
Then you could end up in prison

109
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,140
for falsifying records
and filing a false report.

110
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,940
I know all

111
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,860
you care about is rattling him.

112
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,820
But I’m begging you

113
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,060
to bring justice for my father.

114
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,340
I feel for you.

115
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,660
But this is as far as it goes.

116
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,380
Please…

117
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,300
Get him jailed.

118
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,460
You’d get rid of him

119
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,300
and free up the post, too.

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,060
Please, sir…

121
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,420
Get out of here.

122
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,780
Sir, I’m begging you.

123
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,300
Please help me. Please sir.

124
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,260
Sir, please. I’m begging you.

125
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,340
- You have to help me. Please, sir.
- Hey!

126
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,220
You have to help me. Sir, please help me.

127
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,180
Let go. I said, let go!

128
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,660
Sir, please.

129
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,940
You have to help me.

130
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,380
You’re my only hope…

131
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,780
Sir…

132
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,180
Sir…

133
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,540
For this no-confidence debate,
just go through the motions.

134
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,540
Think of it as sharpening our game
against the opposition.

135
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,940
Still feels pretty heavy, though.

136
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,900
Exactly, sir. The situation with Dr. Nong
still isn’t resolved.

137
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,100
Sun says he’ll sort it out quickly…

138
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,140
isn’t that right?

139
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,140
Of course.

140
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,060
We’re all on the same team here.

141
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,340
Or is someone
having a problem with that?

142
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,580
Just grumbling a little.

143
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,340
Whatever the main party decides,
we’ll follow.

144
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,620
Hearing that from you
eases my mind.

145
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,660
So what, everything I said before
carried no weight?

146
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,740
No, sir.

147
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,380
I know you want a cabinet reshuffle.

148
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,780
Should I do it
without your party in the room?

149
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,820
Oh, no, it’s not that serious, sir.

150
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,420
If anyone has doubts or issues,
say it here and now.

151
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,780
Let’s clear the air.

152
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,820
But if no one speaks up,

153
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,220
don’t let me find out later
you’ve been talking behind my back.

154
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,740
Out of all people,

155
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,980
you should know just how weak
Khunawut’s government really is.

156
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,100
Why waste your time
on a washed-up old man

157
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,700
when you’re more than ready to step up?

158
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,220
Let’s not make the people wait
any longer for our government.

159
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,300
I want to work,
I don’t want to be Prime Minister.

160
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,380
How long has it been since we Phu Chalerm
folks were all together like this?

161
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,380
Didn’t you say you had something
to discuss with Dr. Nong, Nath?

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,540
I don’t think I’ve got anything
to say to the Minister.

163
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,900
No one wants to talk to
a scandal-ridden minister like me, Supa.

164
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,420
Oh, Dr. Nong…

165
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,620
Only people who’ve never done anything
have never made mistakes.

166
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,180
Don’t worry about
the censure debate,

167
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,740
you’ll get through it for sure.

168
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,860
It’s not going to be that easy, Supa.

169
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,620
If it were, Vee wouldn’t be
calling strategy meetings like this.

170
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,140
Khim, may I speak with you?

171
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,220
- Uh, well…
- Right now.

172
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,220
What’s going on, Ni?
Why does it seem so serious?

173
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,420
We’ve found a Turncoat.

174
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,940
Come on… Khim? Really?

175
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,340
Yes. We just haven’t
caught her red-handed yet.

176
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,060
Vee’s just going to tell her
we suspect her.

177
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,700
If we’re not wrong,

178
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,260
we’ll soon see
who she’s been talking to.

179
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,740
And from there, we’ll track down

180
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,220
who else they’ve tried to buy.

181
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,300
Oh my gosh,
there’s more of them!?

182
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,580
Okay. See you in half an hour.
I’ll be careful.

183
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,220
You said you had something
important to warn me about…

184
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,660
So I thought
I should bring Vee along too.

185
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,180
Hope that’s okay.

186
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,100
I’m a little disappointed
to find out it’s you.

187
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,500
What the hell did you do, Nath?

188
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,900
You seriously pulled this stunt without
thinking about how it reflects on me?

189
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,380
You betrayed the party,

190
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,700
and you were dumb enough to fall
into their trap, too?

191
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,980
Tell me right now.

192
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,060
You haven’t taken their money yet, right?

193
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,740
If you haven’t, I can go tell Vee,

194
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,380
and we’ll tell the party they approached you,
but you turned them down.

195
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,820
Answer me, damn it, Nath.

196
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,260
- I’m trying to help you here!
- Help me?

197
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,660
You’re just scared you’ll get hit
in the no-confidence debate.

198
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,180
You’re a turncoat.
They’ll crush you for it.

199
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,100
That’s why I’m talking to you.

200
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,740
You think I’m doing this for myself?

201
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,180
You haven’t taken their money yet, right?

202
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,740
Not yet.

203
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,980
Good. Go tell them you’re out.

204
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,700
I’m taking the money.

205
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,660
How much did they pay you, Nath?
How much to sell yourself like that?

206
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,180
Enough for me to finally get my work done.

207
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,500
There are other ways to get work done.

208
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,860
I’m just doing exactly
what you told me to.

209
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,660
Do whatever it takes to get the job done.

210
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,140
This just happens
to be the method you don’t like.

211
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,420
I’m here talking to you

212
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,060
because I care about you
and I want to help.

213
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,900
You’re like a brother to me.

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,380
Otherwise,
I would’ve let Vee take care of this.

215
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,900
Before you try to help me,
save yourself first.

216
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,300
Nath

217
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,020
You called me brother just because

218
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,860
you want to be another dirty politician.

219
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,140
If I stay with you as ‘brother’ any longer,

220
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,940
I’ll end up in prison for you,
just like Jump did.

221
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,060
Hello?

222
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,460
I’ve got something to report.

223
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,900
But this time, it’s not about drugs,

224
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,380
it’s something even bigger.

225
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,820
Could I get a little more bonus
for this one?

226
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,820
What Dr. Nong did was wrong,

227
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,780
but you’re the one who crossed the line.

228
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,860
I wish none of this had ever happened,

229
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,620
the thing with Dr. Nong,

230
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,860
and you turning into a turncoat.

231
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,260
You don’t have to sweet-talk me.

232
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,620
I’ve made my decision.

233
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,260
I’ve lost faith in your party.

234
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,700
Just let me go.

235
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,340
I can’t afford to lose
even a single vote.

236
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,420
Dr. Nong’s situation
is already hanging by a thread.

237
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,620
I’ve made my choice.

238
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,140
If I can’t persuade you…

239
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,020
I’m just doing my job.

240
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,060
Anyone joining our team
has to be vetted.

241
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,700
Back when you took that
sponsorship deal,

242
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,980
you probably didn’t know, right?

243
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,620
That it was money laundered
from an online gambling ring.

244
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
But if you don’t want to
explain that to the police,

245
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,460
then here’s the trade

246
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,100
You stay quiet about Dr. Nong,

247
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,100
and I’ll keep my mouth
shut about you.

248
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,380
Oh, and during the debate,

249
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,020
stay in line.

250
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,700
Here’s compensation for your time.

251
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,140
Thank you, sir.

252
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,900
So there are no backups
of the footage anywhere else?

253
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,580
There’s nothing else, sir.

254
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,140
No one can know about this.
Not even people at the party.

255
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,060
Understood.

256
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,620
Gale, we got it.

257
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,340
That security guy
charged us a fortune.

258
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,660
If there’s nothing shady
about the doctor in here,

259
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
it’s gonna be such a letdown.

260
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,780
Don’t be let down.

261
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,700
If there is something,
it’s good for the story.

262
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,020
If there’s nothing,
it’s good for the people.

263
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,020
Right?

264
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,780
Yeah, but not good for us.
That’s what we call a loss.

265
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,340
Congrats then, no loss here.

266
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,140
You don’t give us a break
with your scandals, don’t you, doc?

267
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,300
It’s been a while, hasn’t it,
Mr. Phasakorn?

268
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,620
Yes,

269
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,620
I believe the last time
was during the debate?

270
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,740
That’s right.

271
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,740
Funny, isn’t it?

272
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,620
Back then, we were rivals,

273
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,780
and now we’re in the same Cabinet.

274
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,860
And yet, still competing.

275
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,300
Who am I to compete
with the party leader?

276
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,340
I meant in terms of performance.

277
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,100
The first phase of your
Tele-Doctor Project is going pretty well.

278
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,220
I’ve been following it.

279
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,780
Thanks.

280
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,460
Honestly, working with Dr. Chalong
was actually fun.

281
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,340
But I doubt phase two
will be as fun for him

282
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,420
since the suppliers changed
from Med Tech to O.P.M.

283
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,420
Hmm… But is that
a good thing for you?

284
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,300
When you get grilled in the debate,
you can point out that you changed suppliers

285
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
to avoid favoritism.

286
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,260
Well, we don’t even need
to say that, right?

287
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Because the bidding process
in our country

288
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,140
is squeaky clean, isn’t it?

289
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,660
Exactly.

290
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,860
why the sudden spec change...

291
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,900
for Phase Two?

292
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,660
Med Tech was getting the benefits,

293
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,540
why surrender them
and switch to O.P.M.?

294
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,500
Doctor, you haven’t heard?

295
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:16,700
So your other half mentioned
it needed a special backroom deal,

296
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,980
has he?

297
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,660
What do you mean?

298
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,300
Well, if Vee hadn’t stayed up
all night talking to me,

299
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,300
this wouldn’t have gone
through so smoothly.

300
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,620
How about a little trip down
memory lane?

301
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,220
Where’d you go with Sun?

302
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,500
Did you sleep with him?

303
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,140
Where the hell is this coming from?

304
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,180
So it’s true, isn’t it?

305
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,100
Are you insane?
I didn’t do anything!

306
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,900
You really think I’d sleep with Sun?

307
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,540
Then tell me,

308
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,260
why the hell would he give up
the upper hand

309
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,100
and hand your dad hundreds of millions
from a rigged bid, just like that?

310
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,620
He just wanted to help me.
That’s all.

311
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,580
You’re not even good at lying anymore.

312
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,860
That’s the best excuse you’ve got?

313
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,900
What the hell is wrong with you?

314
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,020
We’ve been through so much crap

315
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,740
that we’re way past sitting
around worrying about lies, aren’t we?

316
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,020
Don’t touch me.

317
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,660
Because I never doubted you.

318
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,340
Not at all.

319
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,020
So that’s why you keep
stringing me along.

320
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,180
When I’m telling the truth,
you won't believe me.

321
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,180
What the hell am I supposed to do?

322
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,780
If it were you, would you believe it?

323
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,460
Would you buy that?

324
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,020
Sun tossed away hundreds
of millions after one talk?

325
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,300
You really think so?

326
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,740
Tell me, is there anything
you’ve said to me that’s real?

327
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,300
You haven’t even given me
the chance to explain!

328
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,100
Enough.

329
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,700
I don’t want to hear any more
of your lies.

330
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,660
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Stay away from me.

331
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,940
Come on, Doc.

332
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,420
Doc.

333
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,740
Get out.

334
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,980
Don’t let me see your face again.

335
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,740
Get out.

336
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,780
Get out!

337
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,460
This no-confidence debate is one to watch,

338
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,800
with issues including alleged favoritism,

339
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,940
narcotics,
and the case involving Chief Tong.

340
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,180
Dr. Nong, which issue
is your greatest concern?

341
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,060
Honestly…

342
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,100
none of them.

343
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,580
Because I didn’t do anything wrong.

344
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,300
Still as direct
and composed as always.

345
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,340
Let me put it this way:

346
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,300
I’m here to work,

347
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,740
not play politics.

348
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,540
If people out there say
I’m doing a bad job,

349
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,140
that hurts more than anything
the opposition can accuse me of.

350
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,820
So, you’re fully prepared for the debate?

351
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,980
I’m ready

352
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,540
hands, feet, whatever comes.

353
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,340
Wow, you’re in great spirits.

354
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,580
So, would you mind
if I move to a lighter question?

355
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,860
Go ahead.

356
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,900
Well, I’ve noticed from the monitor

357
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,500
that you’ve got a photo of you
and MP Withu displayed in your office.

358
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,460
Is that to serve the fans?

359
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,540
Apologies,

360
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:24,020
but I think it’s about time we all stop
paying attention to this ‘ship.’

361
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,180
I’d rather have people focus on my work

362
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,220
and whether I’ve delivered on
what I promised during the campaign.

363
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,340
Not this narrative that was spun...

364
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,740
and built up by someone else.

365
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,740
by someone else.

366
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,180
Let me be perfectly clear,
for the last time,

367
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,580
that MP Withu and I...

368
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,100
are simply party colleagues.

369
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,780
We work together

370
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,260
and there's nothing more.

371
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,660
Aren’t you happy I came to visit?

372
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,500
Over the moon.

373
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,900
But I just don’t want you
to see me like this.

374
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,140
Look at me.

375
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,260
From where I’m standing,

376
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,180
you’ve never looked cooler.

377
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,860
You don’t have to say it
to cheer me up.

378
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,140
At the end of the day,

379
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,940
I’m just some ex-con now.

380
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,220
You talk like I don’t know
you went to jail to protect Dr. Nong.

381
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,980
But no one else knows that.

382
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,340
Honestly?

383
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,980
I’m scared no one will ever know the truth.

384
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,980
And I’m scared that one day,

385
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,460
I’ll realize that I shouldn’t have gone
along with the plan.

386
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,580
I’m sorry, Jump.

387
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,180
Why are you apologizing?

388
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,500
You didn’t do anything wrong.

389
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,460
And don’t worry,

390
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,660
I could never be mad
at our Boss or Vee.

391
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,620
Don’t worry about it.

392
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,020
See?

393
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,060
That’s why I said
you look even cooler now.

394
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,020
Don’t worry.

395
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,860
No matter what people say,
when you get out,

396
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,260
I won’t be ashamed to walk beside you.

397
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,780
Are you giving me hope?

398
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,940
Yeah.

399
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,740
I always want the best for you.

400
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,260
Damn, that was kind of touching.

401
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,620
Stay strong.

402
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,340
Vee and I are trying
to find a way to get you out.

403
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,980
But right now

404
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,780
our team’s not the same anymore.

405
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,900
This CCTV footage shows
MP Nath of the Vivat Siam Party,

406
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,620
who suffered a head injury

407
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,780
and was rushed to the hospital
by fellow party member MP Withu.

408
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,900
Twenty minutes prior,

409
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,060
Dr. Nong had entered the room and remained
with MP Nath for nearly ten minutes.

410
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,940
What really happened inside that room?

411
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,500
And beyond that,
what has Dr. Nong done up to now?

412
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,260
Be it the narcotics issue
or the case of Chief Tong?

413
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,820
What is the truth?
This can’t go unanswered.

414
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,860
Vee asked me to tell you this:

415
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,420
if you’re going to lie low,
then lie low from everyone.

416
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,660
Keep your head down, stay quiet,

417
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,140
and wait for things to settle.

418
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:10,900
That’s it.

419
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,380
Doc,

420
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,700
I think you’ve taken it too far
by shutting Vee out on purpose like this.

421
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,100
He knows what’s going on,

422
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,820
and he’s still fighting for you.

423
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,100
Please,

424
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,180
you have to start listening to him.

425
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,300
You’re not in this alone.

426
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,220
You’re carrying all of our hopes.

427
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,180
That day, Dr. Nong
came to talk to me as usual.

428
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,980
But we had some disagreement.

429
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,380
I ran out to clear the air,

430
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,220
but I tripped over a power cord
and hit my head.

431
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,740
After Dr. Nong told MP Withu
we’d exchanged words,

432
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,140
he came to check on me.

433
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,300
When he walked in
and saw me unconscious,

434
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,540
he rushed me to the hospital.

435
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,340
That’s all there is to it.

436
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,260
Then why isn’t Dr. Nong here today
to explain it himself?

437
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,380
He had an urgent matter.

438
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,420
Are you sure
everything you’ve said is true?

439
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,940
You’re not covering for him?

440
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
I stand by it.

441
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,060
Don’t worry about Dr. Nong,
I’ve talked him down.

442
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,910
If there’s anything urgent, call Chatch
he’s turned his phone back on.

443
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,460
Thanks.

444
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,620
What’s Doc even mad about?

445
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,180
It’s just your ex still having feelings for you
what’s the big deal?

446
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,060
You know how Sun is,

447
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,940
he’s a pro at messing with people’s heads.

448
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,540
And our Dr. Nong is hot-headed enough
to walk right into it.

449
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,420
Keep an eye on him for me.

450
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,380
There’s so much drama lately,

451
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,020
I can barely catch my breath.

452
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,340
Blame Sun.

453
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,220
The whole party’s in chaos,
and he’s still stirring the pot.

454
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,060
Shit.

455
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,260
Why am I only seeing this now?

456
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,900
Exactly.

457
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,060
He’s playing hero for your dad
to rack up the points.

458
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,180
It’s more than that.

459
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,340
Sun didn’t back off
from the Med Tech deal

460
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,700
just to split me and Dr. Nong up.

461
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,540
He’s trying to bring down
the government.

462
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,500
Wouldn’t it be easier to just abstain
in the confidence vote?

463
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,940
Why make it complicated?

464
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,020
Think about it,

465
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,540
if parliament dissolves
and there’s a new election

466
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,580
while Dr. Nong’s still clean,

467
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,380
a political star, what happens?

468
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,500
Nothing changes. Or worse,
Sun might have to pay more for support.

469
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,780
Shit!

470
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,060
Do you think the current charges
were Sun’s doing?

471
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,700
That drug-search video leaked
from the cops to Gale?

472
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,340
I don’t need more proof to know
who’s behind it.

473
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,340
So now the party’s at odds with Dr. Nong,

474
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,020
and Dr. Nong is at odds with you.

475
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,620
Divide and conquer.

476
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,460
If our party weakens, who benefits?

477
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,340
Shit.

478
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,580
And I wouldn’t be surprised

479
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,580
if that fake Chief Tong
evidence was his, too.

480
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,140
He orchestrated all of it?

481
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,420
The thing is,

482
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,700
I think the real damage
hasn’t even started.

483
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,460
What are your thoughts on
the upcoming no-confidence debate?

484
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,300
I see it as nothing more than
an attempt to discredit the government.

485
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,340
But overall, we remain very stable.

486
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,820
Given the drop in public trust,

487
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,380
what strategy will you
and your coalition partners pursue?

488
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,420
Rest assured,

489
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,860
we’ll leave no room
for doubt about this government.

490
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,860
If someone crosses the line,
we’ll take decisive action,

491
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,460
we’ll deal with it decisively.

492
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,660
Are you referring to Dr. Nong?

493
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,140
Doctor, you should rest a bit.

494
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,100
When we’re near the condo,
I’ll swing by and pick up your usual congee.

495
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,100
Thanks, Chatch.

496
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,980
Why are we going this way?

497
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,380
Chatch?

498
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,540
Hey, Chatch

499
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,700
Chatch!

500
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,220
Let’s talk in the car.

501
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,980
How about
a little trip down memory lane?

502
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,860
Okay,

503
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,860
I wouldn’t have gone through with it,
you know.

504
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,220
The moment you didn’t consent,
it was already over.

505
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,380
There’s someone in your eyes.

506
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,260
But, even if I can’t win you back,

507
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,500
I don’t want you to hate me.

508
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,020
Can we still be friends?

509
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,180
Okay,

510
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:03,900
I’ll sign off on switching
the Tele-Doctor supplier to O.P.M.

511
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,780
Just don’t go around saying
I caved that easily.

512
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,660
Let me save a little face.

513
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Thank you.

514
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,580
About that 'trip down memory lane'...

515
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,140
How about a game of Catan?

516
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,380
I haven’t had anyone to play with
since I came back to the party.

517
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,900
Come on,

518
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,700
let’s pull an all-nighter like we used to.

519
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,740
Please?

520
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,260
All right then.

521
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,900
I’ll wait.

522
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,940
Maybe one day,
we’ll play Catan again.

523
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,780
Don’t wait for me.

524
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,500
You really don’t feel anything
for him anymore, do you?

525
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,980
After everything we’ve been through,

526
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,420
you still don’t trust me?

527
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,100
I just...

528
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,700
...wanted to hear it from you.

529
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,220
Okay.

530
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,540
I’m not going back to him,

531
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,540
no matter how good he is to me.

532
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,500
Whatever, I felt burned out
a long time ago.

533
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,700
You mean it?

534
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,540
Yeah.

535
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,180
And...

536
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,540
what he said about you
having someone else in your eyes…

537
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:24,340
So the way you kept
pressing me and losing it,

538
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,460
that wasn’t about me cutting
some deal on the side.

539
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,100
It was about something else, right?

540
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,180
How do you really feel about me?

541
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,340
Do I still have to say it?

542
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,620
I want to hear it from you.

543
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,540
That’s all.

544
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,740
You’re up?

545
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,740
Yep.

546
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,980
I’ll bring it over.

547
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,500
This is for you.

548
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,780
Thank you.

549
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,900
- Getting back at me?
- Just a little.

550
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,620
It’s just fried eggs and toast.

551
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:19,020
Nobody was here last week,
so I didn’t stock up.

552
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,780
Good to see you’re eating something.

553
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,540
You’ve gotten so skinny
I can see your ribs.

554
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,500
Was that a grope?

555
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,660
Was that payback?

556
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,860
Can’t help it.

557
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,060
I don’t eat, I just drink.

558
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,380
Too lazy to work.

559
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,940
Body’s a mess, mind’s worse.

560
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,100
Nobody really takes care of me.

561
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:54,020
When someone did,
you kicked him out, remember?

562
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,380
Sorry. Won’t happen again.

563
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,580
A politician’s promise? Please.

564
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,780
You can trust me.

565
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,180
Tell you what, I'll resign,

566
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,980
we’ll move back to Phu Chaloem,
and start a farm.

567
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,380
I’ll buy twenty buffalo.
We’ll get rich raising them.

568
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,180
You’re talking nonsense.

569
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,820
Eat your breakfast

570
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,180
and get to work.

571
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,740
Your ratings are in the gutter.

572
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,260
Time to step up, got it?

573
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,700
My ratings went downhill?

574
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,220
I don’t think so.

575
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,580
Because last night,
I premiered a brand-new performance.

576
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,260
First time, too.

577
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,620
So I’m wondering,
was the performance satisfactory?

578
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,540
Want to rate it?

579
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,500
Hmm…

580
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:18,180
It wasn’t exactly… clear.

581
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,300
Not clear enough?

582
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,260
Not clear enough?

583
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,940
You want it clearer?

584
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:29,900
Hey!

585
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,700
You want it to be crystal clear?

586
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,380
- Right here?
- Right here.

587
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,020
Let’s go.

588
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,740
This is for you.

589
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:46,900
You’re here?

590
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,580
With that goofy smile.
Did a girl send it to you?

591
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,460
Can’t a man smile just ‘cause he’s about
to eat something delicious?

592
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,460
Here,

593
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,460
since you're so nosy, take one.

594
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,300
Thanks, Doc!

595
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,020
Now get going.

596
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,980
Little croissant, huh?

597
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:51,420
If this phase three comes in at this number,
I really can’t go through with it.

598
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:54,500
Hey, why is it so hard for you
to understand?

599
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,740
No, sir, I just want to inform you that...

600
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,860
You want the contract, right?
Then how’s this acceptable, huh?

601
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,980
In that case, I suggest we should propose
an amendment to the TOR.

602
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:12,140
What you just heard
was a clip of a recorded call

603
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:16,060
between a senior government official

604
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,700
and a corporate representative,

605
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,060
colluding on a state project.

606
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:29,500
And here is the full transcript of that call.

607
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,020
Both the audio and the transcript
will be presented

608
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,980
in full during
the no-confidence debate.

609
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,860
Now that the evidence is out,
what’s our next move?

610
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,020
Illegally obtained audio
won’t stand anywhere.

611
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:48,500
And these days, everyone knows
AI can fake voices almost perfectly.

612
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,620
AI or not,
the public already believes it.

613
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,420
Let’s calm down.

614
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,420
I still think this government
can move forward.

615
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,180
We can only move forward
if the public is satisfied.

616
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,100
Why is everyone panicking?

617
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,380
I’m telling you,
it’s not as bad as it looks.

618
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,780
Honestly, Uncle. I think we should
reshuffle a few ministries.

619
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,340
I think we all agree,

620
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,860
right, Anuwat?

621
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,660
I’m for democracy.

622
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,460
I’ll go with the majority.

623
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,460
Exactly.
We need to follow people’s will.

624
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:33,020
Wiwat Siam had held
the power over the ministries,

625
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,620
and it hadn’t worked out.

626
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,980
Maybe it’s time the other
coalition partners took a turn.

627
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,740
Wouldn’t you agree, Prime Minister?

628
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:47,300
In that case, we should call
a full coalition meeting first.

629
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,340
But really, Uncle,
you could have decided this yourself.

630
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,060
We’re all family here.

631
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,540
So, Sun, what do you want?

632
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,140
Health, like you’ve always said?

633
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,180
The ministry under Dr. Nong,
even if nobody wants it,

634
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,100
you’ll have to replace him anyway, right?

635
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,460
Given where things stand,

636
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:11,940
Uncle, you should be listening to
what the rest of us want.

637
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,540
There’s too much
swirling around you, Doctor.

638
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,620
I’ll be blunt:

639
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:39,540
our party has to
vote no confidence in you.

640
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,700
Dad, I have a plan. I can handle this.

641
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,900
You’ve been watching
the numbers too, haven’t you?

642
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:03,340
It’s time we show the public
some sincerity.

643
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,540
Otherwise, this government won’t last.

644
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:08,900
Wait, sir.

645
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,500
If you remove me now,

646
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,180
there’ll be no one left
actually working for the people.

647
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:20,580
That’s not how the public sees it.

648
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:30,140
So this is ‘for the people,’ is it?

649
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,620
Are you removing me for them...

650
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,300
or for another party?

651
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,980
Don’t you think that crosses a line?

652
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,140
No, sir.

653
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:53,780
If anything,
I haven’t gone far enough.

654
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,420
You’re trying to lock in
other parties’ support

655
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,260
for your own confidence vote.

656
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,740
If you truly cared about the people,

657
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,660
trade any other ministry
but not this one.

658
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,740
You think you’re the only one working?

659
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:21,580
Governing means
seeing the big picture,

660
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,300
the party’s future,
and the government’s.

661
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,260
We can’t carry that
if we’re busy carrying you.

662
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,900
I can’t step down now, sir.

663
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,540
I still have so much to do.

664
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,100
No, Doctor.

665
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,140
There’s nothing more you can do.

666
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,340
If I have to clash with your father...

667
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,660
what would happen?

668
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:19,020
That's an even bigger thought
you must avoid.

669
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:23,940
And after the debate, Dr. Nong will
become the first minister in history

670
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,780
to be removed from office
by a no-confidence vote.

671
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,300
I'll help the Doctor.

672
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:29,700
What do you want?

673
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,100
I'm certainly not helping
that Doctor for free.

674
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,300
Who knows?

675
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,060
This debate round might
turn out to be entertaining.
