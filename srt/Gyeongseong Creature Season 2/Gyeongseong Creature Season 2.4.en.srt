GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

2
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,634
What is this place?

3
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,140
Let me out of here. Please?

4
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,641
Please take me with you.

5
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,393
Please!

6
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,068
Please help me.

7
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,447
Don't come close.

8
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,037
I might end up attacking you.

9
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,914
How are you here?

10
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,874
So get away from me, please.

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,751
Please!

12
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,806
Tae-sang!

13
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,034
You're awake.

14
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,787
What is this?

15
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,124
I'd like to hear what happened yesterday.

16
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,918
Who did you meet in that old factory?

17
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,633
Where are the others?

18
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,511
Call Yong-gil for me first.

19
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,972
Mr. Kwon is in critical condition.

20
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,769
He sustained a severe head injury,
which led to a brain hemorrhage.

21
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,772
He's currently in the ICU
after emergency surgery.

22
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,276
And where's the ICU?

23
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,070
I have to see him first. Uncuff me.

24
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,363
Not right now.

25
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,700
I need to see for myself what happened
and what condition he's in!

26
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,744
Take this off now.

27
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,247
I'm Yong-gil's guardian, okay?

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,750
We found a weapon that we suspect
had been used at the scene.

29
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,837
We only found traces of two people on it.

30
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,923
Hair and blood
seemingly belonging to Mr. Kwon,

31
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,759
and your fingerprints, Mr. Jang.

32
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,304
What are you saying?

33
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:03,433
You two were the only ones there,
and based on evidence and circumstances,

34
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:08,605
there is a high possibility
that you're the one who attacked Mr. Kwon.

35
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,857
Don't be ridiculous!

36
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,278
Why would I do such a thing to him?

37
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,905
Was it because of money?

38
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,822
What?

39
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,283
I heard Bugang Company had a lot of debt.

40
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,993
Do you want to start from there?

41
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,328
Look here, Detective.

42
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,872
Who's the woman that was with you?

43
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,081
What's her deal?

44
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,794
Is she the one who murdered
Madam Na and Oh Ki-hoon?

45
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,673
No.

46
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,635
If not, how is she connected
to the serial killer?

47
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,762
There's no connection whatsoever!

48
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,890
Then tell me what exactly happened there.

49
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,644
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.

50
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,609
Hey!

51
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,527
Stay with me!

52
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,821
Wake up!

53
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,241
Open your eyes!

54
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,035
Hey!

55
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,340
GYEONGSEONG CREATURE
BETWEEN A PRETENSE OF VIRTUE AND VICE

56
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,135
EPISODE 4
THE OTHER SIDE

57
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:29,018
Is it consciousness or the subconscious
that rules over a person?

58
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,989
What changes fate?

59
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:46,327
Is it a routine
that is repeated day after day?

60
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,082
Or is it unforeseen coincidence
and hardship?

61
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,841
What is it that defines
the kind of person we are?

62
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,677
Is it disposition?

63
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,180
Or is it ability?

64
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,317
That would depend on the person,
would it not?

65
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,570
Why would it depend on the person?

66
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,615
Because every individual
is quite different.

67
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,702
They all transform in unpredictable ways.

68
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,121
It's not because they are different.

69
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,707
It is because they are imperfect.

70
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:39,964
Most humans are neither here nor there.

71
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:47,764
They are but imperfect beings
placed on the borderline.

72
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:54,020
It may appear as though humans
are ceaselessly seeking life's answers,

73
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,980
but in truth,

74
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:01,361
they only strive to resolve
the anxiety in themselves.

75
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,697
Therefore,

76
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:11,746
it is fundamentally impossible
for a human being to hold good intentions.

77
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:19,379
They make selfish choices
for themselves and themselves only

78
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,759
from the beginning to the very end.

79
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:33,267
That is why our work
carries so much significance.

80
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,146
And that is why

81
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:45,405
we must continue
to move forward and evolve.

82
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:53,913
We do not have time to waste
on failure like this.

83
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:59,127
I apologize.
We will intensify our efforts.

84
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:05,299
I'd like you to bring that person back.

85
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,390
But Lady Maeda, he's already--

86
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,267
Bring him back.

87
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,188
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,397
Detective Noh.

89
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,816
How's he doing so far?

90
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,110
He's having a total breakdown.

91
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,780
He caused a scene at first,
demanding to see Kwon Yong-gil,

92
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,743
but now he's just lying down
without doing or saying anything.

93
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,411
What did the doctor say?

94
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,582
His injury isn't that severe,
so he'll be discharged by this afternoon.

95
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,752
Okay, then get him discharged
and bring him straight to the station.

96
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,170
I have so many questions.

97
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,130
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,473
What do I need to do
to get Jang Ho-jae discharged today?

99
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,934
Please wait. Let me ask his doctor.

100
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,838
Keep it down.

101
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,508
I'm here to help.

102
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,268
Wait, how did this…

103
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,549
We're done searching outside, Captain.
Nothing seems worth noting.

104
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,384
-What are you doing?
-Give me a hand.

105
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,054
Yes, got it.

106
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,892
"Nitrogen."

107
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,394
What is this?

108
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,149
It says "Jeonseung Bio."

109
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,609
Jeonseung Biotech.

110
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,360
-Jeonseung Biotech?
-Yes.

111
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,033
Let's get out of here first.
I have a lot to tell you.

112
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,534
Are you kidding me, asshole?

113
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,078
You can't fool me twice.

114
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,458
Don't you want to find her?

115
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:39,240
The doctor will be right down.
Please wait in the patient's room.

116
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,658
Okay, thank you.

117
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,343
The suspect has escaped. Call for backup.

118
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,021
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

119
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,028
Upstairs, quickly!

120
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,883
Mr. Kwon Yong-gil's guardian?

121
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,594
Please put on a mask
and sanitize your hands.

122
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,679
You'll be given five minutes.

123
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,808
He's still unconscious.
You'll have to see him and come right out.

124
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,935
So what happened? Have you found him yet?

125
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,021
Forensics. I found this upstairs.

126
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,149
We are combing through
the whole hospital right now.

127
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,193
We'll keep looking.

128
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,196
Goddamn it!

129
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,294
Yong-gil.

130
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,048
Why did you do that?

131
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:22,927
For what?

132
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,931
I need to know at least something.

133
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,313
We received a call from the ICU.

134
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,982
Apparently, Kwon's guardian
just came to see him.

135
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,661
Don't go.

136
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,249
Don't go.

137
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,877
Don't go.

138
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,588
How are you feeling?

139
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,550
Can you hear me? It's me, Ho-jae.

140
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,218
Don't go.

141
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,097
Don't go back.

142
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,101
Keep living

143
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,728
as Ho-jae.

144
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,691
Just like now.

145
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,793
Damn it.

146
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,755
This is her scan.

147
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,843
Let me shade in this region here
for a better look.

148
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,650
The way the Najin has settled down
is similar to that of Seung-jo's.

149
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,027
When a Najin enters a body as a larva,

150
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,446
it latches on
nearer to the top of the head.

151
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,074
But these two have settled in the back.

152
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,702
As Seung-jo received
a mature Najin from his mother,

153
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:58,457
it is highly likely
that it was the same case for her as well.

154
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,140
It won't open.

155
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,687
Who's there?

156
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,068
Do you know where we are
or what it is they do here?

157
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,743
Are you all right? Hey!

158
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,834
They said they would cure me.

159
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,588
They said if I drank it…

160
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,468
I wouldn't have to live
with a disability anymore.

161
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,556
It's a simple experiment.

162
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,977
You just have to empty
the glass of water in front of you.

163
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,898
Then you'll immediately receive
ten million won in your bank accounts.

164
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,572
Excuse me.

165
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,240
Yes?

166
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,284
If the experiment succeeds,

167
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,871
will my leg be cured for sure?

168
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,792
You have infantile paralysis, I see.

169
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,961
That's correct.

170
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,756
If this experiment succeeds,

171
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,842
you'll no longer live with a disability.

172
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,930
All right, then. Let's drink up, shall we?

173
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,037
Ten million…

174
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,248
MY PUPPY

175
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,128
The person you're calling is unavailable.
Leave a message after the tone.

176
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,968
I'll no longer have a disability.

177
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,639
You won't have to suffer because of me.

178
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,560
Help!

179
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,615
Please help me!

180
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,057
They said…

181
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:10,399
my leg would heal
if the experiment succeeded.

182
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,029
Is there anything more I should know
about myself before the accident?

183
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,490
You're much better off now
than you were before the accident.

184
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,994
I just came to check
if all your memories really disappeared.

185
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:04,995
Please…

186
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,705
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.

187
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,770
Sir!

188
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,154
Sir!

189
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,750
Master Jang!

190
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,184
Sir, what are you doing?
Aren't you going to take a photograph?

191
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,864
You're not waiting
for the sun to set, are you?

192
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,336
We have to take it while the sun's out.
Hurry up. I'm busy!

193
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,173
You'll let me take a photo
on my own later, won't you?

194
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,257
Yeong-chun.

195
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,344
You can go to the studio
and use your own money to do that.

196
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,683
Stop staring at us and come here already!

197
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,977
Hurry up!

198
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,731
Chop-chop!

199
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,403
Come now.

200
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,451
Here I come.

201
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,583
All right, looking good.

202
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,669
-Slow down!
-Sure. As you wish.

203
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,549
Here we go now. One, two…

204
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,427
One, two, three!

205
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,685
Please. I said I'm fine.

206
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,187
We're celebrating, remember?

207
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,482
A little closer. Look friendly.

208
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,359
Give us a smile!
They won't arrest you for smiling.

209
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,361
Show your teeth at least!

210
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,907
That's it. One, two, three!

211
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,451
Do you want something to drink?

212
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,925
Weak.

213
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,020
Too slow, man.

214
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,862
How are you going to find that woman
in that sorry state?

215
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,328
Asshole. Are you going
to keep hiding like this?

216
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,914
Does it look like I'm hiding?

217
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,709
I'm right here, you know.

218
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,882
It's driving you mad, huh?

219
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,345
I'm here, but you can't see me.
When you can see me, you can't catch me.

220
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,516
I don't listen to cowards who hide.
Come out now.

221
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,976
Show yourself, asshole!

222
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,317
Now what?

223
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,196
Can you beat me?

224
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,870
You're gonna get yourself killed.

225
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,628
No one has ever messed with us before,

226
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,589
except one person.

227
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,509
That's you.

228
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,469
Don't you miss those times?

229
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,388
You crazy bastard!

230
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,773
You know what I'm talking about.

231
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:04,070
Your memories are coming back.
Aren't they?

232
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,416
Don't run from anything.

233
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,710
Look it in the eye

234
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,087
and face it head-on.

235
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,882
Then you'll have a real shot at winning.

236
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,264
Those were your words, Ho-jae.

237
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,981
You have to remember.

238
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,264
Are you okay?

239
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,433
Hey!

240
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,769
Wake up!

241
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,313
He'll stay like that for a while.

242
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,485
Even if he gains consciousness,
he won't be able to recognize anyone.

243
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,654
A massive craving will hit him at first.

244
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,868
But you already know that.

245
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,789
How long have you lived like that?

246
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,417
Tell me where I am first.

247
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,168
As far as I can remember…

248
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,215
the Najin was never leaked to the outside.

249
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,134
Just what on earth are you bastards?

250
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,472
What kind of bastards are you
to be doing such a terrible thing?

251
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,558
How did you survive?

252
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,813
How long have you lived
without being under control?

253
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,190
Are there more of our kind out there
besides you?

254
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,657
Don't tell me…

255
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,329
this is Ongseong Hospital.

256
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,212
Is it?

257
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,760
That hospital closed
when the Greater East Asia War ended.

258
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,764
Most of the building
was destroyed during the war,

259
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,100
and Jeonseung Biotech was built
on top of its ruins.

260
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,149
Its founders are Lady Maeda
and the former chairman, Kato.

261
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,113
Chairman Shin Ji-oh, his son,
has currently succeeded him.

262
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,082
So it's not over, then.

263
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,085
This hell.

264
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,337
Now, answer me.

265
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,467
Who are you?

266
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,029
Out.

267
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,557
Make your choice.

268
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,435
Either go back to the man you used to be,

269
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,729
or…

270
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,774
die here like this.

271
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,571
Don't go back.

272
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,198
Keep living

273
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,826
as Ho-jae.

274
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,913
Just like now.

275
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,585
Come back.

276
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,213
Be it Ho-jae…

277
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,550
or Tae-sang, I don't care.

278
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,679
Go back to the man I once knew.

279
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,852
Let's go back to those times.

280
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,021
Okay?

281
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,401
Long time no see…

282
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,238
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.
