Would you like to order?

3
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,736
Well,

4
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,117
I'm here to see someone called Silverbill.

5
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:28,022
It's been over ten days
since I lost contact with my son.

6
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,608
You should talk to the police
about a runaway kid.

7
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,068
He didn't run away.

8
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,946
He's gone missing.

MADAM NA

00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,994
Job request.

11
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,497
Missing person's name, Oh Ki-hoon.
Age 29.

12
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,958
He went missing about ten days ago.

13
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,753
Do you accept?

14
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,384
ACCEPTED

15
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,728
How long are you going to keep this up?

16
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,111
It's about time you moved on.

CALL FOR ANY AND ALL REQUESTS
ON-CALL 24/7

24
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,694
Going somewhere?

25
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,197
I think we can obtain the evidence
Mr. Yang requested.

26
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,365
Wait up.

27
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,452
You should've told me that sooner, man.
We need to go together for that.

28
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,037
I have to be there.

29
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,831
Hey. You're the one going in today.

30
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,542
What kind of nonsense is that?

31
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,961
Let's stick to our traditions and rules.

32
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,546
Settle it like we used to.

33
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,547
Okay.

34
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,217
Bring it on.

35
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,137
-Cham cham cham!
-Cham cham cham!

36
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,807
Settled.

37
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,975
-Happy?
-Yeah.

38
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,395
But you know what? I'll drive.

39
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,396
Let's go.

40
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,148
Cham cham cham.

41
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,483
Why can't I win?

42
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,825
That will be 6,800 won.

43
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,562
Ho-jae, you know we have to pay off
the loan interest by this week, right?

44
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,939
If you can't get a clear photo today,

45
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,276
we won't get paid,
and the creditors will be onto us,

46
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,488
which means the office will be seized
and we'll be out on the streets very soon.

47
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,448
Hey,

48
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,575
I always wondered…

49
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,492
Yeah?

50
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,663
Why do I have to pay the debt with you?
It has nothing to do with me.

51
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,332
That's a good question.
How shall I put this?

52
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,294
Because I'm the president of Bugang,
and you're the VP.

53
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,504
Since when?

54
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,590
Just put these on. Here.

55
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,637
Hey, Bugang is the last business
that Grandpa left us.

56
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,930
Who else would protect it?

57
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,392
You, me, us!
We have to protect it together.

58
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,397
Strictly speaking, he's your grandpa.
It's got nothing to do with me.

59
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,442
You know how much Grandpa loved you.

60
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,569
Well, I don't remember much about that.

61
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,531
Besides, you and I don't have
anywhere else to be but Bugang.

62
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,657
Speak for yourself.

63
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,743
I'm in high demand.

64
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,579
Cham cham… cham.

65
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,164
See?

66
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,585
Take this and go already.
And don't get caught.

67
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,921
Go on. Hurry. Get to it.

68
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,089
Come on!

69
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,383
Hey, don't miss the face like last time.

70
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,929
If the angle sucks,
we barely get half the pay!

71
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,722
Love you, VP!

72
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,558
Don't just capture the body. Get the face!

73
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,287
Who's there?

74
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,447
You're getting the feed, right?

75
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,076
Of course I am. I made that thing.

76
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,817
Why isn't anyone answering?

77
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,777
Are they busy exercising?

78
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,654
Don't be ridiculous.

79
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,781
Are you sure it's room 608?

80
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,868
Yeah, room 608.

81
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,911
This is the room.

82
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,604
I have a bad feeling about this.

83
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,063
Should I abort for now?

84
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,191
You can't do that, Ho-jae.

85
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,777
You know we have
to pay the interest by this week.

86
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,570
This is our only chance.

87
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,740
We have to get the evidence today,
no matter what.

88
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,887
Just barge in there, okay?

89
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,598
Open the door
with the master key card I gave you,

90
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,559
and just take one picture.
Then you're done, okay?

91
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,730
Ho-jae, just do it. Please?

92
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,849
There's no one here.

93
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,852
Check the bathroom.
They might be taking a shower together.

94
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:28,951
Shit!

95
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,875
What the… Ho-jae?

96
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,934
Is that… a woman?

97
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,418
Sir! Room 608! There's an accident!

98
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,170
-What?
-Hurry up! Come on!

99
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,546
Hey, Ho-jae!

100
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,719
Damn it!

101
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,471
What in the…

102
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,433
Why are you here?

103
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,894
What are you doing?

104
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,646
You said it was room 608.

105
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,482
When did I say that? It was room 809!

106
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,575
Goddamn it.

107
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,080
For God's sake.

108
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,767
DESERTER ELIMINATED

109
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,604
Hey.

110
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,028
DESERTER ELIMINATED

111
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,914
It was a total pro, all right?

112
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,167
The way the jabs came in,
it couldn't have been an amateur.

113
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,877
Anything else you remember?

114
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,129
I couldn't pay attention to anything.

115
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,715
It was dark. I could barely see.

116
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,218
With punches and kicks raining down…

117
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,183
Anyway, that's all.

118
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,185
Be careful how you answer, Ho-jae.

119
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,147
If one thing goes wrong,
you'll end up taking all the blame.

120
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,235
-What, take the blame?
-Why would I?

121
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:35,155
You went in there to capture an affair
on camera and get good money for it,

122
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,950
which led to a fight
that resulted in death.

123
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,243
-No!
-That's not true!

124
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,538
The only fingerprints we found
at the scene were yours, Mr. Jang.

125
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,207
I told you, he was already dead
when I entered the room.

126
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,460
And the victim's blood was found
all over your clothes too.

127
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,922
I've said it multiple times.
I had a fight with the one who was there!

128
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,342
Yes, exactly.
Ho-jae did beat people up back in the day.

129
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,511
-I saw it for myself. Right?
-Shut up.

130
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,097
But this kid doesn't kill people
or do stuff like that.

131
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,099
You know that, Captain! Am I right?

132
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:06,311
Didn't I tell you not to fool around
doing private detective stuff?

133
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:11,650
I told you illegal wiretapping, recording,
and filming are all punishable by law.

134
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,652
Yes, you did tell us, Captain, but--

135
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,904
Look at this stuff.

136
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:21,451
All these files you've saved on here,
these are all people having affairs.

137
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,329
All this cheating.
They're too embarrassing to even look at.

138
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,665
Yeah, right.
You're perusing them over and over.

139
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,625
Let's be real.

140
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,546
The illegal filming charge alone
will get you both locked up.

141
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,424
Come on, now! That's such a stretch.

142
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,385
Why are you doing this to us?
You know how it is, Captain.

143
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,597
To tell you about us,

144
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,308
we used to trade goods
in the global market.

145
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,768
But in this worldwide economic recession,

146
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,021
we small fries have been
crushed down to dust.

147
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,190
So, to put bread on the table,

148
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,110
we just did some side hustles
very briefly.

149
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,112
Hey, you know us!

150
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,906
You know who we are, Captain!

151
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,370
I'll zip it now and let you two talk.

152
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,377
You should stop now
and tell me what this is really about.

153
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,630
What?

154
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,050
You're trying to scare us
with the whole illegal filming thing,

155
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,927
so you clearly want something.

156
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,387
Tell me what it is.

157
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,024
Find out who this is.

158
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,235
-What?
-What?

159
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,653
Excuse me, Captain.

160
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,948
But the police should be
looking for the criminal.

161
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,282
Why should we…

162
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,534
We have arrested key suspects already.

163
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,370
But you said it was unfair.

164
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,580
What else can you do
but join us on the hunt?

165
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,499
Excuse me, Captain?

166
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,918
But still, this is a bit too--

167
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,753
Why? You can't do it?

168
00:20:54,836 --> 00:21:00,634
Then you, Jang Ho-jae, will be named
the prime suspect of this murder.

169
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,304
And your face and name
will be plastered all over the news.

170
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,515
I didn't kill him!

171
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,767
Yeah, I mean, how unfair is that?

172
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,229
You'll be accused of being the killer
even though you're innocent.

173
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,898
But I still have a job to do, you know.

174
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,485
You were at the scene
at the time the victim was murdered.

175
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,530
So, currently, you are the prime suspect.

176
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,367
To save face, we'll write a report
and send it to the prosecutors.

177
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,707
I never pegged you as that type, Captain,
but did you know

178
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,001
that you're an asshole?

179
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,544
I sure did.

180
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,716
I'll give you ten days.
Find me whatever you can.

181
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,468
Who this person is,
whether it's a woman or a man,

182
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,888
and what kind of crazy psycho they must be
to kill people in such a way.

183
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,475
Tell me now if you can't do it.
If so, I'll have to arrest you right away.

184
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,727
What's your call?

185
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,037
Ho-jae, we're screwed now, aren't we?

186
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,250
Is this okay? They're civilians after all.

187
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,838
And they're up against a serial killer.

188
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,507
Do you remember the creep
we arrested two months ago

189
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,218
when you had just transferred
to Violent Crimes?

190
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,888
The rapist who went after
the female college students?

191
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,765
The one you chased for over three years?

192
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,682
Yeah.

193
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,684
Those two caught him.

194
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,186
What?

195
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,272
That guy, Jang Ho-jae,
is better than he lets on.

196
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,525
Don't worry too much.

197
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,822
JONGNO-GU SERIAL MURDER CASE

198
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,626
OH KI-HOON (29 YEARS OLD)
BODYGUARD AT JEONSEUNG BIOTECH

199
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,836
We aren't open yet.

200
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,551
How can I help you this time?

201
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,138
That Silverbill person. Let me meet them.

202
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:15,644
What happened to your son is unfortunate,
but there was nothing we could do.

203
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,315
Your deposit for the request
has been refunded.

204
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,984
You can take that money back.

205
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,528
Pardon?

206
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,239
I'd like to find someone else.

207
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,199
And who might that be?

208
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,785
The person who killed my son.

209
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,205
Whoever it was, I have to find them!

210
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,623
Please?

211
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,421
What do you think?

212
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,300
The client desperately wants you
to find his son's killer.

213
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,537
Ho-jae.

214
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,207
Why don't we leave Seoul
for a while instead?

215
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,293
How about Osaka? Or Singapore?

216
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,879
Should we just go all the way to Hawaii?

217
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,924
That would be like admitting
that I'm the killer.

218
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,677
Are you trying to make me
an international fugitive?

219
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,846
No, that's not what I meant.

220
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,558
I'm saying that we should steer away
from the danger for a bit,

221
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,477
in case you get caught up in trouble.

222
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,188
Can you afford plane tickets?

223
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,232
Of course not.
We gotta muster it up together.

224
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,237
Worrying isn't what we need right now.
We have to find a way.

225
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,740
A realistic way.

226
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,409
What realistic way are you suggesting?

227
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,828
Are you actually
going to catch the culprit?

228
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,830
What is this?

229
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,083
First, let's send out that picture
to all our contacts.

230
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,505
We'll take any and all tip-offs
about anyone who looks remotely similar.

231
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,299
You're really going to do this?

232
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:13,595
My face is going to be on wanted posters
all over the country in ten days.

233
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,641
I want to live a quiet life, Yong-gil.

234
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,851
Help me out.

235
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,502
Why did you have to ask me
for this favor, Grandpa?

236
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,593
HELLO ANTENNAS, REQUESTING TIP-OFFS
ON THE PERSON IN THE PICTURE

237
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:02,394
URGENTLY NEEDED, PLEASE CONTACT ASAP

238
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,113
-It's delicious.
-Did you bring them?

239
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,660
-Hey, good work.
-Good Lord.

240
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,745
I'm done. Heading out now.

241
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,624
-What?
-Did you see this picture?

242
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,792
What picture?

243
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,118
Ho-jae. It's Sinsa-dong.

244
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,747
They first saw her while taking photos
of the building for a quote last week,

245
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,833
but they saw her a few times after that.

246
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:34,170
She usually appears right before sunset
and sits there until it gets dark.

247
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,424
Where in Sinsa-dong?

248
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,219
ACCEPTED

249
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,387
What?

250
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:26,931
SILVERBILL

251
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,019
Are you sure?

252
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,438
You're really going to take this job?

253
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,565
Under one condition.

254
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,693
If I catch the culprit,
I'll hand them over to the cops.

255
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,655
Tell him that I don't take jobs
from people seeking vengeance,

256
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,075
and that I won't take this job
unless he agrees.

257
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,036
What in the world are you thinking?

258
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,455
You've never taken jobs like this.

259
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,583
Now you're going to find
the murderer for him?

260
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,336
I have a few questions of my own as well.

261
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,484
Who are you?

262
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,242
You're not answering me,
so you must be up to something.

263
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,037
Why don't we face each other first?

264
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,581
You'll only get hurt if you move.

265
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,669
Do you know Oh Ki-hoon?

266
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,838
Are you a cop?

267
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,339
I wouldn't say that.

268
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,510
But I'm looking for the culprit
who killed Oh.

269
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,430
You came to the wrong person. It's not me.

270
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,056
Then why were you there?

271
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,435
The person who was there…

272
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,480
that was you, wasn't it?

273
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,801
That was a solid punch.

274
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,055
You are a pro, aren't you?

275
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,730
I won't go easy on you now.

276
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,024
I'm gonna fight with everything I've got.

277
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,366
Why…

278
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,625
I haven't done anything yet.

279
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,004
Master Jang.

280
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,598
Master Jang.

281
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,105
Is it really you?

282
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,609
Interesting.

283
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,640
Soon…

284
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,102
it will be spring again.

285
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,088
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS
ABOUT HUMANS

286
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,925
HUMANS, CREATORS OF HISTORY
AND HISTORY ITSELF

287
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,553
THE RECORD OF EXISTENCE

288
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,932
THE RECORD OF EXISTENCE
BY SHIN JI-OH

289
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,436
THE BOOK OF EVOLUTION AND COEXISTENCE

290
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,105
A FUTURE INSPIRED BY HUMANS

291
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,691
A FUTURE BRED FOR HUMANS

292
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,443
WE ADVANCE

293
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,194
AND EVOLVE

294
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,363
ENDLESSLY

295
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,657
THE POTENTIAL OF HUMANS

296
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,993
THE INFINITY OF HUMANKIND

297
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,622
JEONSEUNG BIOTECH

298
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,686
Let us begin.

299
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,938
Yes, sir.

300
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,400
We will begin Experiment A0-67.
