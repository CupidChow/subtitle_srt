2
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,464
Hey.

3
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,633
Why do you keep fighting?

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,803
You know you can't win.

5
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,182
I'm not fighting to win.

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,935
I'm fighting so they don't forget.

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,647
So they don't forget what they did to us.

8
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,944
To let them know that those who remember
what they did are still alive.

9
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,615
To make them feel sorry.

10
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,451
If they don't feel sorry,

11
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,038
to make them feel guilty, at least.

12
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,417
If they don't even feel guilty,

13
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,296
then to get in their way,
to be a nuisance.

14
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,673
To keep them on edge.

15
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,053
That way, they won't forget either.

16
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,431
Can't you forgive them?

17
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,102
Not when they don't even feel
the need to apologize.

18
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,396
They refuse to admit the fact
that those things even happened.

19
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,942
Isn't it absurd for me to forgive them?

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,277
Still,

21
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,239
it's all in the past.

22
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,450
People didn't have a choice then.

23
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,203
Sure.

24
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,580
The times were such.

25
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:07,001
Some had to do what they did to survive.
We're all human after all.

26
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,796
But

27
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,843
it's also a human thing
to right the wrongs that we've done.

28
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,055
If you don't bother to make an effort…

29
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,434
the world will be much more terrible.

30
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,646
How much do you trust me?

31
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,899
There's no "how much" in trust.

32
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,402
I just trust you.

33
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
I wish

34
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,992
I'd never met you in the first place.

35
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,203
If I hadn't,

36
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,958
I would've been perfectly fine
with becoming a monster.

37
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,311
What are you playing at?

38
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,645
I told you.

39
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,065
I don't want to die.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,080
Thanks to Ho-jae,
I once had a dream for a moment.

41
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,889
I dreamed that I could be like Ho-jae.

42
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,811
Be human and act human.

43
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,897
But…

44
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,983
I couldn't.

45
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,570
I was simply a monster.

46
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,033
I don't care what happens
to anything but me.

47
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,327
I feel no guilt

48
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,205
or pangs of conscience.

49
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:11,209
I kill when someone poses a threat.
I hunt when I'm bored.

50
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,877
I feed when I'm hungry.

51
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,257
And also…

52
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,636
I get a good kick out of it.

53
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,141
I heard Akiko was your mother.

54
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,353
But do you know…

55
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,692
how she came to her death?

56
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,904
I do.

57
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,335
What about it?

58
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,838
So what? It's all in the past.

59
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,135
Lady Maeda is the one
who raised and protected me.

60
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,098
Don't you think she's been using you?

61
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,273
A good son always answers "yes."

62
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,362
You don't get it.

63
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,157
I'm the one who used her

64
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,617
so I could survive.

65
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,913
So…

66
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,336
just die.

67
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,840
Yoon Chae-ok. Bring that woman to me.

68
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,508
For Ho-jae's sake…

69
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,804
Mr. Jang has to be the one
to lead her to her death.

70
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,306
…you must die now.

71
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,398
Freeze! Move and I'll shoot!

72
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,750
Master Jang will be
very disappointed to know…

73
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,129
that you've decided to become a monster.

74
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,678
Wait, that person…

75
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,607
Who are those people?

76
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,694
You have to run,
or else you're going to die.

77
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,239
What do you think you're doing?

78
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,669
-Hey!
-Run as far away as you can. Now.

79
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,286
Who was it?

80
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,413
Who sent you?!

81
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,743
There is no way for you to win here.

82
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,371
Wanna bet?

83
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,126
On whether I can win or not.

84
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,637
In the end, Lady Maeda
will kill everyone around you.

85
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:21,394
Because what she ultimately wants
is for you to be left alone.

86
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,985
If you want to know where I stand,
I don't care who wins.

87
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,946
I just want this fight to be over quickly.

88
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,617
And for that to happen,

89
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,203
this will come in handy.

MARGINAL MAN

92
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,062
Ma'am, have mercy on him!

93
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,566
Please have mercy on Ho-jae,
just this once!

94
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,484
Please!

95
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,779
I'll keep a good eye on him.

96
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,867
I'll make sure he never shows up
in front of you again, Lady Maeda.

97
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,287
I'll keep him in check however I can, so…

98
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,916
please spare him this once.

99
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,376
Can you

100
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,921
bet your life on that promise?

101
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,143
If you do let Ho-jae live…

102
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:46,896
then yes.

103
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,898
I'll bet my life.

104
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,662
Ho-jae.

105
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,473
Ho-jae.

106
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,601
Ho-jae.

107
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,978
Let's go home.

108
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,188
Come on, Ho-jae.

109
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,486
Let's go home now, okay?

110
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,946
Let's go.

111
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,550
Okay. I'll head over now.

112
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,349
-No, stay here. I can go on my own.
-What? Where are you going?

113
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,686
Kwon Yong-gil is awake
and asking for me. I'll be back.

114
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,080
DETECTIVE NOH JI-SU

115
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,040
Hey, how's it going so far?

116
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,879
Captain.

117
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758
Captain.

118
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,177
Captain!

119
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,104
What is it?

120
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,523
Lady Maeda seems to have
caught on to our plan.

121
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,041
Welcome.

122
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,836
I've been waiting for you.

123
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,107
No wonder it was so quiet on the way here.

124
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,528
It was the least I could do
for an old friend.

125
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,864
Are we still friends?

126
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:11,827
So much time has passed,
and so many things have changed,

127
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,413
yet we still stand face to face like this.

128
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:16,916
So maybe we are.

129
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,964
Maybe that is why…

130
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,854
it felt lonelier than I thought

131
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,067
to be erased from your memories.

132
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,780
If you knew how I remembered you,

133
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,992
it would've been better
to leave my memories erased.

134
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,244
It is always better

135
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,791
to live with the painful memories we have

136
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,251
than to have nothing.

137
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,046
You are no longer pain to me.

138
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,715
You are repulsive.

139
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,094
Do you still think

140
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,723
that all human lives are equal?

141
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,767
Do you still think they're not?

142
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,394
What about Yoon Chae-ok's life?

143
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,109
Do you still feel the same way
about her life?

144
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,639
I was always curious

145
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:00,310
just how equal human lives were to you.

146
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,441
Take your friend in the hospital,
for example.

147
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,614
-You'll be moving to the general ward.
-What?

148
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,074
Or

149
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,952
that police friend of yours.

150
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,131
And the child you're looking for, No. 71.

151
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,342
What if you had to decide
between those three lives

152
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,137
and Yoon Chae-ok's life?

153
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,724
Which side would you choose?

154
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,142
No.

155
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,436
You didn't.

156
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,802
Yoon Chae-ok is not down there.

157
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,807
She will shortly have her Najin removed
in the water tank chamber.

158
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,811
There are two possible outcomes.

159
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:28,190
Will she lose her memories like you did
a year ago and become a different person?

160
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,861
Or will she fail to escape the water tank

161
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,781
and drown in it?

162
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,493
Now,

163
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,287
which side will you save first?

164
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,290
Yoon Chae-ok?

165
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,596
Throw her in.

166
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,183
Or…

167
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,270
your friends?

168
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,737
Make a choice, Mr. Jang.

169
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,449
You do not have much time.

170
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,910
Why do you have to take it this far?

171
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,079
I merely want to see for myself

172
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,710
whether you speak the truth
and whether your word would apply here.

173
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,838
What do you think?

174
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,634
Do you still believe
all human lives are the same?

175
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,932
Are they still equal?

176
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,339
Mr. Jang!

177
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,331
Captain!

178
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,594
No. Don't come down.

179
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,022
No! Don't come down!

180
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,857
No!

181
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,718
Hey, are you out of your mind?

182
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,220
Why did you come down here?
What were you thinking?

183
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,107
I've fought them before.

184
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,088
Give up.

185
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,716
You're not getting out of here.

186
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,220
Where's Master Jang?

187
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,808
Just tell me that.

188
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,940
Is he still alive?

189
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,071
He is alive,
but you won't be seeing him again.

190
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:38,542
Jang Tae-sang has chosen
to save other people over you.

191
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,921
And for that,

192
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,342
he will be torn to pieces and killed.

193
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,392
And you'll die in this water tank.

194
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,481
If you wanted to win,
you should've been simpler about it.

195
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:06,903
You two are too emotional,
and you act on too many frivolous reasons.

196
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,993
Just as we each have our own reasons
for choosing to live…

197
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,626
we also have our own reasons
for choosing death.

198
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,213
Aren't you afraid of death?

199
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,942
What we must really fear is not death…

200
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,246
but being left all alone
and unable to die.

201
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,303
Such a pity, those eyes.

202
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,643
I really like them.

203
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,460
What the heck? What is that?

204
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,628
What is that?

205
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,296
Stop talking for God's sake!

206
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,468
Ho-jae!

207
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,557
Hey, Ho-jae!

208
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,601
Ho-jae, are you okay?

209
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,108
What? Hold on.

210
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,776
Wait! Go away!

211
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,073
Start running!

212
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,157
Cut them off.

213
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,370
Damn it!

214
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,247
My legs!

215
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,919
-Shit.
-Cut it.

216
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,214
Jong-hyeok's over there.
We have to take him.

217
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,382
We have to hurry.

218
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:35,969
Thank you.

219
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,513
It's done.

220
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,726
Ho-jae!

221
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,687
There's an elevator back there. Go now!

222
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,023
Damn it!

223
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,701
I said go!

224
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,371
Come on! Hurry!

225
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,415
-What should I set the temperature to?
-All the way down to 18 degrees.

226
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,523
That's enough.

227
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,824
I know you're in pain too.

228
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,068
Nitrogen gas has been detected.

229
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,153
Please evacuate.

230
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,953
Nitrogen gas has been detected.

231
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,413
It's here!

232
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,503
Nitrogen gas has been detected.

233
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,338
Ho-jae, come on!

234
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,800
What the hell is he doing?

235
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,306
Wait! Ho-jae!

236
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,493
Are you all right?

237
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,913
Ho-jae!

238
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,998
Are you okay?

239
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,500
No time to talk right now.

240
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,836
You'll find a long hallway
on the floor above.

241
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,630
Go straight down to the end.

242
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,800
Exit through the iron doors on the right,
and a passage will lead you outside.

243
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,970
Wait a second. Hey, what about you?

244
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,805
Yoon Chae-ok is still in here.

245
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,309
No, don't. Don't do this, man!

246
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,938
Call backup as soon as you get out.

247
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,481
I will.

248
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,398
Hold on, man.

249
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,985
Come with us, okay?
Let's get out together.

250
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,113
You have to save yourself at least!

251
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,534
Go ahead without me.

252
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,578
I'll bring her out.

253
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,321
How is it progressing?

254
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,075
The water temperature just dropped
to 20 degrees.

255
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,619
It'll drop to 18 within three minutes.

256
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,873
Then she will go into cardiac arrest.

257
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,672
Master Jang.

258
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,218
I wish to be with you.

259
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,639
There is something

260
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,185
I really want to tell you.

261
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,564
There were so many things…

262
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,068
I wanted to do with you.

263
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,016
What is that?

264
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,521
Wasn't her Najin asleep?

265
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,215
Why did you do it?

266
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,968
Did you really…

267
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,596
intend to kill me?

268
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,768
I should have killed you

269
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,771
a year ago

270
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,316
when you chose Mr. Jang over me.

271
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,532
Was there ever a moment…

272
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,955
in which you regarded me as your son?

273
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,626
There are things that make humans weak.

274
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,132
Mother, child, companion,
lover, homeland, to name a few.

275
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,343
Once they imprison themselves

276
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,637
by obsessing
over such trivial relationships,

277
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,557
humans become endlessly useless

278
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,101
and pitiful beings.

279
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:33,024
They get taken advantage of
and become expendable, easily discarded.

280
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,905
I did not raise you like that, Seung-jo.

281
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,575
I whipped and trained you

282
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,244
so that you would not be
tied down to anything,

283
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,788
so that you could become perfect
on your own.

284
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,460
But you continued to long for a mother

285
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,046
and depended on Jang Tae-sang.

286
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,008
How disappointing.

287
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,651
Forgive me.

288
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,366
Disappointment means

289
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,328
that you had some expectations for me.

290
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,331
Okay.

291
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,792
I'll do better.

292
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,212
I won't long for anyone…

293
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,674
or expect anything ever again.

294
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,092
So…

295
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,769
accept me for who I am.

296
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,399
I won't be tied down to you.

297
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,320
I'll become perfect on my own.

298
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,371
How beautiful.

299
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,238
Her heart has stopped.

300
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,951
I'll be taking that Najin.

301
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,730
Do you think

302
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,485
the good times will come to us?

303
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,198
They surely will.

304
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,210
I will make sure that they do.

305
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,365
What is it?

306
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,202
What's going to happen to me now?

307
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,620
Well,

308
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:06,709
you'll need to take responsibility
for the three people who have died.

309
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:09,962
But

310
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,465
I'll help you get qualified
for all the mitigating factors.

311
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,050
Try not to worry.

312
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,722
Move!

313
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,393
What happened here?

314
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,104
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

315
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,189
-Are you badly injured? Can you move?
-Move!

316
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,275
-I think I broke my leg.
-Oh no!

317
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:35,988
We have to start an urgent search
of Jeonseung Biotech now.

318
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,406
Let's get a warrant first.

319
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,907
-Yes, sir.
-Shit!

320
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,868
Are you okay, sir?

321
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,496
Is it just the two of you?

322
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:53,839
What did you say?

323
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,799
Is it just the two of you?

324
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,430
Yeah.

325
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,223
Just us two.

326
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,475
I see.

327
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,822
The screen doors are opening.

328
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,412
SEARCH AND SEIZURE CONDUCTED
AGAINST JEONSEUNG BIOTECH

329
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,580
INVESTIGATION INTO
ILLEGAL HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION

330
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,624
MULTIPLE TIP-OFFS OF HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION

331
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,084
PROSECUTION SUMMONS CHAIRMAN

332
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,794
HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION LAB NOT FOUND

333
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,222
Yummy.

334
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,630
Come on out and eat.
You're going to be late.

335
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:40,547
Okay!

336
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,467
Coming.

337
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,223
Coming home late from school again?

338
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,726
My club is holding a fundraiser.

339
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,772
We'll be having drinks after that,
so I'll probably be very late.

340
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,609
It's so good.

341
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,277
-Good, huh?
-Yeah.

342
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,536
Hey, do you have a boyfriend yet?

343
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,164
A boyfriend?

344
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,418
I mean…

345
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,840
I'll get one when I get one.

346
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,930
Here, have some meat too.

347
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,520
So good.

348
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,440
Your makeup looks lovely.

349
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,527
I'm going to bag myself a guy
at the fundraiser.

350
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,280
Your clothes are so pretty too.

351
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,743
Sometimes I have this dream.

352
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,545
A dream where
I chase after someone every night.

353
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,132
I don't know who it is,

354
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,843
and I can't remember much of it…

355
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,640
but my heart aches and feels
as if it were torn before I wake up.

356
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,477
Spring will soon pass,

357
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,439
and it will be summer again.

358
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,662
And we will live on again.

359
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:09,209
IN REMEMBRANCE OF OUR COLLEAGUES
KIM HYEON-JUNG AND OH HYO-JEONG

360
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,032
Keep it going.
