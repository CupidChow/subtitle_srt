It's always the same pattern.

00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,171
I'm overcome with hunger
after extreme blood loss or exhaustion.

4
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,469
-I need to feed.
-I need to feed.

-I need to feed.
-I need to feed.

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,271
-I need to feed.
-I need to feed.

7
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,652
-I need to feed.
-I need to feed.

8
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,216
This is bad.

00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,580
You will only experience good luck
from now on.

Have a seat.

17
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,984
Do you want something to drink?
Coffee? Or something else?

18
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,779
Let's talk first.

19
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,992
Let's do introductions first.

20
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,205
I already told you my name.

21
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,498
What's yours?

22
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,584
I don't have one.

23
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,129
We're on the same side,
but you won't even tell me your name?

24
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,714
Since we're on the same side,

25
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,133
we can skip the trivialities.

26
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,889
How's your injury?

27
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,309
Are you all right?

28
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,940
You were seriously hurt that day.

29
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,780
I'd like to set just two rules.

30
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,991
No personal questions.

31
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,953
And you do as I say.

32
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,083
No introductions and no catching up?

33
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,043
You're one unfriendly teammate.

34
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,629
I'm going to call Madam Na's phone now.

35
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,423
But Madam Na's dead.

36
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,092
The person who killed her has her phone.

37
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,803
He was also the last person

38
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:10,888
to request a job.

39
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,727
What was the job?

40
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,827
Look familiar?

41
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,649
What are you doing?

42
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,361
You're on probation. Don't wander around.

43
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,446
Give me a break.

44
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,782
Do you mean to lock me up
until I'm a living corpse?

45
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,953
If that's the only way
to control a variable like you, yes.

46
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,708
What are you so afraid of?

47
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,256
That's why you keep trying
to suppress and control us.

48
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,635
You're scared

49
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,803
that we'll be a threat.

50
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,265
Is that why Ho-jae
had to go through surgery?

51
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,684
He got on my nerves.

52
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,605
He was getting in the way.

53
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,194
He was annoying.

54
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,862
That's why.

55
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,159
Do you really think you can control us?

56
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,830
I do know how to control
the Najin inside your head.

57
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,211
Go back to your room.

58
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,133
Actually, I met one of our kind outside.

59
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,353
SILVERBILL

60
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,312
It's her.

61
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,902
Hello?

62
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,737
Are you looking for me?

63
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,740
Do you know me?

64
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,242
How?

65
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,869
Is she with you?

66
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,207
Amazing.

67
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,546
So she's alive after all that.
She really must be one of my kind.

68
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,424
What are you talking about?

69
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,718
I'm sure you know what I mean.

70
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,762
I don't. That's why I asked.
So spell it out.

71
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,888
What did you mean?

72
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,975
Answer me.

73
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,495
-Who was that?
-Ho-jae.

74
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,249
He's with her right now.

75
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,044
What do we do? Call him again?

76
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,047
Let's wait.

77
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:33,966
Hey.

78
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,511
He said that you were "one of his kind."

79
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,680
Do you know what he meant by that?

80
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,811
You're one of us.

81
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,397
No.

82
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,198
MADAM NA
LET US MEET TONIGHT

83
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,282
It's him.

84
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,326
He wants to meet.

85
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,336
CHOOSE A LOCATION

86
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,217
Done.

87
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,302
That's all I needed from you.

88
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,512
"That's all"?

89
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,263
I'll be going alone.

90
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,973
Are you kidding me?

91
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,060
Didn't I just help you set up the meeting?

92
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,061
Look.

93
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,397
I'm the one being framed as a suspect.

94
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,357
I'm the one he wants to meet.

95
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,276
There are some things
you should never encounter in your life.

96
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,490
Get involved with them, and in a flash,
your life will become hell.

97
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,035
You can't revert that…

98
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,956
or return to the past.

99
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,670
You may have to live your whole life
like you're in an endless nightmare.

100
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,590
Are you threatening me
or worrying about me?

101
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,551
I'm seriously trying to dissuade you.

102
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,221
You can't handle that guy.

103
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,764
Then call the police.

104
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,851
My goal is to catch him,
not to escalate the situation.

105
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,188
What if we call the police
and he decides to hide away?

106
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,650
Then it'd be a lost cause.

107
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,902
He's looking for me.

108
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,905
He wants to meet me, not you.

109
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,783
Recklessness isn't the same
as bravery, you know.

110
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,996
I'd rather die before I let anyone
walk into danger by themselves.

111
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,292
You said we're on the same side.

112
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,043
So we go together.

113
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,508
Are they going to meet up?

114
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,012
Yes, they will make contact
with the suspect who has Madam Na's phone.

115
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,054
Time and place?

116
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,349
Not confirmed yet.
I'm planning on tailing them.

117
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,395
I'll request backup.
Follow them when they're on the move.

118
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,566
Wait, what are you gonna do?
Who did you say you're meeting?

119
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,401
The guy who killed the Owl Bar owner.

120
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,154
She thinks
he's behind the motel murder too.

121
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,157
Then call the cops.
You shouldn't be going there!

122
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,243
If we call the cops and he finds out,
he'll go deeper into hiding,

123
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,578
and it'll be a lost cause.

124
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,288
Says who?

125
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,247
She does.

126
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,542
And you trust her?
How many times have you met her?

127
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,294
Not sure. Maybe twice?

128
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,379
Hey.

129
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,382
Do you even know what her name is?

130
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,259
-Ms. Silverbill?
-What does she do?

131
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,136
She finds missing people.

132
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,971
I knew it!

133
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,724
Everything about her
is vague, uncertain, and unclear.

134
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,435
But you're going to follow her blindly
without question?

135
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,436
This isn't like you.

136
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,438
I know.

137
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,107
But strangely, I find myself believing
whatever she says.

138
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
Because you've fallen for her looks!

139
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,071
Snap out of it, man!

140
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,907
What are you gonna do
if she turns out to be an accomplice?

141
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,117
What if they're playing you?

142
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,703
Her closest friend was murdered.

143
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,747
Yong-gil, put yourself in her shoes.

144
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,334
If someone murdered me so violently,
wouldn't you lose your mind?

145
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,753
Wait, why are you making this about us?

146
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,421
I feel very offended.

147
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,549
Would you lose your mind or not?

148
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,925
I'd lose it, man!

149
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,927
Would you look for the culprit like crazy?

150
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,387
Yeah, I so would!

151
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,848
-Will you be our backup later?
-Yeah, I will--

152
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,849
Thanks, man.

153
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,811
You crazy son of a… Damn you!

154
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,397
Make sure you dress warmly.

155
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,442
Hold on.

156
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,820
It's three times.

157
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,531
I've seen her three times already.

158
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,722
Is that you, Jong-hyeok?

159
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes, Grandma. I'm home.

160
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,895
Goodness. You must be tired.

161
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,230
-I'm fine.
-Well done today.

162
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,996
Go wash your hands.

163
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,497
-Let's eat first.
-Okay.

164
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,126
So, your training starts tomorrow?

165
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,253
Yeah, it goes on for a month.

166
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,089
What kind of training takes a full month?

167
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,175
I heard all new employees go through it.

168
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,303
Grandma, what's this?

169
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,013
What?

170
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,143
What else? It's a new suit.

171
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,395
I received a bonus!

172
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,272
Really? From Madam Na?

173
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,775
No, from Master Jang.

174
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,194
Master… who?

175
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,528
Don't worry about it.

176
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,530
Have a seat. Let's eat.

177
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,490
Okay.

178
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,752
You cooked so much food!

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,737
I'm telling you one more time--

183
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,030
I'll be back.

184
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,666
Scared?

185
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,045
No. Not at all.

186
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,760
Someone's got fancy gadgets.

187
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,136
It's two-way.

188
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,681
And these.

189
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,728
If things look bad,
throw them hard on the ground.

190
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,230
They'll go off on their own.

191
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,735
Where did you get equipment like this?

192
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,490
Are you a retired soldier?
A former NIS agent or something?

193
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,659
They're effective
for two to three minutes each,

194
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,039
so you'll buy enough time to get back
to the car if you use them in intervals.

195
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,084
Again with the mixed messages.

196
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,878
Are you worrying about me
or threatening me?

197
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,256
I'm saying let's not slow each other down.

198
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,534
Why do you keep your name a secret anyway?

199
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,121
Do you have a hang-up about your name?

200
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,042
Or do you carry a secret
that you can't divulge?

201
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,423
Ms. Silverbill.

202
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,093
Can you hear me?

203
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,427
Hello?

204
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,429
-Mic check--
-Focus, will you?

205
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,270
Okay. Roger that.

206
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,120
I guess he's already here.
Moving toward R2.

207
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,095
Ms. Silverbill,

208
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,304
are you on your way?

209
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,682
Where are you?

210
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,351
Ms. Silverbill.

211
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,585
What was that?

212
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,923
I think we walked into a trap.

213
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,842
You need to run away.

214
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,387
Now!

215
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,131
Where are you now? Are you okay?

216
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,927
I'm on my way. Keep running!

217
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,038
Hold on a sec.

218
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,167
Jang Ho-jae, you idiot.

219
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,209
This way!

220
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,142
What are those things? Are they human?

221
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,685
Let's get out of here first.

222
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,408
This is my fight from now on.

223
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,910
What does that mean?

224
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,455
If you're here, I can't fight properly.

225
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,372
What?

226
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,627
I'm sorry.

227
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,569
And who the heck are you?

228
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,238
Hi.

229
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,865
Ho-jae.

230
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,993
It's been so long.

231
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,453
No, wait.

232
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,872
We met briefly last time.

233
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,751
When I stabbed that woman.

234
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,635
Are you the one called Silverbill?

235
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,220
Tell me who you are
before you ask questions.

236
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,765
What the hell are you bastards?

237
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,145
Are you with the guy who killed Madam Na?

238
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,234
You bastard.

239
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,610
Were you that scared?

240
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,947
What was that swarm of people
that I just saw?

241
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,323
I heard you had surgery.

242
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,077
I just came to check

243
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,664
if all your memories really disappeared…

244
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,502
and if there really is nothing left.

245
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,214
Fucking assholes.

246
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,342
This isn't what we agreed.

247
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,477
Man, that was boring.

248
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,188
Is that all you got?

249
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,900
Keep going.

250
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,197
Keep going, you asshole.

251
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,575
Those who came here today

252
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,411
are all gonna die.

253
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,961
No. Don't do it.

254
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,962
Don't, you bastard!

255
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,297
Master Jang.

256
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,857
No…

257
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,785
Are you all right?

258
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,497
Master Jang.

259
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,833
No.

260
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,501
Stay with me.

261
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,837
No!

262
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,464
End them now.

263
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,883
You have to get up. No.

264
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,178
No, please. Wake up!

265
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,689
Ho-jae, get in quickly!

266
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,794
After them!

267
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:43,711
Forget it.

268
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,090
There's no need.

269
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,804
They'll soon find out…

270
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,474
what it is that they rescued.

271
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,406
Is she dead?

272
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,241
Tell me! Is the woman dead?

273
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,451
God, this is messed up!

274
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,578
-What's going on?
-Let's go to the hospital.

275
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,163
-What? The hospital?
-Step on it.

276
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,332
-Floor it!
-The hospital? Just wait.

277
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,587
What?

278
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,756
What's happening?

279
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,466
Are you all right?

280
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,513
She hasn't fully recovered
from the injury two days ago.

281
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,181
I need to feed.

282
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,435
Add to that more enormous blood loss
due to the exact same injury.

283
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,772
It'd be near impossible for her
to resist the hunger and thirst.

284
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,276
I need to feed.

285
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,694
I need to feed.

286
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,491
You're losing a lot of blood.
We have to stem it first.

287
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,038
Stop the car!

288
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,582
-Stop the car!
-What are you doing?

289
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,417
-Stop!
-Are you out of your mind?

290
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,960
-Let me go!
-Don't do this!

291
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,234
Yong-gil.

292
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,946
Yong-gil, are you okay?

293
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,240
Yong-gil, wake up.

294
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,759
I need to feed.

295
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,844
-I need to feed.
-I need to feed.

296
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,263
I need to feed.

297
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,142
-I need to feed.
-I need to feed.

298
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,603
This is bad.

299
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,729
Ms. Silverbill!

300
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,277
I need to feed.

301
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,904
-What's wrong?
-I need--

302
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,947
Get away from me!

303
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,452
I'm sorry.

304
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,795
Get away from me.

305
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,381
Don't come close.

306
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,469
You have to go to the hospital.

307
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,804
You might actually die!

308
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,139
Before I do!

309
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,475
Before I do…

310
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,855
I might end up killing you.

311
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:55,319
I might end up attacking you, so please…

312
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,242
please just go.

313
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,702
Please…

314
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,128
I don't know why I'm acting like this.

315
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,172
But…

316
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,675
a name came to me just now.

317
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,678
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.
