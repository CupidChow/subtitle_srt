GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

2
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,822
Mrs. Nawol.

3
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,117
-Mrs. Nawol.
-Yes?

4
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,413
This letter. Who is it from?

5
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,624
What is this?

6
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,834
You didn't put it on my desk?

7
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,919
No, I didn't.

8
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,215
Beom-o. Did you take it upstairs?

9
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,800
It wasn't me either.

10
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,593
What's wrong?

11
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,386
What does the letter say?

12
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,389
Why?

13
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,391
Does it say something bad?

14
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,730
I'LL BE WAITING AT THE MOONLIGHT BAR

15
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,208
You don't want to go in, Master Jang.

16
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,085
It's her.

17
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,825
You came.

18
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,706
It's been, what,
two years since the war ended?

19
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,958
I thought you had gone back to Japan.

20
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,502
Not that I had died?

21
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,344
Let's hear why you came to see me.
What do you want?

22
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,808
I'd like to hear an apology first.

23
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,978
You ruined my husband's funeral…

24
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,773
and hurt me.

25
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,239
We simply tried to mourn
those who died at Ongseong Hospital.

26
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:23,745
Is that how you like to justify
the terrorist attack you committed?

27
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,916
We call it resistance.

28
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,086
I was true to you.

29
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,135
I truly thought of you as a friend
and worried about you.

30
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,638
And so I helped you.

31
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,726
But you always repay me
with rejections and affronts.

32
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:55,109
True friendship isn't about give-and-take
and paying each other back.

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,947
It's about sharing
and understanding each other.

34
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,830
Go back to your country now, Lady Maeda.

35
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,459
The era of your people has come to an end.

36
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,340
I hope we never see each other again.

37
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,708
There is no place left for you

38
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,335
to return to,

39
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,587
Mr. Jang Tae-sang.

40
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,388
Beom-o, quickly!

41
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,207
Mr. Gu!

42
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,295
Mrs. Nawol…

43
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,786
Out of the way, you fucking bastards.

44
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,874
Mrs. Nawol.

45
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,414
I've given some thought
to what you said earlier.

46
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,959
But I still disagree.

47
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:29,300
Friends are meant to give and take
and pay each other back.

48
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,226
Mrs. Nawol.

49
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,687
Mrs. Nawol?

50
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,236
Mrs. Nawol.

51
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,410
Mrs. Nawol. Wake up.

52
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,414
Mrs. Nawol. Look at me.

53
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,085
Water.

54
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,838
I need water.

55
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,533
No.

56
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,619
Mr. Gu.

57
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,828
Beom-o!

58
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,248
Mr. Gu!

59
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,716
Mr. Gu!

60
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,803
No!

61
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,849
No! Please, no!

62
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,521
You rotten sons of bitches!

63
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,027
Master Jang.

64
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,372
Sir…

65
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,669
Are you all right?

66
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,548
Are you all right, Mrs. Nawol?

67
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,260
Are you hurt?

68
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,179
I feel strange.

69
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,894
It's so cold.

70
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,107
And my head hurts.

71
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,196
Can you help me?

72
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,787
Mrs. Nawol.

73
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,667
I'm coming.

74
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,621
Mrs. Nawol.

75
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,166
Tae-sang.

76
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,428
Run.

77
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,225
Now.

78
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,480
Get away from me.

79
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,029
It's all right, Tae-sang.

80
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,584
I…

81
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,048
I'm all right.

82
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,803
You know…

83
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,100
what I mean, don't you?

84
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,208
GYEONGSEONG CREATURE
BETWEEN CURSE AND BLESSING

85
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,212
EPISODE 5
THE CREATURE

86
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,144
People often think

87
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:01,817
they will find happiness
once they have everything.

88
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,029
No.

89
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,909
When you have everything, you get bored.

90
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,708
You get bored
and become apathetic to everything.

91
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,886
That's why you turn to destruction.

92
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,187
Whenever I see fear and rage
in a person's eyes,

93
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,065
I'm always able to grasp

94
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,778
the fact that I am alive.

95
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,157
Long time no see.

96
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,494
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.

97
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,374
How are you…

98
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,797
The same way you're still alive,
I presume.

99
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,141
I'm not surprised.

100
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,021
Was it Seishin?

101
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,654
So much time has passed.

102
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:36,120
But now that I face you again,
everything suddenly becomes very clear,

103
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,164
as if it all happened yesterday.

104
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,920
Memories of you, Seishin…

105
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,382
and Mr. Jang.

106
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,469
Why are you people…

107
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,474
still here to this day?

108
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,855
Why do you think we shouldn't be here?

109
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,569
We are no longer
your enemies or perpetrators.

110
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,701
Considering the time that has passed,

111
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,789
shouldn't you be thanking us,
even just a little bit?

112
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,170
You, Ms. Yoon Chae-ok,

113
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,630
are still alive because of us.

114
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,842
As is Mr. Jang.

115
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,854
You experimented on him too?

116
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,068
I simply did him a favor.

117
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,321
As a friend.

118
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,537
Why did you?

119
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,415
Why did you do that?!

120
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:09,922
Why did you have to bring him into this?!

121
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,759
Do you know…

122
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,681
why hell is a dreadful place,
by any chance?

123
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,897
Because it never ends.

124
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,235
He and I couldn't be friends,

125
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:37,074
so I decided to become his hell instead.

126
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,727
Why are you suddenly involving her
in the experiment?

127
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,440
Why do you ask?

128
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,528
To have constant variables
in an important plan is not ideal.

129
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,574
It increases the chance
of unpredictable situations.

130
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,787
This isn't about the experiment.

131
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,750
I am exacting revenge on her…

132
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,547
that I couldn't get 79 years ago.

133
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,871
Master Jang.

134
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,471
Master Jang!

135
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,562
Are you okay? Master Jang!

136
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,072
Make your choice now.

137
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,075
Either go back to the man you used to be

138
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:44,952
or…

139
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,455
die here like this.

140
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,754
What's your call?

141
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,508
Do you want to go back or…

142
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,762
let her watch you die?

143
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,185
And if I go back…

144
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,857
to how I was before…

145
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,780
I can beat you?

146
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,950
Maybe.

147
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,121
And I can…

148
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,041
save her too?

149
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,257
Maybe.

150
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,682
Don't try to do anything. Just stay there.

151
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,767
I'll come to you now.

152
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,313
Don't move. Just stay there!

153
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:58,483
I'll head over there right now.

154
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,234
No.

155
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,574
No!

156
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:52,245
No!

157
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,209
No!

158
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,169
You shouldn't!

159
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,886
Don't do it. Stop!

160
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,184
No, don't do it!

161
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,504
No!

162
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,466
No.

163
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,533
I'm looking for someone.

164
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,038
Cherry blossoms…

165
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,040
Until the cherry blossoms fall.

166
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,085
That was my mother.

167
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,218
Let's make a promise.

168
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,677
Stay alive.

169
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,347
Do you really think
those good times will come to us?

170
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,723
No!

171
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,646
The cherry blossoms…

172
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,441
have all fallen.

173
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,446
Master Jang!

174
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,407
Master Jang!

175
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,998
I need to go to him.

176
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,333
It's too late.

177
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,753
There's nothing you can do now.

178
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,640
Stop her!

179
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,592
Yoon Chae-ok.

180
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,472
Where is she?

181
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,248
Jang Ho-jae has escaped.

182
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,715
It seems our fears have been realized.

183
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,763
Jang Tae-sang is out of control
and looking for the woman.

184
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,893
Go…

185
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,439
and bring him to me.

186
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,943
What about the woman?

187
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,160
Kill her.

188
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,872
Very well, ma'am.

189
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,814
You've gotta be kidding me.

190
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,255
Who are you?

191
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,008
And who are you?

192
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,093
I asked you first!

193
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:08,139
I'm a good friend
of the owners who live here.

194
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,267
I come by and share my side dishes
and kimchi with them.

195
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,270
What about you? How do you know them?

196
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,900
I'm not as close to them as you are.

197
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,029
Why did you make a hole in the wall?

198
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,533
Wait, I didn't do that.

199
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,118
Let's see.
What was the number for the police?

200
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,163
There's no need. I am the police.

201
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,041
Detective Noh Ji-su
from Jongno Police Station.

202
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,001
I'm here to pursue a suspect.

203
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,169
A suspect?

204
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,088
Who's a suspect?

205
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,257
Well, Mr. Jang Ho-jae.

206
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,553
It always makes me wonder.

207
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:51,808
Why do cops leave the real culprits alone
and harass the innocent all the time?

208
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,226
Excuse me, ma'am--

209
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,143
Enough.

210
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,645
Make a call.

211
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,646
Pardon?

212
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,648
Call your captain right now.

213
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,484
You want me to call my captain? Why?

214
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,902
Should I call him, then?

215
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,954
Detective Noh.

216
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,374
Myung-jun, is that you?
It's me, Antenna from Sinseol-dong.

217
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,419
Ma'am, what's going on?

218
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,254
I'm calling about Master Jang.

219
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,591
Where are you?
Are you gonna make me come to you?

220
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,972
Tell me where you are.

221
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,058
You lost her?

222
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,435
I apologize.

223
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,605
You know, you build up tolerance
when you catch a cold.

224
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,399
She was hit with nitrogen once.
She won't fall for it again.

225
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:46,070
You know that no one can handle Ho-jae
when he flips out.

226
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,576
You're probably the only person
who has a chance of stopping him now.

227
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,119
Or, you know,

228
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,538
release the kid downstairs.

229
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,333
Number 71, was it?

230
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,084
He must be in his best shape.

231
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,425
-Release the Kurokos.
-Yes, sir.

232
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,083
No!

233
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,884
Where is she?

234
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,679
Tell me where she is.

235
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,224
Where is she?!

236
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,655
I don't remember when,

237
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,533
but everything started to fade away.

238
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,121
Why I'd been fighting,
what I'd been fighting for,

239
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,832
and even my rage.

240
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,800
I couldn't overcome a certain yearning.

241
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,531
I existed…

242
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,452
but I wasn't living.

243
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,585
All I wanted was to see her.

244
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,976
I wanted to embrace her…

245
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,148
and hold on to her.

246
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,618
Master Jang!

247
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,453
Just once would be enough

248
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,331
if it meant I could see you.

249
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,495
If it meant

250
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,206
I could touch you.

251
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,599
Master Jang.

252
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,154
It's me.

253
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,037
I'm here.

254
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:55,982
What happened?

255
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,025
Two Kuroko units have been annihilated.

256
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,043
What happened here?

257
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,714
As you can see, they were totally crushed.

258
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,383
And I got destroyed.

259
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,761
-Where's Jang Tae-sang?
-He ran away with the woman.

260
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,639
They were heading toward tunnel 5.

261
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,268
What, you want me to go after them?

262
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,354
Pursue them now. Don't let them escape.

263
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,814
Yes, sir.

264
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,591
There's no time.

265
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,135
The Kurokos will be swarming again.

266
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,136
Can you

267
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,014
take care of her?

268
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:58,145
In this state, she won't get far
before being captured by the Kurokos.

269
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,858
I'll try to distract them the best I can.
Please get her out of here.

270
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,444
Can you do that for me?

271
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,447
Please, Seung-jo.

272
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,786
Remember tunnel 5?

273
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,958
Take a right at the end of this hallway.
There's a small hole in the ceiling.

274
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,835
It's not noticeable. You might pass it.

275
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,671
So keep an eye out.

276
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,844
It will be all right.

277
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,054
I'll see you outside.

278
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,062
Did he not come this way?

279
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,150
But this is the only exit.

280
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,166
Bring Seung-jo to me.

281
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,147
It looks like you found it right away
without missing it.

282
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,069
She should be in front of exit 5.

283
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,573
If you go out like that,
people will notice you in no time.

284
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,117
Get changed.

285
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,629
Thanks, Seung-jo.

286
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,966
Please.
I told you not to pat me on the head.

287
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,385
I'm not a kid anymore.

288
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,347
I'll get going. They'll suspect me
if I'm gone for too long.

289
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,313
That day, a year ago…

290
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,193
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

291
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,487
Bro.
