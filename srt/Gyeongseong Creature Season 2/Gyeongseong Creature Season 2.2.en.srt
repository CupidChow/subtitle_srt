Please don't kill us.

3
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,249
Please don't kill us.

4
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,587
What in the world happened here?

5
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,805
Is this my doing?

6
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:41,638
Hurray for the independence of Korea!

7
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,612
Gyeongseong will now…

8
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,159
welcome a new spring.

9
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,008
But my winter

10
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,011
has not ended yet.

11
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,737
Left behind by myself
in this perfect hell…

12
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,452
I was forgotten by all.

13
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,208
But…

14
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,673
why?

15
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,801
Why are these things happening again?

16
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,890
Master Jang.

17
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,437
How is it that you are here?

18
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,750
Hey?

19
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,836
I think you're hugging the wrong guy.

20
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,841
Who is Master Jang?

21
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,095
I'm afraid I don't know who that is.

22
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,440
You're not Master Jang?

23
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,524
I'm not.

24
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,361
My name is Jang Ho-jae.

25
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,288
Are you all right?

26
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,458
Why did I do that?

27
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,252
It simply isn't possible.

28
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,712
Excuse me.

29
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,257
There's no way it could be him.

30
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,885
Hey!

31
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,140
Wait.

32
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,061
You haven't answered me yet.

33
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,566
About what?

34
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,485
About who you are,

35
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,322
why you were there that day,
and your relationship with Oh Ki-hoon.

36
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,367
And why do I have to tell you any of that?

37
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,369
Because I'm about to take the fall

38
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,124
and become a murder suspect,
all because I got mixed up with you.

39
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,753
So can you tell me why you were there?

40
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,341
I received a request

41
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,677
to find a missing person.

42
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,180
I went to the motel to find Oh Ki-hoon,

43
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,474
who was already dead when I arrived.

44
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,769
So you're in the same boat as me?

45
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,479
I wouldn't exactly say that.

46
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,648
You're a suspect, and I'm not.

47
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,944
The police also have you on video.

48
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,782
You'll be on the wanted list soon enough.

49
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,992
So?

50
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,328
Want to be on the same side?

51
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,832
You're not the culprit, and neither am I,

52
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,419
but both of us are
under suspicion by the police.

53
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,670
We must help each other.

54
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,465
That's an arrogant way to ask for help.

55
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,051
Because there's no downside
to being on my side.

56
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,513
I don't want to sound like I'm bragging,

57
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,601
but you could say
I'm quite the hotshot in this field.

58
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,978
I work alone.

59
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,815
I hate getting tangled up with others.

60
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,362
I also don't like getting tangled up
with others, but hey,

61
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,991
a person has died.

62
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,121
I don't take second punches.

63
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,877
A word of advice?

64
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,215
Even if you find the killer,
you won't be able to handle them.

65
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,967
I'll be the judge
of whether I can handle them or not.

66
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,177
Go for it, then.

67
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,263
And don't ask me for a free ride.

68
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,515
A free ride?

69
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,558
Who? Me?

70
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,559
Exactly.

71
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,481
Let's mind our own business
and deal with our problems on our own.

EPISODE 2
SIGN

74
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,409
You're back? So, what happened?

75
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,494
Did you find the woman?

76
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,955
Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.

77
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,254
Yong-gil, do you know a Master Jang?

78
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:50,840
Who?

79
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,216
Master Jang.

80
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,677
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

81
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,387
Why?

82
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,681
That woman asked me if I was Master Jang.

83
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,391
So?

84
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,476
I told her I wasn't,

85
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,146
but it sounded familiar.

86
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,648
I thought maybe I'd heard it
from you or something.

87
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,483
From me?

88
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,778
Probably not. I've never heard it before.

89
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,158
I'm making instant noodles.
Want some? I can add more water.

90
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,159
No, I'm good.

91
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,438
Hi, Bugang Company's Jang Ho-jae speaking.

92
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,692
Who is this?

93
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,842
Job request.

94
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,929
Missing person's name, Jang Ho-jae.
Age, early 30s.

95
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,265
He's been missing for about a year.

96
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,727
There is no photograph, only a drawing.

97
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,728
Do you accept?

98
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,511
Here you go.

99
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,096
Thank you.

100
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,062
Ethiopian, huh?

101
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,105
Paraguayan.

102
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,153
I actually don't know coffee that well.
I just took a guess.

103
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,822
I don't know it well either.
I just read the label.

104
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,912
I assume you're not here
to find out my taste in coffee.

105
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,331
Let's cut to the chase. What do you want?

106
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,041
Actually…

107
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,464
I'm here to give you this.

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,883
JONGNO-GU SERIAL MURDER

109
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,636
CASE REPORT

110
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,724
These murders occurred in our jurisdiction
in the past two months.

111
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,936
Mr. Oh Ki-hoon was the fifth victim.

112
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,940
The same MO was used in all five cases.

113
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:39,985
When the bodies were found,
they were missing an eye and their brain.

114
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,986
Brain?

115
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,156
Like the one inside here?

116
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,202
To be honest, we've never seen
this kind of murder before,

117
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,205
so even the detectives are a bit baffled.

118
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,626
We haven't even figured out
what was used to suck out the brain.

119
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,922
Are you saying
this was all done by one person?

120
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,300
Yes. It's the work of a single killer.

121
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,223
Still no reply?

122
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,853
If you're busy,
you can leave a number and go.

123
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,355
I'll text you
when a decision has been made.

124
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,608
How long have you been working
with Silverbill?

125
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,322
I don't take any questions
regarding Silverbill.

126
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,284
I only take requests
to find missing persons.

127
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,286
The request for Ki-hoon…

128
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,956
are you the one who took it?

129
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,966
So this bar

130
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,136
is the reception, so to speak.

131
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,556
Right?

132
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,697
-I'M HEADING OVER NOW
-DON'T COME

133
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,545
I'm curious. What is the meaning of this?

134
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,757
You must've given me the details
of the investigation for a reason.

135
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,133
It's only fair.

136
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,428
You should at least know
what kind of case you're jumping into

137
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,681
and how dangerous
and horrific this culprit is.

138
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,767
This is the least I can do.

139
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,894
Are you new to Violent Crimes?

140
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,395
I transferred two months ago.

141
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,939
How many cases have you solved?

142
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,941
Just a couple of small-time ones.

143
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,901
Yet they gave you a serial murder case?

144
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,613
I can't pick and choose the cases I take.
I'm just following orders.

145
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,490
Then why stick that on there?

146
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,623
A pretty noticeable spot, don't you think?

147
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,670
I'm sorry.

148
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,172
No worries. Did I startle you?

149
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,090
Yes.

150
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,387
ANOTHER VICTIM FOUND
ALL DETECTIVES TO THE CRIME SCENE

151
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,765
It's another murder.
This is the sixth one already.

152
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,226
-Let's go together.
-What?

153
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,176
We ask for your cooperation.

154
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,513
Back up. Do not take pictures.
Back up, please.

155
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,349
Back up, please.

156
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,228
Stop. This is a crime scene. Step back.

157
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,312
Has anyone been hurt?

158
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,647
This is a crime scene.

159
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,607
Please move. Clear the way.

160
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,998
This is driving me nuts.

161
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
I didn't think this would happen to her.

162
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,171
I know, right?

163
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,926
She was so good to me.

164
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,111
MADAM NA

165
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,340
Who are you?

166
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,302
How do you know Jang Ho-jae?

167
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,348
Did you kill Madam Na?

168
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,394
I asked her things,
but she kept talking nonsense.

169
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,896
So yeah.

170
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,486
You crazy bastard.

171
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,405
Where are you?

172
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,160
Tell me where you are right now.

173
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,788
-I asked you a question.
-No pictures.

174
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,540
You should be answering me.

175
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,292
Move out of the way. Please move.

176
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,679
Step back.

177
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,806
Step back. This is a crime scene.

178
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,723
Back up.

179
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,023
Thank you.
I got here quicker thanks to you.

180
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,112
That's odd.

181
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,407
Why won't you die?

182
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,409
Shouldn't you be dead by now

183
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,579
with your neck broken
or your insides ruptured?

184
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,458
If you're human, that is.

185
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,215
Who the hell are you?

186
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,718
Why did you kill Madam Na?

187
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,764
Did you kill Oh Ki-hoon too?
Are you the one behind all of this?

188
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,602
You…

189
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,897
You're one of us.

190
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,723
Let's find out.

191
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,562
Who the fuck are you?

192
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,483
Hey, are you all right?

193
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,401
Are you hurt…

194
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,785
Hello? Someone's been stabbed.

195
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,453
Get here now!

196
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,629
Are you okay?

197
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,383
Hold on a little longer.
The ambulance is on its way.

198
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,553
Hey!

199
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,848
You have to stay awake. Hey!

200
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,477
Stay with me. Hey!

201
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,287
Did you get some sleep?

202
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,921
You were sleeping so peacefully.

203
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,090
I didn't want to wake you.

204
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,017
Master Jang.

205
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:42,939
What's wrong?

206
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,651
Did you have a bad dream?

207
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,993
It was a wretched dream.

208
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,249
A terrifying…

209
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,338
and lonely one.

210
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,678
A dream is just a dream.

211
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,140
Don't think too much of it.

212
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,528
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

213
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,197
I will be here

214
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,950
by your side forever.

215
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,360
Let him go. You're bleeding too much.
We need to treat you now.

216
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,368
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

217
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,828
No, I'm on Level 1.

218
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,914
Pardon?

219
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,126
Last night?

220
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:17,218
JAZZ BAR OWNER IN HER 40S MURDERED
BODY FOUND WITH DAMAGED EYE

221
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,804
I'll look into it and see what happened.

222
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,933
No. Don't concern yourself.
I'll make sure it's taken care of.

223
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,893
Yes.

224
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,732
Call Seung-jo.

225
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,942
Yes, sir.

226
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,557
Do you know
where the emergency patient went?

227
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,142
No, I haven't seen her.

228
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,855
How did it go? Is she all right?

229
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,566
I'm afraid she's disappeared.

230
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,611
We're searching
the whole building right now,

231
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,199
but it seems like she's left the hospital.

232
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,742
What?

233
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,286
What are you…

234
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,597
Is a roundup really necessary?

235
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,728
Scare tactics are a bit outdated--

236
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,086
Do not cause trouble again.
Do not act on your own.

237
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,132
It's because I acted on my own
that I took care of that bastard Ki-hoon.

238
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,009
You know that!

239
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,887
When I'm talking, you listen.

240
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,889
Isn't it frustrating to live like this?

241
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,475
How long are you going to stay in hiding?

242
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,103
With our powers,
we can live however we want!

243
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,736
Power that cannot be controlled
is not real power, Seung-jo.

244
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,115
That's chaotic inertia and violence,
nothing more.

245
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,870
Don't let me hear a peep from you
for a while.

246
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,707
And don't do anything

247
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,835
until the incidents
that you've caused die down.

248
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,423
Make one more mess,

249
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,593
and you'll have to explain yourself
directly to the chairman.

250
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,137
If you'd like that, be my guest.

251
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,938
Are you sure he's dead?

252
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,024
Ho-jae.

253
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,070
Is he really dead?

254
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,499
Seung-jo.

255
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,252
Don't ever bring that name up again.

256
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,337
I'll gut you.

257
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,137
JONGNO POLICE STATION

258
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,725
This makes the sixth victim.

259
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,603
And the culprit left no trace.

260
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:00,108
None of the victims are related,
save for the way they were murdered.

261
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,276
No patterns either.

262
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,952
Did you glean anything on your end?

263
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,663
Detective Noh.

264
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,707
Noh Ji-su?

265
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,627
Did you get anything?

266
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,130
No, nothing that stands out so far.

267
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,591
-So?
-What?

268
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,428
So why are you sitting there
if you haven't found anything?

269
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,265
Didn't I tell you
to keep an eye on Jang Ho-jae?

270
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,768
No one told you to sit your ass down
and listen to music.

271
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,565
I'll be off, then.

272
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,411
He's not home yet?

273
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,188
Where Silverbill lives?
Well, I wouldn't know that.

274
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,483
I doubt even Madam Na knew that much.

275
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,865
They used text messages for communication.

276
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,786
They'd only call each other
when it was urgent.

277
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,790
No one's ever met Silverbill
or seen their face.

278
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,213
Why is this place so bleak?

279
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,262
They say you can never tell
what life has in store for you.

280
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,682
Who would've thought
Madam Na would die like that?

281
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,320
This is too much!

282
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,782
You said your grandson just graduated.
Get him some nice clothes.

283
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,621
Speaking of, he applied for a job recently

284
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,583
and passed everything,
even the interview, all in one go!

285
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,335
He's got a job already?

286
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,380
He's going to work at Jeonseung Biotech!

287
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,301
I was planning on buying him a nice suit.

288
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,971
Thanks, President Jang.

289
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,265
Yong-gil's the president.

290
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,349
Whatever!

291
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,353
All of us antennas know that Master Jang
is the one keeping Bugang afloat.

292
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,360
Who?

293
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,738
What?

294
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,326
What did you just call me?

295
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,787
Oh, well…

296
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,668
there used to be a pawnshop
where your office is right now.

297
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,295
House of Golden Treasure.

298
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,381
He was the owner of that pawnshop.

299
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,260
He was such a good man,
even back during my mother's days.

300
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,097
Right, so,

301
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,641
who was he?

302
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,144
Just some guy.

303
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,022
Master Jang.

304
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,526
Master Jang.

305
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,856
That is the result of Experiment A0-67.

306
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,442
How far did we progress this time?

307
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,362
We weren't able to pass Stage 2 again.

308
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,008
Don't panic.

309
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,929
The moment it recognizes
that you're frightened, it'll attack you.

310
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,972
Don't move. Stand your ground.

311
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,481
Please help me!

312
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,233
Don't look away. Keep still.

313
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,986
I can't do this! I can't!

314
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,269
How long do you intend
to shove failed reports at me?

315
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:15,566
If you can't control those down there,
we can't proceed to the next stage.

316
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,070
If you continue to show no results
and lag like this,

317
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,490
we might have to bring him back.

318
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,368
I will find a solution.

319
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,955
The previous chairman planted
the Najin in your head

320
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,374
so you could protect Jeonseung

321
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,710
and devote yourself
to making great accomplishments.

322
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,923
If you can't stop making
these absurd mistakes and failures,

323
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,010
I will dispose of you.
You should not forget that.

324
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,680
I have not forgotten, sir.

325
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,015
Not for a single moment.

326
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,277
What about Seung-jo?

327
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,863
I've spoken to him.
He will behave for the time being.

328
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,659
Tell him he'll be locked up forever
if he stirs up trouble one more time.

329
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,787
I mean, murder?

330
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,248
In this day and age?

331
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,787
Eat up, man.
It's getting all soggy. What a waste.

332
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,502
This place used to be a pawnshop.
The House of Golden Treasure.

333
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,755
Is that right?

334
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,008
It was owned by a Master Jang.

335
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,478
Granny Antenna knew about it.
Didn't you know?

336
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,608
Not sure.
I might've heard about it and forgot.

337
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,320
What now?

338
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,698
I'm just asking.

339
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,826
Is there anything more
I should know about myself

340
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,412
before the accident last year?

341
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,123
No, there isn't.

342
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,502
I told you pretty much everything
you need to know. Why?

343
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,420
What else do you wanna know?

344
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,757
I wouldn't know
what more there is to know.

345
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:50,346
What I remember about myself
all comes from after the accident.

346
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,141
My memories from before the accident
were filled in by you.

347
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,148
Ho-jae, do you trust me?

348
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,566
I do.

349
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,903
And no one in this world worries
and cares for you as much as I do, right?

350
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,530
Yeah, I know that.

351
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,115
So just listen to me.

352
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,077
You're much better off now
than you were before the accident.

353
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,874
It's not always great
to live with all your memories intact.

354
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,421
Looking at you, I can see why they say
oblivion is a gift to mankind.

355
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,172
Your life's already been reset,

356
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,050
so it doesn't seem so bad
to move on and live a new life.

357
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,055
Was my life that bad?

358
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,766
You're making it serious again!

359
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,518
That's not what I'm saying.

360
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,397
You said I should move on
and live a new life since it's been reset.

361
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,650
That means that my life
before the accident was unhappy

362
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,570
or screwed up or something, right?

363
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,365
The accident happened,
and you lost your memories--

364
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,367
Yes, about those memories…

365
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,330
I want them back.

366
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,624
Ho-jae.

367
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,628
Can you tell me?

368
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,048
What was I like?

369
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,969
I mean, how screwed up was I?

370
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,014
Come on.

371
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,477
Your life?

372
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,982
It was totally, extremely,
freaking annoyingly screwed up.

373
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,277
It was depressing, miserable, and unhappy.

374
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,863
Totally and extremely lame.

375
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:35,034
You were a step away from hell, strung out
with paranoia, anxiety, and insomnia.

376
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:38,913
You'd cause trouble and smash everything
because you had anger management issues.

377
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,291
So there's no reason at all
for you to look back at your past life.

378
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,460
There's nothing to be curious about.

379
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,711
What you should do

380
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:50,257
is believe, see, think of, and enjoy
only what's in front of you.

381
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,259
There's jajangmyeon in front of you,

382
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,678
and all you have to do is enjoy it.

383
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,201
You must've had a really hard time.

384
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,371
Hey, Ho-jae.

385
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,374
UNKNOWN NUMBER

386
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,292
Hello?

387
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,005
Hello?

388
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,049
It's me.

389
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,134
Where are you?

390
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,096
How's your injury? Are you okay?

391
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,140
Can I come in for a minute?

392
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:44,687
What…

393
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,116
What happened?

394
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,744
Your offer.

395
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,206
Does it still stand?

396
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,502
To be on the same side.

397
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm wondering if it still stands.

398
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,761
Hello?
