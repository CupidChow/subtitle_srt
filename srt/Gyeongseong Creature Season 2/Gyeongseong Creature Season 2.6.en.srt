2
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,950
I was a special child.

3
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,535
It is fine to kill.

4
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,039
But you should not be caught.

5
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,208
Why is that?

6
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,925
A good son always answers "yes."

7
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,222
To talk back and ask "why" is bad manners.

8
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,432
Seung-jo.

9
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,520
Yes,

10
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,147
Mother.

11
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,160
I just wanted Mother's approval.

12
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,973
I wanted to be comforted.

13
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,227
Just once would've been enough.

14
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,958
Although we can't determine
why only he can partially transform,

15
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,878
we can formulate a hypothesis.

16
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,130
What would that be?

17
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,343
Unlike other specimens,

18
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,931
Seung-jo inherited his Najin
from his biological mother.

19
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,936
Akiko, you mean?

20
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,983
Having already learned much
from the mother's body,

21
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,028
the Najin, we can assume,

22
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,866
has conformed more actively
as it entered the child.

23
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,578
Like Seishin…

24
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,124
who suddenly activated her body

25
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:15,838
in order to protect her daughter.

26
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,385
Does this mean that

27
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,599
Akiko's maternal instinct
exists in that boy's head?

28
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,894
Perhaps.

29
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,773
Interesting.

30
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,742
That's when I realized

31
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,079
that I wasn't a special person,

32
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,581
but a special…

33
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,584
specimen.

34
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,132
Did your meeting with Mr. Jang go well?

35
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:00,967
Yes.

36
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,594
It went well.

37
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:08,266
I expect good results
from the next plan as well.

38
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,351
Seung-jo.

39
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,189
Did you get some sleep?

40
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,403
How's your injury?

41
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,661
What's wrong? Does it still hurt a lot?

42
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,789
If this is a dream…

43
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,378
I don't want to wake up.

44
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,405
"I missed you."

45
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:18,623
Saying these words over and over
didn't lessen my longing for you.

46
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,543
I missed you so much.

47
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,155
What happened? Where's No. 71?

48
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,074
We haven't found him yet.

49
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,458
It was you, wasn't it?

50
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,964
What the hell did you do?

51
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,219
For freedom.

52
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,975
Don't kid yourself. That's not freedom.
That's confusion and chaos.

53
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,102
Whatever it may be…

54
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,190
it sure is more fun
than what you have in mind.

55
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,234
What are you talking about?

56
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,069
I know…

57
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,366
what it is you want to do.

58
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,599
Hungry.

59
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,965
Man, that guy's plastered.
He must've drank all night.

60
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,136
Excuse me, sir.

61
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,971
Hungry.

62
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,815
Something's come up.

BAIT

65
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,687
Was it you who put Master Jang
on the wanted list?

66
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,272
Well, I wouldn't say that--

67
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,026
I heard you were in charge of the case.
That means it was you.

68
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,279
What was I supposed to do?
People are getting murdered.

69
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,866
Jang Ho-jae was leaving evidence
all over the crime scenes.

70
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,993
Your family has long been indebted

71
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,038
to the master
of the House of Golden Treasure.

72
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,417
How dare you make Master Jang
a wanted man?

73
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,047
Don't bother finding justice
by going after the wrong person.

74
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,218
Look for Jong-hyeok instead.

75
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,928
What?

76
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,015
My boy has gone missing.

77
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,767
What do you mean?

78
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,020
He went to his company's training camp,

79
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:14,275
but then he sent me ten million won
and stopped answering his phone.

80
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,488
So I called his workplace,
and they said there was no such training.

81
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,323
Which company is it?

82
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,576
Jeonseung Biotech.

86
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,926
So this all comes down to…

87
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,346
Jeonseung Biotech.

88
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,098
Should I dig into it?

89
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,683
Hey, you scared me.

90
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,810
Let a person know you're there.

91
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,105
Did you meet up
with the grandma from yesterday?

92
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,990
How do you two know each other?
She seemed pretty close to Jang Ho-jae.

93
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,408
Detective Park, let's eat.

94
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,578
-Should I order gukbap?
-What are you having?

95
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,581
To be honest,
I found it weird from the beginning.

96
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,084
Sure, Jang Ho-jae
may be competent and all that,

97
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,755
but you ordered him to find leads
like it was no big deal.

98
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,674
You also told me to keep an eye on him,

99
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,928
and you stayed up all night at the ICU,
watching over Mr. Kwon.

100
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:24,929
Aren't you hungry?

101
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,223
You've known each other
for a long time, right?

102
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,516
You can order later, then.

103
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,564
This is Yuh Myung-jun of Team 2,
Violent Crimes.

104
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,150
What?

105
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,529
Captain?

106
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,785
An indiscriminate killing occurred
on a subway platform in Seoul.

107
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:53,249
Three civilians died at the scene,
and one was rushed to the emergency room.

108
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,419
At 5:00 a.m., a call was received about
a man who appeared to be hallucinating…

109
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,555
According to the police, Suspect A…

110
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,472
Jong…

111
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,643
…attacked B, a male in his 50s,
who had been preparing for operations…

112
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,727
I know that kid.

113
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,315
He was getting tested on
below Jeonseung Biotech.

114
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,568
Is that true?

115
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,571
Yeah. He escaped from there this morning.

116
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,199
I did it.

117
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,078
I set him free.

118
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,124
Why in the world would you do that?

119
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,627
To show them.

120
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,134
People these days only believe things
they see with their own eyes.

121
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,845
Their faith is now weak.

122
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,930
Three more people died because of you.

123
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,182
And even more may end up dead.

124
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,268
Got that?

125
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,270
What do you mean?

126
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,441
More people may die?
Explain what that means.

127
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,819
I don't know the details.

128
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,031
All I know is that Lady Maeda

129
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,035
is planning something dangerous.

You know her better than I do.

134
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,713
She'll see it through to the end.

135
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,507
Probably.

136
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,802
Is this situation part of that plan?

137
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,266
Are you using him as bait
to capture both of us?

138
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,019
I suppose you really don't like me.

139
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,270
I don't trust you yet.

140
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,564
Who got you out of the underground again?

141
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,484
I clearly remember
who stabbed and kidnapped me.

142
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,847
Good God, he sent ten men flying
when we tried to grapple him down.

143
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,182
He's like a bull.

144
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,602
So I had no choice
but to zap him down with a Taser.

145
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,145
Only then did he drop down.

146
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,817
What kind of monster could do that?

147
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,568
Jong-hyeok.

148
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,199
Look at me. Ahn Jong-hyeok.

149
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,119
What's wrong with you?

150
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,414
Captain!

151
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,749
Are you okay, sir?

152
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,503
I'll go and get the first aid kit.

153
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,255
Do you know him?

154
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,094
BUGANG COMPANY

155
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,473
Hello?

156
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,767
It's me, Captain Yuh.

157
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,603
Hey! What happened to you?

158
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,398
I'm still alive. Don't worry.

159
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,692
Are you using this number again?

160
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,860
Yeah.

161
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,237
I'm back.

162
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:14,950
Okay.

163
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,244
Can you fill me in?

164
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,373
It's Jong-hyeok.
Sinseol-dong Antenna's grandson.

165
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,375
He was the culprit.

166
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,171
And he was recently hired by…

167
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,088
Yes.

168
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,007
Jeonseung Biotech.

169
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,639
What the hell are you doing?

170
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,808
You can't even manage
a single specimen right.

171
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,020
Do you see how your mess
is all over the news?!

172
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,527
I think it was Seung-jo, sir.

173
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,613
Why would he do that?

174
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,492
Shouldn't you be asking
Lady Maeda instead?

175
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,037
Are you saying
that Lady Maeda planned all this?

176
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,881
That's why I warned you, man.

177
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,431
I told you I didn't like this plan

178
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,768
from the moment she made
Jang Tae-sang come back, didn't I?

179
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,440
I don't know what she was thinking
when she gave that order,

180
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,027
but can't you see that it put all of us
at Jeonseung Biotech in danger?

181
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,452
As you said, the previous chairman
planted the Najin in my head

182
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,995
so I could protect Jeonseung

183
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,374
and devote myself
to making great accomplishments.

184
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,882
Should the welfare of Jeonseung
be threatened by this ordeal,

185
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,387
I'll let nothing stop me
from eliminating every risk,

186
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,306
whether it be Jang Tae-sang,
your incompetence…

187
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,061
or Lady Maeda's peremptory decisions.

188
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,318
Don't forget that.

189
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,820
First,

190
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,281
take care of this mess.

191
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,617
Bring No. 71 back.

192
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,663
Then we can talk with Lady Maeda again.

193
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,165
Satisfied?

194
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,340
What are you doing?

195
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,718
Are you planning on going alone?

196
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,221
I am going alone.

197
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,892
You're not going anywhere,
not when you haven't even recovered.

198
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:33,899
See?

199
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,110
I can go with you, can't I?

200
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,696
-Still no.
-Master Jang.

201
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,198
From now on,

202
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,243
I don't want to see you get hurt.

203
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,373
I don't want to see you fall into danger,

204
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,292
nor do I want to go on to regret
leading you into danger.

205
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,294
Not anymore.

206
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,713
This is the 21st century.

207
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:02,261
Don't tell me you're trying to protect me
because that sounds so outdated.

208
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,096
I am.

209
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:09,226
I may not look it,
but I'm over 100 years old.

210
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,646
And my way of thinking
is quite old-fashioned as well,

211
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,899
so I still believe
that men should protect women.

212
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,945
But I think I'm a better fighter than you.

213
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,739
Still no.

214
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,740
And…

215
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,370
I don't die.

216
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,832
I don't

217
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,877
want to be a woman
who needs to be protected by you.

218
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,590
I want to be a woman
who stays by your side.

219
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,636
So,

220
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,682
let's stay together, Master Jang.

221
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,853
Yeah?

222
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,119
It's cheating if you smile like that.

223
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,543
Give me one more smile.

224
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,859
Yeah.

225
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,696
Who? From where?

226
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,783
Jeonseung Biotech.
That's where they're from.

227
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,293
Are you insane? You're going where?

228
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,211
To that kid.

229
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,213
Why the heck would you do that?

230
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,049
I know him.

231
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,133
So what?

232
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,011
He got arrested. What can you do?

233
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,806
Jeonseung won't let him be.

234
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,935
They'll move to deal with him
in one of two ways.

235
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,812
Either take him back or kill him.

236
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,190
I should do something
before that happens.

237
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,860
Aren't you sick of it?
Living your whole life like that?

238
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,074
You fought them, got beaten up,
and barely managed to escape alive.

239
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,743
And you still want to fight them?

240
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,663
How can you be like that?

241
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,415
It's about time you call it quits!

242
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,543
-Seung-jo.
-Just run away instead!

243
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:44,047
Go wherever you want with that woman
and live your life now, okay?

244
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,301
I want to live my life too.

245
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,887
Happily, with her.

246
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,888
But

247
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,433
not by running away.

248
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,478
There is no life of mine that I can find…

249
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,149
by running away.

250
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,824
Who is it?

251
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,992
It's Noh Ji-su.

252
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,662
Some men from Jeonseung Biotech are here.

253
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,956
They want to take the culprit.

254
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,043
What are you saying?

255
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,088
You barge in here and demand
we hand over the culprit?

256
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,924
-That person is infected.
-Infected?

257
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,551
I was informed that

258
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,847
your team asked Jeonseung Biotech
about this nitrogen gas.

259
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,350
We did.
And we haven't heard back from you.

260
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,021
This is a portable nitrogen gas canister
used to suppress violent patients.

261
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,482
We developed it.

262
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,860
The infected patients display
strong aggression, you see.

263
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,280
Here are the official notes from the KDCA

264
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,700
and the approval letter
from the National Police Agency.

265
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,578
Please transfer the patient over to us.

266
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,580
You think we're a joke, huh?

267
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,376
He's accused of being involved in six
murder cases in the last two months.

268
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,963
Even today, three people died
in a single location.

269
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,633
Do you really think this stupid paper

270
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,469
can convince me
to hand over such a violent criminal?

271
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,568
The safety of civilians must come
before the investigations right now.

272
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,863
If the disease spreads
and things spin out of control,

273
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,491
will you, Captain Yuh,
take responsibility for it?

274
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,917
-They're moving faster than I thought.
-Aren't you too late?

275
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,753
The precinct is ten minutes away.
We still have time.

276
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,798
So what if you have time?
What are you going to do there?

277
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,508
What I do best.

278
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,426
Shake things up.

279
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,306
I'm ready. Let's go.

280
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:00,850
Me too.

281
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,689
I'm coming with you.

282
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,128
Aren't you going a bit too fast?
Can't you see the sign?

283
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,089
I can. But I've never really kept to them.

284
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,056
-Did you check?
-Yes.

285
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,101
The KDCA confirmed everything he said.

286
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,604
There are a handful
of infected people nationwide

287
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,814
who have displayed similar symptoms.

288
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,651
The issue is highly sensitive,
so everything's strictly confidential.

289
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,822
I also confirmed that Jeonseung Biotech
is researching the causes of infection.

290
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,199
Wait. Captain?

291
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,327
They're covering the cameras.

292
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,538
Damn it.

293
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,628
Should I release the gas first?

294
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,630
Don't bother. Just open it.

295
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,884
CAPTAIN YUH MYUNG-JUN

296
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,218
Yes, Captain.

297
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,553
Hey. Where are you?

298
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,265
Hey! Where are you?

299
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,018
I'm tailing the Jeonseung Biotech people.

300
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,104
-What?
-I'm sorry.

301
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:37,150
I know the culprit was caught red-handed.
I know this case is now closed.

302
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,235
But something doesn't feel right.

303
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,654
You don't think I'm reliable, I know.

304
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,449
But this time, I'll trust my instincts
and follow through.

305
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,450
I'm sorry, sir.

306
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,287
Finally, you're doing some work.

307
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,915
Do not lose them.

308
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,375
And keep me updated.

309
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,378
Yes, sir. I won't come back empty-handed.

310
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,963
Good. That's all.

311
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,572
My grandson. I heard he was here.

312
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,700
You can let me see him, can't you?

313
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,247
Yes, but not right now.

314
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:38,127
No. My baby didn't do it.
Jong-hyeok would never do such a thing!

315
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,421
You know that, don't you?

316
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,965
Yes, well…

317
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,646
There are two cars
and a motorcycle tailing us.

318
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,439
Floor it.

319
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,937
Do you…

320
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,857
like him a lot?

321
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,655
Why do I have to tell you that?

322
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,782
Because I like him too.

323
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,996
I knew about the bad blood
between him and Lady Maeda.

324
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,749
And I knew

325
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,377
why Jeonseung Biotech made him so angry.

326
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,592
So when he said he was going to wipe out
the underground lab a year ago…

327
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,305
I didn't hesitate for a second…

328
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,100
and told him I'd be on his side.

329
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,022
At the time…

330
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,070
I really thought I would die for him.

331
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,740
But…

332
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,163
I was wrong.

333
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,626
On that day, one year ago…

334
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,924
no one stopped me from joining him.

335
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,762
Say that again.

336
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,892
You would die for Mr. Jang?

337
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,689
Is that what you just said?

338
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,608
He's the first person to accept me.

339
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,777
He said that

340
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,363
it was okay to be myself.

341
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,952
He helped me realize that I was human.

342
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,956
So, for the first time…

343
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,836
it wasn't painful to be alive.

344
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,088
I also

345
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,590
accepted you.

346
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,262
You were born from a lowly courtesan,
but I accepted you as my son.

347
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,224
I registered you under my family name
despite the objections.

348
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,977
And yet

349
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,396
you betray me?

350
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,607
I'm sorry, Mother.

351
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,738
Please let me go.

352
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,369
Lift your head.

353
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,874
Lift your head up.

354
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,084
Now.

355
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:19,223
The Najin inside you will fall deep asleep
for the next 24 hours.

356
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,691
It will not protect you
under any circumstances whatsoever.

357
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,572
A knife will make you bleed,
and the wound will not heal.

358
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,201
A gunshot will penetrate your body
and lead to your death.

359
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,497
You will not recover.

360
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,543
Nor will you regenerate.

361
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,478
You may go if you wish.

362
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,689
I hope you go and learn

363
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,735
how weak and agonizing the human body is

364
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,781
and how meaningless
goodwill and righteousness are

365
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,076
in the face of death.

366
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,291
The choice is yours.

367
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,461
I will leave the door open.

368
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,843
The truth is,
I was there that day one year ago.

369
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,431
But I couldn't jump in and help him.

370
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,062
I was scared…

371
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,191
that I might die.

372
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,946
Being scared…

373
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,617
isn't something to be sorry about.

374
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,664
Some may be scared of dying…

375
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,464
while others may be scared of living.

376
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,973
The fears that people have
are all unique to themselves.

377
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,234
And besides, Master Jang
never once questioned you about that.

378
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,365
That means he already understands you.

379
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,578
So don't be sorry.

380
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,788
For the next 24 hours,

381
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,582
your Najin will be asleep.

382
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,253
During that time,
whether you're slashed with a knife

383
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,339
or shot with a gun,

384
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,426
you will die.

385
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,387
But why…

386
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,639
I told you.

387
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,809
I was scared…

388
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,898
that I might die.

389
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,357
So we meet again.

390
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,566
Yeah.

391
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,443
Has it been a year?

392
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,154
I'm sick and tired of your ass.

393
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,075
Tenacity happens to be
my redeeming quality.

394
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,827
You've reunited with the woman
you were yearning for.

395
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,164
Why not stay by her side?
Why bother showing up again?

396
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,248
Don't worry.

397
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,710
Once I'm done here, I'll see myself out.

398
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,755
Do you still trust Seung-jo?

399
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,533
Yeah.

400
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:12,868
I do.

401
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,123
Poor girl.

402
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,586
Just worry about yourself.

403
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,479
They've lured Jang Tae-sang away,
and Seung-jo is with Yoon Chae-ok.

404
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,267
Hey.

405
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,575
By the way,

406
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:41,373
if I go through with the surgery,
will I be able to play the cello again?

407
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,541
Of course.

408
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,670
You'll become a better cellist
than before the accident.

409
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,882
When will I receive the transplant?

410
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,095
I'm trying to select
the most suitable one for you.

411
00:41:55,846 --> 00:42:00,142
After three to six months,
the Najin learns most of the mechanisms.

412
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,062
It should not bear a huge toll
on the new body.

413
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,191
Is the success rate definitely higher
than when it's in its larval stage?

414
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,943
The transplant of a mature Najin

415
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,321
has not caused any deaths so far.

416
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,538
We'll go with this one.

417
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,415
Transplant it three months from now.

418
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,752
Just wait three more months.

419
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,339
You'll be able to walk again.

420
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:31,966
Go on and eat.
