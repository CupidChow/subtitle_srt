00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,840
High school life instantly decides
everything in one fell swoop.

3
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,730
Whether you get in a circle at first or not...

4
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,560
That's the problem.

5
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,480
Yes!

6
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:36,790
Well, this other time my boyfriend suddenly
said that he'd like to tie my wrist during sex.

7
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,580
Did you agree?

8
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,720
Of course not!
Talk about a mood killer.

9
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,500
-He really did so?
-Seriously.

10
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,870
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

11
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,000
Boys are dumb that's why they immediately
copy what's shown in porn videos.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,260
-I so know.
-Aren't I right?

13
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,590
But mine's an adult already so he
wouldn't try such kid acts.

14
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,470
-Isn't that the end for you?
-What? Is that so?

15
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,780
Well, mine also said that we should go
on a date through a drive...

16
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,110
We would go to a hotel in Roponggi and
have dinner there.

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,390
Wait, where did you take these lines from?

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,230
You don't think this way?

19
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,400
Just you though!

20
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,090
What a waste! It'd be good if you tried though.
It might be hotter than you expect.

21
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,920
What? Erika, you've already done it?

22
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,290
Isn't your boyfriend kinda crazy?

23
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,500
Well actually, I thought it was impossible
for me, but...

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,670
I did think that it was great at first
and all too, but...

25
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,620
If it was something like that,
I guess you can afford to do that too.

26
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,000
I have a call from my darling!
Excuse me for a bit~

27
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,350
Hello, darling~?

28
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,960
Who are you calling "darling"?!

29
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,330
One after the other, you make me pretend as your boyfriend!
You know our school prohibits phones during class.

30
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,270
Sorry, Sanchan!
I really owe you so much!

31
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,410
Seriously, why do you have to lie
about having a boyfriend?

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,850
You do now that all the girls in my group
have boyfriends. All they talk about is them.

33
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,600
I told you, there's no reason for you not to tell
them that you have zero experiences in love, right?

34
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,130
But there's no way they do bondage play, right?

35
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,320
Sorry, Sanchan!

36
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,250
I'm sure she's just lying.

37
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,160
Who is?

38
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,210
Erika.

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,110
I thought so too!
About her boyfriend, right?

40
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,340
Yup, you're right.

41
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,450
I get the feeling that he doesn't exist anywhere.

42
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,220
After all, we haven't seen his face yet.

43
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,330
You too?

44
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,960
I told her to let me see a photo of her boyfriend, but
she said he didn't like photos so I placed it aside.

45
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,880
I told her to let me see him but she sways
away from the topic.

46
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,970
Even the phone call a while ago... she puts
on an air like it's really her darling whom she's calling.

47
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,230
Why don't you just finally come out clean that
all the talk about your boyfriend was a lie?

48
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,480
No way. No way. No way!

49
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,440
After all, everyone in my class were already
gathered in a perfect group.

50
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,040
There's no way I can get in another group at this rate.

51
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,090
But why the heck did you get along
with those girls in the first place?

52
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,660
Well, there was no one around me
whom I could talk to anymore.

53
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,060
Okay, I'm not oblivious to it!
The fact that I'm so stupid.

54
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,470
But it's just like back in middle school
where you weren't with me.

55
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,330
Whichever high school life I choose
won't ever fit in with me.

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,940
So what are you gonna do?

57
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,930
For the meanwhile...

58
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,790
I think that I should look for a photo that'd make
them think of him as my boyfriend... or something?

59
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,650
Look... Isn't that guy so hot?

60
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,530
You're right!
He's ridiculously cool!

61
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,540
He looks like a celebrity!

62
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,590
I wanna make him my boyfriend!

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,810
Oh, my God! He's so freaking hot!!
I want him as a boyfriend! I really do!

64
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,070
He's freaking cool!

65
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,700
Which one would you pick between them?

66
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,880
So cool!

67
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,400
What? Erika! Wai---!

68
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,410
Where are you going?

69
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,380
You've got to be kidding right?

70
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,220
Look! What is that?!

71
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,140
What?

72
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,970
Let's go!

73
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,410
What are you doing?! You stupid---!

74
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,990
And with this...

75
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,540
...I found my boyfriend!

76
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,500
This might work.

77
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,550
I DID IT!

78
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,630
OOKAMI SHOUJO TO KURO OUJI
"Wolf Girl and Black Prince"

79
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,820
But seriously. This is your boyfriend?

80
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,810
Isn't he a freaking hottie?

81
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,090
It really took me through a lot of
trouble just to get a picture of him!

82
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,660
He hates being photographed.

83
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,980
But I have a feeling like I've seen
this guy somewhere.

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,710
Where?

85
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,530
Is he a model?

86
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,400
No, no! No way!
That's impossible.

87
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,950
What? What, what?

88
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,770
Isn't he Sata Kyoya from Class 8?!

89
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,950
You're right!

90
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,490
You see?
Look at this!

91
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,880
Class 8!

92
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,640
Oh, my God! This is great!

93
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,510
Oh, hey! Wai---!

94
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,500
You really can't just!

95
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,600
You guys! Cut it out!

96
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,520
Seriously! This is not a good idea!

97
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,370
This is seriously not a good idea!
He'll really get mad at me!

98
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,370
But knowing that there's a hottie like him
at Class 8, I'm sure people are swarming to him.

99
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,640
Of course, he has a face no one can forget!

100
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,770
You are so right!

101
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,280
HEY!

102
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,590
THIS IS BAD!

103
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,180
Kyoya-kun! Sata-kun!
Where are you~?

104
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,300
Hey!

105
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,380
What do you need from my class?

106
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,040
The perverted photographer
girl from yesterday.

107
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,880
Oh yeah! You're right! Yesterday!
Yesterday, yes!

108
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,630
Bye!

109
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,590
Okay! Let's go! About yesterday!
Yes, you are so right! It was yesterday!

110
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,130
This is something about yesterday!
Yesterday, yesterday.

111
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,860
Seriously?

112
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,320
"Darling..."

113
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,350
What?

114
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,080
I-I'm so sorry for suddenly
doing this with you.

115
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,530
There must be a reason for this, right?
If you're fine with me, I'd be glad to hear you out.

116
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,400
I mean, umm...

117
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,710
I see...

118
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,230
From what I've heard, I think
I got the gist of it.

119
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,210
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,240
Fine with me.

121
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,810
In other words...

122
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,730
I only have to pretend as your boyfriend, right?

123
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,900
Y-Y-You're fine with it?

124
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,610
Yup.

125
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,990
T-T-Thank you so much!

126
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,270
Then...

127
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,300
I'll have you spin three times, give me
your hands and bark, okay?

128
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,650
Ehhh?

129
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,220
It's not "ehh"...

130
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,960
Did you expect me to play along with
this nonsense request for nothing?

131
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,590
If I'm going to play along with
your nonsensical pretentious act...

132
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,730
You're going to have to be my dog.

133
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,240
"M-My d-dog?"

134
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,480
You know what?

135
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,760
I actually like dogs.

136
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,730
They're such cheerful creatures.

137
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,470
If you tell them to wait, they'll
wait how long it takes.

138
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,590
No matter how cold you are to them,
no matter how tears fill those black eyes,

139
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,650
they'll do just what their master says.

140
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,540
Those eyes of theirs are thrillingly
attractive to me.

141
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,090
Oh, but if you don't like it,
it's fine any way.

142
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Forgive me for going ahead with my mouth.

143
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,630
Miss Wolf Girl.

144
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,750
The girl who cried wolf!

145
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,980
We're kicking you out.

146
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,440
"Arf!"

147
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,740
It's too bad you're so dumb...

148
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,220
But I think this'll be great to kill time.

149
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,060
Kill time?

150
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,990
I'll dote on you then.

151
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,520
...Poochie.

152
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,940
Lemme play too.

153
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,550
You can't even clear off the game!

154
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,890
I can so...!

155
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,920
Come on, you guys! Don't fight.
Play in order, okay?

156
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,560
Then let's do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

157
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,720
Okay.

158
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,690
First comes rock!
Jackenpoy!

159
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,200
Yay!

160
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,000
Lemme play later.

161
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,580
I see. So he was that sadistic of a guy, huh?

162
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,960
I wouldn't think of him as such from the outside.

163
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,360
That's how he deceives everyone around him!

164
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,710
He's the worst swindler ever!

165
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,010
You're saying that?

166
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,650
But in the first place, it's
something you should be grateful for!

167
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,940
Even if he's such a sadistic black prince, he did
say he'd go out with you though.

168
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,460
I know! I am grateful!
I am overwhelming grateful!

169
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,610
But have you ever tried being told to turn around
three times and bark as he said?

170
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm at the point of revoking myself as human!

171
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,520
Even you had an option...

172
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,210
I know, but...

173
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,280
It can't be helped, though.
You have no other choice.

174
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,150
Something will turn out great either way.

175
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,800
San-chan... don't you feel happy being
released from your boyfriend?

176
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,890
You found out, huh?

177
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,940
GEEZZ~!

178
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,340
Meet me in the cafeteria.
Buy me a drink.
Make it fast!

179
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,580
Hey, Erika.
What will you eat?

180
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,700
I got a call from my darling.
Gotta go!

181
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,500
What's with her? Ever since she opened
up to us, she's been like that.

182
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,290
Still, why?

183
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,390
Why would the Number one hottie
in school choose Erika?

184
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
What?

185
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,330
What's wrong?

186
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,990
You're late. You made me wait.
Who do you think you are?

187
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,000
Sorry.

188
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,850
Hey, that's my---.

189
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,450
What? What'd you say?

190
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,300
I said nothing.

191
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,030
I'm digging in.

192
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,920
Geezz... You did that on purpose.

193
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
What?

194
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,140
Oh, it's Erika and her boyfriend!
Found you!

195
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,730
Why lunch together all of a sudden?

196
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,670
You've never eaten lunch together.

197
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,280
I figured we might as well, now
that the secret's out.

198
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,470
Your friends?

199
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,170
Yes, they're in the same class as mine.

200
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,400
Marin, Tezuka, and Nanase.

201
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,450
The ones I keep talking to you about, right?

202
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh, "them?"

203
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,160
"Them?" Oh, yes. Them.

204
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,730
Nice to meet you.
I'm Sata Kyoya.

205
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,690
Thanks for always looking after Erika.

206
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,730
A smooth talker~~~

207
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,840
The feeling of the absolute smile of a prince, huh?

208
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,850
Such a hottie like him, huh?

209
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,210
Makes me want to hide him too.

210
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,110
Yup, yup. Yeah.

211
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,100
Hey, hey~ Prince Sata~!

212
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,660
Is it true that you love bondage play?

213
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,310
You're asking that now?

214
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,260
Pardon?

215
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,510
Because Erika told us.

216
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,490
You tie her up and all that stuff.

217
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,410
Right?

218
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,170
Sata-kun, even though you look
like a prince on the outside...

219
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,380
You're surprisingly a pervert, huh?

220
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,400
Do you always do such plays?

221
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,400
No! Umm, talking about tha---!

222
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,250
You're right, I think I like it.

223
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,280
Sticking a gag in that annoying mouth of yours.

224
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,570
Tying you up so good that you can't barely move.

225
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,490
Wanna try it?

226
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,900
Sorry to disturb all of you while you're eating.

227
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,480
Erika, let's go.

228
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,650
I think it's safe over here.

229
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,920
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,440
Because of me, you became
like a pervert.

231
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,290
Heck, it doesn't matter to me.

232
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,170
But everyone was watching.

233
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,600
Shut up already.

234
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,560
You are my girlfriend.

235
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,450
You're good as shutting up and
be protected by me.

236
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,950
It's not "Sata-kun," it's "Kyoya," kay?

237
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,060
Okay.

238
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,570
I understand.

239
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,870
Well, I guess you're completely in my debt now.

240
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,880
Shinohara-san...
do you think this is good already?

241
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,200
Erika.

242
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,280
Yes!

243
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,780
My bad, sorry!

244
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,740
It's fine. I picked them up already.

245
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,060
We're going home.

246
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,490
Oh, it's fine.
I'll take them to the teacher myself.

247
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,860
Thank you, Kusakabe-kun.

248
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,240
Sorry for letting you do this.

249
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll see you tomorrow!

250
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,240
Let's go.

251
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,520
No way. They said it wouldn't rain today.

252
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,680
Come on.

253
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,360
Thanks.

254
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,290
What? You're holding this.

255
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,050
Hey, I'm getting wet over here so
move the umbrella to my side.

256
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,510
I'm barely being sheltered too.

257
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,780
Oh, really?

258
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,350
I'm just fine either way...
I can drop the act anytime.

259
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,370
Hey, lean it a bit more to my side.

260
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,440
I got it.

261
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,090
We're running.

262
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,230
HEY! W-W-W-WAIT!

263
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,760
Dogs do need proper walks too.

264
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,660
Hey, Takeru.

265
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,680
Hey, welcome!

266
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,500
Where's uncle?

267
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,410
He's out shopping.

268
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,640
What happened to you? You're soaking wet.

269
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,500
Is she someone you know?

270
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,220
Something like that.

271
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,300
Could she be your girlfriend?

272
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,510
Uhh, no no no no!

273
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,600
This is bad.
Your girlfriend is soaking wet too.

274
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,350
Your friend?

275
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,300
Oh, Takeru?
Way back since middle school.

276
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,480
This is shocking... that you'd bring your
girlfriend over here in my store.

277
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,850
This guy isn't cute at all for
saying the most unnecessary things, right?

278
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,770
Well, I think that's the part which
is interesting about him.

279
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,870
You're noisy. You're working right now so
go away and work.

280
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,910
Until a proper customer comes,
I'll do my job.

281
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,100
You really can't keep your act together, huh?

282
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,120
What?

283
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,990
Nothing. It's just that you guys
get along so well.

284
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,660
Actually, this guy's parents are divorced
and his sister and mother is living at Kobe.

285
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,240
He lives together with his father but he's working
most of the times so he's basically living alone.

286
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,010
He still comes to this store to eat at times.

287
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,180
Don't just nonchalantly spout the extra stuffs.

288
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,270
Welcome.

289
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,180
What would you like?

290
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,260
Just order whichever you want.

291
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,720
Take my umbrella and hurry off home.

292
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,370
I said you're an eyesore so
hurry and disappear.

293
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,280
"Girlfriend..."

294
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,820
But still, aren't you so masochistic?

295
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,610
Why would you say that?

296
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,050
My stamina wouldn't be able to keep up with that.

297
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,840
Weren't you the one said it?
That there's no other choice.

298
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,590
Well, I did but...

299
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,420
-I want second helpings.
-Here.

300
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,500
Why don't you just go and look for a true boyfriend so
you can break up with that sadist black prince.

301
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,050
Do you not like anyone in your class?

302
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't say that too lightly.

303
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,640
If there was even one, I should already
have had him in the first place.

304
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,050
Really? There might be someone nearby you
but you haven't just noticed it.

305
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,120
Your school is different from mine which
is an all-girls school and yours are co-ed.

306
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,980
Second serve.

307
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,760
Why don't you start looking at men with
romance in mind?

308
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,190
Romance in mind?

309
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,710
Shinohara-san.

310
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,540
Yes.

311
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,330
We'd like to talk to you.

312
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,620
We heard that you were going out with Sata-kun.
Is it true?

313
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,920
Well, yeah.

314
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,810
Unbelievable.

315
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,890
Why would that happen?

316
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,950
I was just brought by the wind?

317
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,060
Sata-kun is everyone's idol.

318
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,690
If someone puts a hand on him...

319
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,150
It's the rule where you have to suppress
yourself to show your content.

320
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,480
Ah, but it can't be helped, ri---

321
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,400
What? What are you saying?
More li--

322
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,170
Stop it, you guys.

323
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,680
Kamiya-kun.

324
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,230
It's such a disgrace for you guys
to gang up on a beauty.

325
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,950
Aside from that...

326
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,810
Three against one...
Isn't that unfair?

327
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,380
What's your problem?
This doesn't concern you, Kamiya-kun.

328
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,990
I may look like this, but I
have a  strong sense of justice.

329
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,570
Hey, I think we've had enough today.

330
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,800
You're right. Let's go.

331
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,360
Are you okay?

332
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,250
Um... Thank you so much.

333
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,490
I just saw you being caught up
in their troubles by chance.

334
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,520
Bye.

335
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,370
But that was a joke.

336
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,880
Actually, I...

337
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,130
...have been interested in you
since before...

338
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,870
...Shinohara-san.

339
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,420
Are you free this weekend? If you are,
want to go and hang out with me?
Let’s meet at 1pm, Harajuku station.

340
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,100
Hey, what's with you?

341
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,530
This Kamiya here is the Kamiya from
my class, right?

342
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,990
Right, but give that back to me.

343
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,090
W-What, hey---!

344
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,280
Wai--- What?!

345
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,450
You deleted the whole application!

346
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,960
You can't wag your tail over another guy
other than me.

347
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,490
Don't ever get involved with Kamiya and don't
go out with him this Sunday.

348
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,430
Tail?

349
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
Hey...

350
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,840
Hey...!

351
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,660
Tell me why.

352
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,430
Kyoya-kun... You do know that you're not my real
boyfriend so this isn't betrayal or any of those.

353
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,910
What?

354
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,300
Have you forgotten where you stand?

355
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,170
You are my dog.
I am your master.

356
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,600
You have no power to refuse me.

357
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,910
Oh, wait. Is that it?

358
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,640
Do you want me to expose right here to
everyone that I'm just your fake boyfriend?

359
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,300
I understand.
I won't go then.

360
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,620
Great. What a good girl.

361
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,500
Oh, there's Erika's boyfriend.

362
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,550
Hey, Erika's boyfriend.

363
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,410
Hey, Erika!

364
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,320
Yahoo!

365
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,280
Just joking!

366
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,870
There's no way I can give up that easily.

367
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,660
Sorry for being late.

368
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,480
Erika, you look so cute.

369
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,800
Really? Thank you.

370
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,510
Look.

371
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,810
So cute.

372
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,660
What do you think about the character?

373
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,590
Thanks for waiting.

374
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,170
Looks delicious.

375
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,610
Oh, you don't have to.

376
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,240
The bill?

377
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,040
-I'm sorry.
-No problem.

378
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,350
Thank you.

379
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,240
Is it good?

380
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,540
Yeah, delicious.

381
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:15,860
You hold it like this, and take extra
caution of your posture.

382
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,010
Ready.. go!
One, two, three!

383
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,850
-Here I go?
-Yup.

384
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,120
One, two.

385
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,270
That was amazing!

386
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
Erika-chan...

387
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,810
Did you have fun?

388
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,870
Of course. I had so much fun.

389
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,410
I'm glad.

390
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,130
Hey... can I ask one thing?

391
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,850
You and Sata-kun are dating, right?

392
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,460
So, I'm right, huh?

393
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,280
Aaah... What a shame.

394
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,550
I would have been happy if I
were your boyfriend.

395
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,350
I'm going to be up against Sata-kun,
and I think I have no chance in winning at all.

396
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,070
No, no! Of course, that's...

397
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,910
Actually...

398
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,380
Sata-kun isn't my boyfriend.

399
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,880
It's just that... a lot happened and I had him
to pretend to be my boyfriend and..

400
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,040
Is that true?

401
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,180
Yup.

402
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,360
That's why I don't reall---

403
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,740
What the heck? So you aren't Sata's woman then?

404
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,730
I actually wasted my time and money on this.

405
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,790
If you aren't his woman,
then this is pointless.

406
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,050
Well, that's it.

407
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,810
Just forget about everything that
happened today.

408
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,310
I see.

409
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,690
So I guess I was right, huh?

410
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,480
Kamiya... Your way dumber than I thought.

411
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,110
What? Wanna go at me?

412
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,800
No way...
I actually dislike violence.

413
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,500
Let's go, Erika.

414
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,250
So that's what it was all about?

415
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,990
Even all of the things you told me...

416
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,520
...and did to me--- all was a lie?

417
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,600
Of course!

418
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,200
Wait, like you fell for it too easily.

419
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,020
I say a few nice things there and you fall for me.

420
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,930
I was suppressing to laugh halfway
through and that was problematic for me.

421
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,230
How desperate for a man are y---

422
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,800
Didn't you say you disliked violence?

423
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,390
I do, but...

424
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,810
But this girl belongs to me.

425
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,620
It pisses me off when you hurt her for no reason.

426
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,190
Come on, let's go.

427
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,410
Come on.

428
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,860
You really don't listen, huh?

429
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,990
Do you really wanna get fooled that much?

430
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,840
So you already found about what
Kamiya was going to do, huh?

431
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,890
Of course, as well as that lie of yours.

432
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,520
I told Kamiya about the lie that
you were my boyfriend!

433
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,710
Can't be helped if you did.

434
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,840
Will Kamiya-kun keep it to himself?

435
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,720
The hell I know!

436
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,750
For now, I don't want you getting me involved
in this nonsense, okay?

437
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,310
Next time, I'll throw you out a window.

438
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,620
Just when I thought I finally
found some genuine love.

439
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,130
You'd gotten yourself up in a tizzy
about romance, right?

440
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,220
"Love" you experience in that state
is just self-delusion.

441
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,100
There's no point in getting depressed
over a love like that.

442
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,100
What?

443
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,840
Thank you...

444
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,010
You're comforting me, right?

445
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,280
You are so easy to read, though.

446
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,110
What?!

447
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,430
What's with that slack-jawed expression?

448
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,910
You look like this, that’s why people
think it’s easy to attack you.

449
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,250
My face has nothing to do with that!

450
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,430
I might have to train you again from square one.

451
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,660
Sa-ta-kun!

452
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,700
Hello from yesterday.

453
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,760
Don't talk to me like we're close.

454
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,960
Sata-kun...

455
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,040
...won't you team up with me?

456
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,400
Let's both get some fun!

457
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,020
If we're together...

458
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,430
...the girls we can gather will double up.

459
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,120
With those options in hands,
women will increase around us!

460
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,230
That's crap.

461
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,970
The more willing women we call out
the more we enjoy. It's a man's instinct!

462
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,400
Even I know myself.

463
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,370
You and I are the same species.

464
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,630
We're both special.

465
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,050
You're just assuming that.

466
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,110
How great.

467
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,220
Tezuka went with her older boyfriend
on a 4 days 3 nights skiing trip.

468
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,820
Wait-- where is Marin at? Hawaii?

469
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,130
How nice~~
I wanna go on a date too~!

470
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,160
Oh? What is your sadistic prince
doing right now?

471
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,730
I dunno.

472
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,480
You don't know as if you contacted him.

473
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,050
I didn't contact him. More like I haven't received
any mail from him since winter break came.

474
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,510
Well, we were just fake dating for the
benefit of others anyway, so...

475
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,860
Could you possibly be sulking?

476
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,500
Maybe you have gotten to
like the black prince somewhere.

477
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,030
No. No no no! No freaking way!

478
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,780
As if I would! That man’s
twisted to the core!

479
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,710
My god!

480
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,150
Yup, that's my next destination.
Then maybe I’ll go to Okinawa?
Where did Erika go?
Please show us some pictures next time~

481
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,480
Erika, did you go somewhere?
Let us see some pictures next time.

482
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,980
SAN-CHAN~~~!
What should I do~~~?

483
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,010
I really thought you weren't coming.

484
00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:00,240
Since I was bored... I wanted to see my dog's
face which I haven't seen in a while and tease it.

485
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,010
Thank you.

486
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,230
Hey...

487
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,720
Do you feel unwell today?

488
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,210
Why?

489
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,240
Somehow...

490
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,640
You haven't been honest...

491
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,510
...like you always do.

492
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,940
Shut up.

493
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,630
Aren't you gonna take a photo of us here?

494
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,820
You're right.

495
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,190
Seriously, what did you even come for?

496
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,490
We're going up.

497
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,990
-How much?
-1000 yen.

498
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,940
These ones? Okay. Thank you so much.

499
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,290
Here's your change. Thank you so much.

500
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,720
Here.

501
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,190
That'll pass off as proof, right?

502
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,080
Thank you.

503
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,660
One more time.

504
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,410
What's fun about taking photos of food?
Hurry up and eat it.

505
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,870
I'm digging in.

506
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,690
This so good!
Are you gonna eat too?

507
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,510
Don't want it.
I hate sweets.

508
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,430
-What are you saying?
-Sorry.

509
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,970
Gimme some of that.

510
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,490
-Here.
-Okay.

511
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,420
That's nice.

512
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,410
They both love each other so
much that they just can't contain it.

513
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,280
I can only see love as a play stuff.

514
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,400
The real thing they love isn't that itself
but it's themselves who is in love, right?

515
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,820
They only want to be seen publicly
that they really love each other.

516
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,530
They don't really love their partners.

517
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,810
Kyoya-kun... have you ever tried
going out with someone because of love?

518
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,720
No one.

519
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,520
Why? You're popular.

520
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,810
The hell I know.

521
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,650
There's no woman who has seriously affected me.

522
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,400
They're not making themselves
convenient for you?

523
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,450
They're not convenient for me.

524
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,770
You're the worst.

525
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,270
Shut up. Anyway, love isn't just about
accompanying someone to eat.

526
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,860
Even without it, it doesn't bother me.

527
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,200
I don't have to force my way to admit it.

528
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,430
What?

529
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,570
You're strong that why's you think that way.

530
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:07,220
I'm scared to be all by myself..
I'm also scared if I'm not with someone.

531
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,710
That's nonsense.

532
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,520
-Bye.
-Bye bye.

533
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,840
I actually wanted to go to Disney Land...
but he said we should just do so next time.

534
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,330
Well, isn't your prince coming to get you today?

535
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,290
You're right. I'm sorry.

536
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,800
-See ya.
-Bye bye.

537
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,950
See ya.

538
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,010
Oh, umm...

539
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,070
Is Sata-kun...?

540
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,180
If it's Sata-kun, he's resting
due to a cold.

541
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,410
Cold?

542
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,920
Yes?

543
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:20,250
I heard from Takeru about your address
and I bought some snacks too.

544
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,540
Thanks for your effort.

545
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,890
And, umm..!

546
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,830
What now?

547
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:30,150
Well, uhh... You forced your way out even if you
don't feel well just to go out with me yesterday, right?

548
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,560
Shut up. That's not it.

549
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,450
Kyoya-kun?!

550
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,510
Wooaahh... You have an intense fever.
Should we go to the hospital?

551
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,510
I went.

552
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,790
How about medicines? And what do you have for
food? Your father's on a business trip, right?

553
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,800
You heard from Takeru, huh?

554
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,790
Just leave me.

555
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,220
He's always been like that since we were kids.

556
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,620
This is normal for me.

557
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,100
I wouldn't think about anything at this rate.

558
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,570
I don't have any thing for you to do to me.
Go home.

559
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,370
Why are you acting so tough? With the way
you exploit me all the time...!

560
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,840
I bought something to relax your head.

561
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,130
I said just leave me!

562
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,690
What?

563
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,120
Are you trying to get me in your debt?

564
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,500
That's... cold.

565
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,800
When you are sick, you have to let
someone look after you unconditionally!

566
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,620
But you can at least let your guard
down for me.

567
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,300
I am your dog, after all.

568
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,160
Calling yourself a dog? You're hopeless.

569
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,630
Fruits.

570
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,830
I wanna eat something sour.

571
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,600
Okay. I'll go buy them for a while, okay?

572
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,500
I’ve put some sour food in the fridge.
And I’ve cooked porridge, and they’re in the pot.
Please eat them, if you want to.

573
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,980
Isn’t there too many ingredients?

574
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,830
You're right. The fever has gone down.

575
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,520
I told you right?
That I'm okay now.

576
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,780
Because you didn't go to school.

577
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,510
Well, I'm glad.
I'm going back home now, okay?

578
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,440
What? Do you still feel not good?

579
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,000
Thanks.

580
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:43,050
What's with that stupid look?

581
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,320
Well, because...!

582
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,600
You said such startling words.

583
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,180
Are you stupid?
Even grade school students say that.

584
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,440
Well, I know but to hear that from you...

585
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,080
I thought you'd say I was being
annoying again.

586
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,750
You're annoying.

587
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,390
I guessed right.

588
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,950
But with you being compared to other girls...

589
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,420
You didn't harbor any transparent ulterior motives.

590
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,200
That's why I didn't mind thanking you.

591
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,140
Just that.

592
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,050
I think there's something wrong about you!
It'd be better if I checked your temperature again.

593
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,260
Stop acting ridiculous, stupid.

594
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,270
Kyoya! I bought some energy drinks!

595
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,960
Erika-chan, you came?

596
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,320
Well, I'm going home now.

597
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,750
And you'd better be going to school tomorrow!

598
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,850
This is annoying but why won't
you admit it already?

599
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,000
You like the black prince, don't you?

600
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,940
No way! No way!
As if I'd fall for that sadistic guy!

601
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:44,970
This other day too, I went on an errand
for him to buy some croquette bread and I ran so fast...

602
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:52,300
...and even after falling and getting hurt, he said that it was
expected for a dog to work hard and do it for my master.

603
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,270
He's such a piss-off!

604
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,550
But I think I like him...

605
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,230
I see.

606
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,760
Congrats.

607
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,980
I change my mind!
I don't like him at all!

608
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,540
Isn’t it very embarrassing to just
agree without any complaints at all?

609
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,810
It can't be helped. You can't choose
the person whom you wanna fall in love with.

610
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,630
Why don't you just confess already?
It might go well.

611
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,810
And if it doesn't?

612
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,870
I might never be able to talk
to him the way I always do, you know?

613
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,930
You are so deep in that situation, huh?

614
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:48,850
But, are you fine with it?
To remain as a dog to him?

615
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:53,720
Your hand!

616
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,630
Gimme your hand!

617
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,860
If you liked dogs that much,
why don't you buy one?

618
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:25,040
I won't. If they die, it's hard on me.

619
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,350
Did you have one before?

620
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,140
It died when I was in 2nd year middle school.

621
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,480
I see.

622
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,780
I can't adopt another one anymore.

623
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,090
Because right now, I already have such a big dog.

624
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,960
I don't wanna be your dog.

625
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:54,740
I don't want to be... your dog.

626
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,340
Because I like you, Kyoya-kun.

627
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:07,280
It's because I have truly fallen in love with you.

628
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,060
That's just your misunderstanding.

629
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:17,140
You've never gone out with a man before, right?

630
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:22,740
But because you're doing the play-dating thing,
you're starting to imagine you feel that way.

631
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,100
Bye.

632
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,050
W-Wait a moment!

633
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,200
What's your answer from what I said?

634
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,520
Answer?

635
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,190
I said, about that one...

636
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,430
That I like you...

637
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,410
And also...

638
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,630
Like a response that you like me,
or what not...

639
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,700
Beats me. I wonder...

640
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,150
Let the time pass by while
you are thinking of me.

641
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,000
I'll be looking forward to that from now on.

642
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,070
A monster...

643
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,720
You monster!

644
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,490
Can I ask one thing?

645
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:22,590
What?

646
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,370
How can you still stay in love with
him after hearing such a response?

647
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,340
As if I know! I wanna know too!

648
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,530
What's your plan from now on?

649
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:37,140
For now, I'll do whatever methods it takes for him to
turn my way! As if I could lose that easily!

650
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,840
I get what you're saying.

651
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,030
How someone goes out with a person
is his method, I know...

652
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,330
But you can't play with the heart of a person in love.

653
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,160
I'll beat a change of heart into that guy!

654
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,810
Oh, uhh! That's not it, Takeru-kun!

655
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,300
You're coming with us, right? Goddess, goddess~

656
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,320
Listen. I'll bring it to you one more time!

657
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:12,080
If you are 100% certain that you can make me happy,
I'll go along with your invitation.

658
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,520
Well of course!~ I'll grant your dreams
to the best of my capabilities!

659
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,730
Okay, you fail! To the best of your ability is
a guarantee that it's gonna suck.

660
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,220
You're saying you're not really confident.

661
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:25,380
Trying such a half-hearted pass on me,
you need 100 years of work.

662
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,320
You bore me, disappear already.

663
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,800
That b*tch can actually talk then.
Whatever.

664
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,700
-You're just a beauty!
-A sadistic one!

665
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,430
A demon!

666
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:36,770
Reika-neesan!

667
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:37,780
Takeru?

668
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,870
It's been a while!
Are you off to where Kyoya is?

669
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,610
I went to his apartment though but I forgot the key.

670
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,260
Beauty Demon!

671
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,850
I did call Kyoya but he's completely ignoring me!

672
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,570
Oh? Elder sister?

673
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,830
She's Kyoya's elder sister, Reika-san.

674
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,530
Nice to meet you. I've been under Kyoya-kun's care.
I'm Shinohara Erika.

675
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,340
-By Kyoya?
-Yes.

676
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:57,590
I see.

677
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,890
So he's pretending to be your boyfriend?

678
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,530
Well, but right now...
I'm truly in love with him.

679
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,200
I have gotten to l-like him.

680
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,660
So, you're trying to remove me from the picture?

681
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,720
No, no, no!
That's not it.

682
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,180
Fine with me.

683
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,720
This is going to be great to kill time.

684
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,810
Another "kill-time" again?

685
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,410
Come on, follow me already.

686
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:35,040
Takeru. I'm going out with Erika.

687
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:43,640
What are you looking at?

688
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,610
Well, uhh... I think this is already our third store.

689
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,260
Even how much I eat,
I don't get fat.

690
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:54,310
I-Is that so? I envy you.

691
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,430
So?

692
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,770
Which part of Kyoya do you like?

693
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,460
Don't tell me... you aren't one of those stupid ones
who would choose a man base on his face, right?

694
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,760
No, no way!

695
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:10,400
But, if you want me to choose which part of him
I like, it's kinda complicated...

696
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,860
I think it's just the same with the parts
of him that I hate and like but...

697
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,170
I actually like the parts of him
which I hate so...

698
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:20,180
How do I put this?

699
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,490
In the end, that's where it goes huh?

700
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,100
Why would you think that?

701
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:34,790
You know what? I'll tell you directly... even if
you go out with him, you won't ever be happy.

702
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,770
He is so super self-centered and selfish.

703
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,760
He isn't self-centered!

704
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,640
He does have a bad mouth and he hurts
people now and then, but...

705
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,360
But for him to put up with my nonsensical
request, he's really kind.

706
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,830
And I also don't think that I would
want Kyoya-kun to change.

707
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,850
As a girl...

708
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,980
...as long as he will love me, I'm fine with that.

709
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:11,920
"As a woman... to have him like me..."
Don't you have pride in you at all?

710
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,660
I have none.

711
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:17,360
If I can have Kyoya-kun to love me...

712
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,850
...I'll do whatever for that.

713
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,380
I see.

714
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,760
If you say that much...

715
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,060
Why don't you let me see
that you're serious about him?

716
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,240
Ready? Go!

717
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,980
She got in another fight with her man?

718
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,290
Things haven't been going smoothly
between her and her boyfriend.

719
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,870
Once they fight, she'd eat high-calories
sweet desserts to vent her anger.

720
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,260
Really?

721
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,590
What now?

722
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:06,900
My big sis.

723
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,320
Was it too much for you?
Having a cake battle with me.

724
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,900
After all...

725
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,060
You did say I should show how serious I was.

726
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,620
Erika-chan..

727
00:59:56,910 --> 01:00:00,800
You did say that Kyoya was kind, right?

728
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,870
Yes.

729
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,210
Do you have a phone with you?

730
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,150
Here.

731
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:24,940
This is my number.
If something happens, call me.

732
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,920
Thank you so much!

733
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,320
Let's go.

734
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:39,130
Erika...

735
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,430
What are you doing?

736
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,820
It's not about what she was doing, you jerk.
She went through a lot just recently.

737
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,960
Shut up.
I wasn't asking you, bitch.

738
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,940
Bitch?

739
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,610
I-I ate a lot.

740
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,710
You ate a lot?

741
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:56,250
Yes. I just ate too much.

742
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,390
Get a grip already.

743
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,340
What's your problem?

744
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:14,720
Don't you dare embarrass a woman in public.

745
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,900
Hurry and pay up already.

746
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,180
Geez... what a brat.

747
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,100
I'm sorry. I caused you a lot of troubles.

748
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,470
I seems to be causing you too much troub---

749
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,400
If you were really serious in dumping me off...

750
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:54,720
Instead of doing these worthless things,
deal with me face on.

751
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:20,720
Erika, you have pretty bad luck, to be in the same
group as Kusakabe-kun. My sympathies.

752
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:25,820
But seriously, a class field trip is such a bore.

753
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:29,780
How about you, Erika? Aren't you going on a date
with the prince during free time?

754
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,780
Right, of course.

755
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:36,040
I envy you...
I wanna go with my boyfriend too.

756
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,820
Me too~!

757
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,170
Isn't your boyfriend in class 4 so you're going together?

758
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,430
You're right.

759
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,520
So what are we gonna do?

760
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,190
Wanna skip?

761
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,270
Seriously?

762
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,310
I also prefer that.

763
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,580
Free time?

764
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,910
Yup, for the class field trip.
I thought I wanted to stroll around with you.

765
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:09,790
You said something extraordinary, didn't you?

766
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,190
I-I didn't do it on purpose.
I-I just got carried away.

767
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,020
Fine.

768
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,340
Really?

769
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,530
Over strolling around, I could go
on a walk with my dog.

770
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,490
Yeheey! You see, I've been thinking of a
really perfect date course!

771
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,270
You’re really becoming more and more into this act.

772
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:31,990
What?

773
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,360
It's nothing.

774
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:40,500
Each group, please come up with a day itinerary.

775
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,390
I’m in charge of guiding the group during the trip.

776
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,860
Seems like I can’t go home together
with Kyoya-kun for the meanwhile then.

777
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,250
Sorry, Shinohara-san.
It's because I have bad luck.

778
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:58,960
Not the least! It isn't your fault, okay?

779
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:01,510
You see, my luck isn't that good too.

780
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,270
That's not true.

781
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:04,850
It's because of me.

782
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:14,110
Kusakabe-kun, so you also had
this kind of look in you, huh?

783
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,650
Because you always wore glasses while you
look at people so I couldn’t notice.

784
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,440
I'm sorry.

785
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,590
Why?

786
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,050
I look like a girl and it's disgusting.

787
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,570
That's not true!

788
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:28,070
You look so handsome so I'm sure
you're bound to be popular.

789
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:31,810
No way! For me... to be... popular...

790
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,960
Geez! Don’t deny everything!

791
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,890
If  someone seriously told you that,
don't you think it's rude?

792
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,350
Isn't that how it is?

793
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:47,330
To deny everything that person said...
it just means that you don't trust him/her at all.

794
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,020
I think so.

795
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:54,510
That's why, no one will ever feel
disgusted looking at you, okay?

796
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,490
I think you should be confident
and act like how you usually do.

797
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,600
Sata-kun!

798
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:09,200
For our class field trip...

799
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:12,280
I asked out some girls to hang out
with us for karaoke.

800
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,530
I pass. I'll go on a different course from you.

801
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:21,280
Don't tell me you're going on a date
with Erika-chan, huh?

802
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,260
Will it really be fine if I exposed it to everyone?

803
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,450
Erika-chan's lie, that is.

804
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:45,370
For a prince to be keeping up with such a facade...

805
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:49,250
Seems to me that Erika-chan is
having fun with some other guy.

806
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,460
Shinohara-san... do you think doing
it like this is good enough?

807
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,830
Kusakabe-kun, you're good in drawing.

808
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,920
That's not true for someone like me.

809
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:39,960
Can I have a look?

810
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,050
Go ahead.

811
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:42,740
Can I look at this too?

812
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,190
This is a beautiful place.

813
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:51,090
You're going with Sata-kun?

814
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,350
I heard from Tezuka-san and the rest that you
are going on a date with Sata-kun during free time.

815
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,540
I see.

816
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,230
You were also in the same group as ours, right?

817
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,080
"Lock Love Monument."

818
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:15,560
If you go with the person you like and put on
a padlock, you will always be together forever.

819
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,570
This is great.

820
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,810
Right?

821
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:21,220
But I think Kyoya-kun dislikes stuffs like that.

822
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,310
Why?

823
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:26,560
I think he's someone who wouldn't go
to cliche date courses.

824
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,840
Even if you say you wanted to go?

825
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,650
Impossible. It's too much of a hurdle.

826
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,410
Really?

827
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:41,040
If it's me, I would do whatever it is just
to make the person I love happy.

828
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:51,140
I'm sure that girl who is going to become
your girlfriend... would be so happy.

829
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:09,720
Kusakabe-kun?

830
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:14,410
Who are you calling "Kusakabe-kun"?

831
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,300
Kyoya-kun...!

832
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,640
W-Were you waiting for me perh---

833
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,740
No way! Let's go.

834
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:43,430
Did you make any arrangements with that guy?

835
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,350
Oh, Kusakabe-kun?

836
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,080
Yeah.

837
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:51,850
There was something he wanted to buy for his
friend's birthday so I recommended to him a store I knew.

838
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,250
Ah! But it wasn't today so it's fine.

839
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,550
Nonsense.

840
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:00,060
Shouldn't people just give gifts when they feel like it?

841
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:05,160
So you're the type who gives presents
even if it's not a birthday.

842
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,490
But it ain't my hobby to buy gifts for women.

843
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,010
You're right.

844
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,650
Well, but...

845
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:14,930
If you say that you want it, I have
no problems buying it for you.

846
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,590
Like a dog's collar... for walks.

847
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,560
Really?! I'm so happy!

848
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,900
Are you stupid?
What are you saying?

849
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,380
After all, whatever you receive from the person
you love, you'd be so happy.

850
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,090
It's special so I would definitely cherish it.

851
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:35,680
Stupid, that was a joke.
What are you getting carried away for?

852
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:50,380
I want to go with Kyoya-kun...

853
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,650
... to Venus Terrace as soon as possible.

854
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:58,730
There's no Venus Terrace in the
Prince's course copy though.

855
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:04,570
For that, if he goes ahead and I'm not there yet,
he'd hate it so I will eventually come as a surprise.

856
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:13,100
It's pointless to lock padlocks with him
when you're not even his girlfriend.

857
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:16,760
I do know about that though...

858
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:23,060
Geeezzz, San-chan! You are such a meanie!
Just when I'm getting all excited about this.

859
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:25,780
I'm worried about you.

860
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:29,840
If something happens in that class trip,
I can't come and help you, you know?

861
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:38,350
Right now, over prioritizing that plan...

862
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:42,750
Isn't it more important for you to
confirm Kyoya's feelings at this point?

863
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,050
Then...

864
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,230
What if I confess and got rejected?

865
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,950
I can't go out on a date with him anymore.

866
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,610
I did told Marin and the rest that I
am going on a date.

867
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:07,510
It's because you always think of the trivial things and expect
that's why you can't graduate from the fake girlfriend role.
[A/N: This girl can really talk fast.]

868
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:13,800
No matter how many fake beautiful memories you make
with him, you won't become his real girlfriend.

869
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,020
I know.

870
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,580
Then, while I go shopping,
I leave the store to you..

871
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,290
You actually draw good.

872
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:08,060
When you told me that you liked yakisoba croquette,
Kusakabe-kun told me a great place where they have some.

873
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:10,510
Only the locals know of that shop.

874
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:31,270
There's something I want to confirm.

875
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,280
What is it?

876
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:43,910
What is it about?

877
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:46,740
What?

878
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:51,170
You can tell me anything.

879
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,000
If you're fine with me,
I'll listen to you.

880
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,680
What is it--- Hurry and tell me.

881
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,710
What do you think of me?

882
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,510
I like you, Kyoya-kun.

883
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:30,560
Now that I noticed it, I've been
thinking about you all the time.

884
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:33,830
You're just filling every space in my head.

885
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:39,370
But, Kyoya-kun...

886
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,210
For you, I am...

887
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:49,140
...just someone you hang out with to kill time.

888
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,760
A convenient dog.

889
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,330
Just that.

890
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,010
You're a problematic one.

891
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:13,360
I know even without you telling me, Erika.

892
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:19,900
No matter how useful she is, I couldn't
stay with a girl whom I didn't like.

893
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,760
I wasn't able to say it until now
cuz I was embarrassed, but...

894
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:31,110
I also think about that towards you, Erika.

895
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,460
Really?

896
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:41,600
Then, if I said I wanted to go to Venus Terrace?

897
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,730
Venus Terrace?

898
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,330
Of course, I'm fine with that,
I'll go anywhere you wanna go.

899
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:47,280
Really?!

900
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:51,500
You know what, there’s a rumor that if you go there with your
special someone and lock padlocks, you will be together.

901
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,490
So....?

902
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:54,310
Until when do you want me to keep
playing this act of yours?

903
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:01,040
You believe so easily!

904
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,280
It was a lie!

905
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:06,320
There's no way I would sweet talk to you like this!

906
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:11,100
How are you going to live your life this way?

907
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,320
You'll get taken in by a con man some---

908
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,850
Erika?

909
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:18,720
San-chan...

910
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,170
What's wrong?

911
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:24,500
San-chan~~~!

912
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,740
What happened?

913
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:29,910
You know what?

914
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:34,190
I quit being the Wolf Girl.

915
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:38,400
Okay.

916
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:40,780
Come here.

917
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:21,170
What the heck?

918
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,460
Everyone, gather.

919
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:55,680
Let’s meet up at this area after
we’re finished with looking around.

920
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,790
Let's go.

921
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,320
Looks fun.

922
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,220
Let's go.

923
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,130
Erika, hurry. Let's go.

924
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:18,950
There's something I want to tell everyone!

925
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:23,010
-What's wrong
-What happened?

926
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,900
I'm sorry.

927
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,940
I and Kyoya-kun aren't dating at all.

928
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,310
What? What did you just say?

929
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,630
We don't get you at all.

930
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,790
I said...

931
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,420
When I said that I and Kyoya-kun
were dating, it was all a lie.

932
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:54,940
Seriously?

933
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,350
Are you for real?

934
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:01,870
You all had experiences in love and all...

935
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:06,810
So, in order for me to fit in with your
conversations...

936
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:09,750
I had Kyoya-kun pretend for me
as my boyfriend.

937
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:14,730
After all, I have no experience in love...
and I've never kissed someone before too.

938
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:19,920
But if you guys found out about that,
I thought I could no longer hang out with you.

939
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:25,490
I'm afraid of being all by myself in class.

940
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,220
I'm sorry.

941
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:36,940
Erika...

942
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,440
You really hurt us a lot.

943
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,790
That's discouraging.
Let's go, guys.

944
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,980
A while ago, inside the bus...

945
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:27,880
Shinohara-san just told everyone in front of their
faces that it was a lie that you were dating her.

946
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,450
What?

947
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:36,000
Was it really a lie?

948
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,690
What's up with you all of a sudden?
It doesn't concern you.

949
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,790
It does.

950
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,410
I... like Shinohara-san.

951
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,030
If it means that I get to see her smile,
I'll do whatever it takes.

952
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:10,050
Why don't you become her man and you both
can be happy or whatever.

953
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:12,050
But...!

954
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:15,700
Shinohara-san... about you...!

955
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:19,150
I'm not involved in that.
Do what pleases you.

956
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:42,450
While I was living in Kobe, the Great Hanshin
earthquake occurred which was a very big incident.

957
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:46,450
I was living just next to the expressway
where the beams fell.

958
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:52,880
The bridge beam fell so hard that it damaged
the mansion and could no longer be lived in.

959
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,230
It happened that we couldn't escape.

960
01:24:55,250 --> 01:25:00,270
And so for the meanwhile, we took
refuge inside a car...

961
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:06,060
But there’s also many people
trapped and dead in the house.

962
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:35,970
Listen, everyone. After this is your free time.

963
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:41,900
Be back at the hotel's lobby
in the given time.

964
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,810
Okay!

965
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:23,330
The caller id you’re reaching is currently unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone.

966
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:32,400
Hello, Reika-san. Sorry for suddenly
calling you. This is Erika.

967
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:37,330
Well, I'm at Kobe right now
for our class field trip.

968
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:41,710
I came...

969
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm sorry.

970
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:00,150
Even though you cheered on for me...

971
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,970
I couldn't do my best.

972
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:08,540
I'm sorry.

973
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:23,200
You liar.
Apologise to Kyoya, disgusting.
What is the meaning of this.
Stop bothering Kyoya!

974
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:29,570
You liar. Are you stupid?
Can’t you understand?
Unbelievable.
Kyoya is such  poor thing.

975
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:06,730
Take a picture.

976
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:09,820
Say cheese!

977
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,900
I'm glad I found you.

978
01:28:29,490 --> 01:28:34,130
Oohh... It is true.
The croquette's here are so good.

979
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:37,580
You're right.
I have to thank my friend.

980
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:47,540
I'm sorry. Looks like I made
you accompany me.

981
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:52,650
Not really. It was me who wanted
to follow your plan, after all.

982
01:28:53,420 --> 01:29:01,680
I really thought you wanted to stroll on your
own following the course we planned so well.

983
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:07,800
Shinohara-san... can I ask you one thing?

984
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:13,110
Which part of Sata-kun made you like him?

985
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:18,830
Oh, sorry.

986
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:24,300
But... even if him being your boyfriend was a lie...

987
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:28,960
I know your feelings for him are truly genuine.

988
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:34,450
I'm really the worst for lying like that, right?

989
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,140
That's not true!

990
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,830
I understand your feelings.

991
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:43,410
Since I've always been alone.

992
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,700
I wonder what made me like him, too.

993
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:59,900
He's always making fun of me.

994
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:04,420
He's full of himself and sarcastic.

995
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,510
He always says the meaniest things.

996
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:15,460
But I liked him, you know?

997
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:19,790
I'm not mistaking it because it's the truth.

998
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:23,820
Even I don't understand it well myself.

999
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,280
Shinohara-san...

1000
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,020
Am I not good enough for you?

1001
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:48,180
If compared to Sata-kun,
I'm not really that cool.

1002
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,620
I can't even say that I'm better off than him.

1003
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:56,560
But, if it's me...

1004
01:30:57,770 --> 01:31:01,430
I will never hurt you nor make you cry.

1005
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:07,820
I'm sorry. Kusakabe-kun, I still...

1006
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:12,010
I know. I understand your feelings well.

1007
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,040
That's why you don't have to answer me now.

1008
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:20,210
Just, for today...

1009
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:23,370
Will you give me a chance to make you smile?

1010
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,600
I'll do my utmost best.

1011
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,120
Okay.

1012
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:33,150
Okay.

1013
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:42,960
Oh! That is so cute! Look!

1014
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,260
That is so cute! So cute!

1015
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:09,790
After all, whatever you receive from the person
you love, you'd be so happy.

1016
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,330
It's special so I would definitely cherish it.

1017
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:17,860
Sata-kun! Let's go!

1018
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,570
Hey, Sata-kun.
Where are you going?

1019
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:46,560
Toilet.

1020
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,840
What the heck am I doing?

1021
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:19,000
You really are hopeless, aren't you?

1022
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,580
What?

1023
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:26,420
I received a voice message from Erika-chan.
I tried calling her but I can't reach her.

1024
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:28,360
So, what's with that?

1025
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:40,650
That other time, when we met, Erika-chan
said that you were kind towards her.

1026
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:47,530
Do you know? Just how she was
hurt by what you said?

1027
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:52,780
Did you properly take a good look at her?
She's trying her best to understand you.

1028
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:59,780
The most important feelings... until you
express them in words, it won't get conveyed.

1029
01:34:00,190 --> 01:34:03,300
Shut up! I know that much!

1030
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:11,810
I came.

1031
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,610
Here.

1032
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,670
Thank you.

1033
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,960
Sorry, there was a lot of people in the supermarket.

1034
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:37,150
We have to hurry to Venus Terrace, right?

1035
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,260
Umm, Kusakabe-kun...

1036
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,210
Sorry...

1037
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:47,080
I actually... wanna go there on my own
from this spot..

1038
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:54,790
Even I can't help myself out.

1039
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:58,790
After being told such cruel words...

1040
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:04,440
Somewhere inside me, I still
want to believe in Kyoya-kun.

1041
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,820
I think about the "what-if's".

1042
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:13,250
I'm so sorry.

1043
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:17,580
Don't apologize.

1044
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:22,160
I still did confess despite knowing about your feelings.

1045
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,540
Yup, it's fine.

1046
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:33,030
I'll go ahead to the hotel, and
tell the teachers that it went great for me.

1047
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:38,630
Why?

1048
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,290
Didn't I tell you?

1049
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,430
I...

1050
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,590
...want to see the happy face of the girl I love.

1051
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,200
Thank you.

1052
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:20,490
Answer it!

1053
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:24,240
You were asleep.

1054
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,770
-Am not.
-I'm sure you were!

1055
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:28,270
-Really, you---
-Just for a bit.

1056
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:29,460
Where's Erika?

1057
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:31,990
Didn't see her.

1058
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:33,710
Weren't she with Kusakabe-kun?

1059
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,940
So you weren't really going out with her?

1060
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,910
Why do you look a bit happy?

1061
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:41,140
Hey, wait up!

1062
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:47,750
Do you know just how much you embarrassed
me in front of the girls?

1063
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:50,110
Why won't you just enjoy with us?

1064
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:56,160
Can't you just let Kusakabe-kun handle Erika-chan?

1065
01:37:57,130 --> 01:38:00,770
Shut up.
Enjoy on your own.

1066
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:03,140
I said wait!

1067
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:06,020
Don't put an act.

1068
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:08,110
Take a look at this.

1069
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:12,610
I have 300 email addresses of girls in my phone.

1070
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:15,550
After just calling out to them,
they'd be there in an instant.

1071
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:20,890
In other words, I am enjoying my life
300 times more than you are.

1072
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:33,570
Gathering a number of girls even if you don't
like them--- they're all just a pile of trash.

1073
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,510
A pile or trash?

1074
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:39,430
In one among all of them...

1075
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,060
Do you have a woman who you
seriously wanna protect?

1076
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:52,730
A woman who thinks she knows all about
you more than anyone else...

1077
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:55,490
Do you have her?

1078
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:01,540
A woman who thinks that once she loses you...

1079
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:05,190
There's a feeling of pain in her chest....

1080
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,370
...do you have a woman like that?

1081
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:16,740
I don't think you understand that at all.

1082
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,930
Once you meet someone who really matters to you.

1083
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,220
Why?

1084
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,210
Just a while back...

1085
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:34,630
...I was exactly like you.

1086
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:39,080
Stop messing with me.

1087
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:43,380
That's it.

1088
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,710
That b*stard...

1089
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:59,130
He erased all the numbers.

1090
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:04,620
He's surprisingly serious.

1091
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,900
"The Black Prince".

1092
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,120
As if he's coming.

1093
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:57,100
Pick up the damn phone already!

1094
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:04,180
There you are!

1095
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:14,560
Would you look at that girl?
What is she doing at the garbage  area?

1096
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,820
How filthy!

1097
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,780
Hey, Erika!

1098
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:26,980
What the heck are you doing over there?!

1099
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,730
Kyoya-kun... Why are you here?

1100
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:33,180
It's not "why", you stupid dog!

1101
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,250
Taking so long to pick your phone
and dilly-dallying around!

1102
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:47,490
I lost the strap... that's why...

1103
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:49,030
Strap?

1104
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:52,940
Is that why you're searching
through the garbage pile?

1105
01:45:56,860 --> 01:46:00,980
After all... even if it's a lie or not...

1106
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:05,090
The times I spent with you are
my most cherished memories.

1107
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:12,090
You really are a huge idiot.

1108
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:24,910
I have decided.

1109
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:27,840
What?

1110
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:32,790
I want to quit being a wolf girl.

1111
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,160
I quit.

1112
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:40,860
Thank you for everything you've done.

1113
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,100
Somehow...

1114
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:51,270
I just thought that I really want to quit.

1115
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:56,080
I'm so stupid, huh?

1116
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:59,000
It would have been better
if I've done this much earlier.

1117
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,780
Without a boyfriend...

1118
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:09,210
Hating it more to be all alone...

1119
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:12,850
I lied...

1120
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:16,850
But...

1121
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:22,170
I came to seriously fall in love with you...

1122
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:31,310
The walks I had with you were really so fun...

1123
01:47:36,770 --> 01:47:39,100
It was so fun that...

1124
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:44,600
I was fine with it even if it was all a lie.

1125
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:48,100
I wanted to stay beside you...

1126
01:47:57,990 --> 01:48:00,170
I really am so sorry.

1127
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,070
Then with this, it means...

1128
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:20,400
...that I don't have to play
with this facade of yours, huh?

1129
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:28,850
I see.

1130
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:39,240
Did you think you could just pour
some water over your master's face?

1131
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:49,380
That's why I said I quit!

1132
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:52,240
Don't get cocky on me!

1133
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:20,460
On your neck...

1134
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:26,660
If I gave you a real collar, it’ll make people
judge and suspect my taste.

1135
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:34,460
This is proof that you are mine.

1136
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,010
Don't you ever forget that.

1137
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:47,560
I don't get it.

1138
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:59,480
I don't know what you think of me!

1139
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:04,540
If you won't tell me properly, I won't know!

1140
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:11,230
That noisy mouth of yours.

1141
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:29,790
I love you.

1142
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:43,710
We're going back.

1143
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:57,010
Hurry it up.

1144
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:10,090
What?

1145
01:51:10,980 --> 01:51:12,640
What did you say?

1146
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:13,990
Did you say something?

1147
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,670
Say it one more time.

1148
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:18,120
I won't say it, stupid dog.

1149
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,730
Say it one more time!

1150
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,650
Come on.

1151
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:22,850
I won't!

1152
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:23,790
Just say it more more time!

1153
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,680
Don’t think of force opening your master’s mouth.

1154
01:51:28,710 --> 01:51:30,040
We're running.

1155
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,840
Hey, wait! Say it quick!

1156
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,070
Come on, don't lag behind.

1157
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:39,670
Hey! Kyoya-kun, say it quickly!
