1
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,199
who

2
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,359
show me your past

3
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,039
what are you going to do

4
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,119
Don't be afraid

5
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,599
I won't hurt you

6
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:33,999
previously

7
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,079
It's those juniors from the Immortal Sect who are wrong

8
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,799
I apologize to you on their behalf

9
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,559
Don't argue with them

10
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,559
This is the jade condensation of our fairy world

11
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,759
It is miraculous in recovering internal injuries

12
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,319
I see

13
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,319
It's easier now

14
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,239
I'm fine

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,039
I told you

16
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,799
Men and women are not intimate

17
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,719
you can't sleep with me

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,559
I let you stay in the same room with me before

19
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,159
It's because you feel

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,839
it's because you are sick

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,599
To take care of you conveniently

22
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,359
That’s why I let you sleep in this room

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,439
I don't

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,559
now

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,639
You have learned some immortal skills

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,319
Know how to control yourself

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,359
tomorrow

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,559
I will clean it up

29
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,239
Come out of a room

30
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,439
You have to live on your own from now on

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,319
I'm doing this for your own good too

32
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,559
That's my side dish

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,999
how

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,719
Not even allowed to eat a carrot

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,039
for you

36
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,719
Gone

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,399
Put it down

38
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,999
What a beautiful flower

39
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,119
As long as you like it

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,719
The fragrance of every flower here

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,199
Each has its own different effects

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,759
Such as this

43
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,759
its smell is pleasant and fragrant

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,519
Not only can it make people happy physically and mentally

45
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,079
It can also soothe the mind and help you sleep

46
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,959
You smell it

47
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:03,999
fragrant

48
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,439
And this

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
In fact, the real effect of this floral fragrance

50
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,999
It's inexplicably exciting

51
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,159
Yaoyang, come here and smell it

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,319
This flower smells so good

53
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,759
I'm hungry

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,559
jade mushroom

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,519
Is there anything to eat?

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,399
Yes yes

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,119
Ruoxi

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,199
Not as good as

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,039
Put this flower in the bedroom

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,119
Thank you for your hard work

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,159
Freshly washed fruits

62
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,759
What are you copying?

63
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,719
Yaoyang

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,319
I'll be punished by copying the secret formula a hundred times

65
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,759
Yaoyang

66
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,399
Why so strict

67
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,119
It's a bit strict

68
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,439
Our little fox is better

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,519
you

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,239
Do you like our little fox?

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,799
like

72
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,719
what is

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,399
I like this one

74
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,119
It's you every day

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,559
Everyone wants to be with him

76
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,719
every day

77
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,519
Everyone wants to be with him

78
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,359
I think

79
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,159
That is to like

80
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,279
I also want to do it every day

81
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,319
They are all together with Yaoyang

82
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,839
I also like Yaoyang

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,079
It seems you really don’t understand the relationship between men and women

84
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,759
That

85
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,839
What is the relationship between a man and a woman like?

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
This love between man and woman?

87
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,759
that is

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,759
It can only be understood but cannot be expressed in words

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,879
I'm here

90
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,399
There is a strange book

91
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,359
you see

92
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,519
This is a strange book

93
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,999
You will understand after reading this

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,639
Not red

95
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,119
Not green either

96
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,919
Type a word

97
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,359
what does this mean

98
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,159
You will understand slowly

99
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,319
Then I'll ask Yaoyang

100
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,799
Stop

101
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,919
Where is this book?

102
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,599
He has someone who understands

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,199
Some people don't understand

104
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,999
Where is this Yaoyang?

105
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,399
He may not understand

106
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,719
Who knows?

107
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,719
Little fox

108
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,719
He is well informed

109
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,839
You can ask him

110
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,839
when necessary

111
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,919
You can also ask him for advice

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,959
yes

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,039
Tu Jing

114
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,079
This little mushroom said

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,039
You know this book better

116
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,399
I want you to teach me

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,759
this

118
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,719
what does this mean

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,319
Take a look quickly

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,759
Ruoxi

121
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,959
content of this book

122
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,559
Let's learn it later

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,599
good

124
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,199
Then I'll put it away first

125
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,599
Too bad

126
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,119
I forgot to prepare herbs for Yaoyang

127
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,319
I'll go first

128
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,199
Come back later

129
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,359
This jade mushroom

130
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,879
Really

131
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,679
Look quickly

132
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,759
This is the method in the fairy book

133
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,719
It is said to help restore internal strength

134
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,319
Please soak a little longer

135
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,519
previously

136
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,879
your mind is damaged

137
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,279
This fairy herbal bath will help you calm down and rejuvenate your mind

138
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,639
since

139
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,319
It's been a long time since I took a medicated bath

140
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,239
Thank you

141
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,679
Then soak it while it's hot

142
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,359
I still have to go study with Tu Jing.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,359
I'll let you two have one tonight

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
No one sleeps before the flowers and under the moon

145
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,759
And some herbs

146
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,519
It's over

147
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,359
go out

148
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,439
But there is still one missing medicine

149
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,759
are you okay

150
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,359
close your eyes

151
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,799
That

152
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,599
Then when can I open it?

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,559
number

154
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,759
dozens of numbers

155
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,719
you

156
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,919
Are you angry with me?

157
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,479
