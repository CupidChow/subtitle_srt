1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,399
master

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,679
This is

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,239
Where did you find the artifact?

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,279
This object is not an artifact

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,319
It's a treasure passed down from generation to generation in ShadowClan.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,919
in

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,719
Pretending to be a monster transformed by the evil thoughts of the three realms

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,919
named evil cloud

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,799
The Shadow Clan relies on this monster to increase their mana.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,919
Be the enemy of my immortal sect

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,879
It took a lot of effort to become a teacher

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,399
Just got this

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,919
from now on

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,079
You must keep a close watch

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,319
Don't let ShadowClan take it back again

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,119
In this book of immortals

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,199
There are records about evil clouds

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,759
You take it too

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,919
For disciples to circulate

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,679
yes

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,559
This is me using the power of the demon elixir in my body

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,759
The elixir refined for Wan'er

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,719
Whenever she gets sick

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,599
Just give her one

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,959
tomorrow

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,519
Just take her away

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,119
I will take her to hide far away

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,679
lest the time comes

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,919
I'll be hurt by you again

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,639
Waner

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,599
let's go

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,319
He won't come back today

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,359
I know Gu Li is driving me away

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,679
I'm afraid I'm in danger

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,759
I just want to say goodbye to him

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,159
can you take me to see him

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,799
I

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,679
I don't know where he is either

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,159
Wan'er, let's go quickly

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,519
And please take this medicine.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,359
Come with me

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,199
Waner

43
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,119
You run quickly

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,959
I stopped her

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,279
You run quickly

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,359
self-awareness

47
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,959
Waner

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,559
Yaoyang

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,919
what are you doing

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,639
let me go

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,759
master

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,119
Just one last step left

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,319
Wait until the evil cloud reaches my body

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,879
I'll let you go

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
don't want

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,199
I am your master

57
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,519
You listen to me

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,359
sorry

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,039
this matter

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,599
I can't listen to you

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,839
Gu Li

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,199
let me go

63
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,119
Have you forgotten our cooperation?

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,199
He only wants to save you

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,159
Besides, his poison

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,279
There is no cure

67
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,999
don't want

68
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,159
Yang'er

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,919
you believe me

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,119
I will definitely find a way to save you

71
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,279
Please let me go, let me go

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,559
Senior brother

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,439
Please let me go

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,759
Have you brought anything?

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,519
Senior brother

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,599
Could it be

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,119
Do you want to watch Yang'er die quietly?

78
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,319
Yin'er

79
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,319
sorry

80
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,119
don't want

81
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,919
stop

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:21,479
Yang'er

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,519
master

84
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,279
It's finally over

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,599
don't feel sorry for me

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,559
my wish

87
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,479
I hope that my disciple

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,119
Can expel evil spirits from the body as soon as possible

89
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,599
Become a normal person

90
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,199
I think

91
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,759
Your wish should be the same, I guess.

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,519
become a normal person

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,759
Not my wish

94
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,279
my wish is

95
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,719
always with you

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,319
It's a pity

97
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,599
Yang'er Yang'er

98
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,959
don't want

99
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,919
Yang'er

100
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,519
Why don't you listen to me?

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,479
Believe me

102
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,079
I will definitely find a way to save you

103
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,759
As long as you can live safely

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,399
All my efforts and sacrifices

105
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,399
It's all worth it

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,919
Now I can finally face my heart

107
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,319
for my master

108
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,359
I'm just repaying her kindness

109
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,719
it's you i love

110
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,559
it's me

111
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,119
Ruoxi

112
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,199
OK

113
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,599
What a show

114
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,159
What a pity

115
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,679
Heng'er

116
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,399
Yin'er

117
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,119
You guys disappoint me so much

118
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,959
Immortal Lord

119
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,919
Those things that Immortal Lord did

120
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,959
I'm afraid I haven't told them yet.

121
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,679
she promised me

122
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,559
Won't hurt ShadowClan again

123
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,279
Then he hurt me secretly

124
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,079
How despicable

125
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,959
each other

126
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,119
You just want to pass through the mirror of the floating world

127
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,559
Just absorbing the energy of evil clouds

128
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,079
I can't

129
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,119
One step ahead of you

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,799
Immortal Lord

131
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,199
Is everything he said true?

132
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,719
what he said

133
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,799
It's all true

134
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,119
What is the so-called evil cloud?

135
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,919
It is transformed by the evil thoughts of the three realms

136
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,959
It's just a complete lie

137
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,839
This evil cloud

138
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,919
They were all transformed by her evil thoughts alone

139
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,079
As long as she doesn't exist

140
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,599
This evil cloud

141
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,159
will not exist

142
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,879
it's you

143
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,559
turn out to be

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,119
You are the initiator of all this

145
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,799
Why

146
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,079
You are already an immortal

147
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,319
Why

148
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,199
Now that we know everything

149
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,719
I'll leave you alone

150
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,639
Gu Li

151
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,719
I brought you a gift

152
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,119
let me go

153
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,639
what are you going to do

154
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,719
Hand over the mirror

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,479
Gu Li doesn't want it

156
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,599
Let Wan'er go now

157
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,719
Waner

158
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,719
don't hurt her

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,199
The evil cloud is here with me

160
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,519
don't want

161
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,719
Yang'er

162
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,279
These

163
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,959
I didn't eat

164
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,399
don't know you

165
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,399
Is it useful?

166
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,919
Yang'er

167
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,159
Yaoyang

Yang'er

170
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,279
this is you

171
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,119
Yang'er

Yang'er

174
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:19,919
Come to the candied haws

175
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,839
Big and sweet candied haws

176

girl

177
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,759
Let’s skewer the candied haws on a stick

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,679
Come and take it

179
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,039
Sugar-coated haws

180
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,639
