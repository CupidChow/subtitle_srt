1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,079
Evil clouds escape from the mirror of the floating world

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,199
It's been several days

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,959
Is there any progress?

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,279
Master

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,879
evil cloud

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,479
already

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,959
Entering a mortal body

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,239
now

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,639
Taken in by junior sister

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,919
Presumably to save that mortal

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,279
Disciple thinks

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,679
If he never does evil again

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:31,759
Do we

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,479
If the evil cloud grows stronger

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,359
It will inevitably lead to catastrophe in the three realms

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,439
anyway

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,679
Be sure to get rid of

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,839
It's Immortal Lord

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,399
let me go

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,879
I didn't do anything wrong

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,439
let me go

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,959
Immortal Lord

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,359
Yaoyang injured three of my disciples

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,799
Almost life-threatening

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,279
If the evil cloud in his body is no longer sealed,

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,519
It will definitely lead to chaos

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,279
I also ask the immortal to make a decision as soon as possible

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,759
What Dehua said is absolutely true

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,319
According to fairy rules

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,239
Yaoyang's crime will not lead to death

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,759
Then he was punished with twenty-four thunderbolts

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,239
And be imprisoned in the Netherworld Tower forever

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,359
Immortal wise and wise

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,799
Immortal Lord

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,399
Yaoyang made a mistake

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,479
It’s all due to the poor guarding of Xiyin

37
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,359
Please ask the Immortal Lord to punish you

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,959
Xiyin Shangxian

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,799
The devil is the devil after all

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,719
The descendants of Gu Xianmen in your pavilion

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,039
Dedicated to protecting this devil

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,279
What are your intentions?

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,879
Immortal Lord calm down

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,039
Yaoyang

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,159
He is my disciple, Bai Xiyin

46
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,679
Disciple makes a mistake

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,399
Naturally, the master should be punished on his behalf

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,759
Moreover

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,279
Yaoyang

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,159
Not a born devil

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,279
Just because of the evil cloud in the body.

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,559
Just accidentally hurt a fellow disciple

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,279
There is another hidden story behind this matter

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
I also hope that the Immortal Lord will see clearly.

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,719
Rare words

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,039
Are you going to ignore the fairy rules?

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,599
Today's events

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,159
It's those three disciples

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,119
Want to bring the innocent fox demon

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,479
Eradicated as a demon

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,239
My disciple

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,999
It was only when the road was rough that I took action to stop it.

63
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,239
That evil cloud is the illusion of evil thoughts

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,479
A person filled with evil thoughts

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,639
How can literature have good thoughts?

66
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,239
The two poles of all things

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,759
good versus evil

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,959
Since there is no absolute goodness in this world

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,559
Naturally, there is no absolute evil

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,159
Moreover

71
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,959
Yaoyang is temporarily incapacitated

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,279
How can I withstand these twenty-four thunders?

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
This Netherworld Tower is full of evil monsters

74
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,239
If the evil cloud absorbs the power of the evil demon,

75
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,399
Break out of the tower

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,599
The consequences are disastrous

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,679
I hope the immortal will think twice

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,079
But I am a descendant of the Immortal Sect

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,679
Don't be injured in vain

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,999
There needs to be an explanation for this matter

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,359
I

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,039
Willing to be punished on behalf of my disciples

83
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,719
good

84
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,679
No, no, no master

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,479
Heng'er

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,239
I will leave this matter to your custody

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:28,999
yes

88
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,079
Senior brother

89
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,999
You can take Yang'er back first.

90
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,759
I won't leave

91
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:41,999
master

92
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,039
I still want to stay with you

93
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,319
Just a few thunderbolts

94
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,439
It's fine

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,639
I won't leave

96
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,439
Let's go

97
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,479
Not leaving

98
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,799
Let's go

99
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,639
Not leaving

100
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,639
master

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,719
Yaoyang

102
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,119
After all, it was my master who made you turn into a monster.

103
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,039
today

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,519
Use your life for the teacher

105
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,519
give you your life

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,359
Did she just lie to me?

107
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,799
If you were hit by twenty-four thunderbolts

108
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,959
what will happen to her

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,319
Before

110
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,959
There is an immortal

111
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,399
Only suffered fifteen thunderbolts

112
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,879
It's already hurt his soul

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,599
Still not healed

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,839
And now

115
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,519
Junior sister, she will suffer for you

116
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,999
Twenty-four thunders

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,119
My master she

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,759
Can't

119
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,279
stop

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,399
don't want

121
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,079
master

122
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,599
Please let me in quickly, Master

123
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,279
Go quickly

124
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,479
I won't leave

125
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,399
sorry

126
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,359
master

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,039
are you okay

128
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,919
don’t worry

129
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,839
It's okay to be a teacher

130
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,879
master

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,439
sorry

132
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,239
it's all my fault

133
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,959
It was me who hurt you

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,239
I'm fine

135
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,639
you get out of the way

136
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,759
How is my master doing?

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,919
junior sister

138
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,639
What are you doing?

139
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,519
Stop talking

140
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,959
Senior brother

141
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,119
you from now on

142
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,159
Be sure to practice magic more frequently

143
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,439
Never let down Master

144
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,279
My painstaking efforts for you

145
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,919
alright

146
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,119
Senior brother

147
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,559
I'm fine

148
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,439
Yang'er

149
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,919
us

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,719
go home

151
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,279
Fuxian morning dew

152
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,039
Has healing properties

153
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,279
master

154
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,519
You wait

155
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,719
I'm going to collect morning dew right now

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,559
who

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,679
come out

158
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,039
it's me

159
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,439
You are the fox demon from last time

160
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,839
Thanks to my benefactor and the immortal for saving me last time

161
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,079
Just escaped

162
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,879
Are you here

163
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,039
Collect morning dew

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
My master was injured because of me

165
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,319
I heard about the morning dew here

166
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,079
Helps restore the immortal body

167
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,479
let me help you

168
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,919
Fuxian morning dew

169
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,439
master

170
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,079
Feeling better?

171
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,439
This is the last time I rescued that fox

172
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,719
Got it for me

173
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,639
Illustrated report of gratitude

174
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,439
Demons are also divided into good and bad

175
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,399
Yang'er

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,399
Can you spare no effort

177
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,999
Collect morning dew for my teacher

178
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,839
I am very happy to be a teacher

179
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,679
Master was hurt because of me

180
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,119
Disciple

181
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,039
Naturally, I want to heal Master

182
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,199
but

183
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,839
master

184
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,439
No need to be punished for me

185
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,039
This is what I should

186
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,119
What nonsense are you talking about?

187
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,039
Since I am your master

188
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,679
You should be protected

189
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,439
Being a teacher is no longer a serious problem

190
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,999
You don't have to blame yourself

191
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,679
Master is so good to me

192
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,479
How can I repay you?

193
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,039
If you really want to repay

194
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,039
Follow me and practice hard in the future

195
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,439
Drive away evil clouds

196
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,919
Be a normal person again

197
