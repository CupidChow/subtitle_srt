1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,479
I've long known about Xiyin Shangxian

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,399
be kind to you

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,079
how do you know

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,279
What are your intentions?

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,559
take it easy

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,599
I'm on the same page as you

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,879
Now she is reborn

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,159
The body is controlled by evil clouds

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,999
No memory of past life

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,599
you

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,999
Don't you want to help her?

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,759
evil cloud

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,279
I'll ask you

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,159
Do you want to help her?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,799
how to help

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,759
It's easy to say it's simple

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,919
It's hard to say

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,519
that is

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,079
You want her to fall in love with you

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,319
fall in love with me

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,519
master

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,639
I do this

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,519
will you blame me

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,839
Even if it's my fault

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,359
It doesn't matter

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,519
I just want you to live

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,079
As long as you can survive

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,279
Even if I am shattered to pieces, I will never recover

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,479
No matter what

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,039
That's why she's so tall

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,919
Then she came over there

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,559
Is there any

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,319
Never seen

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,319
girl

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,439
have you ever seen a girl

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,599
Probably this high

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,279
Is there any

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,919
No

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,159
Where can she go?

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,959
Have you returned to Fuxianju?

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,319
Ruoxi

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,879
What's wrong

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,119
what happened

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,479
Ruoxi, is she back?

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,559
she

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,399
Didn't I go out with you?

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,959
Ruoxi is gone

48
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,119
Could it be that he is too playful?

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,399
Where did you run to play?

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,719
impossible

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,279
I searched the whole town

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,679
I also found

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,879
She ate the leftover half of the candied haws

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,639
She will not be casual

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,919
Throwing the candied haws on the ground

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,719
what happened

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,679
Ruoxi

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,399
she is missing

59
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,119
What did you say

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,719
The hairstyle and clothes are wrong

61
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,479
you got up

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,959
I'll show you

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,039
My swordsmanship today

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,599
Have you ever seen this girl?

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,039
Never seen, never seen

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,639
Have you ever seen this girl?

67
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,319
No

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,679
Have you ever seen this girl?

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,519
No

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,599
Have you ever seen this girl?

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,759
No

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,599
Ruoxi

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,879
where have you been

74
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,959
you

75
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,879
you woke up

76
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,959
you

77
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,679
you are a bad person

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,319
Are you hungry?

79
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,399
Have something to eat

80
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,039
I don't eat

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,079
Let me go back quickly

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,199
Do you still remember this place?

83
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,799
Senior brother is the best to me

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,759
You know I love this sweet-scented osmanthus cake the most

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,279
Is it tasty

86
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,719
this

87
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,719
It’s your favorite osmanthus cake

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,679
I don't like to eat osmanthus cake

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,639
Let me go back quickly

90
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,959
I almost forgot

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,199
You are not my junior sister

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,959
It's just that she looks exactly like her

93
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,199
junior sister

94
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,319
master

95
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,199
what is

96
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,519
Master is

97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,919
A person who teaches others skills

98
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,919
The junior sister you are talking about

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,279
Is it Master?

100
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,959
That's it

101
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,879
The one who teaches people skills

102
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,839
You just

103
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,719
say me

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,719
Looks like your junior sister

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,199
As long as I'm here

106
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,639
I will definitely protect you

107
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,959
Senior brother

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,559
junior sister

109
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,399
Only when you are full can you have the strength to look for it.

110
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,679
I'm not hungry. You can eat.

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,439
I'm not hungry either

112
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,359
you

113
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,999
I don't eat it either

114
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,159
Shadow Resurrection

115
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,879
The most difficult thing is not to collect

116
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,279
Your master’s immortal soul

117
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,879
It’s not about letting your master’s immortal soul return.

118
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,519
The hardest thing is

119
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,839
How to let Bai Ruoxi have this blank paper

120
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,119
within three months

121
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,319
Give birth to seven emotions and six desires

122
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,719
That's why you said it at the beginning

123
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,719
I may not be able to do it

124
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,759
This forbidden technique

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,919
There was a precedent in ShadowClan

126
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,839
It’s just that no one succeeded

127
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,319
master

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,479
where have you been

129
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,919
junior sister

130
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,759
You sacrifice yourself for the sake of the world

131
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,199
All praise your righteousness

132
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,639
now

133
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,199
I will never let this monster

134
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,039
Ruin your reputation for life

135
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,679
where am i

136
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,519
what are you going to do to me

137
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,319
I've been here

138
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,719
yes

139
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,399
here

140
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,919
It's the place where you were transformed

141
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,359
can you let me go back

142
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,519
I want to go home

143
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,799
If Yaoyang can't find me

144
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,999
It will definitely be sad

145
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,799
I don’t want to make Yaoyang sad

146
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,239
I beg you, please let me go back

147
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,679
junior sister

148
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,559
Sorry

149
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,799
I have to go home

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,439
No one can stop me

151
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,599
Li Ruosheng, Hu Bai, Liu Pan Jinghai, Gao Hanyu, Xu Guochang, Sun Zhouyue, Zhang Xinran, Kong Deyupeng, Guo Xinghanming, Li Hongting
