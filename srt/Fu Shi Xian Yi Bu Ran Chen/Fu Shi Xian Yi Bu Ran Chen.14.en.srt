1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,279
I see

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,279
I will definitely do it

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,959
You have to think clearly

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,679
Once you use forbidden magic to resurrect your master

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,559
That would be tantamount to being an enemy of the entire fairy world.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,319
Even so

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,679
would you like that too

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,159
Let alone the fairyland

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,799
Even if we are enemies of the entire Three Realms

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,759
I don't hesitate

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,719
very good

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,479
What's this

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,879
This is our ShadowClan's artifact.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,479
Shadow Crescent

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,439
put it on

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,959
It can cover up the devilish energy in you

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,639
The fairy clan

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,359
I can't find you

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,639
walk home

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,639
stand up by yourself

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,999
Master loves to be clean most of the time

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,039
It seems

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,879
I need to buy her some clothes.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,159
Walk

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,759
I'll take you to the human world

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,319
world

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,159
Is there anything delicious?

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,639
The world is fun

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,199
The girl hasn't paid yet

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,959
Buy anything in this world

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,479
Everybody needs money

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,879
money

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,719
Give

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,079
Thank you

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,279
Eat

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,559
Take a look, take a look, take a look

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,759
Girl, come and take a look

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,479
Look how exquisite this mask is

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,319
Do you want candied haws?

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,279
Come

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,799
Get the candied haws, okay?

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,599
Sugar-coated haws

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,759
money

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,359
come one

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,799
OK

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,239
Thank you, come

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,159
hold

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,959
Sugar-coated haws

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,639
sweet

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,599
Let's take a look at the clothes.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,559
Come on, girl, take a look here

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
Look at the girl, she looks like a fairy

53
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,079
This dress will definitely suit you

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,359
Give it a try

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,919
Then try it

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,239
Good girl, please come inside

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,079
Try this set again

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,719
paper kite

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,959
Look at the paper kite

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,679
world

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,639
fun

62
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,759
Still going

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,839
Better not go

64
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,479
Why

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,319
go

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,839
if you behave well

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,159
i can consider

68
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,479
Put these things away first

69
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,239
good

70
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,759
if hungry

71
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,879
Just eat first and then work

72
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,679
Come

73
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,879
I teach you

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,279
scriptures

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,959
put it here

76
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,159
The brush is on the shelf

77
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,119
The paperweight is placed on the far right

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,759
A little further to the right

79
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,079
Fold the sleeves first

80
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,639
Fold clothes again

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,679
Fold

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,679
flower arrangement

83
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,319
The color system should be the same

84
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,479
You try

85
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,119
These two words

86
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,479
Just call her Ruoxi

87
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,159
like

88
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,359
Xi

89
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,279
when you hold the pen

90
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,679
The barrel of the pen should be straight

91
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,679
Only if you learn to read and write

92
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,279
Only then can you understand the fairy books

93
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,119
Only in this way can you practice immortality

94
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,839
Immortal magic

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,919
Be more attentive

96
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,879
Don't look at my pen

97
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,879
when holding the pen

98
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,759
Don’t shake your hands

99
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,839
The pen must be strong and powerful

100
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,919
Can't be soft

101
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,639
Write like this a hundred times

102
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,639
I'll check it out later

103
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,639
a hundred times

104
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,359
sweet

105
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,959
Bai Ruoxi

106
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,319
stop

107
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,959
Tabby cat

108
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,639
What’s wrong with you

109
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,719
Never be emotional
