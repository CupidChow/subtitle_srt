1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,079
Yin'er

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,119
Are you still blaming the teacher?

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,999
I dare not

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,919
do you know

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,279
Why do ShadowClan come again and again?

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,679
Because as long as I get the evil cloud

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,959
It is equivalent to gaining the power to destroy the world.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,719
I know you went to Juxian Cave first to find another way

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,159
But this

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,039
After all, it’s not a long-term solution.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,319
Immortal Lord

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,519
Do you really want to sacrifice Yang'er?

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,599
As long as the evil cloud stays for one day

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,159
That boy will always be ShadowClan's target.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,319
unless

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,519
Unless something

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,119
unless

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,479
Sacrifice an immortal soul

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,319
Seal ShadowClan forever

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,879
Yang'er

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,279
will be completely safe

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,639
your wine spilled

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,559
I'll go and fill another pot for you

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,519
No need

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,479
have you

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,039
Betrayed by the people closest to you

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,519
actually

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,559
He always cares about you

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,559
you mean

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,359
I must have misunderstood him

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,999
Tu Jing

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,719
You are still too naive

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,959
Some things I have never experienced

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,719
Naturally, I don’t quite understand

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,519
What is so called sacrifice?

36
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,479
It's just an excuse

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,479
It's getting late

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,199
Stop drinking

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,839
I'll help you go back to rest

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,519
You don't need to worry about it

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,159
I actually

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,919
With part of your memory

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,199
turn out to be

44
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,959
you for that idiot

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,319
He sacrificed so much

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,119
I won't be like you

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,759
Extremely stupid

48
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,159
Yang'er

49
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,759
With these demon pills

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,279
Finally the Ukiyo Mirror can be repaired

51
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,319
To repair the floating mirror

52
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,599
Don't kill people randomly

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,679
yes

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,799
As long as the Ukiyo Mirror can be repaired

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,359
What do the lives of a few demons mean?

56
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,039
Yaoyang

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,599
Has Ruoxi been here before?

58
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,239
Miss Ruoxi

59
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,719
Indeed been here

60
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,519
Has she seen Gu Li?

61
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,199
what did they say

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,559
yes

63
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,919
seen

64
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,519
Tell me what the deal is

65
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,479
What exactly is it?

66
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,839
I can't hear clearly either

67
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,079
Yaoyang

68
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,279
There is something

69
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,199
I never told you

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,359
Before

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,399
Miss Ruoxi came to see me

72
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,799
Yaoyang won't let me tell you

73
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,999
That’s all

74
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,359
Let me tell you the truth

75
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,719
To save you

76
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,679
I have been nourishing Gu with my heart and blood

77
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,759
Give you another life

78
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,279
result

79
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,999
Poison attacks the heart

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,399
I am afraid

81
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,479
Time is running out

82
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,519
What did you say

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,319
He actually

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,319
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

85
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,359
She won't let me tell you

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,559
I didn't ask you to tell me either

87
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,999
Your body is already so weak

88
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,719
Why do you insist on coming to my place?

89
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,919
You and Ruoxi

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,319
What exactly was traded?

91
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,159
how

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,919
Didn't she tell you?

93
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,279
But that's not important anymore

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,919
I have repaired the Ukiyo mirror

95
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,119
away from my plan

96
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,919
One step closer

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,119
You promised me back then

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,519
To save her

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,919
Why are you so naive?

100
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,079
Will actually believe other people's promises?

101
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,159
Hongji

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,319
Have you found the Ukiyo Mirror?

103
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,279
Immortal Lord

104
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,279
As expected by the Immortal Lord

105
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,319
The Mirror of the Floating World is indeed in ShadowClan

106
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,359
ShadowClan is greedy

107
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,879
It's bound to make a comeback

108
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,759
Pass the order

109
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,199
recently

110
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,799
The disciples of the Immortal Sect need to be prepared

111
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,719
Don't be careless

112
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,679
yes

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,719
The mirror of the floating world

114
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,359
You woke up so quickly

115
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,319
do you know something

116
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,159
You guessed it

117
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,199
i do

118
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,719
knew

119
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,519
some secrets about you

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,399
The fairy bottle is missing

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,159
explain

122
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,119
Where did you hide my master's immortal soul for me?

123
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,839
I hid in

124
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,359
A place you'll never find

125
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,559
Just give up

126
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,119
this life

127
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,519
Don’t even think of turning me into your master

128
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,359
You know it all

129
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,319
Only Bai Xiyin’s all the immortal soul has dissipated

130
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,319
I'm Bai Ruoxi

131
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,999
It will always be Bai Ruoxi

132
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,999
give her back to me

133
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,199
Don't even think about it

134
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,759
Unless you kill me

135
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,999
but

136
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,399
Are you willing to kill me?

137
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,679
you and her

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,079
What a world of difference

139
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,159
You go

140
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,319
I don't want to see you again

141
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,279
Really

142
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,119
A good disciple who has deep love for his master

143
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,479
Bai Ruoxi

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,479
m what are you doing

145
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,679
now that

146
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,399
You want your master’s immortal soul so much?

147
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,879
Then I will make it happen for you

148
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,519
Bai Ruoxi, let me go

149
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,919
stop

150
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,599
Bai Ruoxi, you are crazy

151
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,279
you are not

152
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,239
I want to get your master’s immortal soul

153
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,719
I'll give it to you now

154
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,519
Kaijuite

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,799
You go out

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,319
I don't want to see you again

157
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,359
do you think

158
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,319
Who wants to be with you?

159
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:09,719
