1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,359
junior sister

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,759
I can’t imagine the last time we were separated

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,999
Competition is farewell

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:31,679
junior sister

5
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,519
Don't move

6
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,879
Keep your waist straight

7
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,079
Lift your hand up

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,919
Legs forward

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,359
why are you here

10
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,759
I'll take her away

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,399
You go back to your room first

12
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,479
junior sister

13
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,239
is it you

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,079
bad guy

15
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,999
you are not her

16
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,159
What on earth did you do to my junior sister?

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,559
This matter has nothing to do with you

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,679
irrelevant

19
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,399
My junior sister and I grew up together

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,159
Junior sister, she

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,759
to death

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,439
Still protecting you

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,679
And you

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,199
But use a monster

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,199
Resurrected someone who looked like her

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,559
Identical monster

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,399
I really regret

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,919
I didn’t kill you before

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,639
Junior sister like this

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,239
I won't die because of you

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,839
you're right

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,199
I killed her

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,799
so

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,759
I will resurrect her no matter what

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,439
Even if it is doomed

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,759
I don't hesitate

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,159
you crazy

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,199
good

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,959
He is not a bad person

40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,079
he

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,599
He is my master's friend

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,399
We are cutting spells

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,679
If you don't want to enter the house

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,679
Just stand further away

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,599
OK

46
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,119
Do you still remember the tips I taught you?

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,599
Heart

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,599
tactic

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,639
The evil cloud is indeed inside her body

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,399
no

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,079
The Immortal Lord must not be allowed to know about this matter

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,999
I must take her away today

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,119
Can't take her away

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,399
You don't have evil clouds anymore

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,599
Just an immortal sect with the lowest level of immortal power

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,999
Why protect her?

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,999
open

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,799
Just pretend you didn’t see anything today

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,679
Let's go

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,199
Go quickly

61
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,119
It's okay

62
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,199
no pain

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,999
master

64
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,199
wake up

65
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,199
What's wrong

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,839
pain

67
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,639
No more pain

68
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,959
This is not for food

69
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,239
It's herbal medicine

70
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,639
Can heal your injuries

71
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,359
herbal medicine

72
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,279
Right

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,799
herbal medicine

74
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,039
herbal medicine

75
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,959
Young Master

76
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,519
Yaoyang these days

77
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,879
I had a great time getting along with that woman

78
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,319
What the young master told me

79
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,639
He's not in a hurry

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,239
It seems

81
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,519
They should find someone to supervise them

82
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,999
in addition

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,799
What you asked us to check last time

84
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,679
Already have an eyebrow

85
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,799
Say it quickly

86
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,079
we have found her

87
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,159
In this life, her name is Wan'er

88
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,279
She is a mortal woman

89
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,479
only

90
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,879
Who are you

91
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,279
why save me

92
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,959
You really haven't changed at all

93
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,079
uncle

94
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,519
After the Immortal Xiyin was resurrected,

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,279
The body seems to be wrapped in the evil spirit of evil clouds

96
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,639
This must be the work of that boy Yaoyang

97
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,799
this matter

98
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,839
Should we inform the Immortal Lord as soon as possible?

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,279
This matter has not yet been determined

100
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,599
After I find out the truth

101
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,839
It's never too late

102
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,479
But

103
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,879
Who do I think I am?

104
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,879
It turns out to be the young master of Shadow Clan.

105
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,759
My place is small

106
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,079
Can't afford to greet you

107
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,359
farewell

108
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,879
I found her reincarnation

109
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,679
What did you say

110
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,559
where is she

111
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,279
you are cunning

112
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,279
Don't think about me

113
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,159
Her name is Wan'er in this life

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,679
is a mortal

115
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,319
but

116
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,479
But what

117
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,479
when i found her

118
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,199
She is preparing to commit suicide

119
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,319
Because I have an incurable disease

120
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,119
I warn you

121
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,479
If you dare to hurt her again

122
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,599
I will never forgive you

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,319
Don't worry

124
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,159
She is just a mortal now

125
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,279
Nothing to use

126
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,919
You are looking for me

127
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,919
You don't just want to tell me this, right?

128
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,039
Say it

129
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,719
What do you want from me?

130
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,959
one thing indeed

131
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,239
Need you to do it

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,959
I can tell you

133
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
Cheating, abducting, smashing, looting and burning

134
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,839
Murder, arson, debauchery

135
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,359
Extreme bullying

136
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,599
I won't do it

137
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,319
How much ability do you have

138
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,679
Don't I know yet?

139
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,119
Not what you said

140
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,999
i do these things

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,239
It's for the friendship between us

142
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,919
It has nothing to do with these things

143
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,799
Say it

144
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,199
What happened

145
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,279
very simple

146
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,759
it's her

147
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,199
I seem to have been here before

148
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,879
It hurts me to death

149
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,319
It hurts, it hurts

150
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,679
pain pain pain

151
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,279
A little mushroom essence

152
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,039
How dare you bully a little girl?

153
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,559
Spare your life

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,879
I want to try the new spell I learned

155
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,479
Just a joke

156
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,719
Don't take it seriously

157
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,639
My head is spinning

158
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,039
What did you eat growing up?

159
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,039
So strong

160
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,479
thank you for saving me

161
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,839
You're welcome

162
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,639
It smells so good

163
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,959
this

164
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,039
It’s a sachet specially made by our fox tribe.

165
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,999
if you like

166
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,239
I'll give it to you

167
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,639
like

168
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,639
I like it too

169
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,599
I want it too

170
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,879
can you give me one

171
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,679
I don't want it anymore

172
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,719
you

173
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,239
It's a mushroom

174
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,999
Not an ordinary mushroom

175
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,759
I'm from ancient times

176
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,279
unique mushroom

177
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,799
Very special mushrooms

178
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,519
Are mushrooms edible?

179
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,839
8

180
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,719
Can eat

181
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,319
what are you going to do

182
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,759
If you can move your mouth, just don't move your hands, okay?

183
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,799
no

184
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,039
What a cute little mushroom

185
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,039
You can go back and make some soup.

186
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,639
Right

187
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,199
Yaoyang said

188
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,919
Don't accept favors in vain

189
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,159
or

190
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,079
You go home with me

191
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,319
I treat you to mushrooms

192
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,599
but

193
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,999
I haven't figured out how to do it yet

194
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,119
girl

195
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,639
you can't cook

196
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,239
Usually it's done by Yaoyang.

197
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,079
but he is sick

198
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,199
