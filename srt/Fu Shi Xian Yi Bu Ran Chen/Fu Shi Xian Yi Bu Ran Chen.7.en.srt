1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,359
Has Yaoyang never told you?

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,839
How were you transformed?

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,359
I

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,719
I was

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,399
phantomed

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,839
Yaoyang uses ShadowClan secrets

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,439
Use a wisp of my junior sister’s immortal soul

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,159
Illusion you

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,119
That’s why you look like my junior sister

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,639
exactly the same

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,799
No

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,399
No way

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,719
this is not true

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,679
you are lying to me

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,839
this is not true

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,959
I must ask him clearly

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,639
If you dare to lie to me

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,839
I must

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,719
kill you

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,719
Unity of mind and heart

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,919
Qi should follow

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,519
More than equal to each other

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,079
Never surprised

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,679
Immortal Fusion

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,359
Pure mind and concentration

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,879
what did you call me

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,559
master

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,199
I'm not your master

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,999
Don't call me that again

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,839
turn out to be

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,799
You don't let me call you master

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,599
It's because

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,919
I am your master's substitute

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,119
It seems like the moon is missing

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,719
Don't pick this off

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,759
Why

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,439
it's a treasure

38
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,119
take it with you

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,239
No bad people will come to trouble you

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:33,959
It's Ruoxi

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,359
Are you okay?

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,719
Were there any injuries?

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,759
Ruoxi

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,599
why don't you speak

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,119
Is it injured somewhere?

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,959
Let me see

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,439
don't touch me

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,919
you are hurt

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,319
let's go home

50
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,559
Let me take a look

51
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,959
How about it

52
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,479
Because of the demonic energy in her body

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,759
Injured due to conflict with the immortal energy

54
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,639
But it's no big deal

55
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,919
It's better for you to take care of her

56
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,599
wait for her to wake up

57
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,999
Give her this to drink

58
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,359
She is afraid of hardship

59
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,759
Wait until she finishes drinking

60
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,839
Give her a piece of candy

61
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,199
Thousands of hurdles in the world

62
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,359
Only love is sad

63
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,519
They're quite a match, right?

64
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,639
you woke up

65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,439
Tu Jing

66
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,279
Come

67
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,839
Drink the medicine

68
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,639
It recovers faster this way

69
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,639
where have you been

70
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,599
what happened

71
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,759
If you don't want to say it

72
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,399
Don't say anything

73
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,959
here with me

74
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,839
you can be yourself

75
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,359
I only found these wild vegetables

76
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,239
See if you want to add two more dishes

77
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,719
You want me to cook mushrooms

78
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,679
That's not what I meant

79
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,919
I kill you

80
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,439
The last one

81
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,959
Egg drop soup

82
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,359
So rich

83
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,159
you are hurt

84
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,519
Extra food specially for you

85
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,159
Take good care of it

86
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,759
tasty

87
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,319
What's this

88
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,079
This is a beggar chicken

89
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,559
beggar chicken

90
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,399
How to eat this

91
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,359
This is a bit hot

92
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,839
Otherwise, just use a knife to cut it.

93
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,759
I'd better take it to the kitchen and do it.

94
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,399
Right

95
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
Do I have to drink alcohol to eat beggar’s chicken?

96
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,759
OK

97
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,599
It just so happens that I haven’t drank for a long time.

98
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,199
no

99
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,399
Your injury is not healed yet

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,199
No drinking

101
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,719
I know my own body well

102
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,559
Go and get it. Go and get it.

103
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,279
Come

104
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,039
Stop drinking

105
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,639
you let go

106
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,719
Stop drinking

107
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,519
open

108
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,439
Stop drinking

109
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,559
release

110
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,159
Where is the Shadow Crescent Moon I gave you?

111
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,919
Throw it away

112
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,199
Where to throw it

113
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,839
How do I remember

114
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,119
Did I tell you?

115
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,999
That thing is very important

116
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,959
why do you throw it

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,999
I don't like

118
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,999
don't like things

119
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,319
Why can't you throw it away?

120
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,159
you
