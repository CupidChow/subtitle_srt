1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,479
it's you

2
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,559
Hand over the mirror

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,919
Otherwise I'll kill her

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,999
Leave me alone and go quickly

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,519
do you think

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,399
Do I care whether she lives or lives?

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,559
stop

8
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,919
sorry

9
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,519
It's all because of me

10
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,479
I handed over the mirror myself

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,279
What does it have to do with you

12
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,399
Stop being so sentimental about me.

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,199
I'm really useless

14
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,799
compete again

15
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,319
Lost the floating mirror

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,679
Overestimating one's capabilities

17
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,519
How dare you come up with the idea of ​​a floating mirror?

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,959
did you know

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,079
The power of that evil cloud is far beyond the reach of my Shadow Clan

20
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,159
no

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,439
no matter what the cost

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,159
You must get the Ukiyo Mirror

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,999
then

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,959
It's all my fault, brother and ShadowClan warriors.

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,079
sealed

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,919
It was me who caused the ShadowClan people to become homeless.

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,919
from that moment on

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,839
I made up my mind

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,919
what i lost

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,359
Must take it back

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,279
I just found out today

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,119
It turns out you have been burdened with so much

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,159
I don't need you to pity me

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,119
Even if I lose my mirror

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,319
I also have Bai Ruoxi

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,519
I can definitely turn defeat into victory

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,639
tomorrow

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,279
Just leave here

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,159
You want to drive me away

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,119
There's no use for you staying here

41
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,839
From now on, that infatuated jade mushroom will take care of you

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,959
Wan'er I'm sorry

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,279
stay with me

44
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,919
It will only bring harm to you

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,879
Do you still know how to come back?

46
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,519
Don't tell me yet

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,079
Stayed in this place for a long time

48
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,959
go somewhere else

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,799
Can't even sleep

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,519
Are you tired from practicing?

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,199
Would you like to try this ShadowClan specialty wine?

52
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,879
Come and try

53
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,519
Good wine

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,559
You drink first

55
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,919
I'll get you two dishes

56
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,079
Fortunately, I'm smart

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,319
Take the antidote beforehand

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,039
I can only help you so far

59
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,999
Everything in the world

60
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,679
Dependent origination and cessation

61
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,479
After all, it’s still shallow and shallow.

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,399
What a pity

63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,159
I know that day was not a dream

64
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,519
have you really been here

65
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,159
It turned out to be a dream

66
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,119
what are you doing

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,679
Yaoyang

68
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,719
let me go

69
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,599
no matter what i

70
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,999
I won't let you become a demon

71
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,959
you have done so much for me

72
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,319
It's my turn now

73
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,119
you

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,359
What nonsense are you talking about?

75
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,879
You guys are really sincere

76
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,559
of scrambling

77
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,079
Want to die for the other person

78
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,479
What did you say

79
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,799
She wants to use her remaining immortal soul

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,999
protect your heart

81
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,119
Such heart-eating poison

82
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,719
I won't kill you

83
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,559
Do you understand?

84
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,679
That price is

85
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,039
She must become a demon

86
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,679
you know it's too late

87
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,839
my own life

88
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,879
I will save myself

89
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,679
You don't need to worry about it

90
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,919
you're right

91
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,959
I did know it was too late

92
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,199
you

93
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,679
How could it be

94
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,559
with your temper

95
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,759
Will not obediently hand over the immortal soul

96
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,359
Who wants to be with you?

97
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,799
Ruoxi

98
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,319
I will definitely stop you

99
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,879
what are you up to

100
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,519
Just one last step left

101
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,039
I can't die yet

102
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,519
Yang'er

103
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,359
master

104
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,719
you are finally back

105
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,399
I finally succeeded

106
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,079
Yang'er

107
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,359
wake up

108
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,439
