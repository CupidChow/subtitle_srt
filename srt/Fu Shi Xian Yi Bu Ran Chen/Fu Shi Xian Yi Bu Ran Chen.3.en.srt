1
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,439
His soul is damaged

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,199
There is no way back

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,279
Brother Yucao

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,239
Please find a way to save him

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,759
Can't save him

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,399
Give up

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,879
why are you doing this

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,879
You'll die if you do this

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,599
I have to save him

10
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,119
You are a demon and he is a fairy

11
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,599
Your powers conflict with each other

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,079
you know what to do

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,079
let me go

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,759
Maybe I can give it a try

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,959
Let me give it a try

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,119
His immortal soul is damaged

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,879
Only magic can save him

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,839
I still have this

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,039
This is an herbal medicine for treating trauma.

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,559
He suffered internal injuries

21
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,959
So what should we do?

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,599
Don't look at me

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,359
I don't know magic

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,119
I can't save him

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,759
What should I do?

26
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,039
you woke up

27
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,399
Very good

28
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,359
you finally woke up

29
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,799
I'm fine

30
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,239
Stop crying

31
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,759
young master

32
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,279
She won't eat anything

33
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,039
I see

34
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,999
Why are you meddling in my own business and saving me?

35
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,199
what are you going to do

36
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,679
I'll tell you if you eat it

37
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,239
Not poisonous

38
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,479
you haven't answered me yet

39
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,759
I don't want to owe anyone else

40
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,439
what do you mean

41
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,199
why are you so stupid

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,359
don't you know

43
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,519
I've been using you

44
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,959
I know

45
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,319
i always knew

46
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,119
But I still want to save you

47
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,519
Don't worry

48
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,319
I'm here

49
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,519
You won't die for a while

50
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,119
us

51
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,679
Met before

52
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,519
What a beautiful starry sky

53
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,279
you say

54
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,599
This is fairyland

55
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,199
Then if I want to see it in the future

56
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,679
Can you see it every day?

57
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,599
Such a starry sky

58
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,919
They are a pair of miserable mandarin ducks

59
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,199
What a pity

60
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,759
why are you laughing

61
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,159
nothing

62
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,279
You shouldn't like it

63
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,599
Miss Ruoxi

64
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,959
Don't talk nonsense

65
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,919
Be careful not to smear that girl’s reputation

66
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,359
That's right

67
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,679
I'm worried that I can't find anyone

68
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,559
It's you

69
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,239
What?

70
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,919
Not interesting

71
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,119
Don't worry

72
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,239
i will help you

73
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,039
Where are the two of them?

74
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,959
Come here quickly

75
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,079
Quick, quick, quick

76
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,159
Walk

77
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,519
Let me introduce two friends to you

78
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,439
I met them both in the woods

79
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,199
This is Tu Jing

80
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,759
benefactor

81
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,199
It turned out to be you

82
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,999
You really know each other

83
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,799
yes

84
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,239
He saved my life before

85
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,559
So he is my benefactor

86
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,399
I heard Ruoxi say

87
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,199
Thanks to you for saving me this time

88
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,119
We're even

89
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,999
You don’t have to call me benefactor from now on

90
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,759
Just call me Yaoyang

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,959
Got cold

92
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,999
This is

93
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,359
I have no talent

94
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,119
It's a stone from ancient times

95
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,559
unique

96
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,079
I can't make it up anymore

97
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,519
You listen to his nonsense

98
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,799
He is a mushroom guy who loves to brag.

99
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,759
You wanted to plot against me before

100
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,359
I was beaten up

101
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,039
I almost made it into mushroom soup.

102
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,599
He is teasing you

103
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,159
No, no, no

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,679
It's all a misunderstanding. It's all a misunderstanding.

105
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,159
It's all misunderstanding

106
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,719
His name is Yucao

107
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,999
Thanks to him collecting Chinese herbal medicine these days

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,239
I'm here to take care of your body.

109
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,519
That's true

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,559
His cooking is very delicious

111
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,879
What about me?

112
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,519
Want to keep both of them

113
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,839
May I

114
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,039
I can stay and cook

115
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,639
Herbal medicines can also be prepared

116
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,279
I have nowhere to go anyway

117
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,439
Right?

118
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,759
You haven't recovered yet

119
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,239
The two of us are staying

120
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,679
There can also be someone to take care of you

121
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,279
The storage room over there

122
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,159
Just enough to free up

123
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,919
only

124
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,679
This is fairyland

125
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,559
Don't run around

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,359
To avoid being discovered by the Immortal Lord

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,679
OK OK

128
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,679
Very good

129
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,559
Kong Deyu, Li Ruosheng, Hu Baichuanbiao, Xu Guo, Li Hongting
