1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,279
Have you brought anything?

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,559
This is the ShadowClan artifact

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,159
Mirror of the Floating World

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,679
with it

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,999
I can practice ancient forbidden arts

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,399
Enhance my immortal power

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,559
That's right

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,959
I will help you cast spells

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,719
Just concentrate on your practice

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,399
good

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,519
you

12
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,559
Waner

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,999
Your illness has returned again

14
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,959
I'm fine

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,279
Don't waste your demonic power to save me anymore

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,679
Wan'er, are you okay? It's her

17
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,439
It's her I've seen her

18
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,879
It was she who killed you

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,439
it's her

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,359
Yang'er

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,519
master

22
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,519
you are finally back

23
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,279
I finally succeeded

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,719
I'm Ruoxi

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,879
Yang'er

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,679
I don't want to

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,919
be your master

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,799
Yang'er

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,879
wake up

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,359
junior sister

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,079
it's you

32
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,719
why are you here

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,759
You guys should leave quickly

34
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,119
Immortal Lord

35
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,799
Immortal Lord, she has taken back the Floating World Mirror

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,119
What did you say

37
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,719
Immortal Lord, she already knows

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,519
Where do you live?

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,479
You have been exposed

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,999
If you don't escape, it'll be too late

41
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,439
Bad

42
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,759
Don't even think about trapping me

43
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,239
Bring Yaoyang

44
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,879
You guys go quickly

45
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,919
Today's feelings

46
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,999
I wrote it down first

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,479
Heng'er

48
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,119
you disappoint me so much

49
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,759
we act separately

50
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,799
no

51
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,679
Their target is me.

52
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,599
Take good care of Yaoyang

53
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,239
Yin'er

54
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,399
You can't escape

55
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,079
I want to try

56
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,759
Another one comes to die

57
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,719
Who lives and who dies

58
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,839
Not necessarily yet

59
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,759
why are you here

60
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,879
Is it strange?

61
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,319
Now we two are on the same battlefield

62
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,519
Eat this demon pill

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,959
You and I will fight out together

64
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,999
I can't die now

65
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,519
I must save Yaoyang

66
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,319
She's going to become a devil

67
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,999
Go quickly

68
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,759
It’s important to catch Xie Yun

69
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,479
Yin'er

70
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,359
Let's take it easy

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,919
For the sake of justice

72
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,799
Also for you

73
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,519
Ruoxi

74
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,279
You go quickly

75
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,479
Tu Jing

76
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,319
we escaped

77
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,679
You persist

78
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,959
I'll save you right away

79
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,879
Too late

80
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,479
No way

81
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,519
No, it's too late

82
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,479
No way

83
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,919
actually

84
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,079
I knew it from the beginning

85
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,319
someone you like

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,119
It's Yaoyang

87
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,719
I know

88
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,759
I also know

89
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,879
you have never changed

90
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,919
It's all pretend

91
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,239
actually

92
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,959
I knew you earlier than Yaoyang

93
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,879
when i first met you

94
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,559
you are dressed

95
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,479
plain clothes

96
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,319
who

97
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,759
It turned out to be a little fox

98
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,119
turn out to be

99
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,879
After collecting the fairy dew that day,

100
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,919
man hiding behind tree

101
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,039
it's you

102
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,119
don't want

103
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,839
little fox

104
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,079
wake up

105
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,719
don't want

106
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,319
no

107
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,959
I can't become a devil

108
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,959
Ruoxi

109
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,439
don't want

110
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,359
You come to me

111
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,599
What kind of trick are you trying to do again?

112
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,679
Only you can save my master now

113
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,959
your master

114
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,239
Master’s immortal soul has returned to the body

115
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,599
Then use the Ukiyo mirror

116
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,439
Draw evil clouds to me

117
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,279
Master can return to normal

118
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,399
What a pity

119
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,799
Master

120
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,079
Ready to seal the evil cloud

121
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,239
It's too late for you

122
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,399
Just bring the evil cloud to me

123
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,719
I want to be sealed

124
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,999
Why should I trust you?

125
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,399
It’s about Master’s safety

126
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,479
How could I lie

127
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,199
I believe you for once

128
