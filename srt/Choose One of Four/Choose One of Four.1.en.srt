(What makes it so good?)

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,000

(There are also powerful villains)

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,120
(and a story full of twists and turns.)

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,000
(You ask me what I like best.)

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,248

(What?)

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,520
They killed the four great constables
in the final chapter?

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,160
How could it end so suddenly?

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,640
They died just like that?

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,480
Time for class. Where are you going?

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm going to tear down his studio.

Excuse me.

(The crossbow he has invented)

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,520
(is considered a high-tech weapon.)

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,280
(He is not so skilled in martial arts,)

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,600
(but he is the most favored character
of the female readers.)

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,240
(Shi Tingyu)
(He's intelligent)

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
(as a master of deduction.)

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,200

(is wealthy and romantic.)

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
(He's domineering)

67
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
(and embodies masculinity.)

68
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,760
(He usually ranks second or third
in the popularity vote.)

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,080
(He's impervious to swords and spears)

70
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,320
(with mastery in fists and palms.)

71
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:32,160

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,680
(Fine, I will.)

75
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,040
(This arrogant fellow is Zhao Wumian.)

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
(Apart from his martial arts,)

77
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,760
(he has nothing to show.)

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,560
(I usually skip over him.)

79
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,560
(Zhao Wumian)
(Luckily, he doesn't show up much)

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
(and is even less popular
than some supporting roles.)

81
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,160
Are you done watching?

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
Show yourselves.

(and mysterious.)

86
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,200
(No one knows their true identities.)

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,680
(Over the years,)

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,000
(they have done)

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
(all sorts of evil.)

90
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,680
Mr. Zhao, I heard

91
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,400
your Wuxin Swordsplay was unrivaled

92
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,720
in the world.

93
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,520
I would like to

94
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,160
admire it properly.

How dare you kill my favorite character?

99
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
I won't allow it.

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,800
Xu Zhimo, you'd better...

101
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000

(Thankfully, the senior
Zhao Wumian is here.)

113
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,000
No wonder you have assembled here

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
but dare not make a move.

115
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,720
