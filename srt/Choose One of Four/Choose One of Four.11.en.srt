(Tingyu Discovering Zhishui's Secret)

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,720
You've come just in time.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,800
I'll kill all three of you.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,400
Wait.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,320
I run a small business.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,400
Harmony leads to prosperity.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,960
Let's talk it over.

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,440
Master Xu.

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,080
Don't do it.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,600
This young man

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,880
is from the Han family,
and so the Big Dipper Sect...

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,960
Really?

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,280
With the Han family joining us,

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,000
we'll secure

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,360
a decisive victory.

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,080
Scoundrel!

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,600
Don't run.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,240
Witch.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,240
Witch.

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,720
Witch.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,080
Little Deer.

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,520
Witch, are you alright?

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,560
Please don't die.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
Can we put these two things together

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
to save her?

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,040
Mo Shanghua said

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,840
what she had taken

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,360
is Granny Meng's poisonous wine.

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,080
It's a rare poison.

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,240
I've seen it during the war against

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
the Kingdom of Bili.

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,920
This poison is vile.

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
When it takes effect,

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
the heart-piercing pain

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,680
is unbearable.

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,400
How do we find the antidote

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,560
for the Little Deer?

51
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,920
Now,

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,480
she can only be saved

53
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,760
in one place.

54
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,120
That is

55
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
the Imperial Clinic of Beichao.

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,560
Ruyi Pavilion.

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
Ruyi Pavilion.

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,640
Exclusively for the royal family.

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,880
The royal family?

60
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
So what?

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,280
Actually,

62
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,560
the four great clans

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,280
also have access to it.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
Actually,

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,400
I really like this girl.

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,080
How about

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,280
I take her to the Ruyi Pavilion?

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,200
You take these two items

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,600
to Tianshan Academy.

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,200
I'll take care of her.

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,880
Alright then.

72
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,360
Fengyi.

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,840
Take these things and head back.

74
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,840
Also, I think

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
there's trouble at the Daoming Court.

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,640
The Daoming Court
was turned upside down.

77
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,040
You heard about it too?

78
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,680
Turned upside down?

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,240
Trouble?

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,200
Our leader is there.

81
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,120
What can go wrong?

82
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,520
The Big Dipper Sect

83
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,600
has become adept at using poison.

84
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,040
I think a master of poisons joined them.

85
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,160
They can blend

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,120
the conductor

87
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,880
with poison without a trace.

88
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,560
Okay.

89
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,520
I'll go to Tianshan Academy

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,840
and then Daoming Court.

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,960
Wumian.

92
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,720
Take good care of Little Deer.

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Stop calling her that.

94
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,440
So annoying.

95
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,800
(Tianshan Academy)

96
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,160
Tingyu, I was looking for you...

97
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,160
Tingyu.

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,960
Tingyu.

99
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Tingyu.

100
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
Tingyu.

101
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,960
I've come too late.

103
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,080
Distinguished officials
surround His Majesty.

104
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,440
A humble scholar laments his fall.

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,640
A prosperous age
illuminates our kingdom.

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,080
A humble boat sails
on the tumultuous sea.

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
Mr. Xu.

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,080
I hope your next life goes

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,240
easier on you.

110
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,080
Let us drink tea

111
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,760
and play chess again in the next life.

112
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,280
Tingyu.

113
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,720
You...

114
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,400
This is the worst scenario
I have in mind.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,840
Actually, I had set up

116
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,880
my crossbow in the tree before I came.

117
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,480
As soon as Xu Zhenqing made a move,

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,360
my arrow would
go straight for his heart.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,440
Masters have always taught me

120
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,200
to have a backup plan.

121
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,720
So,

122
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,560
you took a gamble?

123
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,920
The scent of your clothes

124
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
and the mud on your shoes...

125
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,760
Calculating the time,

126
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,240
I bet

127
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,440
you've been to the Dark Capital.

128
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,560
Besides,

129
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,680
you met with a woman
with a strong scent of rouge.

130
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,680
If I do the math here,

131
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,240
I bet Wumian and the others

132
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,040
encountered an ambush at the brothel.

133
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,160
Fortunately, Wumian
is a top martial artist.

134
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,200
So he should be fine.

135
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,480
But he couldn't get any clues.

136
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
And you went

137
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,160
behind Wumian and Fengyi's back.

138
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,880
Did you go there in secret

139
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
to tip off the Big Dipper Sect?

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,760
It's said that your name was Mo Qijin

141
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
before you joined the Daoming Court.

142
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,800
Mo is a rare surname.

143
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Considering where you just visited...

144
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,200
What a coincidence.

145
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,720
The person in charge there

146
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,960
shares your surname.

147
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
There's only one possibility.

148
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,560
You are the little brother
of Mo Shanghua.

149
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,840
So,

150
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,200
why did you visit

151
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,600
the Dark Capital?

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,960
Mo

153
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
Qi

154
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,040
jin.

155
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,640
Actually, if you kill me now,

156
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,400
you could blame it on Xu Zhenqing.

157
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,560
Otherwise,

158
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,840
I will report to our leader.

159
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,280
Right?

160
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,360
Zhishui.

161
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,240
Zhishui.

162
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
Don't be nervous.

163
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,440
I was just speculating.

164
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,360
Are you hungry?

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,040
Zhishui.

166
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,200
Shall we

167
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,680
grab something to eat?

168
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,712
(Ruyi Pavilion)

169
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,200
Feed this to Miss Lin.

170
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,360
Alright.

171
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,760
Zhishui.

172
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,400
Love you.

173
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,480
Zhishui.

174
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,280
Hedgehog, what are you doing on my bed?

175
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
What are you worked up about?

176
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
I'm also a patient.

177
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,440
Besides,

178
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,000
we slept on different beds.

179
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,360
But last night,

180
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,520
you kept shouting "Zhishui",

181
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,920
and climbed

182
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,240
onto my bed.

183
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,480
Wait, I...

184
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,960
Do you have to stare at me?

185
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
W-Who's staring?

186
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Scoundrel.

187
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Then

188
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,480
would you stare

189
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,480
at Yun Zhishui?

190
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,000
I-It depends on the scenario.

191
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
If you're undressed for treatment,

192
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,520
go to another room.

193
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,640
Why are you dirtying my eyes and soul?

194
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,160
You're so heavy.

195
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,560
I carried you here.

196
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,960
No one else could.

197
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,776
You...

198
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,000
Besides,

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,160
you think I wanted to stay?

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
You kept moaning in pain

201
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
and begging me to stay.

202
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,120
Anyway, I was asleep.

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,280
You can even say

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,520
that I was dancing in the street.

205
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Miss.

206
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,120
What this gentleman just said is true.

207
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,040
You've been shouting,

208
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
"Zhishui."

209
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,600
"Zhishui."

210
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,160
What a fool.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,920
You think such a mad woman

212
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,200
could ruin my entire plan?

213
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,640
Forgive me.

214
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
Forgive me.

215
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,400
My big brother died!

216
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,560
Everything is under control.

217
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
Now you know

218
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,000
what to do.

219
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,000
I swear I'll go against

220
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,440
Mo Shanghua.

221
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,360
She did all this

222
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,360
to keep a balance
between us and the court

223
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,840
to obstruct me from claiming the throne.

224
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,080
She's going to work with them

225
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,240
to make me step down.

226
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:34,271
♪Who is admiring
their own solitary elegance♪

227
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:39,999

♪Contented with oneself
amidst the chaotic world♪

00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:08,383
♪Who lets the lonely petals fall♪

233
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:16,287
♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

234
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:21,279
♪The bloom of the gardenia,
oh so fleeting♪

235
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,975
♪Thinking of the songs
and the sighs of the parted♪
