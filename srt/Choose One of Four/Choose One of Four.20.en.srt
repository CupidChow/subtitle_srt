(The Biggest Villain Appears!)

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,840
I want you to ascend the throne.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
Ascend the throne.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,440
Ascend the throne.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,120
There is one thing I don't get.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
So

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,480
I'm here for advice.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,880
You once said

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,840
that she and I

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,520
couldn't be a couple.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,400
Is that so?

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,880
In fact, what Miss Lin said last time

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,400
enlightened me.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,640
Marital fate is beautiful
but fleeting, like fireworks.

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,160
But true love is not
about possessing each other.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,720
Rather, it's about
wishing each other the best

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,320
and achieving personal growth.

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,160
That's easy to say

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,880
but extremely hard

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,360
to achieve.

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,200
And now,

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,160
she's the only weak spot you have

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,360
as the top martial artist.

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
How do you know this?

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,280
I can feel

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,600
all her emotions.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,920
And she can feel

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,800
all my emotions

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
as well as physical pain.

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,960
It could have been a good thing.

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,800
It's just that

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,440
the court is in turbulence.

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
I can't give her a peaceful life.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
So, Madam,

48
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,960
is there a way

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
to sever this connection?

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,400
This is the last time

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,520
I call you father.

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm telling you this

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,760
right now

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,280
to show you that

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,520
I've always

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,320
trusted you.

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,720
Do you know

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,560
what evil deeds
the Big Dipper Sect has done?

59
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,120
Think about it.

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,400
His Majesty

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,680
may be debauched,

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,720
but he has promoted irrigation works

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,160
and built roads.

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,440
The imperial examination system

65
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,880
may not be perfect

66
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,120
but he has made sure
that everyone could make a living.

67
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,600
What about the Big Dipper Sect?

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,920
It does all kinds of evil deeds.

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,880
Have you done anything good
for the people?

70
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,760
What about

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,360
all those corrupt officials
I've eliminated

72
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,880
and the effort I put into

73
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,840
training you kids?

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,480
I did it to ensure world peace one day.

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,320
Especially you.

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,520
I made you upright

77
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,480
and impartial

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,320
to be a wise ruler

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,600
for the people.

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
Training us?

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,480
You killed 14 of my juniors.

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,320
Me? A wise ruler?

83
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,760
I am just a pawn of yours, that's all.

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,720
This is the worst torment in the world.

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,160
Don't

86
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,880
rescue Zhao Wumian just yet.

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
As long as we don't rescue him,

88
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,240
he will stay alive.

89
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
Why is that?

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,400
As long as Wumian is still in prison,

91
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560
Shangguan Yunxiao will wait

92
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
until next week's royal ceremony.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,920
If we get him out of there...

94
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,680
Things will be different.

95
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,000
For example,

96
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
he could confirm

97
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,680
that Zhao Wumian killed your father.

98
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,680
And

99
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
he could bring
the entire Daoming Court down.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,680
He could even

101
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,840
eliminate the person
he has never been able to control,

102
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,360
Mo Shanghua.

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Then we must contact Lusheng now.

104
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,840
You can only achieve something great
through legitimate and reasonable ways.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,400
That's what I teach you.

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Do you think

107
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,160
a person like me

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,240
would make the people suffer?

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,680
If I had no principles,

110
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,400
I would have utilized various powers

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,760
and your martial arts skills

112
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,080
to launch a major attack

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,280
on the capital.

114
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,240
Why would I wait until now?

115
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,920
Look at you.

116
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,840
Right now,

117
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,640
you are just a prisoner.

118
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
The only thing you can do

119
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,680
is to join me in the rebel

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,680
to turn the tables.

121
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,440
I have mastered all the martial arts

122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,440
because you taught me well.

123
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,520
From the day I joined the army,
I knew that I couldn't

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,560
turn against my own people.

125
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,600
You want me to seize the capital?

126
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,640
In your dreams.

127
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,720
There are two ways.

128
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,600
The first is to sever your love

129
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,560
and block your emotions.

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,560
That will break the tie.

131
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,520
The second way

132
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,040
is to incapacitate your martial arts.

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,560
Hedgehog.

134
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,600
Please be alright.

135
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,080
Little Deer was saved by Zhishui.

136
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,640
They must be hiding

137
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,120
at the Zuisheng House
in the Dark Capital.

138
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,760
You can only enter the Dark Capital

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
during the day.

140
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,200
Right.

141
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,320
What festival is it today?

142
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,960
It's Qixi.

143
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,640
That's not good.

144
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,464
You...

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,720
You actually

146
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
incapacitated your martial arts.

147
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,160
Wumian.

148
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,320
You've gone to the extreme.

149
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,520
You've disappointed me.

150
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,440
What a pity for your Wuxin Swordsplay.

151
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
Kill him.

152
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,080
Be careful.

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,120
Miss Lin.

154
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,440
I was planning to...

155
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,080
Step aside.

156
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,000
Hedgehog.

157
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,120
Are you alright?

158
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,280
Wumian

159
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,360
suffered torture

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,720
and became incapacitated.

161
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Come on.

162
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
Write down

163
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,840
what you want to say.

164
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,240
Wumian.

165
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,160
Wumian.

166
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,560
Wumian.

167
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,800
Wumian.

168
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,600
Master Xu.

169
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,040
It may not be

170
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,920
the right time to rescue him.

171
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,880
Will it make you happy
if he dies in prison?

172
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,600
Miss Lin.

173
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,360
Don't get worked up.

174
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,920
We are just worried
that the Big Dipper Sect

175
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
will take advantage of it.

176
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,280
It's not safe here.

177
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,400
Let's get going.

178
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,040
How does that idiom go?

179
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,840
Yeah.

180
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,160
Walking into a deadly trap.

181
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,080
Shangguan, you've gone too far!

182
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
You used my sister-in-law
to manipulate my brother and me,

183
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,880
leading us astray.

184
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,280
Fortunately, Tingyu never gave up on me.

185
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,480
Today

186
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,200
one of us has to die.

187
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,080
Why don't you reunite
with your brother and sister-in-law?

188
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,120
My lord.

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,480
We have solved the case.

190
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Qiu Shisanniang

191
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,920
and the Daoming Court members

192
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
raided the prison.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,360
Zhao Wumian is guilty of murder.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,680
Xu Zhenqing committed treason.

195
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,160
All of them are here.

196
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,120
Good.

197
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,280
This trap was set to get rid of you.

198
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,280
Now that you're found guilty,

199
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,400
I have an excuse
to mobilize military power

200
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,920
to take all of you out.

201
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,200
What a pleasant surprise

202
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
to catch Master Xu here.

203
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,880
Perfect.

204
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,520
Now I have no further concerns.

205
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,520
Even the heavens are helping me

206
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,640
to ascend the throne next week.

207
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Wang Linsheng, heed the command.

208
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Here.

209
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
I now appoint you
as the temporary Commander.

210
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,200
Thank you, my lord.

211
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

212
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,480
All soldiers, heed the command.

213
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,840
Capture Qiu Shisanniang
and Xu Zhenqing alive.

214
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,080
Kill everyone from the Daoming Court.

215
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Miss Lin.

216
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,200
Take care of Wumian.

217
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,960
Form the array.

218
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,280
Beisu Qingfeng Powder.

219
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,640
Hold your breath.

220
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,040
Oh no.

221
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,640
Is Tang Bocheng still alive?

222
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:12,607

their own solitary elegance♪

223
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:18,335
