(Wonderful Comic World)

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,280
Bye.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,080
Bye. I'm off.

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,960
Zhao Wumian.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,160
Let go of me.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,080
Let me go, Zhao Wumian.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,800
Let go of me.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,920
Petty tricks.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
Come back to Daoming Court
with me for investigation.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,040
You rascal.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,680
I'd rather die than go with you.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,880
I told you it wasn't me.

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,080
Gentlemen.

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,160
Listen.

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,120
(Shangguan Yunxiao)
Let me introduce you.

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,560
This is

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,840
our leader,

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,000
Shangguan Yunxiao.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,880
Okay.

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,520
Report.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,280
The Princess of Bili
arrived home safely.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,200
We were about to fight
with the Big Dipper Sect

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,960
when this lady fell from the sky.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,720
She helped us

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,200
protect the Princess of Bili
from the Big Dipper Sect,

39
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,840
thus preventing a dispute
between the two kingdoms.

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,240
So formidable?

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,080
Miss.

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,200
May I ask your name?

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm Lin Lusheng.

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,240
All of you

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,560
are my old acquaintances.

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,560
I've never missed a single issue.

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,040
So I know everything about you.

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,360
Bizarre attire.

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,800
Strange behavior.

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,320
Are you a witch?

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,920
What nonsense?

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,040
Are you a hedgehog?

53
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Full of spikes.

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
I've told you.

55
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,880
This is a comic world.

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,480
I've entered the book.

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,520
Master Situ and Master Ouyang

58
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,840
of Tianshan Academy are here.

59
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,600
Greetings to Lord Shangguan
and the four great constables.

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Masters.

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,720
Long time no see.

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Lord Shangguan.

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,720
We've put a halt to providing talents

64
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
for the imperial court

65
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,400
these days.

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,080
Because something bizarre has occurred.

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
Recently,

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,080
a book titled "Big Dipper Mysteries"

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,120
has grown popular in the academy.

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,040
Many students

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,680
have shown great interest in the rituals

72
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,200
documented in the book.

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,320
What's more,

74
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
some students died

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
horrible deaths because of it.

76
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,840
That's why we came
to Daoming Court to seek help.

77
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,000
But we can't stop selecting talents

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,160
for the imperial court.

79
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,280
Master.

80
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,360
Form an array.

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,720
Zhao Wumian, blood makes you faint.

82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
You will feel better with these.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,960
What is this?

84
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,480
Witch.

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,680
I don't want your things.

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,840
Just keep it.

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,680
You may be cold-blooded,

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,040
but I remember that blood

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,200
makes you squeamish.

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
Right?

91
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,720
It's for you.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
It will make you feel better.

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
Stop being mean to me from now on.

94
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,880
Zhishui. Fengyi.

95
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,120
Come with me

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
to check for suspicious people.

97
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,280
Understood.

98
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,480
You're blocking me, Witch.

99
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,800
Step aside.

100
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,240
(I remember that Shi Tingyu)

101
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,560
(got seriously injured in this chapter.)

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,160
Master.

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
(It breaks the reader's heart.)

104
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,840
(No.)

105
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,680
(Let me help him through this)

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
(before going back.)

107
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,880
Wumian.

108
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,280
The masters

109
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,720
are dead.

110
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,920
It's the curse of the Big Dipper Demon.

111
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,640
(Big Dipper Mysteries)
I have read this.

112
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Those who disrespect
the Big Dipper Demon

113
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,160
will be cursed

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,960
and bleed from seven orifices

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
until they die.

116
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,040
Tingyu.

117
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,680
I know

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,520
you were close to them.

119
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
Rest assured.

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,160
We will bring the murderer to justice.

121
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,760
Tingyu.

122
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,560
Master.

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,480
Master.

124
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,520
Miss Lin Lusheng.

125
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,400
Miss Lin Lusheng.

126
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,200
Are you alright?

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,560
Could it be the long-lost Guinei Vessel?

128
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,440
Tingyu.

129
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,360
Are you alright?

130
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm fine.

131
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,920
Miss Lin Lusheng.

132
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,040
I may be young,

133
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
but this is my duty.

134
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm used to it.

135
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,080
(Tingyu was most invested in this case)

136
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,720
(in the comics.)

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,920
(I should help him.)

138
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,240
Did you just call me by name?

139
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,680
A comic character called my name.

140
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,200
It feels so surreal.

141
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,880
(Right.)

142
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,640
(Let me check the plot of this chapter.)

143
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,616
What...

144
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,760
Give it back to me.

145
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,600
Witch.

146
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,440
Is this your magical device?

147
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,920
Don't mess with it.

148
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,880
It's my tablet.

149
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,400
Tablet?

150
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you have

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,840
Wi-Fi here?

152
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Wumian.

153
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,600
We're back.

154
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
(I remember now.)

155
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
(It's this guy.)

156
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
We've sent the bodies for an autopsy.

157
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,160
You checked around?

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
No clues.

159
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,200
It's strange.

160
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,000
It seems

161
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,440
this case is not as simple as imagined.

162
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
So what should we do next?

163
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,240
We need to

164
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,320
discuss it more.

165
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,280
Little Deer.

166
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,200
What are you doing?

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
If I show you

168
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,520
the murderer's face,

169
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
you must take me to Tianshan Academy.

170
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,240
No way.

171
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,160
It's too dangerous.

172
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
Why should we believe

173
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,080
that your painting is correct?

174
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
I am a witch.

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,800
I can see people's karma and destiny.

176
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,320
That was how I knew
Commander Han Zhonggu

177
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,480
would pass by Fengjin Garden.

178
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,520
Han Fengyi, release the signal.

179
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,496
(Han)

180
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,320
Tingyu.

181
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,160
Rest assured.

182
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,560
I will help you.

183
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,920
So bold.

184
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,840
Want to bet

185
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,200
who finds the murderer first?

186
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,520
People have died.

187
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Show some respect.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
What's wrong?

189
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,760
Backing down already?

190
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,960
How about this?

191
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,160
If you win,

192
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,800
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,760
If you lose,

194
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
You'll have to do something for me.

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
You're dressed in strange clothes

196
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,080
and you want to go around?

197
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,968
You...

198
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,360
In my opinion,

199
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,520
Miss Lin talks in a mysterious way.

200
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,520
If you claim to have an idea,

201
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,800
just give it a try.

202
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,200
Leader, this is...

203
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,440
Hedgehog.

204
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
You're bound to lose.

205
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,640
He is the murderer.

206
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,320
Sorry.

207
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,640
I missed a stroke.

208
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
- Xu Zhenqing?
- Xu Zhenqing?

209
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
I swear it wasn't me.

210
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,767
