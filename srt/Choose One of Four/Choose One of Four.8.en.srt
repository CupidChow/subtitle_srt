(Is That You, Master Xu?)

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,720
(The annoying supporting character,
Hedgehog,)

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,000
(is quite cute.)

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Why are you so happy?

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,480
Miss,

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,920
are you here to steal business?

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,120
You've amused the guest so much.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,480
What business would I steal?

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,680
We're waiting for a friend here.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,240
We'll leave shortly.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,200
Every moment matters.

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,440
Rather than waiting here,

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,280
why not go up together

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,040
to have fun?

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,200
You're bothering me and my friend.

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,480
Aside from my future wife,

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,280
I wouldn't touch any other woman.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,920
You haven't been in a love?

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Well,

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,800
just now,

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,160
pretending to be a married couple

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,520
was purely

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
for getting Green Crystal.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,520
Well,

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,080
I couldn't possibly marry you.

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,320
You're not my type either.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Well,

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,120
why did you drink that wine for me?

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,960
W-Who drank wine for you?

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Narcissism.

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,840
Then give me your hand.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,840
I'll try with my inner strength to see

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,160
if I can force out the poisoned wine.

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,760
Although I'm not certain

48
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,360
whether that wine was poisoned,

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,480
or if it would only make one

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,880
burp.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,992
Burp?

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,520
Maybe it was just a cup of

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
carbonated drink.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,760
Carbonated drink?

55
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,400
(What am I saying?)

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,720
Give it a try.

57
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,320
Hedgehog.

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,880
What's wrong?

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
Do you smell that?

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,120
This was the smell that night

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,280
when my whole family was murdered.

62
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,880
After my father smelled it,

63
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,880
he became weak and limp.

64
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
How come I'm all right?

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,400
This is a rare type of poison,
Beisu Qingfeng Powder,

66
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,720
which only affects martial artists.

67
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,000
We're taken in.

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,120
Leave now!

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,280
Hedgehog, are you fine?

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
Are you alright?

71
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,440
My strength

72
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,240
has been sealed by half.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,720
Let's leave here now.

74
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,400
Let's go.

75
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,800
This isn't a place you can

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,160
just come and go as you please.

77
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:19,440
(Tianshan Academy)
Who can understand profound chess?

78
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,080
After thousands of games,
one can understand the truth.

79
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,200
In Buddhism, there is endless fate.

80
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,280
But I just try to get ahead
in the next move.

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
Mr. Shi.

82
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
For this game of chess,

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,080
you're in a dead end.

84
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,880
Hedgehog, are you fine?

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,520
Zhao Wumian.

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,080
You can't escape today.

87
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
Yun Zhishui.

88
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,600
Help me!

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,040
Yun Zhishui.

90
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
You leave first.

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,560
I'll handle it.

92
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
No.

93
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
They are in danger now.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,640
This is my territory.

95
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Your junior Shi Tingyu

96
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,040
is in great danger now.

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,760
You go back to Tianshan Academy first.

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
I have a way here.

99
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
Besides,

100
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,080
if you don't hurry back,

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,520
you may have
to collect your junior's corpse.

102
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,800
Yun Zhishui, help!

103
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
Yun Zhishui.

104
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,360
Don't touch that girl.

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,760
After so many years,

106
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,320
it's the first time
you are anxious over a girl.

107
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,400
Then I really should

108
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,320
take good care of her.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
This Beisu Qingfeng Powder is
so powerful

110
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,640
that even you, the top master...

111
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,080
It can't have such significant power

112
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
within a short time.

113
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
It needs a conductor.

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,240
Conductor.

115
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,480
What's wrong?

116
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,960
Are you afraid it's poisoned?

117
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,320
So they had already
ingested the conductor.

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,760
They planned to lure us

119
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,240
into the Dark Capital.

120
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,520
What a good strategy!

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,440
Unexpectedly,

122
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,840
we could take Zhao Wumian down.

123
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,480
It's truly an honor.

124
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,200
If I don't pretend to be poisoned,

125
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
how can I lure you to show up?

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,480
You six

127
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,360
must be the notorious
Six Evils of Jiangnan.

128
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Unexpectedly,

129
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,360
you have also joined
the Big Dipper Sect.

130
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,280
Now, sever one of your arms.

131
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,640
Then I

132
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,280
can spare your lives.

133
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,240
Except

134
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,920
you.

135
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,840
You've messed with the wrong person,

136
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,240
so you must pay a heavy price.

137
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,120
With my strength,

138
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,360
how could I not tell

139
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,440
the murderous intent you're hiding?

140
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
Sever one of your arms,

141
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,800
and I'll spare your lives.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
His inner strength has gone.

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,760
Attack him!

144
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,560
Leave one of your arms behind.

145
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,960
Right.

146
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,400
As long as you survive,

147
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,440
you still have hope.

148
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,040
Leave an arm behind,

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,080
then retreat.

150
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,120
This is not a loss.

151
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,400
Everyone.

152
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,960
Don't rush.

153
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
Rather than severing your arms,

154
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
you'd better join me in the attack.

155
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
We might defeat him.

156
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,240
Our leader has said

157
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,920
whoever takes Zhao Wumian's head

158
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,800
shall become the eighth member.

159
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,720
The eighth member.

160
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
Master Xu.

161
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
If you continue, it'd be terrible.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,680
(Lusheng, stay calm.)

163
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,360
(Think about what to do next.)

164
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,320
(Say something.)

165
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760
(Before,)

166
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,520
(it seems I've told him)

167
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,840
(I am the eighth star.)

168
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,600
Leave.

169
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,160
I can last three more moves.

170
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,992
The code.

171
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:49,520
Yes, the code.

172
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,240
Master Xu.

173
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,720
I am

174
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,400
the eighth star of the Big Dipper Sect.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,160
Darkness is approaching,

176
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,520
and Big Dipper will be forever.

177
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,840
Wait, wait, Master Xu.

178
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,720
I...

179
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,960
I am the eighth star

180
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,400
of the Big Dipper Sect.

181
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,800
Our leader sent me here for a reason.

182
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,760
Miss, you must be kidding.

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
Master Xu.

184
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,040
If you don't know,

185
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,160
then I don't blame you.

186
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,960
Because the task the leader gave me is

187
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,880
to dismantle Daoming Court from within.

188
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,920
Then you know
the Daoming Court has already

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,280
been overturned.

190
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
Overturned?

191
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,600
Of course.

192
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,000
This is my contribution.

193
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,320
Ridiculous.

194
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,520
Master Xu,

195
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,280
your petty tricks

196
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,040
work on those four young constables.

197
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,080
Trying to deceive me

198
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,520
is impossible.

199
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,160
Whether it's true

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
or false,

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,760
anyway,

202
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,120
tonight, you must die.

203
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,960
Mr. Shi.

204
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,360
For this game of chess,

205
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,800
you're in a dead end.

206
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:23,071
♪Who is admiring
their own solitary elegance♪

207
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:28,799
♪Strolling leisurely in the courtyard♪

208
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,887
♪Dust adheres to the brick walls♪

209
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:40,447
♪So stubborn, can't bear to collide♪

210
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:46,143
♪Who weaves garments
of feathers and rainbow silks♪

211
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,031
♪Contented with oneself
amidst the chaotic world♪

212
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:57,183
♪Who lets the lonely petals fall♪

213
00:10:57,183 --> 00:11:05,087
♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

214
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:10,079
♪The bloom of the gardenia,
oh so fleeting♪

215
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,775
♪Thinking of the songs
and the sighs of the parted♪
