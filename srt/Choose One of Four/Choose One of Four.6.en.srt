(Dark Capital is Very Dangerous)

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,080
Just as I imagined,

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,800
they have entered the Dark Capital.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,400
But,

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,280
a strange woman is following them.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
It doesn't matter.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,560
She doesn't know martial arts,

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,480
and can't stir up trouble.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,720
We must capture Zhao Wumian

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,120
at this place.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,800
Do we really have to do this?

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,600
Zhao Wumian

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,320
is a key part of our leader's plan.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,520
So,

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
aren't we?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,800
Let me tell you.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,400
Before,

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,200
to avoid my father,

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
I used to hang out here.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,880
So,

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,480
it feels like my home here.

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,720
I'm not scared at all.

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,440
Wumian.

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,800
Here, they use

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Dark Capital currency.

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,320
Spend it sparingly.

40
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,480
Little Deer.

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
This is for you.

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,600
What is this?

43
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,720
Dragon's beard candy.

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,480
After eating it,

45
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,800
you will feel better indeed.

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,520
Be quiet.

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Once we find what we want,

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,520
let's hurry and leave.

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,480
Understand?

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,760
Wumian.

51
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Spend the night here.

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,200
The night is really fun here.

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,200
Be serious.

54
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,440
Do you remember

55
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,840
death causes and methods

56
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,120
of the two mentors

57
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,280
and the academy disciples

58
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,480
were all very strange?

59
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,800
So,

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,960
the poison

61
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,520
must be prearranged by someone.

62
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,840
We can't take it lightly.

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
So,

64
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,120
it's quite frightening.

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
So in your opinion,

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,960
where might be the thing

67
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
we want?

68
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,280
Right, first...

69
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Where is he?

70
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,520
No way.

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,080
Unreliable Han Fengyi.

72
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Don't worry.

73
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,920
I can lead the way.

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,720
I know there is

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
a grocery store
that is ready to serve here.

76
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
They should have what we want.

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,168
Hmm.

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
Wait, Hedgehog.

79
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,640
We've

80
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,720
already walked past here.

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,920
What's wrong?

82
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,760
Are you questioning
my sense of direction?

83
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,480
What else?

84
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,240
Right.

85
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,640
How do you know I have blood phobia?

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
I am a witch,

87
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,480
so I know everything about you.

88
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,360
Anyway,

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,680
you wouldn't understand.

90
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
Enough.

91
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,960
Let's go.

92
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,400
We've already walked over
a hundred kilometers.

93
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Hurry over here.

94
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,832
(Tianshan Academy)

95
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,680
Zhishui.

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
Zhishui.

97
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
Zhishui.

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,000
Where did Zhishui go?

99
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,200
Mr. Shi.

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,960
Ever since you left academy
as the second top scorer,

101
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,600
it's been a long time
since we had a proper game of chess.

102
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,000
As the constable,

103
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,320
you have no inner strength at all,

104
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
which really surprises me.

105
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,160
I'm really tired.

106
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,680
I'm really starving.

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,920
I'm really starving.

108
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,240
Zhao Wumian.

109
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,920
What should I do?

110
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
My stomach is growling.

111
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,160
Leave now.

112
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,880
It's not safe here.

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't attract attention.

114
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,840
I need to eat something first.

115
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,880
What do you order?

116
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,000
Two small dishes of meat.

117
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,640
Even you'd be scared.

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,680
Alright then.

119
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Let's eat something first.

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,520
After eating,

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,360
hurry on our way.

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
Miss,

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,240
can you give me some money?

124
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,320
Sure.

125
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,560
Don't act rashly.

126
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
People in Dark Capital

127
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,160
all harbor ulterior motives.

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
Why don't you have any sympathy?

129
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
The child is so pitiful.

130
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,640
I should help her.

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,360
You haven't eaten yet, right?

132
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,760
This is dragon's beard candy.

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Here, have a taste.

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,600
How is it?

135
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,560
Is it tasty?

136
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,560
Here.

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,720
Take them.

138
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,520
You can take all of them.

139
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,520
See you.

140
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
Bye.

141
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,520
See?

142
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
Not all people here are bad.

143
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,680
Give me the money.

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
Give him the money.

145
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
You just gave

146
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,320
our only money to that child.

I'm afraid you would

154
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,240
fight with someone again.

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,200

You haven't

157
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,080
been in love, right?

158
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,560
None of your business.

159
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,160
No way.

160
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,800
You definitely have never been in love.

161
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,320
Probably no girl would like you

162
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,040
due to your personality.

163
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,480
Now,

164
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,600
it should be safe.

165
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
Yes, I suppose.

166
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,560
Let's go.

167
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,760
Okay.

168
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,640
Let's go.

169
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,688
(Ready to serve)

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,440
I think I saw Zhishui.

171
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,200
You must have got it wrong.

172
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,920
(I wonder how Zhishui and Tingyu)

173
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,440
(are doing at the Tianshan Academy.)

174
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560
(In the Hat Demon case, Tingyu)

175
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,640
(shielded the Emperor from an arrow)

176
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
(and got hit in his vital area,)

177
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,240
(causing him to lose
all his inner strength.)

178
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
(The priority is)

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,000
(to find Green Crystal
and Guinie Vessel)

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,880
(and get back.)

181
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,880
(No pain, no gain.)

182
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,680
(This is...)

183
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
(Perhaps I can)

184
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,080
(return.)

185
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,400
(But I...)

186
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,560
Witch.

187
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,720
I think

188
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,560
this is Guinie Vessel.

189
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,160
Hmm.

190
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,480
(They are thinking about saving people.)

191
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,840
(Only I am still
thinking about going home.)

192
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,880
