You...

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,320
Raise your head.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,960
Do I

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
look like your friend?

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,040
How can anyone resemble Your Majesty?

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,880
I apologize.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
(It seems Xu Zhimo only)

00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,520
(and didn't come to this world.)

It turns out

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,560
you are the constables
from Daoming Court.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,400
Considering your merits
in solving cases,

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I will forget about

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,400
your transgression.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,880
Get up.

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,120
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,520
Hedgehog.

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,160
Are you alright?

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,360
Come on.

36
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,240
Get up first.

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
You're not mad at me

38
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,640
for what I did today, right?

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Hedgehog.

40
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,000
I think you're very different

41
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,120
from the character in the comic.

42
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,480
Comic?

43
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,800
Yeah.

44
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,920
Like a novel or something?

45
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,320
Similar, I suppose.

46
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,080
The comic says
you're a top martial artist

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,080
and that's pretty much it.

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,160
That is

49
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,960
quite accurate.

50
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,520
Apart from that,

51
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
any other differences?

52
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:26,680
Well,

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,000
when I first met you,

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,840
you were always fixated on trifles

55
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
and acting impulsively.

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
You had low EQ

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,840
and were quite scheming.

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,160
You looked cold and not approachable.

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,360
However, despite your many flaws,

60
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
you have a strong sense

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,800
of responsibility.

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,280
You're compassionate,

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,360
kind-hearted,

64
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
and protective of others.

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
Witch.

66
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,200
Yeah.

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,720
Do...

68
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,600
Do you like Zhishui?

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,840
Where does that come from?

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,920
It's nothing.

71
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,880
Just asking.

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
He is

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
my crush.

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,240
He has a lot of fans
back where I'm from.

75
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,520
Fans?

76
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,800
Yeah.

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,280
I prefer food.

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Then...

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
Then what do you

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
think about me?

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,960
What about you?

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,280
Well...

83
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,240
You know...

84
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,160
Y-You are a nice guy,

85
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
although you're not so popular.

86
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
So can you...

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
Can you perhaps

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,240
don't fall for Zhishui?

89
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,320
Right, Witch.

90
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,640
Do you know
why I faint at the sight of blood?

91
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,480
I have no idea.

92
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
The comic didn't mention
the specific reason.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,040
It was raining heavily on the night

94
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,400
when my whole clan was killed.

95
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,960
It looked

96
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
like a terrifying red ocean.

97
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,680
It's useless to master martial arts.

98
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,040
I still couldn't

99
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,560
avenge my people
after years of training.

100
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,520
That powerless feeling.

101
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,080
I get it.

102
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,200
Only those who have experienced it
would understand.

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,680
Before Chen Shenmao died,

104
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,960
she trusted me so much

105
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,560
and she wanted to live.

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,600
And I promised

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,080
to protect her.

108
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
But in the end...

109
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
I know.

110
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,720
I understand your pain.

111
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
You were young

112
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,160
back then.

113
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,400
You must have been tormented.

114
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,320
It's okay.

115
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,040
This is not your fault.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,720
It's those villains' fault.

117
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,520
You've been working hard

118
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
to solve cases and save lives

119
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,400
for so many years.

120
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880

But

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,240

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,360
