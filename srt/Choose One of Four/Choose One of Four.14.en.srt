(Ruyi Pavilion)

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm fine.

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm fine.

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
(What am I thinking?)

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,120
(Focus on the clues.)

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,880
Hedgehog, look.

21
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,320
"Collection of Sweet Words"?

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,800
So that's what you like to read?

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,200
Oh, right.

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,640
Did you find anything?

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,760
I found some documents in the book.

26
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,600
(Order Sheet)

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
How did you find these?

28
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,200
It's mentioned in the comic.

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,920
What?

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,520
Nothing.

31
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,000
It's the divination of a witch.

32
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,280
Let's see.

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,920
(Order Sheet, Purchaser: Han Zhonggu)
Mandrake flower seeds.

34
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,360
They never planted

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,880
mandrake flowers at the Ruyi Pavilion.

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,720
The flowers are purchased

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,320
from all over the world.

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,080
If they can't procure the flowers
for some reason,

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,120
they have to buy the seeds
and plant them secretly.

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,280
That means...

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,680
- It's hidden.
- It's hidden.

42
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,000
But Ruyi Pavilion doesn't have

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,480
a suitable environment.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Where are the flowers planted?

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
Let's see.

Han Zhonggu?

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Isn't he Han Fengyi's father?

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
Let's browse through the books

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,840
to look for more clues.

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,576
Okay.

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,520
I'll go over there.

54
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
Okay, I'll look over here.

(Kudzu Root)

57
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:06,440
(Mandrake flower)
This one mentions mandrake flowers.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,040
Fresh mandrake petals

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,320
can remove all poisons.

60
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
For someone poisoned by
Granny Meng's poisonous wine,

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,800
mix mandrake petals

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,240
with the blood
of a skilled martial artist.

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,640
Drink it

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,960
to remove the poison.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,560
If martial artists are poisoned

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
by Beisu Qingfeng Powder,

67
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,040
they must find true love

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,960
to cure the poison.

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
The pulse of true love

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,400
can help them
eliminate the poison automatically.

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
Women of Beichao are truly suffering.

72
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,640
If one is of humble origin,

73
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,720
living in this world

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,760
is a pure torment.

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,000
One who roams the martial world

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,320
can't make it with a single identity.

77
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,680
In the Dark Capital,

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,400
I'm the top courtesan of Zuisheng House.

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,320
Here,

80
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,440
I am a physician.

81
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,520
And at home,

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm your older sister.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,560
Why did you go to Miss Lin's room?

84
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,240
Don't you lay a finger on her.

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
She is very important

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,960
to me.

87
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,680
Alright.

88
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,920
I do admire her for being talented.

89
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
It's rare to see

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,080
a woman with such thoughts

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
in this world.

92
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,360
Shanghua.

93
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,440
His Majesty will attend
Pinxiang Meeting tomorrow.

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,960
Are you planning...?

95
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
I know what I'm doing.

96
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,520
What is the Big Dipper Sect up to?

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,880
Lin Lusheng fell victim to

98
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,960
Granny Meng's poisonous wine.

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
It's made from mandrake flowers

100
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,640
and the effects vary

101
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,320
for each individual.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,160
Lin Lusheng shares traits
similar to Chen Shenmao.

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,280
Their poisoned blood

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,640
can be used to develop new poisons.

105
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,720
The Tiangu Vessel

106
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,720
is a medicinal conductor.

107
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
Once Lin Lusheng
approaches someone who's poisoned,

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
the Big Dipper Sect

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
can control the poisoned one.

110
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,080
Who are they targeting?

111
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,120
His Majesty.

112
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,920
They want him
to step down from the throne.

113
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,320
Then they can

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
rightfully control the entire Beichao.

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,040
Shanghua.

116
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
We need to discuss it more.

117
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,160
Don't act impulsively.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
I know what I'm doing.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,360
I don't want you
to be on the run forever.

120
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
Ever since you joined Daoming Court,

121
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,000
you've changed a lot.

122
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,840
Don't forget.

123
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,760
The Hat Demon case may seem

124
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,640
to be plotted by the Big Dipper Sect.

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,120
But in fact,

126
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,920
it was you who propelled it.

127
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,200
What's in the past is not

128
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,560
worth mentioning.

129
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,280
It's just at the last moment,

130
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,000
you changed your mind
about killing the emperor.

131
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,080
Because Tingyu cracked the case in time.

132
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,360
And I realized that

133
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,520
the people of Beichao

134
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,400
would only suffer without an emperor.

135
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Shanghua.

136
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,320
I want to do what I can to help.

137
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,840
No matter what happens,

138
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,960
Qijin,

139
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,480
you matter the most to me.

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,720
If...

141
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,720
If you make a move,

142
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,680
I will arrest you
in the name of Daoming Court.

143
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
You know?

144
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,480
Qijin.

145
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
Ten years ago,

146
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,120
only I survived
out of the 20 palace maids

147
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,640
who served the emperor.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Your Majesty.

149
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,240
I've taken over the Daoming Court.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Rest assured about the public security.

151
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,560
We almost

152
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,720
got to Shangguan Yunxiao.

153
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,000
However,

154
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,840
he disappeared at the critical moment.

155
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,760
The Big Dipper Sect
remains the biggest problem.

156
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,640
I haven't been sleeping well.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,800
Get some soothing incense
from the Ruyi Pavilion.

158
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,800
Right.

159
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,600
Why rush to hold
the Pinxiang Meeting tomorrow?

160
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,400
It's an auspicious day tomorrow.

161
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
It helps you better absorb

162
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,840
high-quality Feini at the Ruyi Pavilion.

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,920
And I'll do my best
to find Lord Shangguan.

164
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,320
I know I can entrust everything to you.

165
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
Over the past decade or so,

166
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,960
you've been taking out

167
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,920
the entire family
of whoever threatens the court...

168
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,880
Who's there?

169
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,720
Come out.

170
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Seventeen years ago,

171
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,920
on the seventh day of the sixth month,

172
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,640
my entire family

173
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,960
was brutally killed.

174
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,240
Your Majesty.

175
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,400
Do you remember that?

176
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,920
I've executed so many corrupt officials.

177
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,920
I can't remember something

178
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,160
from 17 years ago.

179
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,560
Dozens of people
at the Daoming Court were killed.

180
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,840
Our leader
Shangguan Yunxiao went missing.

181
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
We served the court wholeheartedly.

182
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,040
But Your Majesty,

183
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,960
you speak so lightly

184
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,480
of our life and death.

185
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,400
Zhao Wumian, show some respect.

186
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,000
How dare you

187
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,560
talk to His Majesty like this?

188
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,480
Xu Zhimo.

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,920
Who are you?

190
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,920
How dare you call out my name?

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,960
You also came? You're the emperor here?

192
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,280
What a strange woman.

193
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,440
She doesn't

194
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,760
get on her knees

195
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,760
and she utters strange phrases
I do not understand.

196
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,360
You're playing dumb here?

197
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,680
I haven't settled accounts with you

198
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,240
for killing four great constables
in the comic.

199
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,480
Show some respect.

200
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,440
We apologize.

201
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,880
Please spare us, Your Majesty.

202
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,680
I apologize.

203
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,360
You...

204
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
Raise your head.

205
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,160
Do I

206
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
look like your friend?

207
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,440
How can anyone resemble Your Majesty?

208
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
I apologize.

209
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,000
(It seems Xu Zhimo only)

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,640
(made the emperor look like him)

211
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,760
(and didn't come to this world.)

212
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,720
It turns out

213
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,800
you are the constables
from Daoming Court.

214
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
Considering your merits
in solving cases,

215
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
I will forget about

216
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,640
your transgression.

217
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,120
Get up.

218
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,360
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

219
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.
