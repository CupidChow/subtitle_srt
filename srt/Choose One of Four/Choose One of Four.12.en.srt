(Master of Poisons, Tang Bocheng)

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,160
Master.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,120
Our plan at Tianshan Academy failed.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,280
And that Hat Demon scheme

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,600
involving the royalty's internal strife.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,600
The plan

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,400
involving the foreign princesses...

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,760
All our plans failed.

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,040
Master, please

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,320
show us the way.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,440
We've taken down the Daoming Court.

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,480
We can proceed however we want.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
What we need to do first

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,200
is to cultivate our Tiangu Vessel

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,720
to nurture our new Feini.

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,080
Well...

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
Are you alright?

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,440
I sense danger.

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,120
He is Tang Bocheng,

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,200
the top physician of Ruyi Pavilion.

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,560
I am a physician here.

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,880
You can call me Qiu Shisanniang.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
I bet

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,640
Mo Shanghua is off to kill Lin Lusheng

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,760
to eliminate the only Tiangu Vessel.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,360
So the plans for the Pinxiang Meeting

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,800
will also fall apart.

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,000
Wait.

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,400
It's too late.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,320
Mo Shanghua has already

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,400
arrived at Ruyi Pavilion.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,560
Then...

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,560
Don't worry.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,160
I have set everything up.

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,440
Tang Bocheng?

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,320
That's right.

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,800
The Master of Poisons back in the day.

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Back then,

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I saved him when he was being hunted

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
by Han Zhonggu.

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
I inducted him into our sect

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
as the seventh member.

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
Thus, he pledged loyalty to me.

57
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,520
I also gave him a new life

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,080
and renamed him

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
Tang Bocheng.

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,600
In that case,

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,120
he is the most crucial link in our plan.

62
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,000
You sent him to the Ruyi Pavilion

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,200
to administer

64
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,280
conductors and poisons
to the royal family.

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Then we'll only wait.

66
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,880
Once the poison is nurtured,

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,520
we can control the entire royal family.

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,000
You look a bit like

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Mo...

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,720
Miss Lin.

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
It's time for medicine.

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,720
Well...

73
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,760
I feel much better now.

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,064
I-I can stop taking the medicine, right?

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Mr. Zhao.

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,240
Let me take your pulse.

77
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,600
You kill without batting an eye.

78
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Your sword is fast and leaves no trace.

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Mr. Zhao.

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,880
You are indeed

81
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,000
the top martial artist.

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,960
I didn't expect

83
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
to see you here, Mo Shanghua.

84
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,480
It seems that the capital

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,040
has been engulfed by darkness.

86
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,040
I've rested for a few days.

87
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,240
I can arrest you

88
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
without any effort.

89
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,280
I don't know Mo Shanghua.

90
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,640
But I've never seen someone

91
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,600
so defiant while suffering

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
from a deadly poison.

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
Have you gone mad?

94
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,400
Enough.

95
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,320
I'll drink it.

96
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,640
What's wrong, Witch?

97
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,240
It's so bitter.

98
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,880
But I feel

99
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,600
much better.

100
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,160
Good medicine tastes bitter.

101
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,720
Since you fellow disciples are reunited,

102
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,400
we will not disturb you.

103
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,720
By the way, Miss Lin.

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,280
You can't leave

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,240
until your poison is removed.

106
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:03,560
What's wrong?

107
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,280
Are you alright?

108
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,720
That's right.

109
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
The poison hasn't matured.

110
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,760
Once you leave the safe range,

111
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,800
you'll be in grave danger.

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,520
That's right.

113
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,200
You're truly a master of intelligence,
Qiu Shisanniang.

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Then you might as well

115
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
sell me a tip.

116
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,640
Tell me the one

117
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,240
who wiped out

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,280
my entire clan 17 years ago.

119
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,840
Wasn't it the Big Dipper Sect?

120
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
My investigation shows

121
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,280
that things are not so simple.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
For so many years,

123
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
hasn't Shangguan Yunxiao

124
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,600
told you anything?

125
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
Not a single word.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,640
Then you should stop asking.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,760
None of us

128
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,880
can afford to mess with this person.

129
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,360
Wumian.

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I have closed the case
of Tianshan Academy

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,920
and saved the poisoned students.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
But the Daoming Court...

133
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,640
What about it?

134
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,920
It's destroyed.

135
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,320
Except for us,

136
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,640
all the other 14 disciples

137
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
have been...

138
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,320
Where is our leader?

139
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,880
He's missing.

140
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,520
The Big Dipper Sect did it?

141
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,120
What about Tingyu?

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,160
Tell me.

143
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,120
My...

144
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,600
My hands...

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,720
What...?

146
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,840
I remember now.

147
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,320
Lots of bad things

148
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,640
will happen here.

149
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,960
Right at Ruyi Pavilion.

150
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
We have to go...

151
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,880
Miss Lin.

152
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,440
Are you feeling any better?

153
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,840
Promise me.

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't go to Zuisheng House again.

155
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,800
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,840
Wumian.

157
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,360
You just fetched water?

158
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,240
I didn't know you had fetched water.

159
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,320
If I had known...

160
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
So noisy.

161
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,600
I got the water for myself.

162
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,320
I am a patient too.

163
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,240
Oh, right.

164
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
Did you find any clues

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,640
at the Daoming Court?

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,280
I found the token of Han Zhonggu,

167
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,920
the Commander of the Imperial Guards

168
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,280
on our leader's chair.

169
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,680
Han Zhonggu?

170
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,520
