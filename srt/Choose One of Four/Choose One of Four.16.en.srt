00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
Are you okay?

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm fine.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,320
Who could have thought

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,920
that the most dangerous place
turned out to be the safest?

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,480
Let's collect some to study later.

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,720
Alright.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
I'll ask my juniors to come
and have a look tomorrow.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,400
Be careful.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,720
I'm fine.

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,720
Right.

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,840
I remember it was mentioned in the comic

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,480
that through special processing,

27
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,520
mandrake flowers can be made

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,600
into a hallucinogenic drug,

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,880
called Feini.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,040
It can even serve to

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,000
control the human mind.

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
The Kingdom of Bili

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,600
used it against our army.

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
However,

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,600
it ended up
as a symbol of the power of the nobles.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,240
What if the Ruyi Pavilion planted these?

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,240
Ruyi Pavilion?

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,880
Are they planning

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
to control His Majesty tomorrow?

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,480
Say no more.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,560
Let's gather some to see

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
if they're real mandrake flowers.

43
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,520
Okay.

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,520
Why do you look like a fortune teller?

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,240
Watch out.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,280
Witch.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,480
Are you okay?

48
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm fine.

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,200
Witch.

50
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,560
What's wrong, Witch?

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,480
Zhao Wumian.

52
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Long time no see.

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,760
You discovered our secret.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,560
Then we can't let you live.

55
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,560
She is already trapped

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,440
within the safety zone.

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,880
She can't escape our control.

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,560
Han Zhonggu is in charge

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,080
of the Daoming Court.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
We don't know

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
whether he is a friend.

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,160
That's why I took you here to hide.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,040
I lived here

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,040
while I was chasing drug traffickers.

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,920
Right.

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,680
Miss Lin.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,280
You can't leave

68
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,240
until your poison is removed.

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,320
That's right.

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,680
The poison hasn't matured.

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,200
Once you leave the safe range,

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,400
you'll be in grave danger.

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,520
(Mandrake flower)
This book

74
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,440
says something about mandrake flowers.

75
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,040
Fresh mandrake petals

76
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,360
(can remove all poisons.)

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
(For someone poisoned by
Granny Meng's poisonous wine,)

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,920
(mix mandrake petals)

79
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,400

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,040

82
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480

87
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,920
What's wrong?

88
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,920
Are you fine?

89
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,400
Have the medicine.

Hedgehog.

109
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,560
It's time for taking medicine.

110
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,280
You know what?

111
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,480
I don't hurt anymore.

112
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,000
The conductor has been removed.

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
I know.

114
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,280
My wound doesn't hurt anymore, either.

115
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,840
That's great.

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,400
Right.

117
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
It's the Pinxiang Meeting today.

118
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,360
That's right.

119
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,640
It's probably about to start.

120
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,240
I have to go there

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,240
to stop the Big Dipper Sect.

122
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,840
They want to control

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,760
the emperor with the Feini
made from mandrake flowers.

124
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,880
Take me with you.

125
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,400
No, it's too dangerous.

126
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,960
I can't let you
get hurt again, understand?

127
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,120
But I don't want you to get hurt either.

128
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,760
Right.

129
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
I made this from mandrake flowers.

130
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,640
The ultimate antidote.

131
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,040
It just

132
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,840
doesn't contain my blood.

133
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,760
What do you mean

134
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,440
by that?

135
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,360
It's an ultimate antidote
even without my blood.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,520
But your case was rather special.

137
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,240
I'll take

138
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,440
His Majesty to the hidden chamber

139
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,640
to look for clues.

140
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,680
In that case,

141
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,080
we'll secure the evidence.

142
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,600
Do you remember

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,480
the bet we made before?

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,880
So bold.

145
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,360
Let's see who can find the killer first.

146
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
People have died.

147
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,720
How can we bet on that?

148
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,760
Why? Backing down already?

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,600
How about this?

150
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,400
If you win,

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,960
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

152
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,920
If you lose,

153
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,120
you'll have to do something for me.

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Of course, I remember.

155
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,560
You won that time.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,656
Yeah.

157
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,000
So you have to do as I say.

158
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680

159
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,560
Listen carefully.

From now on, no matter what happens,

161
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,600
we must face it together.

162
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,520
Understand?

00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
