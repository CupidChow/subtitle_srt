(Troubles at Ruyi Pavilion)

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,640
Little Deer, feeling better?

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,920
Turns out everybody's here.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,240
I knew it.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,760
We think alike.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,040
Don't get me wrong.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,640
I came to report to Wumian.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,640
I heard that

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,800
a small imperial feast

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
would be held here in three days

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
for His Majesty to taste Feini

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,240
from the Kingdom of Bili.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,000
They call it the "Pinxiang Meeting".

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,400
What is "Feini"?

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,840
It's nothing special.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
It just makes you happy

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,320
once you consume it.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,120
There you are.

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,080
Madam.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,840
Were you waiting for me?

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,760
One day, you'll understand.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
I've seen this before.

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,880
Can it take me back?

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,360
Once the four great constables are dead,

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
you can go back.

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,832
No.

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
We can't let them die.

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,320
Actually,

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,560
many things

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,720
are destined.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,440
I don't believe it.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,200
Man can conquer fate.

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,840
Tingyu.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,880
Lusheng.

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,520
Don't rush.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,480
Take your time.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,880
How long have I been asleep?

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,320
For two days.

52
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,160
Two days?

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
Lusheng.

54
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
Are you alright?

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,960
What is that?

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm cultivating potatoes

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,840
with natural magnets
to provide energy for this mirror.

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,360
You're so smart, Tingyu.

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
How did you know
my tablet ran out of power?

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,400
That's great.

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,600
(The comic story)

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,200
(is following my lead now.)

63
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,120
(I think I remember
the murderer of Ruyi Pavilion now.)

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,880
Miss Lin.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,000
You woke up.

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,120
Little Deer, you woke up.

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,840
Witch...

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,160
That's him.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,040
This is...

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,080
The murderer of the Ruyi Pavilion.

71
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,840
Someone died here?

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, and it's dangerous.

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
I've seen this man.

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,800
The Master of Poisons back in the day.

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,640
The Big Dipper Sect

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,520
saved him during the arrest.

77
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,200
Then how did he end up here?

78
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
I just noticed that

79
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,800
Tang Bocheng was limping
and he was a skilled

80
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,440
martial artist.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
I may not know

82
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,320
his tie with the Master of Poisons.

83
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,960
But he's nothing ordinary.

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,120
But,

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,120
the Master of Poisons
doesn't look like Tang Bocheng at all.

86
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,840
Lusheng.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,360
The three of them have been
cooking for you every day.

88
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,320
You were in a coma,

89
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,640
but they wouldn't let me eat.

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,640
I finally got to try these.

91
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
Anyway, I have three meals a day.

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,520
I don't care about

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,800
making some extra
for someone else, right?

94
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,560
Let's eat together.

95
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay.

96
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
Thank you.

97
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,680
Try this.

98
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,200
This.

99
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,720
Have mine when it's still warm.

100
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,800
Dig in.

101
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,440
Qiu Shisanniang.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,800
The sect does not
wish to complicate matters.

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,840
But you openly oppose us.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Aren't you scared...?

105
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,120
What a coincidence.

106
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,280
I've changed my mind again.

107
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm looking forward
to the Pinxiang Meeting.

108
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,920
(Ruyi Pavilion)

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,440
Fengyi, Tingyu, and I will keep

110
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,120
working on the Daoming Court case

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,640
and look for our leader.

112
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,000
Tang Bocheng is somewhat strange.

113
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,880
It's also weird

114
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,600
that Mo Shanghua
is disguised as Qiu Shisanniang.

115
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,080
I suspect

116
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,600
it's related to the Big Dipper Sect.

117
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,480
But without evidence,

118
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,400
we must not act rashly.

119
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,440
Wumian.

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,160
You have just recovered.

121
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,040
And Little Deer

122
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,760
has to stay to recover.

123
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,280
How about

124
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,120
we take down
Tang Bocheng and Mo Shanghua?

125
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Let's hold our forces

126
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,200
and don't alert them.

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,560
I think

128
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,360
they're up to something bigger.

129
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,080
Let me look into it.

130
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,400
But it's dangerous for you to stay here.

131
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,320
They may

132
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,440
act carelessly just because they think

133
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,920
I haven't recovered.

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,080
Given my current condition,

135
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
you don't have to worry.

136
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,240
Find our leader first.

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,960
Didn't Commander Han

138
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,520
say he would investigate
the Daoming Court case alone

139
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,000
and no one shall intervene?

140
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,640
What is going on?

141
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,600
You've been

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,600
evading my questions these days.

143
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,760
If I weren't injured,

144
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,880
I would punish you severely.

145
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,080
Wumian.

146
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,240
Han Zhonggu is in charge
of the investigation

147
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,160
of Daoming Court right now.

148
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
Then you should stop asking.

149
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,800
None of us

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
can afford to mess with this person.

151
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
How come it's you people?

152
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,560
What do you mean?

153
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,120
His Majesty assigned it to us.

154
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
You think we want this task?

155
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
How come your father's token

156
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,760
was found on our leader's chair?

157
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
Token?

158
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,000
Zhao Wumian.

159
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,280
Have you been out of your mind?

160
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
You think my father killed our leader

161
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
and destroyed the Daoming Court?

162
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,880
Enough.

163
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,720
Everyone, calm down.

164
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,480
Someone is driving a wedge between us.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,720
I know

166
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,520
you've always looked down on my family,

167
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,200
thinking that

168
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,960
I can't do anything without my family.

169
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,480
Little Deer is right.

170
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,160
You are a hedgehog,
a cold-blooded creature.

171
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,160
Come here.

172
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,920
Don't get pricked by the hedgehog.

173
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,800
Let go.

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
That's enough.

175
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,160
No more angry talks.

176
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,000
We still have a case of Daoming Court
to work on.

177
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,160
Yeah.

178
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,240
That's what matters.

179
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
We can talk about the Little Deer

180
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,960
and the Hedgehog later.

181
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay?

182
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,440
That wasn't angry talk.

183
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,680
You are a cold-blooded creature.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Do you also hate it

185
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,600
when he calls you Little Deer?

186
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,640
No.

187
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,000
It's just that he pulled me over

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,480
as if I was an object

189
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,240
that could be snatched.

190
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
Sorry about that.

191
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,240
I overlooked your feelings.

192
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,600
It's okay.

193
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,520
The breakfast was nice.

194
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:16,920
Oh, right.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have

196
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,560
some cached chapters on my tablet.

197
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
There's no internet.

198
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
But I still found some clues.

199
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
This mirror...

200
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,920
What have you found?

201
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,600
There's a place
called the Sutra Pavilion

202
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,680
where the patients of Ruyi Pavilion
rest and seek joy.

203
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,240
The comic says

204
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
that this place holds many clues.

205
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:48,607
♪Who is admiring
their own solitary elegance♪

206
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:54,335
♪Strolling leisurely in the courtyard♪

207
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:59,423
♪Dust adheres to the brick walls♪

208
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:05,983
♪So stubborn, can't bear to collide♪

209
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:11,679
♪Who weaves garments
of feathers and rainbow silks♪

210
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:17,567
♪Contented with oneself
amidst the chaotic world♪

211
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:22,719
♪Who lets the lonely petals fall♪

212
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:30,623
♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

213
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:35,615
♪The bloom of the gardenia,
oh so fleeting♪

214
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:41,311
♪Thinking of the songs
and the sighs of the parted♪
