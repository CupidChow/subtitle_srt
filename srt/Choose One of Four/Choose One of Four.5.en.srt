(Enter the Dark Capital)

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,240
Since its establishment
by Shangguan Yunxiao,

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,960
it has solved many bizarre

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,360
and major cases.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,040
Among Shangguan Yunxiao's

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,040
48 disciples,

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,760
four stand out from the rest.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,000
Three years ago,

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,560
they solved the royal family's
Hat Demon case.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,560
First, the youngest one, Shi Tingyu,

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,680
the youngest second top genius
of Tianshan Academy,

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,640
declined high-ranking official positions

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,400
and chose to be a disciple
of Shangguan Yunxiao.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,320
At Daoming Court,

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,760
he can access wrongful cases
over the last hundred years,

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,240
safeguarding civilians.

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,520
His martial arts are average,

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,600
but at 18, he understood
the Hat Demon case's truth

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,520
and immediately protected the Emperor.

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,120
During the Hat Demon case,

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
This constable
with top martial art skills

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,960
fended off many enemies alone.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,720
It's said that he used to guard

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,160
the border with troops,

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,520
killing enemies in an instant,

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,160
(Loyalty to the Nation)
without leaving any trace.

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,880
Beloved by the troops,

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,440
he declined the General's promotion

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,880
and came to assist his foster father,
Shangguan Yunxiao

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,240
to fully eradicate the Big Dipper Sect.

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,280
Mr. Han, born into a prestigious family,

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
is the son of Han Zhonggu,
the Commander.

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,920
His martial techniques are great.

47
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,240
He used to be idle,

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,760
and now becomes a formidable figure.

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,680
What even troubles the Commander is

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,600
he doesn't want
to follow his father's path.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,240
Our lead role is here.

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Zhishui was once a hero
with unparalleled swordsmanship.

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,560
After a fight with Zhao Wumian,

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,920
he was introduced by Zhao Wumian
to join the Daoming Court.

55
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,600
During the Hat Demon case,

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
he persuaded Shangguan Yunxiao
to change the strategy

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,440
and also convinced Han Fengyi
to win his father's trust,

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,960
so the case was eventually solved.

59
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,240
The four were bestowed
as the Four Great Constables.

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,400
Their ranking is,

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,040
Zhao Wumian, Eldest Senior.

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,040
Zhishui, Second Senior.

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,960
Han Fengyi, Third Senior.

64
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,160
And Tingyu, the youngest.

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,000
They are known as

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
the Four Great Constables,

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
specializing in tackling bizarre cases
like Big Dipper Demon.

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
- Trust us.
- Trust us.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,040
Trust us.

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,800
I trust you.

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,680
Please.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,240
Please save me and my family.

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,080
You get up first.

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,040
You get up first.

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,648
Come on.

76
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:24,840
Get up first.

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,480
Trust me.

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,480
I will definitely protect you.

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,200
Thank you.

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,160
I've had a really hard time.

81
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,760
I just want to live on.

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,160
It's like a never-ending nightmare.

83
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,120
Rest assured.

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,440
I will definitely protect you.

85
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,280
And your life will get back to normal.

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,840
(It seems
I've found the evidence first.)

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
(Hedgehog, you are sure to lose.)

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,880
(Tingyu will be okay then.)

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,320
Thank you.

90
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,880
I trust you.

91
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,920
I will tell you everything I know.

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,560
Okay.

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,072
Okay.

94
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,240
I know it all.

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,280
Well, you tell them everything.

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,240
Come on, follow me.

97
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,400
Okay, let's go.

98
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,880
How are you? Are you okay?

99
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,080
I...

100
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,280
I might not make it.

101
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,280
I can't help you.

102
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,480
Thank you.

103
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,160
No.

104
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,920
I'll take you out.

105
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,880
Come on.

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,600
I can also be freed.

107
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Hurry up.

108
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,880
(You trust me.)

109
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,320
(I've read the entire comic series.)

110
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,840
(I know everything.)

111
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,640
Both of my mentors have already died.

112
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,640
My best friend has also...

113
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Trust us.

114
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,240
Miss Lin.

115
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
Are you okay?

116
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
I just promised her

117
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,680
to protect her.

118
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,680
I definitely will.

119
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
Her name is Chen Shenmao.

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
She's a living person.

121
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
She is a person.

122
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,440
She's a living person.

123
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
I trust you.

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,640
I will tell you

125
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,800
everything I know.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,360
It's the Green Crystal.

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,760
Chen Shenmao said...

128
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,840
She said

129
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
some people were poisoned.

130
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,360
It's the Green Crystal

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,600
and some...

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,560
Some kind of special vessel.

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Right.

134
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,560
Right.

135
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,472
Right.

136
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,560
The reason everyone died together

137
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,320
must be because of this poison.

138
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,640
And the antidote

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,920
and poison have the same origin.

140
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,320
Both antidote and poison were

141
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,480
made with Green Crystal
on the Guinie Vessel.

142
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,640
Exactly.

143
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
Antidote and poison
have the same origin.

144
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
If we can find it,

145
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,960
we will save many people.

146
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,560
These things are

147
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,720
exclusive to Dark Capital.

148
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,920
But this place is extremely dangerous.

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,120
Few have visited.

150
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm familiar with Dark Capital.

151
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,400
It feels like my home there.

152
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
There are so many fun places.

153
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
The funniest thing is

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,720
once the sun sets,

155
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,280
you can't find the entrance.

156
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
Let's set off now.

157
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
Miss Lin.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,760
I think you should take a rest.

159
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,200
But I...

160
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
Have you ever thought about

161
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,480
this person's death

162
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,200
is completely due to
your selfish desire to win?

163
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
Don't do things beyond your ability.

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,720
Wumian.

165
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
It is already late.

166
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,400
The situation is urgent.

167
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,480
Set off for the Dark Capital.

168
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
Yes.

169
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,520
Sorry.

170
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,160
I oversimplified the situation.

171
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,200
Take me to the Dark Capital.

172
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,440
Following this clue,

173
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,840
we can save many people.

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,680
Please trust me one last time.

175
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,560
Okay?

176
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Then let's go.

177
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Okay.

178
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,560
No.

179
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,520
Zhishui and Tingyu can't go.

180
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,680
You will be seriously injured
in this chapter.

181
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,600
Witch.

182
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,480
You'll never learn.

183
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,600
Wumian.

184
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,520
Some situations at Tianshan Academy
need to be investigated.

185
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,680
Maybe

186
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,960
I should stay with Zhishui

187
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,520
to handle the situations.

188
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,080
Wumian.

189
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,640
Then I will stay with Tingyu.

190
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,560
It'd be safer

191
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,520
with me by his side.

192
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,760
Alright.

193
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Zhishui and Tingyu will stay.

194
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,880
I, Fengyi

195
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,800
and this witch

196
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,120
set off now.

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440
(So this is the Dark Capital.)

198
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,000
(It's always been mentioned
in the comics,)

199
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,520
(but I have never seen it.)

200
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,560
Just as I imagined,

201
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,360
they have entered the Dark Capital.

202
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,000
But,

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,840
a strange woman is following them.

204
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,480
It doesn't matter.

205
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,240
She doesn't know martial arts,

206
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,080
and can't stir up trouble.

207
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,720
We must capture Zhao Wumian

208
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,040
at this place.

209
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:14,207
♪Who is admiring
their own solitary elegance♪

210
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:19,935
♪Strolling leisurely in the courtyard♪

211
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:25,023
♪Dust adheres to the brick walls♪

212
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:31,583
♪So stubborn, can't bear to collide♪

213
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:37,279
♪Who weaves garments
of feathers and rainbow silks♪

214
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,167
♪Contented with oneself
amidst the chaotic world♪

215
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,319
♪Who lets the lonely petals fall♪

216
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:56,223
♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

217
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:01,215
♪The bloom of the gardenia,
oh so fleeting♪

218
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:06,911
♪Thinking of the songs
and the sighs of the parted♪
