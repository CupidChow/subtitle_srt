(The Comics Have Changed!)

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,440
The young lady
who likes to talk nonsense.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,400
Come on.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,760
Come to me

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,800
and prove you are the eighth member.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,600
Mr. Shi.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,000
You have lost

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,440
this game.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
Mr. Xu.

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,280
Well played.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,080
You pretended

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,680
to be targeting my pieces

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,640
in the center of the board.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,800
But in reality,

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,120
you won the game by taking my pieces

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,720
on the edge of the board.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,680
I had the chance to win

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,600
because you made a few mistakes.

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,760
Isn't it a bit too late

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
to finally realize it now?

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
No one can make sure

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,880
that every step they take is correct.

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,120
But it's never too late

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
to pull back.

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,560
I detest young ladies
who spout nonsense.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,360
(Oh no.)

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,760
(It's totally different)

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,040
(from the plot of the comics.)

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,464
(Why would Yun Zhishui
come to Zuisheng House?)

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
What's wrong?

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,480
Our eighth member.

45
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,960
Be quiet. I am thinking.

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,440
Xu Zhenqing.

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,000
Xu Huaishi.

48
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,160
You are

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,360
immensely talented

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,520
and were one of the candidates
recommended to the imperial court.

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,360
However,

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
someone with connections
took your place.

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,680
Coming from humble origins,

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
you saw the gap between classes

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,400
and adopted the name Xu Zhenqing

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
to be a mentor at the academy.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Am I right?

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,600
How did you know

59
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,320
I went by the name Xu Huaishi

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,120
and not my real name?

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,120
I also know

62
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,080
that you took advantage of your position

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,920
to deceive the students
with the Big Dipper Mysteries,

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,960
so that they submit

65
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,040
to the Big Dipper Demon you've created

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,640
as fervent disciples.

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,680
Then

68
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
you controlled them.

69
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,160
Then...

70
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,000
Am I right?

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,040
It seems like you know too much.

72
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,200
Witch.

73
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,000
B-But Master Xu,

74
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,120
you were too careless.

75
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,880
The Guinie Vessel
ended up on the black market.

76
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,000
If I hadn't followed Zhao Wumian there,

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
it would have significantly

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
hindered the plan.

79
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,160
Also,

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
if our leader finds out,

81
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,880
can you bear the consequences?

82
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,240
In that case,

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,240
let me kill Zhao Wumian

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
to cut off the lead.

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,920
I will explain it

86
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,040
to our leader.

87
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Now,

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,880
come over here.

89
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,680
Right and wrong

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,040
are not absolute,

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,920
but relative.

92
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,560
Right and wrong may not be absolute.

93
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,520
But murder and arson
are definitely wrong.

94
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,440
Then how do you define
what His Majesty did

95
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
back in the day?

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,200
There is no right and wrong.

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,040
Nor is there fairness.

98
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,120
Only victory matters.

99
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,960
Just like in this game.

100
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,240
(What?)

101
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
(Brilliant move.)

102
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,080
(The counterattack is incredible.)

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,520
(Now it seems...)

104
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,880
Senior.

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,440
Life is not just about winning.

106
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Right and wrong matters.

107
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,200
Your first 20 moves

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,800
were very upright.

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,240
But from the 21st move,

110
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,240
you became hasty and result-driven.

111
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,440
You lost your pace

112
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,360
and ended up entrapped.

113
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,720
I only conceded three pieces to you

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,960
to lure you

115
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
into the deadly trap.

116
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,392
I...

117
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,320
I just want to live.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,880
I can't help you.

119
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,520
Come with me.

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,440
I'll be free.

121
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,360
Go.

122
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,400
Trust me.

123
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,480
Lusheng.

124
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
Note this.

125
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,920
After one hour,

126
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,720
she will still die.

127
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,000
(It's hard to imagine)

128
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,200
(what it's like)

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,040
(to die in a comic series.)

130
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,800
A genius is always a genius.

131
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
No matter how much we try,

132
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,240
we can't catch up.

133
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,760
We are of different ages.

134
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,080
But fate brought us to meet

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,120
at Tianshan Academy years ago.

136
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,880
Back then, we studied during the day

137
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,760
and played chess after sunset,

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,360
discussing our ideals with passion.

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,640
But you ranked second

140
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,360
in the imperial exam within two years.

141
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,080
And it took me

142
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,600
a full 11 years.

143
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,400
Do you know how I feel?

144
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,520
This is not a reason
for you to kill our masters.

145
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Mr. Shi.

146
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Tingyu.

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,760
I really don't want to kill you.

148
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,920
But today, my task

149
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,320
is to take your life.

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,520
I hope

151
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,080
you don't blame me.

152
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,520
The young lady
who likes to talk nonsense.

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,760
Leave Zhao Wumian alone for now.

154
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,320
He is part of my plan.

155
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,960
I am persuading him

156
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,600
to join us.

157
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,400
Got it.

158
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,760
Let's go.

159
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
Leave everything to Miss Lin.

160
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,960
It was my younger brother

161
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,200
who told me to take advantage
of my position.

162
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,760
He made me write
the Big Dipper Mysteries

163
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,440
to deceive the students

164
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,480
and make them our fervent followers.

165
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,840
Then

166
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,120
we delivered them to the court

167
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,320
to control

168
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,440
the people and the court.

169
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,360
That's enough.

170
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
Thank you.

171
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,280
Mr. Xu.

172
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
I can reunite

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,080
with our masters now.

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,640
Alright, as you wish.

175
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,120
Oh, right.

176
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,560
By now, Shi Tingyu and Yun Zhishui

177
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,640
should have been killed

178
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,720
at Tianshan Academy.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
And Han Fengyi

180
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,960
must be cornered at the casino

181
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,680
in the Dark Capital.

182
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,160
In Qixi this year,

183
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,080
we will be able to make

184
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,040
the entire Beichao

185
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,120
perish.

186
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,960
Zhao Wumian.

187
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,760
You

188
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,240
will die at Qixi.

189
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,640
Qixi...

190
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
Make the entire Beichao

191
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,560
perish.

192
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,280
Wait.

193
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,280
You smashed my tables

194
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,000
and scared away my guests

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,760
because of your disputes.

196
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,520
How can you just leave like that?

197
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:52,703
♪Who is admiring
their own solitary elegance♪

198
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:58,431
♪Strolling leisurely in the courtyard♪

199
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:03,519
♪Dust adheres to the brick walls♪

200
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,079
♪So stubborn, can't bear to collide♪

201
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,775
♪Who weaves garments
of feathers and rainbow silks♪

202
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:21,663
♪Contented with oneself
amidst the chaotic world♪

203
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:26,815
♪Who lets the lonely petals fall♪

204
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:34,719
♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

205
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:39,711
♪The bloom of the gardenia,
oh so fleeting♪

206
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:45,407
♪Thinking of the songs
and the sighs of the parted♪
