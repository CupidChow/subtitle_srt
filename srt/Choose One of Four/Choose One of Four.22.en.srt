(I came back six hours
before the update.)

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,720
Hurry up and paint.

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,560
Upload it once you're done.

64
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,760
I'm working on it.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
(Shangguan Yunxiao?)

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
But Mr. Shangguan,

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,760
this thing on my shoulder

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,520
affects my efficiency.

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,760
Okay.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,240
(I don't know what went wrong.)

72
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,840
(But I think it's my only chance.)

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,240
(Hedgehog, wait for me.)

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,520
(Why is Shangguan Yunxiao here?)

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,080
(Did he leap here with me?)

76
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,240
(No way.)

77
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,440
(The last volume is not out yet.)

78
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,040
(And I fell into the Comic World
after the update.)

79
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,480
(So Shangguan Yunxiao came earlier)

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
(and forced the comic artist to kill
the four great constables.)

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Mr. Shangguan, take a look.

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,040
I've almost finished the comic

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,240
as you said.

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,720
Very good.

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,680
Then everything falls into place for me.

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,320
Who is it?

87
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,360
Who are you?

88
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,320
(Great.)

89
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,720
(He doesn't know me yet.)

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,680
(Let me show you the ruthless society)

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
(and modern technology.)

92
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,440
I'm applying to be the concept artist.

93
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
Concept artist?

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Yeah, to do the drawings.

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
Can you really draw?

96
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,560
Of course.

97
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,280
That's why I'm here.

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,360
Go away.

99
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
Let her draw.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,560
What do you want me to draw?

101
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,760
Have a look for yourself.

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,760
Lin Lusheng.

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,640
You think I don't recognize you?

104
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,520
So, you're from this world.

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,080
No wonder you know everything.

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,600
Yun Zhishui.

107
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,200
Little Deer.

108
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,160
What happened?

109
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,800
What have you done?

110
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,600
I drew a portal for the four of them.

111
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,920
How dare you?

112
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,480
What else did you do?

113
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,560
I also drew a plot for you
to return to the Comic World.

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
What?

115
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Where is Zhao Wumian?

116
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,520
I'm sorry, Witch.

117
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm late.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,480
It's over now.

119
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,000
It's over now.

120
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,040
Miss Lin Lusheng.

121
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,600
Why are the books here
different from ours?

122
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,800
There are many things you haven't seen.

123
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Have fun here.

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,160
Where are we?

125
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,040
You're in our world.

126
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,040
I told you I wasn't a witch.

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,880
It's really different.

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,200
And what is this?

129
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,360
What is this?

130
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
Interesting.

131
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,960
Knowing that you're a comic character

132
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,920
must be hard on you.

133
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,120
My juniors.

134
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,360
It's getting late.

135
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,440
Let's get going.

136
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Can't you stay here?

137
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,800
I...

138
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't belong to this world.

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,640
But I don't belong
to your world, either.

140
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,680
We can't stay just yet.

141
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
We have unfinished business.

142
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Well...

143
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
There's a power outage.

144
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,200
It might take a few days to fix.

145
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Why don't you

146
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,680
rest here for now?

147
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,480
What do you say?

148
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,560
Alright then.

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
It seems

150
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,360
that we have to stay for a few days.

151
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,800

152
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,320
