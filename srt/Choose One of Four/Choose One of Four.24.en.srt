I'll meet Lusheng's parents tomorrow

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,800

not this world.

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,960
So

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,760
why don't we all stay here?

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,120
this is abrupt.

Shangguan Yunxiao
organized an uprising in your name

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,600
and disguised
the comic artist as His Majesty

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,920
to pacify the uprising.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,520
The previous reign and supporters

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,080
will join force with the Kingdom of Bili

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,080
and attack the capital tomorrow.

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,600
