(The Dangerous Mo Shanghua)

00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,240
Wait.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,920
You smashed my tables

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,640
and scared away my guests

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,400
because of your disputes.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,280
How can you just leave like that?

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Alright, Mr. Xu.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,360
Can you let me die without regret?

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
Tingyu.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,040
Do you have any unfulfilled wishes?

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,240
Distinguished officials
surround His Majesty.

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,480
Senior.

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,920
Could you help me with the next line?

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,480
Distinguished officials
surround His Majesty.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
Excellent governance
pleases the ministers.

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,440
Mr. Xu.

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,960
What a great verse.

31
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,840
You are truly talented.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,800
Do you still remember
what you wrote back then?

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,720
No, I don't.

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,920
You wrote,

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,880
"A humble scholar laments his fall."

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,960
Your verse

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,760
revealed the suffering and helplessness
of the common people.

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,360
I gave up a high position

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,920
and chose to work on the frontline

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,880
because of this verse of yours.

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,320
I did that to pursue fairness.

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
Does anyone

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560
have a chance in this world?

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,200
In this world,

45
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,520
we can always create chances.

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,360
As long as you are willing to try,

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,960
you will always have opportunities.

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,520
Mr. Xu.

49
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
The people you are harming now

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,040
are your former selves.

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,360
Why?

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,800
Why could you bear
to hurt our two revered masters?

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,880
Why?

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,760
How am I not

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,480
grateful

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,000
to our masters?

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,800
It was my twin brother

58
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,840
who took their lives.

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,200
He is one of the seven leaders
of the Big Dipper Sect.

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,680
We worked together,

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,280
one in the open, one in secret.

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,160
When I first

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,080
saw that book,

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,320
the style of play reminded me of you.

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,320
But you are the last person

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,720
I hope it will be.

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,640
Mr. Xu.

68
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
You have suffered so much.

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,480
What game

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
are you really playing?

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,160
It was my younger brother

72
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,400
who told me to take advantage
of my position.

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,960
He made me write
the Big Dipper Mysteries

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,640
to deceive the students

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,680
and make them our fervent followers.

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,040
Then

77
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,320
we delivered them to the court

78
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,520
to control

79
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,640
the people and the court.

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,560
That's enough.

81
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,440
Thank you.

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
Mr. Xu.

83
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,360
I can reunite

84
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
with our masters now.

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,840
Alright, as you wish.

86
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,680
Please forgive me

87
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,840
for not welcoming you properly.

88
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,720
This woman

89
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,280
is the Yaksha

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,360
of the Dark Capital.

91
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,240
Mo Shanghua.

92
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,720
She runs
the biggest intelligence network.

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,840
She is ten times

94
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
more powerful than Master Xu.

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,600
And we have all the big shots here.

96
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,640
The top martial artist, Zhao Wumian.

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,400
One of the highest bounties,
Six Evils of Jiangnan.

98
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,880
And two leading members
of the Big Dipper Sect.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,760
Come on.

100
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,160
Let me entertain you.

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,800
Keep the show running.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,160
I am the eighth member
of the Big Dipper Sect.

103
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
Greetings, Yaksha of the Dark Capital,

104
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,160
Miss Mo.

105
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,360
I bet your Zuisheng House

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
is the largest intelligence hub, right?

107
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,840
My Zuisheng House

108
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,320
is merely a place for seeking joy.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
It's just that we have many guests

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,400
and end up hearing many bizarre tales.

111
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
What intelligence hub
are you talking about?

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,400
What a coincidence.

113
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,040
A high-ranking official
came a few days ago,

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,600
claiming to be the head
of the Military Grand Council.

115
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,800
He asked for the best dishes
here as a treat.

116
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,120
I wonder

117
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,600
how the head
of the Military Grand Council

118
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,920
can reveal his identity

119
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,760
so casually.

120
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,520
Just as expected,

121
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,200
he was merely a charlatan
from outside the city.

122
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,920
What a pair of star-crossed lovers.

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,600
One is about to die from Granny Meng's

124
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
poisonous wine.

125
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,480
The other had been poisoned
with Beisu Qingfeng Powder

126
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,920
and had little prowess left.

127
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,400
It's truly amazing.

128
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,600
You're suffering from
such dangerous poisons.

129
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,000
Then my tables and guests...

130
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,160
Never mind.

131
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
You are about to die.

132
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Be gone with the wind.

133
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,200
Please forgive me.

134
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,680
I'm afraid you have to leave.

135
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
They might not be able to leave.

136
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Take a look.

137
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,120
Shangguan Yunxiao.

138
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,240
Daoming Court has been annihilated.

139
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
What a pity.

140
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,720
Our only semi-finished Tiangu Vessel

141
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,480
Chen Shenmao

142
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,400
are dead.

143
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
Informants reported

144
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,760
that the strange girl

145
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
had Granny Meng's poisonous wine

146
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
at Madam Murong's place.

147
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,320
Surprisingly,

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
she absorbed the wine

149
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,640
and survived

150
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,760
for two hours.

151
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,680
Capture her alive.

152
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,800
What exactly do you want?

153
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,840
Also,

154
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,760
what did you do to Zhishui

155
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,520
on the second floor?

156
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,640
No wonder Mo Qijin
is so interested in you

157
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,160
and told me to leave you alone.

158
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,800
What an interesting girl.

159
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,760
Who is Mo Qijin?

160
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,800
It was his childhood name.

161
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,880
Are you childhood sweethearts?

162
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,640
Perhaps we were more intimate

163
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,800
than childhood sweethearts.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
You're lying.

165
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,000
It's not in the comics at all.

166
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,400
Oh, right.

167
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,560
Is Zhishui

168
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,080
still up there?

169
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,920
You've managed to be a leader

170
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,080
of the Big Dipper Sect
with all your tricks.

171
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,920
And you still care about love affairs?

172
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,640
What tricks?

173
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,680
You should know it better than anyone.

174
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,520
As a woman,

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,120
it takes a huge effort
to establish yourself

176
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,200
in a dangerous place
like the Dark Capital.

177
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
No one else would understand

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,720
the hardships you've been through.

179
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,640
Well said.

180
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,880
No wonder so many guys like you.

181
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,200
However,

182
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,960
if you've studied the laws
regarding women of Beichao,

183
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,720
you would change your mind.

184
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,400
If you make it out alive,

185
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,920
we can be friends.

186
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,472
You...

187
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,720
Are you okay?

188
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,040
That's really impressive.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,160
He still has

190
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,600
such profound inner strength
when poisoned.

191
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,360
Want trouble with them?

192
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
Over my dead body!

193
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,640
Little Deer.

194
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
You were fine just now.

195
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,720
What happened?

196
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,840
Where have you been, Young Master Han?

197
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
I went to look for something.

198
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,320
Look, the Green Crystal.

199
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,840
Mr. Han.

200
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
I didn't expect

201
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,040
that you would survive.

202
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,040
You've come just in time.

203
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,280
I'll kill all three of you.

204
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:04,000

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,360
Tingyu, I was looking for you...

206
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,360
Tingyu.

207
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,160
Tingyu.

208
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Tingyu.

209
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,320
Tingyu.

210
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,760
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,160
I've come too late.
