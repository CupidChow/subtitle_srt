(Hedgehog, I Swear I Will Save You)

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,360
What...

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,720
Let go of me.

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,560
Let go of me.

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,760
Traitor Zhao Wumian!

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,200
You've always suspected

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,160
Commander Han
of killing your entire family.

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,240
But I didn't expect

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,680
that you'd kill Commander Han
without any evidence

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,280
to incriminate him.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,400
Zhao Wumian.

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
Why did you do this?

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,760
Answer me.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Hedgehog.

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,080
Leave.

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,880
This is a trap.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
It was like this when I arrived.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,840
Let them take me

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,160
into custody and clear my name

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,760
after investigation.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,840
Hedgehog.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,880
Hurry up and tell them.

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,800
You didn't kill Commander Han.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,440
It never happened in the comic.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,760
Hurry up and tell them.

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
The new leader of the Daoming Court

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,120
must be an accomplice.

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,760
Take her into custody too.

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Who dares to touch her?

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,600
She has nothing to do with it.

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,320
That's not up to you

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,680
to decide.

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Fengyi.

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
Take Lusheng away.

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Han Fengyi.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
You guys, go after them.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
Take him away.

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,440
Fengyi.

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
We will do your father justice.

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,120
We'll handle this.

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,000
Give me back my family's token.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,120
You don't deserve it.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,760
So

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
they used Zhao Wumian's grudge
against Han Zhonggu

58
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,760
to get rid of Han Zhonggu

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
and frame Zhao Wumian.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,880
That's right.

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,400
I bet the Big Dipper Sect did this.

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,080
So, what should we do now?

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,480
It's okay.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,760
Miss Lin, don't worry.

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,000
The largest intelligence network

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,960
is already looking for Wumian.

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,000
Miss Lin.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,880
This is my sister.

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,720
Your sister?

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,720
Then

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,560
are you Mo Shanghua or Qiu Shisanniang?

72
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,600
Both

73
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,120
and neither.

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,680
So you are siblings.

75
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,160
At the Zuisheng House, no wonder...

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,840
You are the only one
my little brother cares about.

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,280
Shanghua.

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,040
Miss Lin is the head
of the Daoming Court now.

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,600
Don't speak like that.

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,200
Thank you, Miss Lin,

81
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,480
for earning equality

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,400
and basic rights for women in Beichao.

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,320
This is what we've been doing

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,480
for so many years.

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,720
I should also thank you

86
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,640
for getting me gold and silver,

87
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,200
fine fabrics,
and the retention of my position.

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,000
You should thank Zhishui

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,640
for retaining your position.

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,680
He was ready to

91
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,240
sacrifice himself

92
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,080
to protect you.

93
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,360
And I think he's been

94
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,960
striving hard to make sure

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,640
you live in peace.

96
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,400
That was a rare opportunity.

97
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
At that moment,

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
many possibilities came to my mind.

99
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,360
But our parents were beaten to death

100
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,520
on the street

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,080
when my brother

102
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,920
was merely seven years old.

103
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,480
We were sold

104
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,800
to the Zuisheng House to do odd jobs.

105
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,360
I've faced the darkest
and filthiest side of the world

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
all by myself.

107
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,680
I hope Qijin

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,440
can preserve his innocence.

109
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
I fully understand your predicament.

110
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,240
But now you are both wanted criminals.

111
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,200
And Hedgehog is...

112
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
He's missing.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,800
Miss Lin.

114
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,000
I have good news.

115
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,080
I know

116
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,040
where Zhao Wumian is locked up.

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Really?

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
Leader?

119
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,840
Wumian.

120
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,120
Long time no see.

121
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm sorry to have kept you in the dark.

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,920
You are the leader
of the Big Dipper Sect

123
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,560
and the Daoming Court,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,760
Shangguan Yunxiao?

125
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,800
I know

126
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,440
you might find it
hard to accept for now.

127
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
Let me explain it to you.

128
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Tingyu.

129
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,120
Fengyi.

130
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,080
What brings you here so late at night?

131
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,760
Wait.

132
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
I-I'm a bit confused.

133
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,720
But

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
isn't he Xu Zhenqing?

135
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,280
I was the top scorer
of the imperial exam.

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,720
Unfortunately,
I was born into a humble family

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,560
and couldn't get promoted.

138
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,640
His Majesty indulged

139
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,280
in debauchery and tyranny.

140
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,440
People with aspirations

141
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,040
had problems with him.

142
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,120
Under a twist of fate,

143
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,000
I established the Big Dipper Sect.

144
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,320
Therefore,

145
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
the court allocated funds
to Shangguan Yunxiao

146
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,840
to establish the Daoming Court
against the Big Dipper Sect.

147
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,840
Slowly, I convinced some court officials

148
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
to join the Big Dipper Sect,

149
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,040
including the twin brothers
from Tianshan Academy,

150
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,920
Commander Han Zhonggu, and so on.

151
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,560
They all provided much financial support

152
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,080
and resources for the Big Dipper Sect.

153
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,440
Then why

154
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,440
did you kill Han Zhonggu?

155
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,320
Because

156
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,360
he wavered during

157
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,120
the Pinxiang Meeting.

158
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,320
If he hadn't wavered,

159
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,360
I would have

160
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,080
shown up

161
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,720
at the critical moment
to save His Majesty.

162
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,720
Then I'd have control over the court.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,400
After that, I could

164
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,360
overthrow the court.

165
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,720
Then why

166
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,440
did you adopt me?

167
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Because

168
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,680
Zhao Wumian is

169
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,960
the only

170
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,000
surviving prince of the former reign.

171
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,400
What?

172
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,680
- Wumian is a prince?
- Wumian is a prince?

173
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,120
This is the last card
up Shangguan Yunxiao's sleeve.

174
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,520
In the end,

175
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,240
he will play this last card

176
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,120
to rightfully ascend the throne.

177
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,920
Wait, I'm even more confused now.

178
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,520
Many ministers from the former reign

179
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,600
have been eager to restore the reign.

180
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,080
Besides,

181
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,400
as everyone knows,

182
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,280
the Kingdom of Bili only recognizes
our former reign.

183
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,400
In the end,

184
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,040
you will kill every member
of the Big Dipper Sect

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,080
to vindicate yourself.

186
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,560
Of course.

187
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,040
Everyone in the Daoming Court

188
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,440
will rise to great heights.

189
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,800
So you killed

190
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
my whole family?

191
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,760
That's right.

192
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,760
Shangguan Yunxiao

193
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,680
killed Zhao Wumian's entire family.

194
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,040
What?

195
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,600
Actually,

196
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,520
His Majesty had no such intention.

197
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,480
He only wanted

198
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,480
your father to expel them
from the kingdom.

199
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,760
However,

200
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,480
to damage His Majesty's image

201
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,560
and gain support

202
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,720
from the ministers of the former reign,

203
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,000
Shangguan Yunxiao

204
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,520
took a step ahead

205
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,760
to kill everyone

206
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,360
in the Zhao family

207
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,960
except for Zhao Wumian.

208
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,840
My father was a member

209
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,360
of the Big Dipper Sect?

210
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
Not really.

211
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,200
He just provided financial support.

212
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,040
And the Big Dipper Sect

213
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,120
helped him advance smoothly
in the official ranks.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,560
It was a win-win situation.

215
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,800
Why did you stage your disappearance?

216
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,440
Because His Majesty

217
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,520
almost found out

218
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,360
that Hong Qitian was me.

219
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,920
So I had to make my move

220
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,320
before he got to me.

221
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,080
We almost

222
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,240
got to Shangguan Yunxiao.

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
However,

224
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,640
he disappeared at the critical moment.

225
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,360
The Big Dipper Sect
remains the biggest problem.

226
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,920
So what do you want me to do?

227
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,360
Father?

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,440
I want you to ascend the throne.

229
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:29,439
♪Who is admiring
their own solitary elegance♪

230
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:35,167

♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

237
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:16,447
♪The bloom of the gardenia,
oh so fleeting♪

238

♪Thinking of the songs
and the sighs of the parted♪
