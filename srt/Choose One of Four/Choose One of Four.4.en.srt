Xu Zhenqing?

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,760
I swear it wasn't me.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,760
It was you.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,360
I've said it many times.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,320
It wasn't me.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
And I said the mastermind was you.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,520
Miss, do you have

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,520
any misunderstanding about me?

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,440
Your Excellencies,

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,240
why not join me for tea?

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,720
I will certainly tell you

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,760
everything I know.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,240
Besides,

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,680
Mr. Shi is my dear friend
from years of study.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,200
I will certainly not hide anything.

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,800
May I ask

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,240
what you usually drink?

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,680
Mainly bubble tea and lemon tea.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,760
What did she say?

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,760
Miss.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,680
We may not have bubble tea or lemon tea,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,720
but

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,040
our Pu'er should be quite good.

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,400
What's wrong?

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Are you afraid it's poisoned?

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
After we finish the tea,

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,880
please turn yourself in, Master Xu.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,280
Anyway, you'll be put in jail

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,520
after this chapter.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,760
Master Xu.

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,120
Please don't mind her.

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,080
Miss Lin likes to joke around.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,720
Miss Lin.

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,160
One can't make claims

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,040
without evidence.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,760
(Evidence.)

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,000
(I think I have
downloaded some chapters.)

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,920
Your Excellencies,

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
to be honest,

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,560
many students read the book and believed

55
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,640
that the Big Dipper Demon
could grant them success,

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,240
and thus carried out the rituals,

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,720
hoping that the Big Dipper Demon
would descend upon them.

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,760
Some even

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,640
went to the extent of madness.

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,840
We are deeply troubled.

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,840
Your Excellencies,

62
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
I implore you

63
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,360
to conduct

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,880
a thorough

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,320
investigation.

66
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,160
(Once I open the comic,)

67
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,320
(I will find the evidence.)

68
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,280
(Sneaky rascal.)

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,520
(I advise you to be nice.)

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,960
(If you dare to hurt Shi Tingyu,)

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,120
(I won't let you off.)

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
Miss Lin.

73
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,600
Your mirror looks quite unique.

74
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,200
I'd like to use the bathroom.

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
B-Bathroom.

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,160
We might have to get

77
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,240
water from

78
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,560
the southern river
or the northern creek to have a bath.

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
I mean,

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,880
the outhouse.

81
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,720
The outhouse?

82
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Head out and go straight.

83
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
(Why can't I find that chapter anymore?)

84
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,960
(I only focused on
the sweet romance parts)

85
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,760
(and forgot all about the cases.)

86
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,640
(Where is it?)

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,280
How did I become a comic character?

88
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,400
No way.

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,720
Oh no.

90
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,640
Am I stuck here?

91
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,640
No way, Lin Lusheng.

92
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,200
Calm down.

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,880
Yeah.

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,280
Firstly, ensure Tingyu's safety.

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,920
I remember this case...

96
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,480
In the west chamber,

97
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,600
he has an apprentice
who binds and stores books

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,680
called Chen Maosheng.

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
No, Chen Shenmao.

100
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,160
S-She is the key clue in this case.

101
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,080
Once I find this chapter,

102
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,680
I can reveal the truth.

103
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,800
Yeah.

104
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:06,144
(Shutting down)

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,680
How come it's out of power?

106
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,760
Actually,

107
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,160
we have met before.

108
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,400
(Think of something.)

109
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,320
Wait.

110
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Master Xu.

111
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,520
I-I...

112
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,640
I am

113
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,600
the eighth star of the Big Dipper Sect.

114
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,600
Our sect leader

115
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,960
sent me here for a reason.

116
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,440
W-Well...

117
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,320
If you kill me here,

118
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,800
then you can't clear your name.

119
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,000
What you said

120
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
sounded

121
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,680
truly confusing.

122
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,360
That being said,

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
you look quite clever

124
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,040
and somewhat resemble my late wife.

125
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,880
That's why it feels like
we've met before.

126
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,200
Please forgive me

127
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,440
if I have offended you.

128
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,320
W-Well...

129
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,880
M-Master Xu.

130
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,200
Y-You were married, right?

131
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
That's right.

132
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,960
But my wife passed away.

133
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
I miss her a lot.

134
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840
By the way, Miss Lin.

135
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,880
The outhouse is next to
the west chamber ahead.

136
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll wait for you

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,720
in the tea room.

138
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:34,520
Alright.

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,560
I'll enjoy the tea after I return.

140
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,760
I didn't expect him to believe that.

141
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,720
Comic characters are so easy to fool.

142
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
This is fun.

143
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,440
Hedgehog, just wait to concede.

144
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,960
I'm going to have some real fun.

145
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,776
(Chen Shenmao)

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Who are you?

147
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,960
You are Chen Shenmao, right?

148
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
I am Lin Lusheng.

149
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,840
I came with the four great constables
of Daoming Court.

150
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,120
They are having tea here.

151
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Come with me

152
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,280
and tell them everything you know.

153
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,520
Then the case will be solved.

154
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,040
Come on.

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,520
Case?

156
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,560
You found them as well?

157
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,840
No.

158
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,160
I can't go with you.

159
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,280
As long as I don't leave this room,

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
I will be all right.

161
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,840
Well...

162
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,800
Trust me.

163
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
I have read the comics.

164
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,400
I know everything.

165
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,160
You can only hide for a while.

166
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,240
Stay back.

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,760
Okay.

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,360
Stay back.

169
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,120
I'm staying here.

170
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,040
I'm staying here.

171
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
Don't be afraid.

172
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
Please let me go.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,120
Whoever doesn't believe
in the Big Dipper Demon

174
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,720
ends up dead, bleeding

175
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,240
from seven orifices.

176
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,640
No one can escape it.

177
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,840
I don't want to die.

178
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,240
I don't want to die.

179
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:18,280
(Big Dipper Mysteries)

180
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,000
(It's the curse
of the Big Dipper Demon.)

181
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,880
(Those who disrespect
the Big Dipper Demon)

182
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,160
(will be cursed)

183
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,560
(and bleed from seven orifices)

184
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
(until they die.)

185
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,640
Rest assured.

186
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,840
You won't die.

187
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,120
And I bet there's someone behind it.

188
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,320
There is no such curse
of the Big Dipper Demon.

189
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,240
Besides,

190
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,200
the four great constables are next door.

191
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,000
They will ensure your safety.

192
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,040
The four great constables.

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
Are they really

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,160
in the academy?

195
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,960
Yeah.

196
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,280
They are right here.

197
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,000
They are just next door.

198
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,240
Rest assured.

199
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,760
They are just next door.

200
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
Okay.

201
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,560
I know you have reported it many times

202
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,080
but to no avail.

203
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,280
But the Daoming Court
is different from the yamen.

204
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,120
They report directly to the Emperor.

205
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,760
Since its establishment
by Shangguan Yunxiao,

206
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,480
it has solved many bizarre

207
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,880
and major cases.

208
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,600
Among Shangguan Yunxiao's

209
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
48 disciples,

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,280
four stand out from the rest.

211
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,520
Three years ago,

212
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,080
they solved the royal family's
Hat Demon case.
