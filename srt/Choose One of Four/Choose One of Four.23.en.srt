answer a question we ask.

87
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,600
that person

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160

all your clothes.

127
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,840

128
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,320
I'll drink.

129

134
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,960

140
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,640
Yeah, I wanted to ask too.

141
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,840
Everyone

142
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,440

143
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,880
I don't want anything to happen
to the one I care about.

144
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,320
So...

145
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
I get it.

146
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,840
I understand.

147
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,800

Come on.

160
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,680
One, two, three.

161

This is a new life from now on.

162
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,200

167
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,280
I can't wait.

168
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,800

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,360
Dig in.

170
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
Dig in.

171

178
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,960
You want to take revenge.

179
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,320
But you've come here.

180
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,360
That's just the Comic World

181

182
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,120
We've been through so much together.

183
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,680
I want to be selfish for once.

184
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Can you stay with me

185
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,280
and start a new life?

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,920
Lusheng.

187
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,400
Before I met you,

188
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,040
I had no concern

189
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,120
over anything in the world.

190
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,640
The only thing on my mind

191
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
was to avenge my family.

192
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
But after I met you,

193
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,720
I have changed a lot.

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think

195
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,400
I'd like to watch the sunrise
and have breakfast

196
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,840
with you.

197
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,480
When we have kids,

198
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,280
we'll take them out for walks.

199
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,960
I want to live a little longer

200
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,880
to be with you.

201
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
Look at you.

202
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,200
You have suffered so much for me.

203
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,400
It hurts me too.

204
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,280
So

205
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,000
I want to protect you forever.

206
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,440
Lusheng.

207
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,240
Will you marry me?

208
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,520
Also, Hedgehog.

209
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,200
Didn't you learn all the sweet talks?

210
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,920
I...

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,280
I forgot all of them.

212
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,840
Just now,

213
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
my mind went blank.

214
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,160
So I spoke from my heart.

215
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,440
My lady.

216
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:45,200
What...

217
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,680
What did you just call me?

218
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,200
My lady.

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,520
Mmm.

220
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,120
My parents will come

221
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,520
to the college the day after tomorrow.

222
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,120
Come and meet them.

223
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,200
Also,

224
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
over here,

225
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
you should call me "honey".

226
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,680
Honey.

227
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,407
♪Who is admiring
their own solitary elegance♪

228
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:39,135
♪Strolling leisurely in the courtyard♪

229
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,223
♪Dust adheres to the brick walls♪

230
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:50,783
♪So stubborn, can't bear to collide♪

231
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:56,479
♪Who weaves garments
of feathers and rainbow silks♪

232
00:11:56,479 --> 00:12:02,367
♪Contented with oneself
amidst the chaotic world♪

233
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:07,519
♪Who lets the lonely petals fall♪

234
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:15,423
♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

235
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:20,415
♪The bloom of the gardenia,
oh so fleeting♪

236
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:26,111
♪Thinking of the songs
and the sighs of the parted♪
