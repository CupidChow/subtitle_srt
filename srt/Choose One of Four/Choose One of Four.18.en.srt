It seems

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,000
that all the recent cases

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,600
resulted from the mandrake flowers

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,320
introduced by

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,440
the Big Dipper Sect.

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,040
You

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,600
saved me

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,560
at the Ruyi Pavilion

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,920
a few days ago.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,560
I shall

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
grant you a wish.

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,560
What would you wish for?

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,120
Your Majesty.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,080
I want three wishes.

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,000
Forgive her, Your Majesty.

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,480
I bet she's not clear-headed

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,360
due to the remaining poison.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,880
What a special lady.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,200
Alright.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,000
I will grant you three wishes.

37
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,560
Tell me.

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,240
Here's the first wish.

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,200
The constables of the Daoming Court
solved the case

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,200
and should be exempt from penalties.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,680
Granted.

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,200
Everyone, please rise.

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,720
Here's the second wish.

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,360
Please issue a decree

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,240
to forbid all high officials

46
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,120
from mistreating maidservants

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,440
and ladies of low status

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,960
and peculiar occupations.

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,800
Protect the rights of women.

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,120
Abolish all laws
that are detrimental to women.

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,880
if you've studied the laws
regarding women of Beichao,

52
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,880
you would change your mind.

53
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:24,800
(The Constitution)

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
Women of Beichao are truly suffering.

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
If one is of humble origin,

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,840
to live in this world

57
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,960
is a pure torment.

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,880
Granted.

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,000
You truly are different.

60
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
The first two wishes

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,800
were made for the sake of others.

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,040
I bet you're keeping

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,360
the third wish for yourself, right?

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,840
That's right.

65
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,480
It is for myself.

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,160
Please make me

67
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,960
the leader of the Daoming Court,

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,880
so that I can
arrest Yun Zhishui in person.

69
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,240
I've been around the suspect
for a long time

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,960
and know his living habits.

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,840
That will help me bring him back

72
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,760
as soon as possible.

73
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,320
Lin Lusheng, heed the command.

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,880
I hereby order you
to arrest the criminal Yun Zhishui.

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,480
Make sure he's alive

76
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,880
for my interrogation.

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,840
You gentlemen here assisted

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,320
in solving the case.

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,120
I grant you 10,000 taels
of gold and silver

80
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,760
and 100 rolls of fine fabric.

81

Zhishui is active

106

near the Dark Capital.

I wonder how he is doing.

108
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,400
Why did you ask

109
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,520
to become the court leader?

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,240
Because

111
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,560
you seemed upset when the Han family
was about to take over

going to arrest Zhishui?

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,560
Yeah, I want to arrest him in person.

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,840
This is to protect him.

117
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,440
He'd be in danger

118

191
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,800
Let's find Hedgehog first.

192
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,480
My goodness.

193
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,400
I didn't expect Zhishui
to be hiding in such a place.

194
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,240
We've been investigating for a long time

195
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,520
and found some traces nearby.

196
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,920
I suspect

197
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,080
they were left by Zhishui.

198
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,000
Little Deer.

199
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,680
What should we do

200
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,440
if we find him?

201
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,200
Arrest him?

202
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Let's first ask him
about the assassination

203
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,720
and Mo Shanghua.

204
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,320
Yeah.

205
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,480
Oh, right.

206
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,520
Any news

207
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,560
while we were away from

208
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,640
the Daoming Court?

209
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Little Deer.

210
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,360
I discovered something while I was

211
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,720
taking care of my father.

212
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,040
I suspect

213
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,760
that he killed our leader.

214
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,920
What?

215
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,440
Something's up.

216
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:21,631

217
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:27,359
