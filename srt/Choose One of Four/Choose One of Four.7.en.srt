(No Pain, No Gain?)

15
00:00:55,123 --> 00:01:00,128
(Comic World, Northern Jin City)

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,960
To confide my thoughts to the zither,

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,480
but bosom friends are rare.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
No one knows the strings are broken.

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,760
What a rare visitor!

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,680
Long time no see.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,480
How dare you

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,920
walk in here!

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,000
It seems

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
you've come prepared.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,720
Of course.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,000
Madam Murong.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,360
Do you know

28
00:01:56,544 --> 00:01:57,120
I am Zhao...

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
What is

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,040
your relationship?

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,040
Why bother?

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,360
You might not be aware

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,920
that this shop of mine

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,800
only deals with couples' business.

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
You might not be aware

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,200
that I am Wuxin...

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,040
To be honest,

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,520
we are

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,880
indeed a loving couple.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,680
Saving people matters.

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,520
Don't lie to me.

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,720
You can't be a couple.

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,800
Madam.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't say so.

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,000
We are

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,160
indeed a loving couple.

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,480
You are not a couple.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,760
So I don't want your lives.

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,840
Please leave.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,920
I won't see you out.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Wait, Madam.

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,520
H-Honey, don't rush.

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,480
We can do so tonight.

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,560
You have an age difference
of three thousand years.

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,200
You can't be a couple.

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,280
However,

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,440
the married couple like you

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,320
can still have such heart-fluttering.

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,520
I haven't seen such for decades.

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,240
Back in the days,

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
I wholeheartedly followed my husband.

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,080
Unexpectedly,

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,640
he traded me for wealth
in the Dark Capital

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,280
and remarry

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,440
to lead a happy life.

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,560
Finally,

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,520
he said to me,

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,360
"No pain, no gain."

69
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,200
From then on,

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,600
I take pleasure in breaking up couples.

71
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,360
Miss,

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
I have never seen such a fate.

73
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,320
You don't belong here.

74
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
However,

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
you are very likely

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,640
to become the savior.

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,080
Green Crystal and Guinie Vessel.

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,240
Madam.

79
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,360
Please give me Green Crystal
and Guinie Vessel.

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,160
This is the territory
of Big Dipper Sect.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,320
How dare you ask for these two things!

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,360
The Emperor

83
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
has the absolute sovereignty.

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,760
Territory of Big Dipper Sect?

85
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
You are young and ignorant.

86
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
Do you think you can get

87
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,160
everything in this world

88
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,640
if you want?

89
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
Be it Big Dipper Sect

90
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,840
or Northern Jin City,

91
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,240
I want to save those
who have been poisoned.

92
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,640
They are all innocent.

93
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
And them.

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
Do you know?

95
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,200
In another world,

96
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,080
there are many people
who support and like them.

97
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,760
So I want to rewrite their ending.

98
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,320
Madam.

99
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,800
Please help us.

100
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,640
Give us Green Crystal and Guinie Vessel,

101
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,200
okay?

102
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,520
Are they

103
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,960
really that important

104
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,240
to you?

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,040
Yes.

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Very important.

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,560
Please believe

108
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
that this world is still beautiful,

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
with sincere friendship,

110
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,440
innocent love,

111
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,680
and selfless familial love.

112
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,760
Naive girl.

113
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
My Green Crystal

114
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,200
has been taken by Big Dipper Sect.

115
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,200
If you really want
to trade for this Guinie Vessel,

116
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,880
then drink this life-exchanging wine.

117
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,840
Don't push your luck.

118
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,920
No pain, no gain.

119
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,520
If you want to take it away,

120
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,120
then exchange it with your life.

121
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,800
This is fair.

122
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,360
(If I really die after drinking this,)

123
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,760
(does it mean I can go back then?)

124
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,280
(For those innocent people and Zhishui,)

125
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,680
(I'll take a gamble.)

126
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Trust me.

127
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,240
I will definitely protect you.

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,440
I've had a really hard time.

129
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,840
I just want to live on.

130
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,200
It's like a never-ending nightmare.

131
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,480
Rest assured.
I will definitely protect you.

132
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,440
And your life will get back to normal.

133
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,200
(I'll take a gamble.)

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Give me the antidote,

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
or I will kill you.

136
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,560
Are you okay?

137
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,560
Surprisingly, you are fine.

138
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,200
Could it be...

139
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,000
Could it be the Tiangu Vessel?

140
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,160
What vessel?

141
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,920
Now this is funny.

142
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,560
Attention.

143
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,760
After one hour,

144
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,560
she will still die.

145
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,880
And you, Zhao Wumian,

146
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,520
you

147
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,120
will die at Qixi.

148
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,120
Ridiculous.

149
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,440
Give me the antidote.

150
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,440
Witch.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,920
Are you okay?

152
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,320
Why are you so impulsive?

153
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,640
Without the Green Crystal,

154
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,840
how can we save
Tianshan Academy's people?

155
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Where are you going?

156
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
It's too dangerous here.

157
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Let's get out first.

158
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
I think I saw Zhishui.

159
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,840
You're blocking me.

160
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,840
Step aside.

161
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,920
No way.

162
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,280
You haven't been in a love?

163
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,120
We are

164
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,640
a loving couple.

165
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,040
Are they

166
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,560
really that important

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,920
to you?

168
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,560
Yes.

169
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,840
Very important.

170
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,800
Hey, that's the brothel.

171
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,080
Yun Zhishui.

172
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:13,960
Yun Zhi...

173
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,880
Stop it.

174
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
This is Zuisheng House.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,880
Zhishui.

176
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,720
Yun Zhishui.

177
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,520
How dare you lay a finger on her.

178
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,440
Zhao Wumian.

179
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,240
Yun Zhishui.

180
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:43,400
Wait.

181
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,840
I really saw Zhishui.

182
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't run around.

183
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,880
What just happened

184
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,520
didn't make you learn a lesson?

185
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,280
I...

186
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,480
(This part wasn't drawn
in the comic at all,)

187
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,040
(so it's quite fascinating.)

188
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,720
Keep a low profile.

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,880
Everyone here is complicated.

190
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,240
Be careful.

191
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,400
Oh.

192
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,560
Has the poisoned wine taken effect?

193
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,520
No.

194
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,880
I'm just too sleepy.

195
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,720
So many days,

196
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,160
I feel like I haven't slept for days.

197
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,320
Hedgehog.

198
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,880
What's wrong?

199
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,520
Do you smell that?

200
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,120
This was the smell that night

201
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,280
when my whole family was murdered.

202
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,880
After my father smelled it,

203
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,880
he became weak and limp.

204
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,840
How come I'm all right?

205
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,400
This is a rare type of poison,
Beisu Qingfeng Powder,

206
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,720
which only affects martial artists.

207
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,960
We're taken in.

208
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:15,187
Leave now!

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,360
Hedgehog.

210
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,160
Are you fine?

211
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:31,071

their own solitary elegance♪

00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:36,799

♪Contented with oneself
amidst the chaotic world♪

♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

219
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:18,079

oh so fleeting♪

220
