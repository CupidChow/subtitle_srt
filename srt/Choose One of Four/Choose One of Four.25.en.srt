Zhao Wumian, listen carefully.

From now on, no matter what happens,

21

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Your Majesty.

24

Daoming Court is a banner,

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,920
sheltering the people
in the name of their ruler.

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,600

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,600
reflecting the corruption of the court.

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,920

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,280
Mr. Zhao, please rise.

30
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,440
Thankfully, Miss Lin saved us in time.

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
Today, I will purge the traitors.

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,480
I've written to the Princess of Bili
and explained everything.

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,080

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,240

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,600
My father supported your family.

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,760
But you mistook strictness
for discrimination.

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,680
Shangguan Yunxiao made me do this.

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,360
Just kill me.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,840
Let me apologize to Commander Han
in the underworld.

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,440
Shangguan Yunxiao

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,720
is my foster father.

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
Please let me handle it.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,680

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,080
I taught you all your martial arts.

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,880
How are you going to fight me?

49
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,360
I still can't accept

50

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,680

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,120

54
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
