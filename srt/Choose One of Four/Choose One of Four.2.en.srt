(Can I Return to the Modern Era?)

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,080
(The Princess of Bili was missing.)

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,760
(So this girl is...)

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,120
Young Master Yun.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,480
You must be the Princess of Bili.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,520
Miss.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,240
Who are you?

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
The female lead of the comic

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,160
is truly graceful, poised,

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,480
beautiful, and charming.

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,360
You know?

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,440
I love seeing you and Zhishui together.

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,400
I remember your love poem saying,

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
"I wish I were the stars,
and you the moon."

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,640
"Night after night,
we shine upon each other."

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,240
That was so beautiful.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,600
What?

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
You read my handwritten letter

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,360
to Young Master Yun?

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,960
Yeah.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,040
Of course.

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,480
Everyone at our school read it.

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,680
Who are you?

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,400
How do you know Young Master Yun?

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,440
Zhishui

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,480
is my crush.

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,760
Zhishui?

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,600
Yeah.

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,920
You sound so close.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
What's wrong, Princess?

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
If I had known that

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,360
Young Master Yun

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,320
had a girlfriend in Beichao,

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
I wouldn't have come.

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,880
I shall set off to Kingdom
of Bili tonight.

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
Set off to Kingdom of Bili?

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,040
You're not going anywhere.

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,840
How dare you!

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,600
(They are the worst villains
in the comic,)

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,640
(the Big Dipper Sect.)

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,440
(I remember that Zhishui)

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,280
(was badly injured in this chapter.)

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
(What should I do?)

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,600
Kingdom of Bili has never been

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,640
on good terms with Northern Jin City.

59
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,640
Actually,

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
we share a common goal.

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,280
We should work together.

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
Then the whole world
will be under our reign.

63
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,000
Alright.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
You can't do that.

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,960
They will kill Yun Zhishui.

66
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,560
Stop.

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,520
As long as you spare Young Master Yun,

68
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,280
I am willing to do anything.

69
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
Wait, are you silly?

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,320
Now they will
hurt Yun Zhishui even more.

71
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,560
This is the last thing I can do

72
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,960
for Young Master Yun.

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
Why don't you get it?

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,040
(What do I do?)

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,280
(Think of something.)

76
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,400
(Fine, I'll give it a try.)

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,960
Let me tell you.

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,320
We're the only ones

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,640
in this mansion.

80
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,000
If I kill the princess,

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,160
the Bili people would

82
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,280
definitely suspect you.

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,240
The enemy of the enemy's enemy

84
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,440
makes the greatest enemy.

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Play along if you want to save Zhishui.

86
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,200
Miss.

87
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,960
Calm down.

88
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,800
Please don't hurt the princess.

89
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,880
Miss.

90
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,440
No one will hurt me.

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,680
Please do not harm the princess.

92
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,160
Young Master Yun.

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Why did you show this lady the letter

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,680
I wrote to you?

95
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Me?

96
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Shall I escort you

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,120
back to your kingdom first?

98
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,200
You don't get to tell me

99
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,560
where to go.

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,840
Miss.

101
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
Kill her.

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
We would also

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,680
like to enjoy the show.

104
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Zhao Wumian is here.

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,640
He has injured us.

106
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,280
You didn't even last three rounds.

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
So boring.

108
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:45,000
(Fengjin Garden)

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,920
Let her go.

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,360
I'll count to three.

111
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,720
Come on, Zhao Wumian.

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,520
Are you stupid?

113
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
You don't know the plot. Don't...

114
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,840
Wumian.

115
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,760
Wait.

116
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Han Fengyi, release the signal.

117
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:10,784
(Han)

118
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,960
Why did you do that?

119
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,760
Commander is

120
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,080
passing by with his troops tonight.

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,480
Miss,

122
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,720
how did you know that?

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
I've read the comic.

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
The comic says

125
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,720
the Commander will be passing.

126
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Then you...

127
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,640
Thousands of troops in Northern Jin City

128
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,920
are approaching the city right now.

129
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,160
We

130
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
must not disturb

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,680
the pleasure of such
a father-son reunion.

132
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
Don't fight here.

133
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
You may harm the innocent.

134
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
Keep the princess

135
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,640
safe.

136
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,680
Wumian.

137
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Let them go.

138
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,040
Why doesn't anyone
see the bigger picture?

139
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,280
(Fengjin Garden)
Encircle them.

140
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't let anyone get away.

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,080
(Han Zhonggu)
Father.

142
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
I, Han Zhonggu,
Commander of the Imperial Guards,

143
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,760
pay respects to Your Highness.

144
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,600
Thank you, Commander Han.

145
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,560
Please find someone to escort me

146
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
back to the Kingdom of Bili.

147
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,760
(Wang Linsheng)
I, Wang Linsheng, vice commander,

148
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,240
shall escort Your Highness back.

149
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,880
You don't need to introduce yourself.

150
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
Just escort Her Highness back.

151
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
Aren't you going to say something?

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,280
He has even shown you

153
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,920
my letter...

154
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,040
Young Master Yun.

155
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,920
Let us part ways here.

156
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,360
It's not what you think.

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,080
(What a misunderstanding.)

158
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
(My bad.)

159
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,080
(They broke up because of me.)

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,760
(But at least, I saved Zhishui
from serious injury.)

161
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,680
(It's time to wake up.)

162
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,040
(I'm tired.)

163
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,720
(Don't tell me)

164
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,080
(that it's not a dream.)

165
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,200
(I rarely have such a realistic dream.)

166
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,560
(Leave no regrets.)

167
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,440
Miss.

168
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,360
What are you...?

169
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm too old-fashioned.

170
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,400
The young people
dress in unconventional clothes

171
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,040
and express themselves.

172
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,080
But someone is only

173
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,120
wasting his life.

174
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,240
How infuriating.

175
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,840
Actually,

176
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,040
that princess

177
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,000
is the one destined for you.

178
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,280
I think there's a misunderstanding.

179
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
I'm sure you can...

180
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,800
Miss.

181
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,800
Fate should never be forced.

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,520
What's meant to come will come.

183
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,680
There's no point

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
in forcing her to stay.

185
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,760
What a pretty face.

186
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
It would be a pity if you die.

187
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,240
Rest assured.

188
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,200
I'll ask Xu Zhimo to make it right

189
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,640
and cut someone else's part even more.

190
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,120
Bye.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,560
Bye.

192
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,520
I'm off.

193
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,600
Zhao Wumian.

194
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,560
Let go of me.

195
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,720
Let go of me.

196
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,800
Let go of me.

197
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,720
Let me go, Zhao Wumian.

198
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
Let go of me.

199
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,360
Petty tricks.

200
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,800
Come back to Daoming Court
with me for investigation.

201
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,840
You rascal.

202
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,320
I'd rather die than go with you.

203
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:22,207

their own solitary elegance♪

204
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:27,935

♪Scattering in the city
filled with flying ash♪

211
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:09,215

oh so fleeting♪
