Zhao Wumian.

18

Let's settle our grudges today.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,680
Spare an arm. What do you say?

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,360
We're not in a marketplace.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,000
You don't get to bargain with me.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,640
It is

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,160
your life that I want.

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,640
I think

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,960
you've misunderstood me.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,720
Wuxin Swordsplay.

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,320

they must find true love
to remove the poison.

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,800
I meant I'd fight you

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,760
with one arm
because you were no match for me.

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,160
Wumian.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,200
Spare him.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,240
Tingyu.

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,560
I can't spare him.

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,440
Our masters taught us

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,080
not to go to extremes.

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,760
I bet Mr. Xu has things to say.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Please let me interrogate him.

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,880
Fine.

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
He's yours now.

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,160
I'll head to the Ruyi Pavilion.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,480
Take care of this.

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,760
Wumian.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,080
You've regained power?

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,720
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Don't drink that.

49
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Your Majesty.

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,400
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,600
You can't drink that.

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
How dare you barge in?

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,600
It's you again, weird young lady.

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,560
Tell me.

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,360
Why can't I drink it?

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,200
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,560
This is not a delicacy,

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,600
but a type of poison.

59
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,200
If you do not take the antidote

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
within an hour,

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,360
you might become their puppet.

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,120
Shut up.

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,200
Are you trying to slander me?

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,440
It's a tribute from the Kingdom of Bili

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,640
that prolongs life.

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
Your Majesty.

67
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
The Big Dipper Sect
infiltrated the Ruyi Pavilion

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
and grew raw materials for the poison.

69
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,160
The mandrake flower

70
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,280
is the raw material.

71
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,320
I have heard of it.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
After refining,

73
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,720
the mandrake flowers can be made

74
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,200
into a hallucinogenic drug.

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Is that true?

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,320
Your Majesty.

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,640
It's just a rumor among the folk people

78
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,160
without any written records.

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
Tang Bocheng.

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,160
As the physician of Ruyi Pavilion,

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
how dare you lie to His Majesty

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
about the mandrake flowers?

83
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,520
Your Majesty.

84
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
The mandrake flower
is the raw material to make Feini.

85
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,920
And the fresh mandrake flowers

86
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,200
can detoxify you.

87
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,400
Please have it.

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,240
Fresh mandrake flowers

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,000
have long disappeared from Beichao.

90
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,800
Who knows

91
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,040
what decoction

92
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,160
you're holding?

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
Miss Lin, please bring it here

94
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,160
for me to have a look.

95
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,720
Something's wrong with her.

96
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
Encircle them.

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,880
Your Majesty.

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,560
Let me go.

99
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,520
Let me go.

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
The mandrake flowers must be simmered
for two days and two nights

101
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,760
to remove the Tiangu Vessel.

102
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,600
Otherwise,

103
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,160
the marks on the hands
will only disappear for half a day.

104
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,280
Impede them

105
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,600
when they return

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,760
to make them believe

107
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,040
that they must return.

108
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
Once the medicinal conductor gets close,

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,280
we will be able to control the emperor.

110
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,160
Let go of me.

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Let go of me.

112
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,280
Let me help you.

113
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
What are you doing?

116
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Let go of me.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,240
(What's going on?)

118
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,840
(Haven't the marks disappeared?)

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Thank you.

120
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Without you,

121
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
we couldn't have done this.

122
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
So all of this

123
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,200
was part of your plan?

124
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,040

126
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
His Majesty is poisoned.

127
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
Give him the antidote

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,440
before it's too late.

129
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,040
Yeah.

130
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,960
Do it now.

131
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Kill Lin Lusheng and Zhao Wumian.

132
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,480
