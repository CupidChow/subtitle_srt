1
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,031
You're being so dramatic!
I'm gonna pay you, right?

2
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:14,311
Sir, take it easy.

3
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:16,717
You're groping my breast!

4
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,436
What if I did that to you?

5
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,704
What's going on here?

6
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:22,212
You need to talk to your people!

7
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:24,345
Sir.

8
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:26,496
That's not allowed here.

9
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,142
Not allowed? What do
you mean not allowed?

10
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:33,853
I don't want him anymore!
His breath stinks!

11
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:35,084
This bitch!

12
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,496
- Sir, just take it easy!
- Hold on a minute.

13
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:37,955
Sir, stay right here.

14
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,504
And you! You've been at this for a while!
You're taking it too far!

15
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:41,868
Sir, you're totally wasted.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,366
- I haven't done anything to you.
- Get him out of here first.

17
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:44,506
Just get him out.

18
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:45,958
You all need to talk to your staff!

19
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:49,236
Are you okay?

20
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:50,832
Yes, Mama.

21
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:01,106
She's just being so dramatic!

22
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,306
She acts like she's a princess here.

23
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:05,984
Even I got my nipple bitten,
and I just dealt with it.

24
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:08,686
Well, at least I demanded
a huge tip from him.

25
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:12,672
Honestly, sometimes...
I get into fights because of all of you.

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,924
Please, don't be too picky.

27
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:18,409
Whatever the guests want,
you do it.

28
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:21,354
Just make up for it
with the drinks. Right?

29
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,744
How else are we going to
make the big money, huh?

30
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,733
That's right, Ma.
Me, I'll do anything for the money!

31
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:32,216
It's up to us if we
accept the guest.

32
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:34,682
We can tell just
by looking at them.

33
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,921
Maybe I should pinch all your nipples!

34
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,952
Berna, what they mean is...

35
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:44,134
you need to learn to
talk nicely to the guests.

36
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:48,142
You never know, maybe he
just looks like that, but he's loaded!

37
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:51,016
He looked like a piece of
dirt that grew into a person.

38
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:54,315
True, Mama! That
guy had a thick wallet.

39
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:56,459
Only got big bills.

40
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,929
He's just cheap with his tips.

41
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:01,422
You stole some, didn't you?
You didn't even share any with me.

42
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,342
- Hey, that's enough!
- Mama was the one who took it, anyway.

43
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:04,871
I just returned his wallet.

44
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:06,242
That's enough now.

45
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,772
From the moment they sit down...

46
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:11,316
you need to tell them
what's okay and what's not.

47
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,419
and if they ask for something extra,
they have to match it with cash.

48
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,186
Preach!

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Jeez!

50
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:22,385
I grew old in this bar.
I've been through all of that.

51
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,839
I'll always defend you
as long as I can.

52
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,132
But if you're too uptight about it,

53
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:31,045
there's nothing I can do, got that?

54
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,229
This bar needs to make money, too.

55
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:34,800
Good thing Sy isn't here.

56
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,952
If he were, he'd be
cursing all of us out.

57
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:48,254
Why didn't you put up
with the guest last night?

58
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:50,756
He's nothing compared to you.

59
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:53,416
Even if you're sweaty,
you still look enticing.

60
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,920
That's what I like about you.

61
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:57,745
Just take me home
with you, alright?

62
00:03:58,434 --> 00:03:59,434
How about the register?

63
00:04:00,217 --> 00:04:02,302
It's already planned out.

64
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:42,376
- Hey man, cheers!
- There we go! Cheers!

65
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:50,016
- Here, have some food as a chaser, man.
- Yeah, he's already wasted.

66
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,351
- Dude, that's enough.
- You're being embarrassing.

67
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:53,902
Is it going to take much longer?

68
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:57,077
Can't you see we're
still having a good time?

69
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,859
Go ahead! You go first.

70
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:00,374
I'll follow you later.

71
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,651
Hi, Myrna!

72
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:12,144
You're going to get it later!

73
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,729
[chuckles]

74
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:16,912
Hey you!

75
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,089
Hey!

76
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:11,462
- Shhh!
- What are you doing here?

77
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,296
Is your girlfriend here already?

78
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:20,341
She just got here. But...

79
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,762
she's already asleep. Why?

80
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,883
You haven't come
to see me for weeks!

81
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,108
I'm dried up, daddy!

82
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:30,825
Wait, wait.

83
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,368
Myrna might see us.

84
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,603
Tomorrow, I promise.
I'll visit you in the afternoon, okay?

85
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:36,863
She's asleep!

86
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,444
She's asleep.

87
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:53,837
Did you miss me?

88
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:57,053
I did, so much!

89
00:11:57,947 --> 00:11:59,458
I was so exhausted last night.

90
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:00,965
But when I woke up,

91
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:02,969
you were already snoring.

92
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,468
What are you cooking there?

93
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:09,946
Hotdogs... and eggs.

94
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:13,998
What if you just ate my
hotdog and eggs instead,

95
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,978
while I'm banging you up.

96
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,926
You really have the libido of a rabbit!

97
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:21,035
Only for you.

98
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,421
I’ll hook you up
with a job at the bar.

99
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:44,767
I'll handle talking to Sy.

100
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,237
We need to hire another bouncer anyway.

101
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:52,636
Yes! Finally, I'll have
something to do with my life.

102
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:54,913
Not just sitting around the house!

103
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:57,164
[chuckles]

104
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:03,117
Just don't hook up with
any of the girls there, okay?

105
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,005
If I catch you,
I'll chop that off!

106
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,518
Come on! I'm loyal—and this too.

107
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:14,453
Oh, really?

108
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:17,322
Where's my coffee?

109
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,516
- Oh!
- I'll just have some water for now.

110
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,755
You're really messing with me.

111
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:28,414
Don't make me lose
my trust in you, got it?

112
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:01,194
Uh, sir.

113
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,795
Is Ma'am Myrna here?

114
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,322
What do you need to see her about?

115
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:09,847
Oh, alright, come in.

116
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:26,880
Ma'am, she's an applicant.

117
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:30,841
Good afternoon, ma'am.

118
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:48,209
Have you ever danced in another bar?

119
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,136
No, if I get the job,
this will be my first time.

120
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,953
How old are you and
where are you from?

121
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:59,818
Eighteen, from Samar.

122
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,446
Samar, huh?

123
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,904
You really came all the
way to Manila just to dance?

124
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,397
To work.

125
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,644
My father passed away.
And I don't know where my mother is.

126
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,397
Do you have a boyfriend?

127
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:21,618
No.

128
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:23,432
Are you a virgin?

129
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:24,457
Yes, ma'am.

130
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:29,405
[scoffs] The thing I hate most is a liar.

131
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,017
I actually don't know.

132
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,918
How many boyfriends have you had?

133
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:35,069
Two.

134
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,267
Two? And none of
them ever touched you?

135
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:45,164
No. The first one wanted to,
but I refused, so he broke up with me.

136
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:49,877
The second one forced me.
He tried to go inside, but it hurt.

137
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:54,506
So I left him. I was scared.

138
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:04,847
Oh, tell the boss I'm
waiting for his wire transfer.

139
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,751
Just always watch
the cash register.

140
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:14,986
Because if anything goes missing,
you're going to get in trouble.

141
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:20,573
The key is hidden in my crotch,
so no one else can get it.

142
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,447
Right, Mama?

143
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:24,999
We’ll be back in a week.

144
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,684
The boss is still in Taiwan,
he's not back yet.

145
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:28,994
Alright.

146
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,679
Have a seat over there... sit down.

147
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,945
Have you been paid yet?

148
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:44,403
- Me?
- Hmm.

149
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,662
Not yet. Sy is always
late at giving out salaries.

150
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:54,233
He wants us to
always be in debt to him

151
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:57,078
but there's 30 percent interest.

152
00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:02,014
So when payday comes,
it's all cuts and deductions.

153
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:04,957
That Chinese man is a swindler.

154
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:09,123
I saw that Berna has the key, right?

155
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,461
That woman is a suck-up.

156
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:23,419
She starts rumors about every cashier here,
so be careful of her. Okay?

157
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:31,069
So... when are you free to start?

158
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,794
Anytime, ma'am. I can start whenever.

159
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,671
Alright, then observe tonight.

160
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:42,702
If you like it, you
can start tomorrow.

161
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,996
- Really?
- Yes, I'll teach you.

162
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:46,496
Thank you, ma'am.

163
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,036
Ma... Ma!

164
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,207
Is she available?

165
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:41,745
Ah, no, she's not working a shift yet.

166
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:43,531
Why not? What a waste.

167
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,186
Because we're going
to launch her properly.

168
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:52,058
Don't worry, we'll invite
you to the launching.

169
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,182
You should come!

170
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,537
- You promise?
- Of course!

171
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,080
I'll be back.

172
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:59,036
Yes, just don't skip it.

173
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,067
- Cheers!
- Enjoy!

174
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,992
Be a little more flirty!

175
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,960
Sexier!

176
00:21:23,256 --> 00:21:24,507
What the hell is that?

177
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:33,624
Hey, you girl. If you really
want to be a dancer here,

178
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,962
you can't be doing
that TikTok dance!

179
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:41,383
It needs to be sexier, more provocative.

180
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:46,506
Your body needs to be aggressive,
like that! That's what the guests want.

181
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:49,107
And if you want to
get tabled by a client

182
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:53,609
and get a big tip, you
need to turn them on!

183
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:57,288
Jeez! You're just wasting my time.

184
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,213
Teach her!

185
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,957
Fix her up, she's dancing like a log.

186
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,961
She's fine, though.

187
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,421
What do you mean "fine"?
She can't just be "fine."

188
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:13,982
She needs to make
the guests' dicks hard.

189
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,744
Come on? She just started.

190
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,299
You want her to be good immediately.

191
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:23,900
But don't you see potential in her?

192
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:33,410
You know, I see myself in her.

193
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,219
If she follows everything I say,
she'll be the star dancer of this bar.

194
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:43,024
The hottest model that
all the men will come for.

195
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:48,441
But if she's a pushover,
she'll end up stuck on a table.

196
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,312
Calm down.

197
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:04,357
Bro, did she pass Ma's test?

198
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:08,892
It's not that she didn't pass,
it's just a bit touch-and-go.

199
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,460
She should dance for me instead.

200
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,301
I’d make her feet
straighten out with pleasure.

201
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:15,474
Her feet are both left.

202
00:23:15,553 --> 00:23:18,517
Damn you bro, you're
going to beat me to it.

203
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:20,932
Do you want to do it together instead?

204
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:22,633
I'll be the one to straighten her out.

205
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,647
The most awaited launching
of our newest, hottest...

206
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:40,503
Alluring star of the night,
the one who will warm up your cold night!

207
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:44,740
Let's all welcome Sassy Pinky!

208
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:05,645
The men need to be completely
consumed by lust for her first.

209
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:10,775
Well, I've been consumed
by lust for a while now.

210
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:12,722
What do you mean?

211
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:16,122
For me, or for...?

212
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,183
What are you thinking?
Of course, for you!

213
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:23,207
Don't you dare touch Pinky, okay?

214
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:25,191
If you touch her, you'll
have to deal with me.

215
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:30,372
What are you thinking?

216
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:32,011
Come here!

217
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:33,926
- Hello!
- Hi!

218
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,885
Is she available?

219
00:29:37,747 --> 00:29:41,437
Uh, I haven't let her be tabled yet.

220
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:44,625
That's Pinky, she
just turned eighteen.

221
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:47,972
And she has no experience yet.

222
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:51,421
She's dancing that good,
without experience?

223
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:55,097
She's our newest one here.

224
00:29:55,627 --> 00:30:01,535
She's from the province,
so she's fresh and new.

225
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:03,288
How much?

226
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,889
The price is different just for a table,

227
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:10,926
and it's also different if
you happen to be her first.

228
00:30:12,183 --> 00:30:14,143
The price is also different
for the private room.

229
00:30:14,483 --> 00:30:17,903
Whatever the cost. Send
her over here, right now.

230
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:25,896
I'm the one you're talking to,
so I'll handle it.

231
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:29,465
That's what I like about you!
Don't worry… I'll take care of you.

232
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:33,371
Alright. Have a seat here,
and I'll call her.

233
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:49,553
Do you really want to be tabled?

234
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:56,526
I told you, Ma, I can handle both.

235
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,569
Alright, I'm going to
introduce you to someone.

236
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,000
He rarely comes here.

237
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:14,714
He's a businessman, rich... and
he's very picky, but he likes you.

238
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:17,481
But it has to be table only, okay?

239
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,448
If he wants a private room,
then you have to ask me first.

240
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,294
Why?

241
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,152
Why?

242
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:27,320
Well, of course,
you're a star now.

243
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:30,518
I should be the one
discussing your price.

244
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:40,278
And he thinks you're completely clueless.
Okay? You're innocent.

245
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:50,375
Don't make any crass movements.
You need to be completely virgin-like.

246
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,694
And when he touches you,
you have to play hard to get, understood?

247
00:31:54,719 --> 00:32:00,725
But don't do anything that will annoy him,
you have to be sweet.

248
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:06,638
Then, pretend to hold his arm,
going lower and lower.

249
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,352
Down to his thighs,
then to his crotch.

250
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:12,660
Cuddle him, make him horny.

251
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:18,588
In this job, you have to
think like you're an actress.

252
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:22,395
The most beautiful, sexy star.

253
00:32:23,396 --> 00:32:24,748
Do you understand?

254
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,984
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,204
Okay, good. Come on.

256
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:53,698
He wants to bring you
to a private room.

257
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:55,358
Are you ready?

258
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,616
I don't know.

259
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:02,553
Dindo is a rabbit,
just like this one.

260
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:11,608
Okay, ma'am, I really need the
money anyway to pay for my rent.

261
00:33:14,163 --> 00:33:15,706
If that's the case, then go ahead.

262
00:33:16,271 --> 00:33:19,524
Do a great job,
he's a huge tipper.

263
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:20,935
Let's go

264
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:25,648
Ah, this is Dindo.
Dindo, this is Pinky.

265
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:26,996
- Dindo.
- Pinky.

266
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:32,169
Ah, there. Hey, Jun! Come here.

267
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,487
Take them to the private room.

268
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,669
This way, sir.

269
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:45,897
I thought you didn't
want Pinky to be tabled.

270
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:49,189
Well, he kept on bugging me.

271
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,963
Besides, I know Dindo. He pays well.

272
00:33:57,964 --> 00:34:01,673
You know, lots of people
want to be with your girl, right?

273
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,558
How about I watch her for you?
You know?

274
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:08,795
Like her bodyguard.
To make sure no one disrespects her.

275
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:11,307
Trying to pull a fast one?

276
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:19,114
Hey, Carlito! Just watch
the whole bar, that's your job.

277
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:22,100
Come on, already jealous?

278
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,030
Are you really trying to fool me, huh?

279
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:27,597
Just chill.

280
00:34:27,622 --> 00:34:29,600
- What chill? Stop messing with me.
- What's wrong?

281
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,687
I'm just concerned
about your girl, okay?

282
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:37,501
- What are you talking about?
- I know you. Stop it.

283
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:46,465
Is this your first time?

284
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:48,736
In this bar? Yes.

285
00:34:48,814 --> 00:34:49,982
Doing this?

286
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,196
Sort of. We're just going to talk, right?

287
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:35,990
Hey, Dindo looks completely
satisfied with you, huh?

288
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:37,562
Your kid is good!

289
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,581
Until next time.

290
00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:41,015
Thank you!

291
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:48,542
Wow, it looks like...
you did a great job, huh?

292
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,647
Well, you told me to do a
great job. With the acting.

293
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:55,502
You really impressed me.

294
00:38:56,663 --> 00:39:00,525
If you keep this up, you'll
make a ton of money here.

295
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:04,476
I'll be the one in charge
of who tables you,

296
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,505
who takes you to a private room,
and who takes you out.

297
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:10,664
Yes, sis.

298
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,595
Just call me Mama. Mamasan,
that's what everyone calls me here.

299
00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:19,521
Mama? Mother? Mommy?

300
00:39:20,974 --> 00:39:22,351
Something like that.

301
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:27,084
Thank you, Mama.

302
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,822
Here's your tip!

303
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:31,608
But, he already gave me one.

304
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:34,745
No, that's your tip, from me.

305
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:37,964
Add it to what you
need to pay for your rent.

306
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:43,625
Thank you, Ma.

307
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:52,980
Oh no, no, no.

308
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,062
- Hi, girls.
- I hope they're not late.

309
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:56,911
- Coffee.
- Oh, wow.

310
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,299
- You're so sweet, Tolits.
- Of course.

311
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,250
Ma, this is for you!

312
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:02,523
- Oh!
- I have a gift for you.

313
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:03,976
Where did you get that?

314
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,501
- You're so sweet.
- Just open it.

315
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,100
Oh, I definitely will open it.

316
00:40:10,726 --> 00:40:13,383
Oh, siomai!

317
00:40:13,657 --> 00:40:16,106
How did you know
this is my favorite? Huh?

318
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:21,222
- Secret!
- Oh, really? A secret? Thanks!

319
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,703
Hey, bitches!

320
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:29,232
Where are these bitches?
Hey, you girls! Come over here.

321
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:33,363
Pinky brought a treat!
Come on! Dig in!

322
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:35,514
- You know huh?
- Come on.

323
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:37,050
Thank you.

324
00:40:37,075 --> 00:40:39,952
- Oh, okay, pass through here.
- That looks delicious!

325
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:41,687
- Is it good?
- Go, take some.

326
00:40:41,712 --> 00:40:42,712
Can I have some?

327
00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:43,891
You don't want any?

328
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:46,386
Here. Save some for me, okay?

329
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:50,487
For makeup, you should choose
something that suits your skin.

330
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:53,885
I'll put it on you.

331
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,315
Here, Ma, try this. It's new.

332
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:07,557
Oh, yeah. I only see this on
the dancers. On the internet.

333
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,116
Looking good!

334
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:12,709
Wow! It suits you so well!

335
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,141
Yeah!

336
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,838
There! Your face really stands out.

337
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:24,739
Really, Ma? Thank you.

338
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:36,466
Miss?

339
00:41:40,722 --> 00:41:42,368
This looks pretty.

340
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:45,185
Miss, how much is this?

341
00:41:45,227 --> 00:41:47,207
It's only 380, ma'am.

342
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:56,164
Hey, come here. Turn around.
This will look good on you.

343
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:58,877
Wow! Perfect fit!

344
00:42:00,674 --> 00:42:03,427
Do you want it?
I'll take care of it.

345
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:05,606
- Really, Ma?
- Yeah.

346
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,530
It's so pretty!
Thank you, Ma.

347
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,596
What about this?
Does this look good on me?

348
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,120
You look better without one.

349
00:42:14,656 --> 00:42:16,206
You're so harsh to me!

350
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:19,225
Well, because with
the size of your junk,

351
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,153
if you wear that, it'll
stick out over the garter.

352
00:42:22,511 --> 00:42:23,511
That's true!

353
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:25,401
Idiot.

354
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:26,646
What the hell!

355
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:29,387
Oh, what is it?

356
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:30,484
- Nothing, Ma.
- Huh?

357
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,479
It's nothing. I just saw that bra,
only the nipples are covered.

358
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:36,838
[chuckles] Okay.

359
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:40,782
So, do you want this?
I'm buying it.

360
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:43,032
It'll be perfect for your dancing.

361
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,351
It's only 380, sir.

362
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:47,040
Can't it be...

363
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,726
- 300? 300.
- You've already bought me so much.

364
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:53,020
- Thank you, Ma.
- Don't worry about it.

365
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:54,132
That’s nothing.

366
00:42:56,606 --> 00:43:01,111
Ah, Ma, can I take tomorrow off?

367
00:43:03,724 --> 00:43:04,746
Why?

368
00:43:04,771 --> 00:43:10,507
My landlady found out that I work at a bar,
so there's that.

369
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:15,028
And her son has a crush on me.

370
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:17,994
Then the owner said...

371
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:23,282
I was seducing her son.

372
00:43:23,778 --> 00:43:27,636
And, I don't want to
get into an argument.

373
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,299
That's why I need to find
a new place tomorrow.

374
00:43:37,593 --> 00:43:38,677
Is that so?

375
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
Yeah.

376
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,943
This is my apartment, come in.

377
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,230
I just rent here too,
but it's cheap.

378
00:44:02,296 --> 00:44:04,755
Oh, by the way,
is it okay with you

379
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,866
if your room only has a fan?

380
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:09,652
But it does have a bed.

381
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:14,150
That's fine. In the province,
the electric fan was broken

382
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:18,260
and I was only using a
hand fan until my father died

383
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:23,509
So, this is much better
than my first rental.

384
00:44:25,865 --> 00:44:27,585
Okay, good. Come on.

385
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,825
Let's go upstairs, and
I'll show you your room.

386
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:30,850
Alright.

387
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:34,137
You can rest for now.

388
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:36,447
We'll all go into the
bar together later.

389
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:59,482
There! More hips!

390
00:44:59,932 --> 00:45:03,024
There! Throw it to
the left, to the right!

391
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:06,385
Yes! Down, down, down!

392
00:45:06,386 --> 00:45:07,611
There you go!

393
00:45:07,836 --> 00:45:11,696
Okay, here, here, come down the stage...

394
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:17,562
There, hold your boobs.
Yes, get close to the customer.

395
00:45:17,587 --> 00:45:21,960
Yes, touch him. Then caress him.

396
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:27,658
Then, move to the next customer.
Yes, then touch your pussy.

397
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:32,554
Yes, then smear it on
the guy's crotch! There!

398
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:36,933
Then dance again. Go back
to the stage, fondle your tits.

399
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:44,652
There, there! Then,
shake your tits! Like that!

400
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:49,092
Flirt more, flirt more!
Like that! Bite your lip.

401
00:45:49,243 --> 00:45:57,395
There, like that.
Then split! Perfect!

402
00:45:57,854 --> 00:46:01,424
You're so, so good! Of course,
this is for our big night!

403
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:04,827
You're so good,
I'm so proud of you!

404
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:07,664
- Ouch!
- Oh, Berna!

405
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,261
Oh, sorry.

406
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:11,252
I'm starting to catch on to you, huh!

407
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,718
I didn't mean to,
I already apologized.

408
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:18,396
What apology? You're even starting
a fight with the dancers here too.

409
00:46:19,017 --> 00:46:22,430
And the customers are
getting annoyed with you

410
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,046
because you're acting
so high and mighty.

411
00:46:24,185 --> 00:46:28,231
What is it? Do you still
want to work here, or not?

412
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,124
Get your act together!

413
00:46:35,282 --> 00:46:37,811
Let it go, Ma.
Maybe she's just tired.

414
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:40,850
She's always in a bad mood.

415
00:46:41,284 --> 00:46:43,933
All of us in the dressing room
are just holding back with her.

416
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,602
She's just jealous!

417
00:46:45,646 --> 00:46:47,189
Who would she be jealous of?

418
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:48,878
Don't worry about Berna.

419
00:46:49,027 --> 00:46:51,321
Pinky is clearly better than her.

420
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:52,626
Right, girls?

421
00:46:52,752 --> 00:46:54,962
- Truth!
- So true!

422
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,179
Okay, practice again.
Do a great job!

423
00:46:59,204 --> 00:47:03,961
Sweetie, the hips.
Right, left. There!

424
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:06,616
There! Down, down.
Lower, lower.

425
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:08,558
There! Yes!

426
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:19,935
- Oh, Pinky.
- Yeah?

427
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,130
I'm leaving for a bit, okay?

428
00:47:21,394 --> 00:47:25,719
I'm just going to pay the
water and electricity bills.

429
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:30,006
Later, you and Tolits
can go to the bar together.

430
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:31,657
I'll go straight there later. Okay?

431
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:34,679
Sure, Ma. Is Tolits ready?

432
00:47:34,823 --> 00:47:38,535
Ah, no. He's over there,
still snoring.

433
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,157
- Well, okay then—I'm leaving.
- Take care.

434
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,034
Oh, hey, I didn't notice you there.

435
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:12,067
Mama left first. She said,
she's paying the bills.

436
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:14,307
Then, we should just
follow her to the bar.

437
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:15,937
Is that so?

438
00:48:16,162 --> 00:48:17,162
Yeah.

439
00:48:17,905 --> 00:48:19,948
Oh, by the way,
this is my gift for you.

440
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,723
It's embarrassing,
but... thank you.

441
00:48:24,182 --> 00:48:25,725
Go on, try it on.

442
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,940
I'll just go to the comfort room.

443
00:48:27,965 --> 00:48:31,677
No, try it on here. Why
go to the comfort room?

444
00:48:32,685 --> 00:48:37,148
Are you shy around me? I see you
like this in the bar all the time.

445
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:07,627
Go on, let me have this.

446
00:49:08,451 --> 00:49:10,349
Promise, Mama won't find out.

447
00:49:26,855 --> 00:49:29,499
Wow, you're really sexy.

448
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,485
What do you think?
Will they like this?

449
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:39,787
Your customers will double.

450
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:44,734
Wait...

451
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:50,812
You know, the first time I saw you,
I really, really liked you.

452
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:53,054
Tolits...

453
00:52:39,642 --> 00:52:40,801
You’re really pretty.

454
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:44,253
You’re making me hard again.

455
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,621
Let’s do it again.

456
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,726
No, please. Mama might catch us.

457
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,411
If you don't give in to me,
that's your problem.

458
00:52:56,953 --> 00:53:01,040
Remember this, a secret
doesn't stay a secret forever.

459
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:11,188
Ma, let’s eat.

460
00:53:14,446 --> 00:53:18,816
Ooh, this dish is great.
Who cooked this?

461
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,139
I did.

462
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:22,691
You?

463
00:53:23,775 --> 00:53:25,806
Dig in, go ahead.

464
00:53:43,174 --> 00:53:45,281
You jerk, why do you have this?

465
00:53:46,034 --> 00:53:49,204
I didn't agree to that! Delete it!

466
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,416
I'll only delete this if you
help me with my problem.

467
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:58,700
I have a friend that

468
00:53:59,189 --> 00:54:01,822
I owe money to, and I haven't been
able to pay him back for a long time.

469
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:03,693
I don't have the cash either.

470
00:54:05,216 --> 00:54:07,552
Maybe you can take care of it.

471
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:17,353
He said if he gets to taste you,
he'll forget the debt.

472
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:20,372
Come on, just help me with this.

473
00:54:21,537 --> 00:54:26,062
Nobody else will know.
It will be our secret.

474
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,219
Now, if you need a
favor from me next time,

475
00:54:30,682 --> 00:54:34,142
I promise I'll give it
to you, I'll help you too.

476
00:54:38,202 --> 00:54:43,583
You're the only one he wants
because you're so beautiful and sexy.

477
00:54:43,653 --> 00:54:44,821
Let go of me!

478
00:54:48,176 --> 00:54:53,294
Well, are you going
to help me, or not?

479
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,351
It's up to you.

480
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:11,824
Come on in, bro.

481
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,534
Is Myrna here?

482
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:18,097
She left. Go on, head
straight over there.

483
00:55:18,188 --> 00:55:19,188
Did she really agree?

484
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,042
Of course, she did.

485
00:55:21,408 --> 00:55:22,423
For real?

486
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:23,895
Bro, I don't owe you
anything anymore, right?

487
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,538
Yeah, I got you.

488
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:39,571
Tolits? Tolits!

489
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:43,616
What is it? What happened?

490
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,108
Huh?

491
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:03,659
Come on.

492
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,246
Shit!

493
00:58:51,859 --> 00:58:57,665
Mr. Sy, can I get my salary now?

494
00:59:03,614 --> 00:59:06,742
Oh, hello. Good evening.

495
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:08,701
Is Sexy Pinky dancing tonight?

496
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:11,332
No, she's not around.

497
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:13,360
She's the only one we came here for.

498
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,004
Oh, really? Berna and
the other dancers are here.

499
00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:19,760
They're all good too.

500
00:59:20,905 --> 00:59:22,786
Maybe next time,
when Pinky is here.

501
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,767
Hey man, let's go to Golden Bar?

502
00:59:30,505 --> 00:59:31,505
Myrna!

503
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,452
What is happening here, Myrna?

504
00:59:37,048 --> 00:59:38,759
I thought you said business was great?

505
00:59:40,426 --> 00:59:44,580
Why are there no customers?
The business is losing money!

506
00:59:45,931 --> 00:59:50,667
Our star model is absent, sir, she's sick.

507
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,386
There are no guests, just
because she's not around?

508
00:59:54,277 --> 00:59:55,862
There are plenty of women here, right?

509
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,434
What? Are they useless?

510
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:04,264
The guests only look for Pinky, sir.

511
01:00:04,658 --> 01:00:07,737
Then why don't you hire
a girl as good as Pinky?

512
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,212
It's tough to do
that these days, sir.

513
01:00:12,373 --> 01:00:17,009
Lots of girls applied, but
none are on Pinky's level.

514
01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:21,975
Are we just going to wait?
Find a way.

515
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:25,613
If it keeps being like this,
I'm going to fire you.

516
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:29,082
You're old anyway!
I'll find a replacement!

517
01:00:29,312 --> 01:00:31,701
That's harsh, sir.

518
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:34,497
I've been working here
since I was eighteen.

519
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:37,149
I used to be the one bringing in
all the money here, remember?

520
01:00:37,174 --> 01:00:40,474
With how good I was at
dancing and entertaining guests.

521
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,093
No credit at all?

522
01:00:43,197 --> 01:00:46,133
Don't take it personally,
this is a business.

523
01:00:46,158 --> 01:00:49,882
It needs to make
money to pay all of you.

524
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:55,592
Unbelievable, I grew old working for you!

525
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,522
I don't care if you can't
make the bar profitable.

526
01:00:59,547 --> 01:01:02,714
Find another job if
anyone will still hire you.

527
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,361
I'm leaving! You're all
giving me a headache.

528
01:01:05,386 --> 01:01:08,550
Sir Sy, relax. Watch your heart.

529
01:01:09,922 --> 01:01:11,789
I'll walk you out.

530
01:01:12,852 --> 01:01:17,606
[indistinct chatting]

531
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:31,865
Hey, how's the bar?

532
01:01:33,615 --> 01:01:38,411
I got into a fight with Mr. Sy.

533
01:01:39,198 --> 01:01:42,910
Because there was no one there,
so he got mad.

534
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:51,399
Get rid of my erection first.

535
01:01:51,766 --> 01:01:54,907
What? I'm tired!

536
01:01:57,038 --> 01:01:58,124
Come on.

537
01:01:58,149 --> 01:02:00,569
- No way.
- Let's cool your head down.

538
01:02:00,594 --> 01:02:02,561
- Just relax.
- What are you doing?

539
01:02:04,828 --> 01:02:06,567
It's not happening! I'm tired!

540
01:02:10,433 --> 01:02:11,494
You bitch!

541
01:02:11,907 --> 01:02:13,659
Damn you!

542
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:18,767
I said I'm tired!
What's wrong with you, huh?

543
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:27,170
When I say I want it,
I want it. Okay?

544
01:02:29,472 --> 01:02:30,511
Stop it!

545
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:33,967
I said I want to rest!
I'm so exhausted!

546
01:02:41,081 --> 01:02:43,167
Hey Myrna! Get down here!

547
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:45,412
You piece of trash!

548
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:31,126
You ungrateful pigs!

549
01:04:31,571 --> 01:04:33,517
Son of a bitch!

550
01:04:33,551 --> 01:04:36,466
- Didn't I tell you not to mess with her?
- Myrna! Myrna, wait! Calm down.

551
01:04:36,491 --> 01:04:39,781
- Not to touch Pinky? What did you do?
- Just calm down. Myrna, wait!

552
01:04:39,808 --> 01:04:41,244
- You disgusting pigs!
- Wait, hold on!

553
01:04:41,269 --> 01:04:43,855
- You make me sick!
- Calm down!

554
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,956
Damn you! You piece of trash!

555
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,359
- Myrna, wait!
- We're done! Get the hell out of here!

556
01:04:48,402 --> 01:04:50,665
Damn you! Get out!

557
01:04:52,112 --> 01:04:54,657
Get out of here!
Don't you ever come back!

558
01:04:56,376 --> 01:04:59,860
You scoundrel! You're so ungrateful!

559
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:02,604
He forced me to.

560
01:05:05,327 --> 01:05:07,612
And I'm not really ungrateful,

561
01:05:07,717 --> 01:05:10,317
because I have nothing
to be grateful to you for!

562
01:05:11,264 --> 01:05:16,364
Since the day I was born,
and my father died,

563
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:21,336
I never saw a mother who
took care of me, or guided me

564
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:25,782
because you are a worthless mother!

565
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:43,326
I couldn't handle
your father's life there.

566
01:05:45,596 --> 01:05:47,024
That's why right after
I gave birth to you,

567
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:49,579
I immediately came back to work.

568
01:05:50,903 --> 01:05:55,856
To save money,
and get both of you.

569
01:05:57,428 --> 01:06:02,825
At my father's grave,
I promised I would find you...

570
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:07,225
To rub your sins
against us in your face!

571
01:06:11,857 --> 01:06:13,958
Why did you leave us?

572
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,786
Why didn't you come back?

573
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,545
Forgive me, Abel.

574
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:29,973
I just got buried in debt,
so I couldn't go back.

575
01:06:31,743 --> 01:06:34,440
I had no face to show you.

576
01:06:36,457 --> 01:06:47,750
Since I was a child, all I've
had inside my chest is anger!

577
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:55,948
I planned everything
just to find you.

578
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,011
That feeling you have?

579
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:05,338
It's not even a fraction of what
my father and I went through.

580
01:07:09,449 --> 01:07:10,617
Forgive me, my daughter!

581
01:07:14,203 --> 01:07:15,473
Forgive me!

582
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:19,715
You know...

583
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:26,283
You were always on my mind and
in my heart, no one else, every day.

584
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:31,403
My daughter! If only you knew how I felt.

585
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,796
My child...

586
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,384
That would be 3500.

587
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:13,664
Oh... Here.

588
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:16,963
Ma'am, this is too much.

589
01:10:16,988 --> 01:10:19,824
- Ah, that's okay. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

590
01:11:11,584 --> 01:11:12,836
A fresh start?

591
01:11:19,684 --> 01:11:25,486
Let me make it up to you, in
any way I can, my daughter.

592
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:27,561
For as long as I can.
