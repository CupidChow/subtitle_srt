I have

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,793
a surprise for you.

19
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,732
I took more items from the laundry.

20
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,482
Love,

21
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:43,031
I'm sure you'll love this.

22
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:45,586
I think you'll look good in it.

23
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,657
Let's try it on.

24
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:08,021
There, put your arm here.

25
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:12,381
It's exactly your size.

26
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,933
You'd look really cute as a…

27
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:21,685
professor.

28
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,240
Let's start.

29
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,159
Sir?

30
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,662
Sir, I came here because...

31
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,790
I was hoping to improve my grades.

32
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,403
Sir?

33
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,937
Sir, what do I need to do?

34
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:51,259
Do I need to take removals?

35
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:53,759
Is this what you want?

36
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,723
Is this what you want, sir?

37
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,550
Is this what it takes

38
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,661
to improve my grades?

39
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,249
Sir…

40
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,236
Sir, does it feel good?

41
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:15,659
Sir, is this okay?

42
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,426
What about that, sir?

43
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,304
Do you like that?

44
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,268
Sir,

45
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:29,420
is this how you like it?

46
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,529
Sir!

47
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,532
Sir, answer me!

48
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,617
What do you want?

49
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,788
Sir, please!

50
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,084
Sir!

51
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,101
Did you enjoy that, my love?

52
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:12,087
You didn't look like
you were enjoying it.

53
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,634
You know,

54
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,970
the person who
owns that uniform…

55
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:24,254
I feel like

56
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,810
her boyfriend's having
so much fun with her.

57
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:34,276
I think he already got her pregnant.

58
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,757
For sure,

59
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,760
she's pregnant.

60
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,231
What about me, love?

61
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,199

I didn't see you there.

00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,137
Good morning, Miss Gloria.

89
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,271
Good morning.

90
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:06,154
You have a pending load?

91
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,881
Just this last one.

92
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,179
Hi!

93
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,686
Here's your laundry.

94
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:41,356
Thanks. How much for everything?

95
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,281
Nobody else can
know about this, okay?

96
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,232
Promise?

97
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,880
Please...

98
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:01,202
Excuse me?

99
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:02,502
Are you okay?

100
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:04,914
Ah.

101
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,550
The total is 185.

102
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,778
Here. Thanks!

103
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,586
Thanks.

104
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,870
Her tummy's showing, isn't it?

105
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,497
Looks to me like

106
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,068
it's been three months.

107
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,049
Are you sure?

108
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:29,438
Please.

109
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,785
It's so obvious.

110
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,632
And did you notice

111
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,175
how much water she drinks?

112
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,051
I was the same way

113
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,386
when I was pregnant with Albert.

114
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,140
I hope she's ready to be a mom.

115
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,207
She's so young.
What a waste.

116
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:45,420
Well, then,

117
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,131
I better get this delivered.

118
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,274
Let me do it.

119
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:51,523
Huh?

120
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,527
I'll do it.

121
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,362
Sure?

122
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,071
Yeah.

123
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,106
All right.

124
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,114
Thanks.

125
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,354
Does it feel good?

126
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,524
Laundry delivery, ma'am.

127
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,493
I'll just get the money.

128
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,179
Here. Keep the change.

129
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,598
This is not enough, ma'am.

130
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,501
Oh, sorry. Here's 500.

131
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,476
Thank you.

132
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,812
Thank you, ma'am.

133
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,106
By the way, Doc,

134
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,108
if you ever need an intern,

135
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,692
my son Albert

136
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,152
is in med school.

137
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:40,612
Wow!

138
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,048
That's amazing!

139
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,741
Has he thought
about a specialization?

140
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,701
- Special what?
- I'll take that.

141
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,735
Oh, okay.

142
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,596
Okay, so just tell him

143
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,223
to send me his application.

144
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,082
Okay?

145
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,542
Thanks, Doc.

146
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:54,359
Here you are, Doc.

147
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,548
I wonder what kind of doctor
Doc Raquel is.

148
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:06,841
I actually have no idea.

149
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,016
But I hope she's a doctor for the rich

150
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,048
so she can help Albert.

151
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,175
I guess even

152
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,384
professionals aren't so
different from us, love, huh?

153
00:14:46,328 --> 00:14:49,134
They may look
serious on the outside

154
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,423
but they still feel horny.

155
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:55,753
They may seem formal,

156
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,759
but they've got perverted sides too.

157
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,934
It's like,

158
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,095
as he gets closer,

159
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,475
your heart starts beating faster.

160
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:12,979
Let's check your heartbeat.

161
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:26,537
Why isn't it beating faster?

162
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,681
Would you like me
to make it go faster?

163
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,312
Take a deep breath.

164
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,950
Why isn't it changing?

165
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,412
Oh, I know.

166
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,694
Why is it still slow?

167
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,531
Why isn't it getting faster?

168
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,810
There we go!

169
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,770
It's going fast now, love!

170
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:09,466
It's beating faster now, love!

171
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,683
Love.

172
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,749
Are you okay, love?

173
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,287
Where to, miss?

174
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,831
Need a ride?

175
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,958
Yeah.

176
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,817
It won't start.

177
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,444
I'll just go down.

178
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,157
You're not leaving, Doc.

179
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:39,104
I need you to check
on something for me.

180
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,054
Listen to this, partner.

181
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,973
Another body was found

182
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,182
dead near the creek side

183
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,600
just this morning.

184
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,102
Partner,

185
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,145
Is this the one that was injected

186
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,646
with poison into his neck?

187
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,606
Wasn't there another similar case

188
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,983
just last week?

189
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:12,890
Could it be a serial killer?

190
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,004
- Oh my god,
- Oh no, my friend.

191
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,157
- I hope not.
- Your theory is alarming.

192
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:21,578
But is it really possible to have a
serial killer in the Philippines, partner?

193
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,164
We only hear about those abroad.

194
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,499
Let's ask the police, partner.

195
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,710
Because the question is,

196
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,504
how competent are our police
force with their investigations

197
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,203
for them to make
connections between the killings?

198
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,737
Let's sit down with the chief
of Police North Division

199
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,889
to clarify the rumours
going around social media.

200
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:41,969
Meldie?

201
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,934
Can I leave you in charge?

202
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,200
Why, miss?

203
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:51,791
Are you going home?

204
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,281
That's the plan.

205
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,711
I need to take on extra laundry jobs.

206
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:01,964
Albert needs 60 thousand for his project.

207
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,914
That's a lot of money.

208
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:08,733
You said it.

209
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,218
Okay, miss.

210
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,661
You can go ahead.

211
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,939
I can manage.

212
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,133
Thank you.

213
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,430
Hi, miss!
Just here to pick up.

214
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:32,428
Doc,

215
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,959
here's your laundry.

216
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,361
Oh, dear.

217
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,654
Thanks!

218
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,640
And you left your bag.

219
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:41,758
Oh, so I left it here.

220
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,091
Thanks.

221
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,451
Hang on,

222
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,748
here's my payment.

223
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,664
- Thank you, Doc.
- Bye!

224
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:48,565
Okay. Take care.

225
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,753
Doc, wait.

226
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,133

Excuse me, ma'am.

262
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,389
I'm looking for something.

263
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,362
What is it, sir?

264
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:15,223
The other pair of sock

265
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:16,499
from my last laundry?

266
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:17,442
It's missing.

267
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,857
Oh,

268
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,217
Meldie...

269
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,379
Is this the one, sir?

270
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,503
Thanks.

271
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,745
I'm dropping off a new batch.

272
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,440
So you're a police officer.

273
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:37,896
Huh?

274
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:39,386
How did you know?

275
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:50,800
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

276
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,390
I'll do it. I'll do it.

277
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:56,669
- I'll do it.
- Let me help you.

278
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,104
Thank you, sir.

279
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,144
Sir, I know your girlfriend.

280
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:13,706
She's a model.

281
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:16,038
I know who you are.

282
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,124
I deliver to you

283
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:19,650
at the top floor unit.

284
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:24,818
She's so lucky to have

285
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,550
a police officer as her boyfriend.

286
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:29,893
I don't think so.

287
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:33,308
I'm rarely home these days
because of all the killings.

288
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,190
We're investigating them.

289
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:36,847
They say it's a serial killer.

290
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:40,601
All right,

291
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:41,801
I should go.

292
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,987
Your receipt, sir.

293
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,338
Take care, Mr. Palma.

294
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,447
Huh?

295
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,987
Again, how did you know?

296
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,665
Just call me Jacob.

297
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,293
I'm Meldie.

298
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,338
Okay, I'll go ahead. Thanks.

299
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:24,381
What are you giggling about?

300
00:25:25,238 --> 00:25:26,406
Nothing, miss.

301
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,570
I just remember that last time

302
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,388
I went to deliver to their unit.

303
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,635
I heard them doing something.

304
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,339
They sounded really fond of each other.

305
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:40,807
I even took a peek.

306
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,995
Jesus Christ,

307
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,987
what did you see?

308
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,215
This one.

309
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,843
This is what

310
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:53,619
the girlfriend was wearing.

311
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,214
And the guy was

312
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:59,205
wearing a red polo shirt.

313
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,276
I can't find it in this pile, actually.

314
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:04,279
Miss Gloria,

315
00:26:04,326 --> 00:26:05,702
what if

316
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:07,722
she was with a different guy?

317
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,613
Stop playing detective
and throw that in the washer!

318
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,410
But you know what?

319
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,787
It's not so uncommon.

320
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:24,166
My neighbor's husband
is also a police officer

321
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,002
and that's exactly
what's happening to them.

322
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,472
You're not entirely off the mark.

323
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:29,547
What have you got there?

324
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:32,758
Hey!

325
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:33,823
What's that?

326
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:41,767
So...

327
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,394
Where do you want to eat?

328
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,021
Anywhere.

329
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:48,441
We can always go to our
favorite Japanese restaurant.

330
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,400
We could.

331
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,109
Your treat?

332
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,527
No, your treat.

333
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:53,387
You have so many projects.

334
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,553
Did you check their page
what time they close?

335
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:04,332
Not yet, but I'm
sure they're still open.

336
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,445
Babe, do we still
have food in the fridge?

337
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,739
I think we ran out.

338
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:49,225
We could have something
delivered if you like.

339
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:52,411
Okay.

340
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,039
What do you want?

341
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,297
Anything.

342
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,759
Or I could fix us something.

343
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:10,425
Nah, it's okay.
We're both tired.

344
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,016
By the way, babe.

345
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:18,128
They gave me a new case.

346
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,120
They say it's a serial killer

347
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:21,690
but...

348
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:24,058
we don't have any leads yet.

349
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:25,799
So I might

350
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,925
not be home for a few days.

351
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:33,503
Can we have
dinner next Friday?

352
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,659
I'll reserve a table
at our favorite restaurant.

353
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,847
Next Friday, babe?

354
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,933
My talent agent Gino
set a meeting with a producer.

355
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:44,597
I can't move that.

356
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,050
Babe, can you
prioritize me for once?

357
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:52,784
You're always putting
your career first.

358
00:32:54,491 --> 00:32:57,410
So if it's my career,
I can't prioritize it?

359
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:05,818
Sorry.

360
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,531
Sorry.

361
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:14,994
Sorry.

- Ma.
- Hey.

477
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,974
- What's up?
- Hey, son!

478
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:09,776
Are you sick, ma?

479
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,261

I'm just tired.

480
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,888

00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,808
By the way, Ma.

484
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,661
We have a project coming up.

485
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,312
Thought maybe you
could spare some cash.

486
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,731
Son, sorry, I can't.

487
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:25,066
- I knew it.
- I already gave it all to you.

488
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,818
Ma, you always say
you're out of cash!

489
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,646
Okay, son. Look.

490
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,280
I'll make it up to you.

491
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,032
Just wait a little longer.
I'll take on more jobs.

492
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,658
But I really need it for the project.

493
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:35,093
It's almost submission.

494
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:35,869
Whatever, Ma.

495
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,121
- Hey, let's talk about this.
- Just wash these.

496
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:40,565
Okay, but... wait!

497
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,529
Sorry about my son.

498
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:21,732
He's very busy in med school.

499
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,982
He's stressed

500
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:26,909
that's why he's got a temper.

501
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:31,170
You still wash your son's briefs?

502
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:39,850

503
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,918

505
00:42:46,052 --> 00:42:48,233

506
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:49,881

507
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,170

508
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,162
Yes?

509
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,967
I'm pretty sure
I had seven thousand in my pocket.

510
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,381
That's all there was, sir.

511
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,248
Are you sure?

512
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,670
That's all that we found, sir.

513
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:10,670

514
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:16,245

00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,483

517
00:43:47,187 --> 00:43:49,482

518
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:17,072

519
00:44:17,097 --> 00:44:18,390

523
00:44:29,192 --> 00:44:31,069

544
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:48,972

545
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,874

00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,006
I'll do it, ma'am.

563
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:01,971
It's my day-off anyway.

564
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:03,304
You sure?

565
00:47:03,633 --> 00:47:04,735
Yes, ma'am.

566
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:05,657
All right.

567
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:06,724
Come in.

568
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:13,515
I'm so embarrassed

569
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,084
asking you to do this for me.

570
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,045
This is where you left off?

571
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,630
I'll take it from here.

572
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,214
Yes.

573
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,049
Wanna come with me first

574
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:25,601
so I can show you what needs cleaning?

575
00:47:26,326 --> 00:47:28,429
- Let's go?
- Okay, ma'am.

576
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:32,708
Come here.

577
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:35,711
There are no more
cleansers in the kitchen.

578
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,630
But there's more right here.

579
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,160
Why do you have so many of those?

580
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:43,753
I'm being sponsored by this product.

581
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,421
I'm a quick bright beauty.

582
00:47:45,523 --> 00:47:47,010
They keep sending me bottles.

583
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:49,826
You can take some
for your laundry shop if you like.

584
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,828
Like their page, too.

585
00:47:51,853 --> 00:47:53,536
Hashtag quick bright!

586
00:47:54,055 --> 00:47:54,931
Wow,

587
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,472
you have hydrochloric acid, too?

588
00:47:57,684 --> 00:47:58,810
- Yes.
- Also a sponsor?

589
00:47:58,835 --> 00:47:59,816
Yeah.

590
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,882
Well, I gotta get dressed.

591
00:48:03,907 --> 00:48:04,958
Here you go.

592
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:06,722
- Okay, got it.
- Okay.

593
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,030
All done, Meldie?

594
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,199
Ma'am,

595
00:48:29,224 --> 00:48:31,114
I made you some coffee.

596
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,339
Thank you.

597
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,622
Oh, hey,

598
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:36,940
good job.

599
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,339
Where's your coffee?

600
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,785
I don't drink coffee.

601
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:51,070
Thank you.

602
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,865
I wouldn't have finished cleaning

603
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,141
if not for you.

604
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,660
No problem, ma'am.

605
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:08,410
I'm almost always doing a shoot

606
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,144
so I'm neglecting the condo.

607
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:15,655
I want to be you.

608
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,496
I want to be like you.

609
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,416
An actress.

610
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,294
I'm not an actress.

611
00:49:23,603 --> 00:49:25,021
Not yet.

612
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,006
Just supporting roles.

613
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,075
You'll get your break, ma'am.

614
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,314
You're on very close terms with

615
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,390
your talent agent, aren't you?

616
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,433
Huh?

617
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,056
I mean...

618
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,401
I'm sure your talent agent
will take good care of you.

619
00:49:48,266 --> 00:49:50,654
You seem like you're very nice to him.

620
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:53,345
Am I right?

621
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,935
You're doing everything he asks you to.

622
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,189
So I believe you'll become famous.

623
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,859
Your name and face
will be on every news.

624
00:50:04,152 --> 00:50:05,736
You'll be famous, ma'am.

625
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:10,866
Thank you.

626
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:12,010
And...

627
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:14,887
Don't call me "ma'am."

628
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:16,331
Call me Celine.

629
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:20,159
Ah,

630
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,704
I'm gonna be late.

631
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,771
Here's for your trouble.

632
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,607
Thank you, ma'am.

633
00:50:57,478 --> 00:50:58,598
Sorry,

634
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,140
are we running late?

635
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:01,476
We're still good.

636
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,269
There are other talents waiting there.

637
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,437
We still have time.

638
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:05,505
Okay, then.

639
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:54,754
Let's do this later.

640
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,030
We'll be late.

641
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,906
Okay.

642
00:51:56,931 --> 00:51:57,999
- Let's go?
- Let's go.

643
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,862
I thought you said
you loved Jacob?

644
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,429
I'm sorry for your loss.

645
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,039
Thank you.

646
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:26,780
We didn't expect it.

647
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:28,254
It's so sudden,

648
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,921
how about me?

649
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:36,804
What happened to her?

650
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,931
To Carly?

651
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,643
She had a severe infection.

652
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,122
We don't even know

653
00:52:46,147 --> 00:52:47,856
where she got it from.

654
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,949
What about her child,
what happened to it?

655
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,177
Her child?

656
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,078
She meant your children,

657
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,839
Carly's siblings?

658
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,275
How are they taking it?

659
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,243
They're in shock, too.

660
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:18,178
Her sister

661
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,931
had to fly back from London.

662
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,142
I should go.

663
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,824
Are you okay, young lady?

664
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,062
It only hurts the first time.

665
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,746
Open your legs.

666
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,626
Doc,

667
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:15,937
do you know a Carly Alejandro?

668
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,091
Why do you ask?

669
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,760
She's my bestfriend.

670
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,055
She died last week.

671
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,599
Isn't that because of you?

672
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,725
Dear,

673
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,269
every girl

674
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:33,688
comes to my clinic
of their own accord

675
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:36,399
to get rid of their problem.

676
00:54:37,762 --> 00:54:39,388
They got themselves pregnant.

677
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,302
Why blame it on me?

678
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,123
They played with fire,

679
00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:45,241
it's their fault.

680
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,037
Do you know who's the father?

681
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,929
What's with all the ques--

682
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:15,313
Carly's father couldn't
even avenge her.

683
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:18,399
So I did it myself.

684
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,944
I can do it anyway.

685
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,989
Because he doesn't know the truth

686
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,306
about his own daughter.

687
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:28,540
But

688
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,729
I know everything.

689
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,710
I also know

690
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,695
that those damn bullies

691
00:55:42,052 --> 00:55:44,658
are nothing but worms

692
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:47,720
once you stand up to them.

693
00:55:53,643 --> 00:55:55,294
You know that now, don't you?

694
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:58,898
Putting up a tough front,

695
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,385
but they're nothing.

696
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,849
But doesn't it feel good?

697
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,478
To know there's someone who loves you

698
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:15,571
enough to fight for you?

699
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,171
Can you do that?

700
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,007
You can do that, right?

701
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:09,635
Ma.

702
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:12,138
- Oh, son!
- Where's my clean laundry?

703
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,199
We're still going through the queue.

704
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,976
Ma, I needed it today!

705
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:17,935
Sorry, son.

706
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:18,769
It's still sitting there.

707
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,645
The line's really long.

708
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,188
Bullshit. Just make it happen.

709
00:57:21,213 --> 00:57:22,948
The line's not my fault.

710
00:57:22,998 --> 00:57:25,543
I didn't say it's your fault, son,

711
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:27,563
Whatever. Just wash these, too.

712
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,072
Albert!

713
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,825
Albert!

714
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:37,580
Breaking News!

715
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,665
Another update, folks.

716
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,751
Watch yourself out there.

717
00:57:41,751 --> 00:57:46,213
Another doctor was found dead
yesterday in his clinic.

718
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,090
It is suspected that the recent victim

719
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:52,636
is connected to the serial killer
who is still at large.

720
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,096
And listen here folks,

721
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:57,808
the killer used poison and acid.

722
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,143
Let's take extra precautions

723
00:57:59,168 --> 00:58:02,780
and tune in for more details
when we come back.

724
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:21,845
Hi, Meldie.

725
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:23,793
Hi, sir.

726
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:30,191
Is this for delivery, too?

727
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,550
Yes, please.

728
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:32,657
Thank you.

729
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,251
How are you doing, sir?

730
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:37,423
Just call me Jacob.

731
00:58:40,534 --> 00:58:41,494
Didn't you--

732
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,896
Didn't you say you're assigned

733
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,339
to that serial killer case?

734
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,488
Yeah, but

735
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,115
I might just give it up.

736
00:58:57,493 --> 00:58:58,702
Why?

737
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:06,151
I've been working
the case for so long,

738
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,504
but I still haven't got a lead.

739
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,341
I've been neglecting my girlfriend

740
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:13,634
so I think we should go abroad.

741
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:15,477
Our life might be better there.

742
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:18,148
Don't!

743
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:20,272
Huh?

744
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,144
Nothing, sir.

745
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:34,221
Looks like you're really busy, Meldie.

746
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,491
Nothing wrong with keeping busy, sir.

747
00:59:37,516 --> 00:59:38,643
But,

748
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,019
Miss Gloria's son

749
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,272
keeps dumping more laundry on us.

750
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,609
He's leaving all sorts of
things in his pocket.

751
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:55,540
What's that?

752
00:59:57,354 --> 00:59:59,000
I don't know.

753
00:59:59,321 --> 01:00:00,664
He's a med student

754
01:00:00,973 --> 01:00:03,485
but he's really messy with his things.

755
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,595
I'm scared of him sometimes.

756
01:00:07,162 --> 01:00:08,247
He looks like

757
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,232
he's up to no good.

758
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,272
Isn't that what's
on the news these days?

759
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,658
About the killings.

760
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,414
If I was a gossip,

761
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,417
I would

762
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,171
suspect him for sure.

763
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,509
Good thing I'm not a gossip.

764
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,480
Ah, Meldie,

765
01:00:49,505 --> 01:00:50,589
can I take a picture?

766
01:00:51,419 --> 01:00:52,467
Okay.

767
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,532
Meldie,

768
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,147
just the box, if that's okay.

769
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:14,600
Thank you.

770
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,887
You're welcome, babe.

771
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:25,082
I'm very, very proud of you.

772
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,905
I'm very proud of you, babe.

773
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:39,863
Don't ever leave me, babe.

774
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,408
Don't leave me, okay?

775
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,747
Don't leave me, babe.

776
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:52,526
Don't leave me, Jacob.

777
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,879
Bite me, please.

778
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,013
I was on my way to deliver it.

779
01:02:46,038 --> 01:02:47,425
Thanks, Meldie.

780
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:09,568
Hey, how's it going?

781
01:03:11,294 --> 01:03:12,380
Take care.

782
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,966
Hello?

783
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:15,934
Yes.

784
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,216
Yes. I'm on my way.

785
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:19,630
I told you,

786
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,633
he won't be back till next week.

787
01:03:55,989 --> 01:03:57,004
Hi.

788
01:03:58,894 --> 01:04:01,613
I managed to secure
three endorsements for you.

789
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:03,048
So...

790
01:04:03,899 --> 01:04:06,660
our client wants to meet you
by next week.

791
01:04:07,465 --> 01:04:08,985
Is this the contract?

792
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:11,192
That can wait.

793
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:27,776
Meldie?

794
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,530
What did you do to Gino?

795
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,532
Gino!

796
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,159
Gino!

797
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,290

Jacob?

832
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:34,189
What are you doing here?

833
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:41,196
I'm sorry about what
happened to Celine.

834
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:43,990
Are you okay?

835
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,454
I'm okay.

836
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:51,540
Thank you.

837
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:05,637
I remember Celine

838
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:06,930
had a dress like that.

839
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:12,394
Ah, she gave this to me.

840
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,229
That's why I really liked her.

841
01:11:15,564 --> 01:11:16,439
Sorry,

842
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,275
did you mistake me for her?

843
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:22,659
Not really.

844
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,197
But it suits you.

845
01:11:28,243 --> 01:11:29,894
How are you doing these days?

846
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:31,644
All right.

847
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,081
I got promoted.

848
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:35,464
You were right about your hunch.

849
01:11:35,862 --> 01:11:37,129
I appreciate it.

850
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,171
I'm proud of you.

851
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:44,467
I'm very proud of you, Jacob.

852
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,768
Do you have plans after this?

853
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:42,525
I miss her.

854
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:46,758
I'm sorry.

855
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:48,563
I'm sorry Meldie.

856
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,105

I want to be you.

860
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,613

No,

I hoped that you'll like me.

Am I right?

916
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:36,811
I was so jealous of Loren.

917
01:18:42,035 --> 01:18:44,264
Because you were doing it to her,

918
01:18:44,851 --> 01:18:46,280
but not to me.

919
01:18:53,438 --> 01:18:54,981
Isn't that right?

920
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,945
I wanted you to do to me

921
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:03,573
what you were doing
to her so badly.

922
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,993
The things you did to your daughter.

923
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:10,705
You want this too, sweetie?

924
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,543
Daddy…

925
01:19:28,896 --> 01:19:30,239
Daddy…

926
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:39,609
The things you were doing to her,

927
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:45,073
I want you to do them to me.

928
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,952
Why don't you ever look my way?

929
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,794
Is it because I'm just a maid?

930
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,141
Meldie,

931
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,560
can I tell you a secret?

932
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,063
Of course.

933
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:20,983
Please don't tell anyone,

934
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,902
even Miss Tess.

935
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:25,947
Okay,

936
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:28,950
I won't tell ma'am.

937
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:31,577
It's about Daddy…

938
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:34,413
What about sir Manny?

939
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:36,133
When Mommy's not around,

940
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,209
he comes into my room.

941
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,128
And then?

942
01:20:40,128 --> 01:20:42,839
And then he undresses me

943
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:44,590
and dresses me up.

944
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,383
Then

945
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:47,969
what does he do to you?

946
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:50,388
He makes me wear

947
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,348
his costumes.

948
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:55,726
Huh?

949
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:59,897
He molests me, Meldie.

950
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,570
Then

951
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,405
he gets a taste of you?

952
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:10,158
He keeps using me over and over.

953
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:13,748
I don't know what to do.

954
01:21:14,579 --> 01:21:17,248
I'm scared, Meldie.

955
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:19,250
Help me.

956
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:24,005
My period is two weeks late.

957
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,675
I think I'm pregnant, Meldie.

958
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:31,929
Her stories about you
were making me so wet.

959
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:35,474
But why couldn't
you do them to me?

960
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:39,145
Why didn't you make
me feel that way?

961
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,693
I never felt you try
to make me feel good.

962
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,295
It doesn't matter now.

963
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,717
I've found someone new.

964
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:13,512
I finally found someone

965
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,724
who accepts all of me.

966
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,522
I don't have to pretend

967
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:24,690
to be anyone else anymore.

968
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:37,912
He's nothing like you.

969
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:50,132
I don't need to force myself on him.

970
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:26,937
Sir? Let me join you, sir.

971
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:32,276
What the fuck are you doing in here?

972
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:34,737
I want you to do to me

973
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:37,198
what you're doing to Loren.

974
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,829
What the fuck, Meldie.

975
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:45,831
Are you stupid?

976
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,917
Loren's my daughter.

977
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:50,503
You're just the maid.

978
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:53,481
I only get turned on by my own blood.

979
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:54,965
But she doesn't want you.

980
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:59,512
I want you so much.

981
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:03,391
Daddy...

982
01:25:05,059 --> 01:25:06,435
Get away from me for fuck's sake.

983
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,101
Thank you so much,

984
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:49,478
sir Manny.

985
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,275
Because you came along with me.

986
01:25:57,945 --> 01:26:00,656
Even if you never really loved me.

987
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,832
But you're free.

988
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:15,713

- The last washer's available.
- Okay. Thank you.

996
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,352
Hon,

997
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:35,834
guess what.

998
01:27:35,859 --> 01:27:36,860
Your favorite.

999
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:42,174
How's work?

1000
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:45,883
Chief's retiring.

1001
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,805
Guess who's gonna get promoted?

1002
01:27:49,557 --> 01:27:51,016
We'll never have to think

1003
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:53,383
about money once
the baby comes out.

1004
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:02,611
Hang on a second, hon.

1005
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:12,874
Sir?

1006
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:15,916
You've identified the body?

1007
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,005
Manuel del Mundo?

1008
01:28:25,593 --> 01:28:26,635
Okay, I'm on my way.

1009
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:33,517
Hon,

1010
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:38,439
Hon, I need to go
back to the precinct, okay?

1011
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:42,276
They found a body in the river.

1012
01:28:42,276 --> 01:28:44,528
It's wrapped real tight
and it's decomposing.

1013
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:46,238
I need to be there.

1014
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,741
Let's just meet back home, okay?

1015
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:49,700
Bye, baby.

1016
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:53,370
- Be careful, okay?
- Okay.

1017
01:29:12,473 --> 01:29:13,641
Have you found the suspect

1018
01:29:13,641 --> 01:29:15,643
for that body in the river?

1019
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:20,731
Not yet, hon.

1020
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,566
But

1021
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,068
the victim's relative

1022
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:26,111
has a suspect in mind.

1023
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:27,446
They haven't released a statement

1024
01:29:28,197 --> 01:29:29,365
so

1025
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:31,033
we're still waiting
for strong evidence.

1026
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:46,467
Sorry, hon.

1027
01:29:47,581 --> 01:29:48,943
I'm just not in the mood tonight.

1028
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:51,138
I have too much on my mind.

1029
01:29:55,099 --> 01:29:56,809
For this evening's news.

1030
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,769
The police are currently reaching out

1031
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:01,313
to the relatives of
Dr. Manuel Del Mundo

1032
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:04,233
His body was found
in the river last week,

1033
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:06,485
wrapped very tightly and in the
advanced stage of decomposition

1034
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:09,029
Dr. Del Mundo and his daughter

1035
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:11,240
were reported
missing five years ago.

1036
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:29,099
Meldie...

1037
01:30:39,139 --> 01:30:40,787
I knew it.

1038
01:30:41,411 --> 01:30:43,547
I'm the first one you'd look for.

1039
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,698
Why did you do that to me?

1040
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:54,658
I was just helping you.

1041
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:59,580
I got you out of it.

1042
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:02,124
I did what he wanted.

1043
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,336
I thought you were my friend.

1044
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:07,963
That you cared about me.

1045
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:15,037
I want to be you.

1046
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:21,018
I want to be you in his eyes.

1047
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:24,287
And if I have to replace
you for that to happen,

1048
01:31:25,214 --> 01:31:27,232

Jacob?

1079
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:01,863
It's--

1080
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:04,533
It's--

1081
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:07,786
It's Loren.

1082
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:11,206
This was supposed to be Loren.

1083
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,668
This was supposed to be Loren.

1084
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:24,720
I didn't--

1085
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,472
I didn't mean to!

1086
01:35:37,566 --> 01:35:40,485
I only did it because

1087
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:43,613
I didn't want you to leave me.

1088
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:46,742
I don't want you to
stay away from me.

1089
01:35:48,702 --> 01:35:50,454
What do you mean?

1090
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,416
I'll tell you everything,

1091
01:35:57,461 --> 01:36:00,756
just help me clean this up.

Jac--

1094
01:36:17,731 --> 01:36:19,858
Didn't you say…

1095
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:24,529
that you wanted to
know the real me?

1096
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:29,785
This is the real me.

1097
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:39,002
Even if I killed all of them,

1098
01:36:42,005 --> 01:36:44,883
do you still love me?

1099
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:57,312
Will you still love me?

1100
01:37:11,535 --> 01:37:13,620
What are you saying?

1101
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,163
What's going on, Meldie?

1102
01:37:23,964 --> 01:37:25,715
Don't come any closer.

1103
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:27,592
Won't you forgive me

1104
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:29,636
if I told you I killed all of them?

1105
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:57,265
I love you, hon.

1106
01:39:03,772 --> 01:39:06,274
Don't leave me and baby, okay?

1107
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:40,100
Shh…
