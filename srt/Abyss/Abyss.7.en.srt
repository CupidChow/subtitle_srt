00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,795
EPISODE 7

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,311
He said he had something important
to discuss. Why isn't he here?

3
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,524
How dare he make me wait for him?

4
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,402
That punk, Cha Min.

5
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,238
Now that he's getting married,
this is how he's going to treat me?

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,657
I'm sleepy.

7
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,411
I WON'T LOCK THE DOOR
COME INSIDE AND WAKE ME UP

8
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,463
<i>What was that? Or am I seeing things?</i>

9
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,181
<i>I'm thirsty.</i>

10
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,621
<i>Where am I?</i>

11
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,706
<i>Where is he taking me to?</i>

12
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,466
You didn't know

13
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,261
you'd die, right?

14
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,222
Well, I didn't think

15
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,934
I'd get to kill you either.

16
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,978
<i>Who are you?</i>

17
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,063
<i>Why are you...</i>

18
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,495
Hey, Se-yeon.

19
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,915
<i>Is that Min?</i>

20
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,253
<i>What...</i>

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,547
<i>What is he doing?</i>

22
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,427
Hey, Se-yeon!

23
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>Who are you?</i>

24
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,477
<i>Who are you?</i>

25
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,272
I'll leave the drinks here.
Drink it before you go to bed.

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,361
Min.

27
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,322
Min.

28
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,373
She's not dead yet.

29
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,958
<i>Who are you?</i>

30
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,835
<i>Who are you?</i>

31
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,091
Who are you?

32
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,971
What is it, Se-yeon? What's wrong?

33
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,182
Nothing.

34
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,852
It's nothing.

35
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,025
No, he wasn't! I didn't see his face,
but he wasn't old, for sure!

36
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,904
<i>I saw a young man walk out of her place.</i>

37
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,989
A young man.

38
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,575
Min.

39
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,912
Where did we put
the dash cam footage we got from

40
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,372
the owner of the convenience store?

41
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,790
I need to take another look.

42
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,416
- Let's go to the station.
<i>- Breaking news.</i>

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,419
<i>The mysterious Eomsan-dong serial killer</i>

44
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,963
<i>has finally been apprehended.</i>

45
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,590
<i>The Eomsan-dong serial killer's
meticulous plans</i>

46
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,261
<i>and brutal MO shocked the country.</i>

47
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,098
<i>The culprit has been committing murders
for 20 years ever since 2000.</i>

48
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,434
Stop watching. Let's just go home
instead of the police station.

49
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,437
What? Then I want to go see my mom
before we leave.

50
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,856
They said she's fine.
She regained consciousness a while ago.

51
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,317
She's sleeping right now,
so let's come back later.

52
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,527
Still...

53
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,575
If you want me to tell you what I know,

54
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,785
you'll have to

55
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,246
let my parents go.

56
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,665
Stop...

57
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,542
Please stop!

58
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,918
Stop it!

59
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,854
<i>Are you really Oh Yeong-cheol?</i>

60
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,772
<i>Can you tell us why you look so different?</i>

61
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,399
<i>Do you admit to the murder?</i>

62
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,109
<i>Do you not feel guilty at all?</i>

63
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,277
<i>Please say something.</i>

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,778
<i>Did you have a plan to cover it up?</i>

65
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,697
<i>Please say something!</i>

66
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,331
I said we should go to the station.
Why did you bring me here?

67
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,707
There's no way I can sleep.

68
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,418
That's why I'm going to stay
until you fall asleep. Lie down.

69
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,503
- Come on, Min.
- Se-yeon.

70
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,506
To me, you're not a prosecutor
but a victim...

71
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,924
Actually,

72
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,677
to be precise, you're a murder victim
that I brought back to life.

73
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,681
That's why I need to
keep you safe this time.

74
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,480
Stop dwelling on painful memories
by watching news about Oh Yeong-cheol.

75
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,232
At least not today
when he just got arrested.

76
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,026
Okay?

77
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,696
- You should lie down now.
- Still...

78
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,034
We should try to catch
the other guy instead of...

79
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,119
We have the main culprit for now.

80
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,247
When they interrogate Oh Yeong-cheol,

81
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,416
they'll find out if he had an accomplice.

82
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,960
Then it's a matter of time
until we catch the other guy.

83
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,005
- But I really can't sleep.
- Then try to pretend that you're sleeping.

84
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,632
Close your eyes first.

85
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,347
I really can't sleep.

86
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,849
Even so, keep your eyes closed.

87
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,487
The derivative of cosine x
is a negative sine x.

88
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,241
The derivative of cosine hyperbolic x

89
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,284
is a sine hyperbolic x.

90
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,454
The derivative of secant x

91
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,040
is a product of secant x and tangent x.

92
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:01,087
1ST REGULAR EXAMINATION

93
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,550
- Hey. You're in 212th place.
- It's you.

94
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,385
1ST PLACE: CHA MIN
2ND PLACE: GO SE-YEON

95
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,933
GO SE-YEON

96
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,986
I'm sure I only got one question wrong.

97
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
You got question number seven wrong too.

98
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,202
Are you so upset
that you're skipping lunch?

99
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,038
I brought you your favorite, red bean bun.

100
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,208
Wait, why is this wrong?

101
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,128
- It's definitely--
- It's definitely wrong.

102
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,630
The answer isn't four. It's negative four.

103
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,132
Look.

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,761
The derivative of cosine x is negative 4x.

105
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,807
Substitute 2.5pi for x.

106
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,644
And multiply negative four to that number.
Then it's negative four times one.

107
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,438
So the answer is negative four.

108
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,775
We memorized the formula
in front of the restroom before.

109
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,860
Don't you remember?

110
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,069
Shall we go one more time?

111
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,739
Yes. Whenever you go to the restroom,

112
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,741
- I'll go with you and--
- Do you have a death wish?

113
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,451
I'm just joking.

114
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,705
What about this one?

115
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,665
Solve question number 13 again.

116
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,584
This one...

117
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:26,047
The function is the limit of x
to the second power plus one

118
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,840
over x to the second power minus two.

119
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,676
And the condition is
that n approaches infinity.

120
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,262
That means the limit does not exist.

121
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,099
Since the limit does not exist,
x equals one.

122
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,550
Come to think of it,

123
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,803
you've always been by my side.

124
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,461
Hello?

125
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,629
<i>Where are you, Min?</i>

126
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,173
<i>Are you with Se-yeon right now?</i>

127
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,675
Yes.

128
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,759
<i>Min.</i>

129
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,429
<i>I know that you're disappointed in me.</i>

130
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,432
<i>But you--</i>

131
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,726
Hee-jin, I understand. Stop crying.

132
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,528
Crap.

133
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,574
I must be out of my mind.

134
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,181
Min.

135
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,914
Are you really Min?

136
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,540
I heard Se-yeon told you everything.

137
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,793
I'm sure my mother
and Auntie told you too.

138
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,796
Right. Yes.

139
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,132
But I just can't get used to this change.

140
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,053
Are you really the Min
that I used to know?

141
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,888
Why?

142
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,891
Do you think you can share a bed
and eat meals with this face?

143
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,436
Min, I had my reasons back then.

144
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,315
Fine.

145
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,568
You'll hate and resent me
no matter what I say.

146
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,528
You were right.

147
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,154
I approached you because of your money.

148
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,366
I was lying when I told you I loved you.
It was all an act.

149
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,618
But if that's all I cared about,

150
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,328
why do you think I called off the wedding?

151
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,706
If I marry you, all of your money...

152
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,960
I would've been able
to extort much more from you.

153
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,629
Why do you think I settled
for just the apartment

154
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,922
and tried to flee this country?

155
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,217
As I spent more time with you,

156
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,054
I wanted something more than your money.

157
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,516
I started wishing that

158
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,311
you would truly be mine.

159
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,648
That's how I felt then.

160
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,069
I'm...

161
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,489
I'm even more messed up

162
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,742
than you think.

163
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,994
Hey.

164
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,538
Do you call that an excuse?

165
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,261
That man is my dad.

166
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,015
The serial killer who got arrested today.

167
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,100
Oh Yeong-cheol.

168
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,353
Hey, you've never told me
anything about this.

169
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,314
It's because I didn't want to admit it.

170
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,566
Ever since I was young,
he has been beating me up.

171
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,401
Even when I was nearly beaten to death,

172
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,487
I was brought back to life
by that bastard.

173
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,825
Unfortunately for me,
he was a very skilled doctor.

174
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,579
And that's why...

175
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,999
That's why I couldn't marry you.
I didn't want to put you in danger also.

176
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,087
My first love is one of the victims

177
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,343
that was killed by him.

178
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,151
Choe Myeong-cheol,
who was in high school at the time.

179
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,070
You did this too, didn't you?

180
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,948
As you can see.

181
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,418
This was back in 2002.

182
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,796
This guy worked
for a pharmaceutical company,

183
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,550
and he was seeing a nurse
in my department.

184
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,346
Ms. Kim was a hard worker
before she met him.

185
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,600
But she started slacking off
after she met this prick,

186
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,102
and I didn't like that.

187
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,603
I thought she might

188
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,231
go back to being
the hard worker that she used to be

189
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,567
if she became single again.
That's why I killed him.

190
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,405
And

191
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,782
as for this bastard...

192
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,828
Was it the year I was promoted
to the head of the department?

193
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,788
Anyway,

194
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,624
this prick deserved to die as well.

195
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,627
He beat up his wife to a pulp,

196
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,255
so she was brought to our hospital
in an ambulance.

197
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,840
But all of a sudden,

198
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,051
he cursed at me,
demanding that I bring her back to life.

199
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,724
I was utterly speechless.

200
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,602
He's the one who beat her up.

201
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,728
You psycho.

202
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,063
You think that's something to boast about?

203
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,858
Let me remind you
that 12 people died because of you.

204
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,277
You see,

205
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,157
the lives I've saved
outnumber the people I've killed.

206
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,578
The lives that would've been lost
if it weren't for me.

207
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,083
I worked extremely hard
with this very hand and saved their lives.

208
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,002
Do you understand?

209
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,340
The number of lives I've saved is tenfold
greater than that of those I've killed.

210
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,883
Do you understand?

211
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,469
So what if

212
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,680
I killed those 12 people?

213
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,856
Right.

214
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,901
I don't want to admit it,

215
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,528
but it's actually 11.

216
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,822
What?

217
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,783
Go Se-yeon.

218
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,576
That bitch shouldn't be included.

219
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,329
She's still alive, you know.

220
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,189
- Hey!
- Goodness!

221
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,942
You totally startled me.

222
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,319
What happened? Did Oh Yeong-cheol
admit to all his charges?

223
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,696
Yes.

224
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,364
Including the Go Se-yeon case?

225
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,536
Mi-do! Oh my god, Mi-do!

226
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,997
- Be careful!
- Mom.

227
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,208
Mom.

228
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,127
Did he?

229
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,924
Hey, what's wrong?

230
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,804
You are really the Lee Mi-do
that I know, right?

231
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,268
Yes, of course.
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

232
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,104
Don't be silly, my dear.

233
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,605
I am Mi-do. Who else would I be?

234
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,607
I mean...

235
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,695
Right? Of course.
There's no way I couldn't recognize you.

236
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,239
Jeez, it's because Oh Yeong-cheol
kept talking bullshit.

237
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,160
What did he say? Did he mention
an accomplice or anything like that?

238
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,619
No, he didn't.

239
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,458
But he said
that he didn't kill Prosecutor Go.

240
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,294
He said she's still alive

241
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,546
and that she should be excluded

242
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,257
from the list of the victims.

243
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,468
Right, so does that mean
there's an accomplice--

244
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,678
No, that's impossible.

245
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,847
In his basement,

246
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,725
we found a weapon
with Prosecutor Go's blood on it.

247
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,395
The autopsy also revealed that she died
of exsanguination from a stab wound.

248
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,605
But I clearly...

249
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,774
I mean,

250
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,568
the witness said he was sure
that he saw a young man

251
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,696
leaving that house
at the time of her death.

252
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,364
No, trust me. It can't be true.

253
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,743
It rained very hard that day.

254
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,120
We can't trust what he saw
in the middle of a rainy night.

255
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,497
Also, Oh Yeong-cheol

256
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,250
never said he didn't kill Go Se-yeon.
He just said she's not dead.

257
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,962
He wanted to kill her, but she didn't die.
Therefore, he didn't kill her.

258
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,132
What kind of logic is that?
Is he trying to bullshit me or what?

259
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,886
He's trying to make us think that
he's mentally ill to reduce his sentence.

260
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,846
Dong-cheol!

261
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,433
- Let me meet him in person just once--
- What are you talking about?

262
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,352
- Just once. We'll just talk.
- Hey.

263
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,854
Can you help me out
so that I can speak with him just once?

264
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,981
You have no right to interrogate him.

265
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,108
Stop being ridiculous.

266
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,031
<i>He'll be transferred to the prosecution
in the afternoon anyway.</i>

267
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,492
<i>Just give up. It's all over now.</i>

268
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,913
Gosh, seriously. I'm totally confident
that I can make him talk.

269
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,750
That guy is never helpful.

270
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,585
Who's calling?

271
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,964
Hey.

272
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,048
<i>Hey, you're up?</i>

273
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,051
<i>I'm sorry. Something urgent came up,
so I had to leave.</i>

274
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,970
It's all right.

275
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,763
You're still hung up
on your ex-girlfriend,

276
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,932
so I understand
that you had to go when she called you.

277
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,225
<i>Where are you?</i>

278
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,323
Hey, you're here.

279
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,369
Shouldn't the one who wants
to apologize come to me?

280
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,163
Why make me come here when I'm so busy?

281
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,249
Se-yeon.

282
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,042
Stop calling me so fondly, will you?

283
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,919
Since when were we that close?

284
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,800
Why the heck are you crying?

285
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,802
I'm the one who wants to cry now.

286
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,345
Min told me everything.

287
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,556
I heard you told Oh Yeong-cheol
that I'm still alive.

288
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,601
I'm sorry, Se-yeon.
I had a bit of a situation.

289
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,105
I'm really sorry.

290
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,523
You're sorry?

291
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,901
My mom and dad nearly died
because of that.

292
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,527
And I, too, almost died again.

293
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,363
We brought you back to life.
Is this how you're going to repay me?

294
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,324
- Hey, Se-yeon.
- What? What's your problem?

295
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,576
She's practically an accomplice.

296
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,536
She aided in the abduction and coercion.

297
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,954
I should've figured it out

298
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,457
when she lied about being pregnant
and asked you to meet up.

299
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,292
Hey, Hee-jin.

300
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,211
You'd better tell us the truth.

301
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,880
What is your relationship
with Oh Yeong-cheol?

302
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,715
His daughter.

303
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,842
What?

304
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,719
She's his daughter.

305
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,804
Oh Yeong-cheol is her stepfather.

306
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,645
Damn it.

307
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,611
Right, I get it.

308
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,447
You grew up with a father like that.

309
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,158
He threatened you using your mom.

310
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,660
Fine.

311
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,913
If Oh Yeong-cheol
cornered and pressured you like that,

312
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,499
I'll do my very best to understand
the things that you did.

313
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,752
Let's say that we're both victims.

314
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,421
I'm really sorry.

315
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,549
Darn it.

316
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,429
By the way, isn't he a total psychopath?

317
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,307
I get that the two of you
don't share a single drop of blood,

318
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,852
but still, how could he use
his stepdaughter to cover up what he did?

319
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,229
Jeez.

320
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,190
That's just on paper. He'd have never
thought of her as his real daughter.

321
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,360
I also have never

322
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,363
thought of that evil man as my father.

323
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,283
Well, you're still his daughter on paper.

324
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,785
Yes, you are his daughter.

325
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,330
Hey, you said earlier
that you're really sorry.

326
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,999
You said you want my forgiveness.

327
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,377
Then,

328
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,838
could you go and meet him for me?

329
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,218
There.

330
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,720
Ask him if he had an accomplice.

331
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,055
You have to ask him about it
no matter what, okay?

332
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,643
Gosh, he won't tell you easily though.

333
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,730
Like I said, appease and threaten him
whenever needed. Got it?

334
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,065
Hey, can't you just go in with her?

335
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,817
I'm worried about sending her alone.

336
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,529
Why don't you just say
that you're Hee-jin's lawyer and go in--

337
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,907
I can't. Only family members
can visit on weekends.

338
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,410
I didn't want to say this,

339
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,662
but you've been convicted
of fraud in the past.

340
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,247
You're good at sweet-talking, right?

341
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,999
You can do it alone, right?

342
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,793
- I'll try.
- Good.

343
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,964
There's something
I've always wanted to ask him as well.

344
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,799
Don't worry, Min.

345
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,634
- See you in a bit.
- Good luck.

346
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,741
She came to see him sooner
than I expected.

347
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,054
<i>Mom.</i>

348
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,473
<i>Please be alive.</i>

349
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,607
Jeez, you're driving me nuts.

350
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,900
Will she be okay?

351
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,611
He's killed her once.
Letting her go alone--

352
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,031
Hey, she's visiting him in prison.
What can possibly happen?

353
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,284
Do you think the Correctional Service
is a joke? Just sit still.

354
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,955
For God's sake.

355
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,964
Do you have nothing else to do?

356
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,799
I guess you have too much time
on your hands.

357
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,176
Don't you have
a pile of work to catch up on?

358
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,679
I mean, you're the heir
to that corporate giant.

359
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:55,392
How could you have time to follow
your ex-girlfriend around all the time?

360
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,145
I've always valued
a healthy work-life balance.

361
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,063
What a smooth talker.

362
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,941
And this isn't about me
following my ex-girlfriend around.

363
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,986
I'm trying my best

364
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,656
to make up for what I did to you.

365
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,910
Whether it was a mistake or not,

366
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,830
I revived Oh Yeong-cheol.

367
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,542
Whenever I think about that,

368
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,004
I feel horrible and the regrets--

369
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,797
Gosh, seriously. You're at it again?

370
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,632
Enough with the useless thoughts.

371
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,259
I'm telling you.

372
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,053
You're too tenderhearted.
That's your problem.

373
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,599
Think about it, okay?
There's a dying man in front of you.

374
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,310
Who'd try to determine whether or not
he deserves to be saved first?

375
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,686
Would you say that's normal?

376
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,522
Well,

377
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,524
I'd be lying if I said

378
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,402
I never resented you for reviving him.

379
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,987
But you know what, Min?

380
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,322
Come to think of it,

381
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,825
I probably trusted and liked you
because you're like that.

382
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,870
Whenever you see anyone
who's in need of help,

383
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,123
you don't think about anything else
and just help the person.

384
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,417
You're that kind of person.

385
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,796
There's nothing wrong with what you did.

386
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,094
You got that, idiot?

387
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,179
What? "Idiot"?

388
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,348
Wait. I got better grades than you--

389
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,142
It obviously doesn't mean
that kind of "idiot," you idiot.

390
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,604
You've always been such an idiot.
You haven't changed a bit.

391
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,731
What an idiot.

392
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,777
Gosh, my heart almost exploded.

393
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,990
You are my daughter after all.

394
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,451
You came to see me.

395
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,579
This is why it's nice to have a family.

396
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,164
Right?

397
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,210
I came to ask you something.

398
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,380
You haven't forgotten

399
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,590
our deal, have you?

400
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,802
If I tell everyone about the marble--

401
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,054
That deal?

402
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,268
You could've gotten what you wanted

403
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,145
if I had gotten rid of Go Se-yeon

404
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,814
without ending up here like this.

405
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,192
I thought you were here to see me.

406
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,153
Are you here because of that crazy woman?

407
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,488
My mom.

408
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,616
What did you do to my mom?

409
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,494
You are hugely mistaken if you think

410
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,081
that I can't do anything
because I'm stuck here now.

411
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,336
Do you think I'm working alone?

412
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:32,966
Are you saying

413
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,968
you have an accomplice?

414
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,303
What I'm saying is,

415
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,596
all I have to do to get your mom killed

416
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,682
is give an order.

417
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,350
It's a piece of cake for me.

418
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,147
Think about who your real allies are

419
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,108
and whom you should listen to
for your own sake.

420
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,320
I advise you to think carefully about it.

421
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,453
No matter how hard you try
to run away from me,

422
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,913
you, Oh Su-jin,

423
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,334
will always be my daughter.

424
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,794
Am I wrong?

425
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,339
My princess.

426
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,513
So?

427
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,849
What more do you want me to do?

428
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,276
Now that this marble is in my hands,

429
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,236
the two of us

430
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,824
should start planning
some marvelous things

431
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,869
that only those who were revived
by this marble

432
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,623
can do.

433
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,468
So are you mine or not?

434
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,391
Crap.

435
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,142
Is today a special day or something?

436
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,852
I can tell that you took a shower.

437
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,524
Your ex-girlfriend
who called you out of the blue?

438
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,110
Look at you, Dong-cheol. You still got it.

439
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,445
Nice turn!

440
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,406
Oh Yeong-cheol is locked up,

441
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,990
so we can take it easy. Just go home.

442
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,535
Don't eat cup noodles here.

443
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,578
You're still young. Go on dates, man.

444
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,334
<i>Hi, Dong-cheol. It's me, Mi-do.</i>

445
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,920
<i>I'm in front of the station now.
Let's have dinner together.</i>

446
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,548
It looks like Mi-do changed her number.

447
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,218
Jeez! I told her that I'd pick her up,
but she's waiting for me outside.

448
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,761
She's so impatient.

449
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,474
- Detective Choe.
- Yes?

450
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,018
Call my mom and tell her
that I won't be coming home tonight.

451
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,230
Does it smell?

452
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,234
Hey, you're going to have dinner with
Detective Park in the midst of all this?

453
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,944
Yes. Why can't I?

454
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,155
Hey, I'm doing this for us.

455
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:04,451
I should maintain a good rapport with him
because it'll help us down the road.

456
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,287
For the millionth time,
he'll find out that you're not her.

457
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,330
Hey, he could've figured it out
a long time ago.

458
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,207
But as soon as he saw me,

459
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,084
he held me tight in his arms.

460
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,628
He won't suddenly figure it out
after having dinner with me.

461
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,380
Seriously, that hug was...

462
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,924
And it's not like
I want to keep spending time with him.

463
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,552
When Oh Yeong-cheol's accomplice is caught

464
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,013
and I can go back to my parents,

465
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,558
I won't spend time with him
even if you beg me to.

466
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,435
So put your worries to rest

467
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,604
and wait for your ex-girlfriend, okay?

468
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,732
- It's my dear Dong-cheol.
- What?

469
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,943
That came out very naturally.
You're so used to it now.

470
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,237
DETECTIVE PARK DONG-CHEOL

471
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,907
Hi, Dong-cheol!

472
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,575
That brat.

473
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,827
Oh, this number still works?

474
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,206
You texted me and said
you're waiting for me outside.

475
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,458
When did I text you? I'm not there now.

476
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,753
You texted me earlier.
That's why I'm talking about--

477
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,879
Dong-cheol.

478
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,298
It's me, Dong-cheol.

479
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,260
- Who...
- You really don't recognize me?

480
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,679
It's me, Mi-do.

481
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,641
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

482
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,060
A crazy woman showed up out of nowhere.

483
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,686
<i>What? A crazy woman?</i>

484
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,938
What are you talking about?

485
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,232
Anyway, where are you now?
Will it take long?

486
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,566
Then I'll just eat by myself.

487
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,318
No, I'm coming.

488
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,403
Let's have dinner together.
I'll be there shortly.

489
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,115
If you need help,

490
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,159
you can go inside and ask.

491
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,577
I'm in a rush at the moment.

492
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,122
Come on, Dong-cheol.

493
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,541
Hey, wait! It's me!

494
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,211
I must say, you meet
all sorts of people when you're a cop.

495
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,090
By the way, did I say Mi-do's name
when I was drunk or something?

496
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,383
How does she know Mi-do's name?

497
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,306
That was good.

498
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,934
Hey, you wanted to go for something nice.
Why did we come here?

499
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,187
I was thinking it'd be nice
to have steak together.

500
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,440
Considering our relationship,
udon is good enough.

501
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,692
What were you expecting?

502
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,611
What do you mean by that?

503
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,697
That's a bit harsh.

504
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,909
I actually asked you

505
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,829
to have dinner with me because I thought

506
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,414
we should be clear about this.

507
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,416
I hope

508
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,168
you're not thinking
that we're getting back together.

509
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,922
You're not thinking that, right?

510
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,344
I mean, did you

511
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,056
assume that we were
getting back together...

512
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,850
No, don't get the wrong idea.

513
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,812
I'm not interested in starting over.

514
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,525
We have dinner together,

515
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,195
and you've been ringing me up at night,
calling me all fondly.

516
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,032
- But we're not getting back together?
- No.

517
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,744
Then what do you want?

518
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,661
Partnership.

519
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,497
I told you. I took on the Eomsan-dong case

520
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,124
- for the bereaved family--
- Mi-do.

521
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,462
You might be cool

522
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,633
with being partners on a case
after breaking up,

523
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,595
but I'm too much of a loser to do that.

524
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,307
If that is how it's going to be,

525
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,768
ask Detective Choe for help from now on.

526
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,313
I'll tell him to assist you
in any way he can.

527
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,814
But...

528
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:22,815
Hold on.

529
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,526
You see, this isn't...

530
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,195
No, that's not necessary.

531
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,280
But Dong-cheol...

532
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:30,990
Wait!

533
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,160
Damn it. What am I going to do?

534
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,705
<i>Think about who your real allies are</i>

535
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,792
<i>and whom you should listen to
for your own sake.</i>

536
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,379
<i>I advise you to think carefully about it.</i>

537
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,632
<i>No matter how hard you try
to run away from me,</i>

538
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,384
<i>you, Oh Su-jin,</i>

539
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,095
<i>will always be my daughter.</i>

540
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,806
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

541
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,100
<i>My princess.</i>

542
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,024
<i>All I have to do to get your mom killed
is give an order.</i>

543
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,359
<i>It's a piece of cake for me.</i>

544
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,911
- Just drink this.
- Why? I like mocha latte too.

545
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,121
There's only one though.

546
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,124
Were you out together?

547
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,459
No, we met in the lobby.
Here's your order.

548
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,171
How did it go? Did you record him?
Any information about the accomplice?

549
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,758
I have the footage,
so let's watch it together.

550
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,301
Sure, let's see it.

551
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,554
<i>You are hugely mistaken if you think</i>

552
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,307
<i>that I can't do anything
because I'm stuck here now.</i>

553
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,436
<i>Do you think I'm working alone?</i>

554
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,645
<i>Are you saying</i>

555
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,564
<i>you have an accomplice?</i>

556
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,774
<i>What I'm saying is,</i>

557
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,901
<i>all I have to do to get your mom killed</i>

558
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,070
<i>is give an order.</i>

559
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,072
<i>It's a piece of cake for me.</i>

560
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,869
What's this? Is this it?

561
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,456
- Yes.
- Darn it.

562
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,874
Judging by his words,

563
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,502
it's obvious
that there is someone working for him.

564
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,672
I think he may be the accomplice
that killed you.

565
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,426
All he has to do is give an order
to have Jang Sun-young murdered.

566
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,886
That means...

567
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,972
Oh Yeong-cheol's accomplice

568
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,016
knows where Jang Sun-young
is being hospitalized.

569
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:23,936
My mom...

570
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,065
What's going to happen to her?

571
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,026
If what he says is true,
we must find her quickly--

572
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,070
Yes, finding her should be a priority.

573
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,530
That'll lead us closer to the accomplice.

574
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:35,948
Moreover,

575
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,534
if she has seen the accomplice's face,

576
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,286
that'll make it much easier to catch him.

577
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,746
You're right.

578
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,456
If what Oh Yeong-cheol said is true,

579
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,750
the accomplice will have to
show his face at least once

580
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,669
to kill Jang Sun-young
upon Oh Yeong-cheol's order.

581
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,007
Oh Yeong-cheol gave you
a photo of your mom, right?

582
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,467
Let's see it again.

583
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,774
<i>Don't you think
you're asking for a bit too much?</i>

584
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,859
This isn't CSI, you know.

585
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,362
Why are you all pestering me like this?

586
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,782
Is that so? We're pestering you?

587
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,950
- Move.
- What...

588
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,243
Where is it?

589
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,410
Here it is.

590
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,663
How did you know about that?

591
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,124
If I say I'll turn this over
to the police,

592
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,961
you'll suddenly want to help us.
You won't feel pestered at all.

593
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,129
- Right?
- Unbelievable.

594
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,548
Just do whatever you like.

595
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,844
Sir, please. Can you help us?

596
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,513
You see, this is very important to me.

597
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,224
It'll save my life if you help me out.

598
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,351
Can you please help me this once?

599
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,521
Considering how talented you are,

600
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,273
cracking this will be a piece of cake.

601
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,899
You can say that.

602
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,695
Sure, I'll give it a go.

603
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,370
Threats don't always solve the problem.

604
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,955
Shut it.

605
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,510
The 21st?

606
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,431
It's the day he got arrested
after taking your mother hostage.

607
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:28,352
We just have to figure out
Oh Yeong-cheol's escape route then.

608
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,314
Detective Park
will have the answer for us.

609
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:37,069
I don't think today is
the best day to ask him.

610
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,779
Why not?

611
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,949
Didn't you have dinner with him in order
to maintain the good rapport?

612
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,952
Well...

613
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,871
I don't think

614
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:50,041
he'll be mentally strong enough

615
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,251
to take my call today.

616
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,139
Why did he drink so much?

617
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,476
Dong-cheol!

618
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,477
Hey, Park Dong-cheol!

619
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,438
Oh, it's you.

620
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,191
Why are you here drinking?
I thought you were on a date.

621
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,445
I'll let you in on a secret.

622
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,615
- That girlfriend...
- Yes?

623
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,868
I thought we were going
to get back together,

624
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,204
but she said we're just friends.

625
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,792
She told me that we're just partners
working on a case together.

626
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,669
So...

627
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,631
Stop drinking.
You're not making any sense.

628
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,884
Mi-do.

629
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,063
Hello?

630
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,315
<i>Dong-cheol, it's me, Mi-do.</i>

631
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,192
You wench!

632
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,568
Why are you calling me again?

633
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,363
Why do you keep playing with my heart?

634
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,533
Why is he yelling at me?

635
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,703
<i>If you keep calling me,</i>

636
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,330
I can't move on.

637
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,958
Why do you keep breaking my heart?

638
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,043
I want you gone and out of my sight!

639
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,254
Are you kidding me right now?

640
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,006
What did I ever do to you?

641
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,716
When was I ever in your sight?

642
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,677
I haven't contacted you since that day.

643
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,889
How can you yell at me like this
after all the memories we shared?

644
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,850
<i>You mean brat.</i>

645
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,893
<i>You addictive little minx!</i>

646
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,479
You're even worse than
the most violent criminals.

647
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,149
Stop stirring up my heart! We're over!

648
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,444
Unbelievable.

649
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,570
Wait.

650
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,655
Mi-do, I'm sorry.

651
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,991
Please come back to me, Mi-do.

652
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,293
I'll go to the station
and ask Detective Park in person tomorrow.

653
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,586
Sure.

654
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,223
- Se-yeon.
- Yes?

655
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,600
You're heading home, right?

656
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,769
I guess. What about you?

657
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,188
Me? I'm going home with Hee-jin.

658
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,523
I'll drop you off since it's on the way.

659
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,665
DONGBU POLICE STATION

660
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,293
Unbelievable.

661
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,171
Dong-cheol.

662
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,466
Dong-cheol, wake up.

663
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,467
Dong-cheol?

664
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,551
Mi-do!

665
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,638
Dong-cheol, Prosecutor Lee...

666
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,473
I mean, Lawyer Lee is here.

667
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,600
Who?

668
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,018
Ms. Lee Mi-do.

669
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,482
Mi-do?

670
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,155
My goodness.

671
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,616
- Get a grip on yourself!
- Are you all right?

672
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,538
Hi, Dong-cheol.

673
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,126
Dong-cheol, did you sleep well?

674
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,961
I guess not.

675
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,296
You must've gone drinking last night.

676
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,215
What brings you by
so early in the morning?

677
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,469
Have some coffee and these snacks too.

678
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,973
If I had known you had drinks last night,

679
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:37,476
I would've brought some honey tea instead.

680
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,311
How inconsiderate of me.

681
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,444
Anyway, I came here to ask you something.

682
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,405
The day Oh Yeong-cheol was arrested...

683
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,282
Detective Choe.

684
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:55,327
This short lady has questions
regarding Oh Yeong-cheol's case.

685
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,871
What...

686
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,708
Is he seriously still sulking?

687
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,835
That petty loser...

688
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,507
So you're saying that

689
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,801
he got away
in a stolen ambulance that day, right?

690
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,304
Yes, that's before he took the hostage.

691
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,098
The ambulance must have a dash cam.

692
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,558
Could I check the footage?

693
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,810
Come on, Ms. Lee.
You know I can't let you.

694
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,354
That's why I'm asking you for a favor.

695
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,690
I'd love to help, but I can't.

696
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,525
The prosecution already took the case,

697
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,361
and Prosecutor Seo took the data
from the dash cam already.

698
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,571
What?

699
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,074
- Ji-uk did?
- Yes.

700
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,498
<i>Are you all right?</i>

701
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,876
<i>Wait, you can't sit up like that.</i>

702
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,256
<i>Sir, are you sure you're all right?</i>

703
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,011
<i>Do I seem okay to you?</i>

704
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,430
<i>Sir, what are you doing?</i>

705
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,517
Come in.

706
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,689
Prosecutor Seo, do you remember
Park Min-gyu's case?

707
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,901
His mother personally wanted to thank you.

708
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,402
Ma'am, this way.

709
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,740
Prosecutor Seo.

710
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,825
Thanks to you,

711
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,828
I can finally sleep soundly at night.

712
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,333
I could die right now
without any regrets in this world.

713
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:29,296
I deeply appreciate it, Prosecutor Seo.

714
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,049
Please don't say that.
I only did what was right.

715
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:36,428
<i>Seo Ji-uk might be a nice guy,
but you said he's by the book.</i>

716
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,017
Will he let you see it
just because you're his senior?

717
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,477
It's case evidence.

718
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,813
The Seo Ji-uk I know

719
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,274
will never let me see it.

720
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,526
So why would you go see him?

721
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,194
What else can I do?

722
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,488
I'll just have to steal it
if he won't let me see it.

723
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,199
A person's life is on the line,
so that's a risk I can take.

724
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,077
You're reckless like always.

725
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,163
Min.

726
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,373
Yes?

727
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,376
Are you going to keep making me

728
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,546
come to your office like this?

729
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,381
What?

730
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,385
Oh, that. Well...

731
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,054
I can't leave my office
so easily these days--

732
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,306
Exactly.

733
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,100
So why did you ask me to come here

734
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:27,313
when we could easily discuss this
over the phone?

735
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,149
You're not the only one
who's busy, you know.

736
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,110
Se-yeon, wait. Hold up!

737
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,948
You can drop the case now
since you're busy with your work.

738
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,743
Don't say that. I can't do that
since I'm responsible, you know.

739
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,621
I will help lessen
that burden off your shoulders,

740
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:47,041
so focus on your life
as the heir of Lan Cosmetics.

741
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,834
It's too dangerous for you to work alone.

742
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:49,793
- You--
- Hey!

743
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,421
- What...
- That must hurt.

744
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,256
- What's up with them?
- Beats me.

745
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,758
Hey, Min.

746
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,512
Can you please get off me?
You're embarrassing me.

747
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,765
- Yes, of course.
- Hey.

748
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,102
- No, I'm good.
- Mr. Cha, are you all right?

749
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,687
Yes, I'm fine.

750
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,522
Please get back to work.

751
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,649
Se-yeon...

752
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,858
Ms. Lee!

753
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,321
That lawyer seems to be always around Min.

754
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,698
I want a full background check on her.

755
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,290
Should I really go
to the Public Prosecutor's Office?

756
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,918
Yes, I have a plan, so get going.

757
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:31,960
SEARCH CASE

758
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,547
I used to work in the same office
as Ji-uk.

759
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,549
I can find out all the details

760
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,884
of the cases he's on

761
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,844
and his schedule in court.

762
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:46,141
- Then what?
- We'll find out when he's due in court

763
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,185
and seize the opportunity.

764
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,825
Hey, Min!

765
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,828
I'll call you. Wait here and monitor
through the surveillance camera.

766
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,995
Okay.

767
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,419
I'll call you!

768
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,022
Hey, how's the angle? Can you see well?

769
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,526
- It's good.
- Okay.

770
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,368
PROSECUTOR SEO JI-UK'S OFFICE

771
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,578
Oh my!

772
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,956
- Prosecutor Lee!
- How have you been?

773
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,335
Come in.

774
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,799
He has just left for a trial.

775
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,926
I ran into him at the lobby.

776
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,637
He told me to wait for him at his office.

777
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,389
Is that so?

778
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,019
Don't worry about me
and go on with your work.

779
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,437
- All right, ma'am.
- Sure.

780
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,652
Hello?

781
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,364
Hello, Chief. One moment, please.

782
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,408
Hey, are you keeping watch?

783
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,534
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

784
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,120
Tell me right away if anyone walks in!

785
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,583
Darn it.

786
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,675
Ji-uk's passcode is so obvious.

787
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,928
It must be 0979.

788
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,930
What?

789
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,556
SEO JI-UK

790
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,474
What?

791
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,101
What's happening?
Did he change his passcode?

792
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,269
Why won't it work?

793
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,938
It must start with 07.

794
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,275
What are you doing down there, Ms. Lee?

795
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,988
My earring went rolling under his desk.

796
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,823
- Your earring?
- Yes, isn't it pretty?

797
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,242
It is.

798
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,118
Did you need something?

799
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,038
- He left something in the office.
- Is that so?

800
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,958
He asked me to email it to him.

801
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,585
I guess he doesn't
have a mirror back here.

802
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,344
SEND EMAIL

803
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,554
Why won't it...

804
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,180
There we go.

805
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,642
You still make such good coffee.

806
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,144
Thank you.

807
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:46,822
What was it?

808
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,241
It was 0711.

809
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,455
Is this the one?

810
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,418
<i>Are you all right?</i>

811
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,171
<i>Wait, you can't sit up like that.</i>

812
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,976
COPYING FILE

813
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,188
- Come on, hurry up.
<i>- Se-yeon, someone's approaching.</i>

814
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,982
What? Who is it?

815
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,859
It's too early for Ji-uk to come back.

816
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,403
<i>It's not Seo Ji-uk.
This man looks much older.</i>

817
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,488
I'm almost finished, okay?

818
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,325
Come on, hurry up.

819
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,243
Sir!

820
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,871
Where is Ji-uk?

821
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,166
He's not here.
He's attending a trial at the moment.

822
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,083
What bad timing.

823
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,210
Is that so?

824
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,342
Oh my god, what have I done?

825
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,219
Is there someone inside?

826
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,972
Prosecutor Lee Mi-do is visiting.

827
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,016
She now works for Park & Jang Law Firm.

828
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,271
I guess I should come back later
if he already has a guest.

829
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,276
I just stopped by
after meeting the district attorney,

830
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,528
- so don't tell him I was here.
- Yes, sir.

831
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,073
Goodbye, sir.

832
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,909
Darn it.

833
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,081
What's this?

834
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,958
What? It isn't like him

835
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,711
to leave reference materials
lying around like this.

836
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,132
<i>Are you done yet?</i>

837
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,468
I'm done.

838
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,057
I'll just see him another time.

839
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,558
But he'll be here soon.

840
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,145
Something has just come up for me.
I'll give him a call myself.

841
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,147
- All right, Ms. Lee.
- Have a good day.

842
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,315
You, too.

843
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,666
- Did you get it?
- Of course I did.

844
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,301
Hey, rewind it back again.

845
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:22,644
Darn it. Where the hell is this?

846
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,856
Hold on. Let's start from the beginning.

847
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,818
So Oh Yeong-cheol went through
Gyeongcheon Tollgate.

848
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,403
And then... Where was it?

849
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,363
He turned the handle to this side, right?

850
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,281
So...

851
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,116
he took a left. He took a left here

852
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,786
and went up this road here,
but it comes to a dead end.

853
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,039
How are we supposed to track him?

854
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,250
This footage shows nothing
but some stupid forest.

855
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,626
Can't we call up

856
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,921
all the nursing homes
and mental hospitals and ask if

857
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,466
- there's a patient called Jang Sun-young--
- Hey.

858
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,261
Do you think Oh Yeong-cheol would've
hospitalized her by her real name?

859
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,930
I'm sure he used a different name

860
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,017
or brought her to some
unauthorized facility.

861
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,604
We may be able to find her

862
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,523
if we go and check every single patient
with the photo you have

863
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,691
in all the nearby hospitals.

864
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,819
But we don't have enough time to do that!

865
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,739
Hold on.

866
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,786
Based on the dash cam footage,

867
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,080
he drove through a desolated forest
with no buildings nearby.

868
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,542
So that must be where
he's keeping Hee-jin's mom.

869
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,378
Do you think we don't know that?

870
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,427
Do you know where it is?

871
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,849
GYEONGCHEON

872
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,685
- It must be this one.
- Great.

873
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,456
This forest does look familiar.

874
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,252
There must be a building around here
according to the map.

875
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,006
It's over there!

876
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,592
There it is.

877
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,886
SUGYEONG NURSING HOME

878
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:40,240
Sir, will you be spending the night here?

879
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,369
No, I'm here just to check on him.
I'll be on my way soon.

880
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,204
All right, sir.

881
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,128
I'm sorry.

882
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,508
I'm so sorry.

883
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,344
My son.

884
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,321
SUGYEONG NURSING HOME

885
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,740
I can't believe
she's in a place like this.

886
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,492
- Let's go in and check first.
- Okay.

887
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,496
ROOM 205

888
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,067
Is there a long-stay patient here
who goes by the name Jang Sun-young?

889
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,111
- No.
- You didn't even look it up!

890
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,780
It's a tiny place.

891
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,366
I don't have to look it up
to know if it's our patient or not.

892
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,785
How about this person? Is she here?

893
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,704
No, she's not.

894
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,415
Are you sure?

895
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,001
Look me straight in the eye.
You're lying, aren't you?

896
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,127
- Excuse me?
- You--

897
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,672
We're from the prosecutor's office.
Please cooperate with us.

898
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,702
Mom.

899
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,370
Mom!

900
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:04,968
Hee-jin!

901
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,597
Mom?

902
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,102
Where's my mom?

903
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,730
I think we just missed her.

904
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:24,738
I'm going out!

905
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,781
Get in the car! Hurry!

906
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,127
Hey, mister.

907
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,714
Where are we going?

908
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:47,135
We're going somewhere nice, aren't we?

909
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,346
Sure. We're going somewhere nice.

910
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,356
It's that one over there, isn't it?

911
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,691
- It is.
- Step on it! Catch up!

912
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,487
Somewhere nice...

913
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,739
Somewhere nice...

914
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,492
This is so nice.

915
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,535
Mom.

916
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,497
We're almost there, so hold on tight.

917
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,373
All right.

918
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,088
Min, we must not lose her, okay?

919
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,837
<i>What if he kills my mom as well?</i>

920
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:08,133
<i>- What should I do?
- No, he won't. He can't kill her.</i>

921
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,718
<i>He would have killed her already
if that was what he wanted.</i>

922
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,638
<i>The Lee Mi-do I knew
was actually Go Se-yeon.</i>

923
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,182
What are you talking about?

924
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,725
I really am Lee Mi-do!

925
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,726
<i>Sorry? What...</i>

926
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,646
You're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

927
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,148
Mi-do!

928
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,483
<i>If she really is alive, it's not good.</i>

929
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,901
Wake up, Se-yeon! Please!

930
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,028
<i>I'm sorry I'm always late, Se-yeon.</i>

931
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,363
<i>I really am.</i>

932
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,912
