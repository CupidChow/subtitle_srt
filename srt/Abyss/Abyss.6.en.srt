1
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,028
JANG HEE-JIN

2
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,639
JANG HEE-JIN

3
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,854
JANG HEE-JIN

4
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,561
Please.

5
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,439
I hope my plan works.

6
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,775
Please.

7
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,638
Yes, this is the fifth floor.

8
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,223
Police?

9
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,520
What happened?
Did he already come by and leave?

10
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,029
Hey, Min. Wake up!

11
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,948
Min!

12
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,660
Hey.

13
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,537
What happened? Why am I...

14
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,373
What's this? What's up with my hair?

15
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,417
Did I come back to life as a woman?

16
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,880
Hold on. This can't be right.
No, wait. This can't be it.

17
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,925
Hold on a second. What is this?
What's wrong with my hair? Damn it.

18
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,176
Se-yeon.

19
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,554
You're alive!

20
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,432
Are you all right?
Are you sure you're okay?

21
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,850
What's gotten into you?

22
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,187
Your face looks really red.
I think you're running a fever.

23
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,397
Hey, try to breathe. Okay?

24
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,398
Inhale and exhale.

25
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,318
In, out.

26
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,654
There you go.
Did your wound get healed too?

27
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,280
- Hey, don't touch me.
- Are you all right?

28
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,282
Even if I'm a woman now, I don't--

29
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,493
- What are you talking about?
- What?

30
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,041
Wait, I'm still me.

31
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,125
Damn it.

32
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,419
You said it revives us
in the form of our souls.

33
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,797
No matter how many times you die,
your soul will be the same

34
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,173
even if your body changes.

35
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,508
My gosh.

36
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,593
That was terrifying.

37
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,262
But why am I wearing this?

38
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,472
Hey, you're not hurt, right?

39
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,932
You're okay, right?

40
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
As you can see, yes.

41
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,436
Thank you!

42
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,148
That marble is awesome.

43
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,484
I'll be immortal as long as
I have you and Abyss.

44
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,780
But where's my Abyss?

45
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,658
Oh Yeong-cheol...

46
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,993
That bastard has it.

47
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,744
What?

48
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,122
I'm the owner.
How could that bastard have it now?

49
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,207
Because you died.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,751
Unless Oh Yeong-cheol dies,

51
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,920
you'll never be able to possess Abyss.

52
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,007
But we have a bigger problem than that.

53
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,678
I think Oh Yeong-cheol is using Abyss
however he wishes.

54
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,851
We found only one body
in the basement for now.

55
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,644
But there's a lot of blood stains outside.

56
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,355
Hey, you.

57
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,773
Protect the crime scene, will you?

58
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,442
Put plastic sheets over the steps.

59
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,609
Okay, then.

60
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,946
Does it mean he moved the body
inside after killing her?

61
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,823
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

62
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,783
I think there was one more victim.

63
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,994
But we didn't find a body.

64
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,788
What? You didn't find a body?

65
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,674
Are you crazy? Watch where you're going.

66
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,093
What's wrong with her?

67
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,597
Hey. Are you okay?

68
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,599
Hey!

69
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,439
Hey, can you talk? Hey!

70
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,910
EPISODE 6

71
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,040
I got it. Get over here soon.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,168
Excuse me.

73
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,093
I'm from the police.

74
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,845
Could you

75
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,348
take off your mask for me?

76
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,437
You son of a bitch!

77
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,232
Hey!

78
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,153
Damn it. The elevator.

79
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,176
EMERGENCY ROOM

80
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,266
Detective Choe. Where are you?

81
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,018
The suspect is going down.
Seal off the stairs and elevators.

82
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,857
POLICE

83
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,952
Excuse me. We're from the police.

84
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,621
Have you seen an old man
with long hair and a beard?

85
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,294
Detective Lee, go search that area.

86
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,753
And you guys, over there.

87
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,843
- Did you get his photo?
- Yes, I sent it to the security.

88
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,887
They'll call us
as soon as they locate him.

89
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,556
Hold on, Dong-cheol.
No matter how hard I think about it,

90
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,850
it makes no sense
that he's Oh Yeong-cheol.

91
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,395
I also can't wrap my mind around
how he suddenly became an old man.

92
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,148
But we only found Oh Yeong-cheol's
and the victim's fingerprints

93
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,191
from the scene.

94
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,193
We'll find out more once we ask him.

95
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,611
This is crazy.

96
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,279
- You sealed off all exits, right?
- Yes.

97
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,491
I checked the blueprint, and there's
a separate exit for medical waste.

98
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,992
I sent Gyeong-sik down there.

99
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,078
Okay. It's pretty late now,
so no one is walking around the hospital.

100
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,121
Right.

101
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,332
- Check everyone exiting the hospital.
- Okay.

102
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,543
If we check through the security cameras,
we'll catch him. Let's go.

103
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,097
Hello?

104
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,308
Yes.

105
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,269
Professor.

106
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,647
What brings you to call me?

107
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,692
We just had a patient
from a traffic accident, right?

108
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,819
- His name is...
- Kim Cheol-kyu?

109
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,863
Yes, him. Let me see his chart.

110
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,158
- It's Dr. Kim's patient.
- Yes.

111
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,202
He has just received treatment.

112
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,246
Dr. Kim just notified a fellow doctor.

113
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,664
- Dr. Kim.
- Hey.

114
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,832
- I'm glad you're here. Come here.
- Yes?

115
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,793
Did you notify Dr. Yu about this patient?

116
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,128
I'm trying, but Dr. Yu isn't answering.

117
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,463
It's okay. You don't need to.

118
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,049
We're going to transport
the patient to Seoha Hospital.

119
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,594
The other passenger died,
and he suffered massive bleeding.

120
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,763
He'll die
if the bleeding isn't stopped in an hour.

121
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,515
But we should still notify Dr. Yu.

122
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,351
His family got the ambulance ready.
Get ready to transport him.

123
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,894
Go now.

124
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,981
Where did that old fart go?

125
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,111
On the far right corner.
That's the ER, right?

126
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,237
Yes.

127
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,825
Detective Choe, a doctor
and a patient are leaving the ER now.

128
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,286
- Go check them out.
- I'm on it.

129
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,834
Hold up.

130
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,670
It's official police business.
Take off your mask. I need to check.

131
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,754
- What's this about?
- Okay.

132
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,215
Why is he leaving?
I must check him before he goes.

133
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,466
- Go check yourself.
- Excuse me.

134
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,679
This patient can't miss his golden hour.

135
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,514
- Give me a minute.
- He must be transported now

136
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,600
- to a trauma center!
- Wait. Hold on.

137
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,810
- What's his name?
- You can check. Get out of my way.

138
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,478
You can go now.

139
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,188
PATIENT: KIM CHEOL-KYU

140
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,440
Damn it.

141
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,984
- You checked, right?
- Crap.

142
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,742
I checked, but it wasn't our suspect.

143
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,537
<i>The call cannot be connected. You'll be
connected to the voice mailbox for now.</i>

144
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,584
Professor, I transported the patient
you told me about right away.

145
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,212
I told them to send over the patient's
chart and the files to Seoha Hospital.

146
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,257
Please call me back
once you get this message.

147
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,718
I'll wait for your call, sir.

148
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,229
Hey, who was that on the phone?
You ran out like you were on fire.

149
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,982
- Did something happen?
- No.

150
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,569
It was Professor Oh.
His friend was in a big car accident.

151
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,196
And he was sent to our hospital.

152
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,823
He called me himself
to transfer the patient to Seoha Hospital.

153
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,326
The last time I saw him was
three years ago while volunteering.

154
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,578
He's never called me.
I was so surprised to get his call.

155
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,373
Hold on. He called you himself?

156
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,749
Why? Is that weird?

157
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,209
Have you not heard?

158
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,754
Professor Oh suddenly disappeared
after requesting a leave of absence.

159
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,673
From what I've heard,

160
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,384
he's a murder suspect now,
and the police are looking for him.

161
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,429
- Hey.
- Yes?

162
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,681
Are you sure you checked everyone
before letting them go?

163
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,641
Yes.

164
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,059
- Right?
- Yes.

165
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,395
Yes.

166
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,272
That means
he's still hiding in the hospital.

167
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,191
How is it going?

168
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,276
Looks like
he's still hiding in the hospital.

169
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,862
We checked
all the security camera blind spots.

170
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,572
There was no way
he could escape from here.

171
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,740
Yes, there was.

172
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,827
He's already left the hospital.

173
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,037
How do you know that?

174
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,039
Damn it.

175
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,088
Are you all right?

176
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,341
Wait, you can't sit up like that.

177
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,481
You're the one who killed Se-yeon, right?

178
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,817
That's right. I killed her.

179
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,947
But she kept fighting
until the very last moment she died.

180
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,200
Oh Yeong-cheol,

181
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,204
I won't let you get away this time.

182
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,584
Hey, are you done changing?

183
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,545
Come out if you're done.
We need to go somewhere.

184
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,382
<i>The body of the suspect, Cha,</i>

185
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,551
<i>in the Prosecutor Murder Case,
has been found.</i>

186
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,303
<i>And the police have begun investigating.</i>

187
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,722
<i>His body had already been
reduced to a skeleton.</i>

188
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,474
<i>The decomposition had progressed...</i>

189
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,976
How did they find my DNA from the body?

190
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,314
Could it be possible that my body
didn't disappear when I came back to life?

191
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,274
What if it got teleported
to someplace else?

192
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,651
- What do you think?
<i>- It is speculated that</i>

193
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,530
<i>when Mr. Cha's belongings and a photo
of him and the victim was found,</i>

194
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,825
<i>he felt pressured
due to the open investigation</i>

195
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,746
<i>and ended up committing suicide
while on the run.</i>

196
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:20,049
I'm sorry, but could you turn back
to Golden Palace in Dogeon-dong?

197
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,008
Sure.

198
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,974
It's best that you take care of yourself.

199
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,142
Be quiet.

200
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,145
Ms. Eom, you're not well. You should--

201
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,688
I told you to be quiet!

202
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,982
<i>As the body of the prime suspect</i>

203
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,068
<i>of the Prosecutor Murder Case
has been found,</i>

204
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,612
<i>it is likely that the investigation
will be closed soon.</i>

205
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,324
<i>- He was pressured by the investigation</i>
- Ms. Eom.

206
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,450
<i>and committed suicide...</i>

207
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,373
Assemble

208
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,125
the legal team now.

209
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,756
Crap. Okay, look over here.

210
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,592
It's this old geezer
in the security cameras.

211
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,178
He does look very different
from the Oh Yeong-cheol we know of.

212
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,846
I don't know how this happened.

213
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,808
Anyway, the only people
who went into the house were

214
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,685
the landlady, the victim,
and Oh Yeong-cheol.

215
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,311
Just these three people.

216
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,272
And the only fingerprints

217
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,233
lifted from the bathtub
were from the victim and Oh Yeong-cheol.

218
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,860
So there's no need
to investigate further, right?

219
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,905
The ambulance that picked him up
has fallen off the grid.

220
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,033
Contact the Highway Patrol Unit
and see if you can find out where it went.

221
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,202
- And call the doctor he spoke to.
- Got it, sir.

222
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,204
- I'll take care of that.
- Hurry. Let's move.

223
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,498
- Let's go, guys.
- Hurry. We don't have time.

224
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,293
Thoroughly check everything
I asked you to look into, okay?

225
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,420
Excuse me. Can we help you?

226
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,923
Who is the detective
in charge of the Go Se-yeon case?

227
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,259
Wait, hang on.
What brings you here, ma'am?

228
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,221
I'm here to talk about
how you defamed Lan Cosmetics,

229
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,016
as well as my son, Cha Min,
who is the director there,

230
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,686
and destroyed the reputation
of my company.

231
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,647
Well, ma'am.

232
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,108
As for the media report
on your son's death,

233
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,401
we didn't leak the information.

234
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,611
Before the report came out,

235
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,238
there were serious issues
with how you cops handled the case.

236
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,489
You put out an APB on Mr. Cha,

237
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,909
who was only a suspect,
ignoring the presumption of innocence

238
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,327
even before you indicted him.

239
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,414
You investigated the case without showing
any willingness to protect a civilian,

240
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,999
so I'm sure you were prepared for this.

241
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,252
You see, we had confirmed our suspicion
and even had a witness statement.

242
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,130
However, we couldn't locate
Mr. Cha's whereabouts.

243
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,924
And how many times
did we visit your company

244
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,717
before putting out the APB?

245
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,094
You didn't cooperate
with the investigation at all.

246
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,097
The police can announce what any suspect
is speculated to have done.

247
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,432
That is also the law, okay?

248
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,478
My son, Director Cha,
was not an ordinary civilian.

249
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,023
He was the face of Lan Cosmetics,
a corporate giant.

250
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,691
He represented the brand.

251
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,944
From the prosecution to the police,

252
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,446
I'll sue everyone
who had anything to do with the case.

253
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,908
You leaked information on him
to the media,

254
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,661
and your coercive investigation
led to his...

255
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,830
He lost his life, for God's sake.

256
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,999
My son, Min, died

257
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,419
because you cops cornered him.
It's clearly your fault,

258
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,006
and I'll make you pay
for everything that happened.

259
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,717
Disclose the entire
DNA profiling process of how you

260
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,177
concluded that the body is Mr. Cha.

261
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,097
And send all related documents
to our legal team.

262
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,640
Hey, mister.

263
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,977
Do you actually think we'll give you
our investigation documents that easily?

264
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,687
"Investigation documents"?

265
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,106
My son is dead!

266
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,692
He's back as a skeletonized body.

267
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,195
And I, his mother, found out about it
while watching the news.

268
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,116
What? You can't send them because
they're investigation documents?

269
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,617
Hand them over now. Where are they?

270
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,661
- Hey, guys.
- Hand them over!

271
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,121
Right now!

272
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,998
Hey, guys. Stop her.

273
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,332
Hand them over at once!

274
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,168
PHOTOS OF THE SKELETONIZED BODY

275
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,253
PERSONAL INFORMATION

276
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,047
NAME: CHA MIN

277
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,593
Mom! Are you all right?

278
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,473
Excuse me.

279
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,602
ID CARD
CHA MIN

280
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,691
He was dead.

281
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,735
He was dead...

282
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,611
Hey, excuse me.

283
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,493
- Hey! Dong-cheol!
- Are you all right, sir?

284
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,203
ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR AWARDS

285
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,624
Let me see your hand.

286
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,168
Show me.

287
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,137
This is nuts.

288
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,057
How could these two guys
be the same person?

289
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,894
That's not important right now.

290
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,396
You know what?

291
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:50,152
I clearly saw that you were dead
with my own two eyes.

292
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,322
And now, you're looking at me
alive and well with the same two eyes.

293
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,824
Right? Exactly.

294
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,661
That's exactly why I don't
understand this situation.

295
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,544
Who are you, really?

296
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,130
How many times do I have to tell you?

297
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,423
I'm Cha Min!

298
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,801
And what's more important than who I am

299
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,595
is whether or not I killed Prosecutor Go.
Am I wrong?

300
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,599
I'm not the killer, okay?

301
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,060
I don't even know
why I was pinned as a suspect.

302
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,314
Then let me put this straight.

303
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,149
If you felt wronged

304
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,361
about being falsely accused of the murder,

305
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,322
why didn't you come forth sooner?

306
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,157
Why did you keep your identity hidden?

307
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,412
Hey.

308
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,414
By any chance,

309
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,667
does Mi-do know that you're Cha Min?

310
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,258
You see,

311
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,177
if you are the killer,

312
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,180
and if Mi-do was fully aware of this
and helped you hide,

313
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,267
she'll be prosecuted
for concealing an offender.

314
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,227
Why did you get her involved
in the first place?

315
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,938
The motive, evidence,
and witness statement were all fabricated.

316
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,650
Everyone but myself was calling me
the culprit. What was I supposed to do?

317
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,653
And looking like a different person
doesn't help me prove my innocence.

318
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,196
So just until I catch the culprit--

319
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,573
And?

320
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,491
Did you catch the culprit?

321
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,785
Is that why you're here?

322
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,328
Oh Yeong-cheol.

323
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,831
- He killed Se-yeon as well.
- Jeez.

324
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,332
You saw the proof from Park Gi-man.

325
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,169
What proof? Prosecutor Go's ID card?

326
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,673
I guess your plan is to get
Oh Yeong-cheol locked up with that alone,

327
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,884
but that's not enough
to put him behind bars.

328
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,013
Yes, Oh Yeong-cheol is the killer.

329
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:42,973
But the thing is,

330
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,434
there's no way
we can prove that he, in fact,

331
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,144
killed Prosecutor Go.

332
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,354
I clearly heard him
confessing to the murder.

333
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,690
Did you record his confession?

334
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,567
I heard that my fingerprints and his blood

335
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,486
were found at the crime scene
in Myeongjin Hospital.

336
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,032
That's when I heard his confession.
He said he killed Prosecutor Go.

337
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,826
Okay, so did you record
that confession he made? Did you?

338
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,538
Hey.

339
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,000
Let me remind you that you're
the prime suspect in this case.

340
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,836
With your statement alone,

341
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,088
we simply can't apprehend him.

342
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,591
I wasn't the only one who heard it.
Park Gi-man heard it too.

343
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,468
Right, but did you record it?

344
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,262
What you're telling me isn't enough
to serve as evidence.

345
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,181
Hey, Dong-cheol.

346
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,893
They found a weapon with Prosecutor Go's
blood on it at Oh Yeong-cheol's place.

347
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,853
I told you I was right!

348
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,063
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

349
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,698
Goodness!

350
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,118
Sir, can you hear me?

351
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,875
Pardon?

352
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,092
Doctor! Dr. Yu!

353
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,096
I'll lower it a little bit now.

354
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,555
Look straight ahead.

355
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,307
Good.

356
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,269
But I'm not sure
if the iris is still the same.

357
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,730
Mom, it really is me. I'm Min, okay?

358
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,232
Please don't move.

359
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,912
They checked his fingerprints and iris,
and they both match.

360
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,956
Are you sure?

361
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,042
I mean, maybe the results
were manipulated.

362
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,212
No, that's impossible.
It was done right in front of you.

363
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,798
The results are from this lab's
biometric testing procedure,

364
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,675
which means they can be trusted.

365
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,844
Still,

366
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,595
this makes no sense.

367
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,350
Ma'am, for some strange reason,
I think I can believe that he is Min

368
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,477
the more I look at him.

369
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,395
How?

370
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,647
I mean,

371
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,733
how could that handsome young man

372
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,235
be my son, Min?

373
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,571
He looks nothing like Min.

374
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,949
When it comes to plastic surgery, Korea
is considered number one in the world.

375
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,159
Maybe he got...

376
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,328
How accurate is the biometric testing?

377
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,539
Well, his face has changed a lot indeed.

378
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:16,501
But if everything matches Mr. Cha's
biometrics in the lab's database,

379
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,296
there's a zero-percent chance
that he's not Mr. Cha.

380
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,179
Gosh, seriously.

381
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,665
I bet...

382
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,835
you had no idea
that you could die like this.

383
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,545
I, too,

384
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,217
had no idea that I'd be able to kill you.

385
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,286
TUESDAY, MAY 21

386
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,500
Oh, right. Min.

387
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,045
You heard that Hee-jin is staying
at our guesthouse, right?

388
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,380
Yes.

389
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,593
She's pregnant, so you must've been
very worried about her.

390
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,262
Let's go there first.

391
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,140
No, it's okay.
I'll go see her another day.

392
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,434
Hey, you're up?

393
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,436
What is this? Why did you bring me here?

394
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,355
<i>You were totally passed out in the taxi.</i>

395
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,399
I have no time for a nap now!

396
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,733
You should've woken me up.

397
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,736
Detective Park said you barely got
any sleep for the past two days.

398
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,031
It's not like you were revived
as a superhero. You need to sleep.

399
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,618
<i>I went to the police alone,
but the interview went well. Don't worry.</i>

400
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,912
Our legal team did a good job,
so I could avoid detention.

401
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,123
What's happening with Oh Yeong-cheol?

402
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,541
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

403
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,960
Okay. I'm headed to Dongbu Police Station.
Come right now.

404
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,587
- <i>I can't go now.</i>
- Why not?

405
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,840
I'm back to being Director Cha,
the heir to Lan Cosmetics.

406
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,967
Since I've revealed my identity,

407
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,844
I need to sort things out here as well.

408
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,272
- Is that really Director Cha?
- Director Cha?

409
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,788
You all look like you've seen a ghost.

410
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,124
You're not uncomfortable
that I'm back, are you?

411
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,293
Are you really Director Cha?

412
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,212
Yes, I am.

413
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,714
There is a reason behind
my changed appearance,

414
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,508
but must I tell you
about my private matters?

415
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,262
How could you not come to work
to get plastic surgery

416
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,931
and not even tell us anything?

417
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,557
Especially at this critical time.

418
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,476
I know, right?

419
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,811
Despite my absence
during this critical time,

420
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,398
you were all trying to expedite
the new product launch.

421
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,275
Was there a specific reason?

422
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,861
In every crisis, there is an opportunity.

423
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,529
When the company's image is in jeopardy,

424
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,573
- a sensational new product--
- "Sensational"?

425
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,409
That sounds great.

426
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,580
But I carefully read the ingredient list
and found an endocrine disruptor.

427
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,332
- What?
- Endocrine disruptor?

428
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,000
That's impossible.

429
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,879
Which ingredient is
an endocrine disruptor?

430
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,173
On the product itself,
it's just labeled as "serum."

431
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,800
That's why it's a serious problem.

432
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,302
One of this facial moisturizer's
ingredients, phthalates.

433
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,303
This is the one.

434
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,349
Other brands also use
chemical ingredients like that.

435
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:03,270
And it's FDA-approved.
Don't try to nitpick for no reason.

436
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,939
It's a minute amount,
so it won't be an issue.

437
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,109
The amount allowed by FDA
is under 100ppm, which is a trace amount.

438
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,903
The amount in our product
is very close to the threshold.

439
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,363
I always emphasize this to you.

440
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,699
Skincare products should be edible.
Only safe--

441
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,450
It is edible.

442
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,047
Why don't you prove it then?

443
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,345
Do you know this though?

444
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,098
I heard that overexposure to phthalates

445
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,100
can cause low sperm motility.

446
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,480
In layman's terms,
it can affect your sexual stamina.

447
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,568
It's a dangerous substance that can cause
genital and reproductive abnormalities.

448
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,196
If you're okay with it,
go ahead and swallow a spoonful.

449
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,544
Must I bring up sexual stamina
to make you understand?

450
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,590
Unless you can eat the entire jar of it,
discard all of them.

451
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,175
Do you know how much money we'll lose--

452
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,345
Also, I noticed that we went
with a different manufacturer for this.

453
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,764
We changed our manufacturer?

454
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,225
Why the sudden change?

455
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,854
Why are you rushing to launch
the new product with ingredients

456
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,481
whose safety can't even be guaranteed?

457
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,816
Internal Affairs will start
investigating into this matter,

458
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,860
so let's talk again at our next meeting.

459
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,495
Judging from how he gets his job done,

460
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,747
he must be Min indeed.

461
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,174
Hello?

462
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,801
<i>Hello, this is Myeongjin Hospital.</i>

463
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,719
<i>You're Mr. Park Gi-man's guardian, right?</i>

464
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,186
What happened? You said he woke up.

465
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,854
He did regain his consciousness earlier,

466
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,441
but he still needs rest.
They gave him a sedative, so he's asleep.

467
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,362
Hey, then when will he wake up...

468
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,573
Excuse me. Did Park Gi-man
fully regain his consciousness?

469
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,827
Yes, he did. He's just asleep now.

470
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,955
- He'll wake up soon if everything is fine.
- Oh, I see.

471
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,751
GUESTHOUSE

472
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:36,923
GUESTHOUSE

473
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,384
By any chance,

474
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,678
did he say anything

475
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,305
or look for anyone when he woke up?

476
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,266
No, not that I recall.

477
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,517
Oh, right.

478
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,730
The notebook...

479
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,856
"The notebook"?

480
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,274
He said, "The notebook."

481
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,943
"The notebook"?

482
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,122
<i>The number you have dialed
is unavailable now.</i>

483
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,124
Damn it. Why isn't he picking up?

484
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,667
He's back.

485
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,295
How could he not even visit me once,
knowing that I'm here?

486
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,381
Yes, come in.

487
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,968
Here you go.
You asked for a new cell phone.

488
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,429
Thank you.

489
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,931
Ms. Eom scheduled
a doctor's appointment for you.

490
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,266
You should start getting ready.

491
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,276
I'm sorry.

492
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,237
I've been feeling unwell
since this morning. I don't think I can...

493
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,972
This is nuts.

494
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,184
What should I do?

495
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,521
I'll get kicked out if they find out
that I'm not pregnant.

496
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,482
If I get kicked out...

497
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,611
No, I cannot let that happen.

498
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,155
If that happens, he'll really...

499
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,658
He will really kill me this time.

MESSAGE SENT

515
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,443
I knew that someday

516
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,364
you'd be useful to me in some way.

SUGYEONG NURSING HOME

518
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,804
He can't talk at all,
and he keeps getting severe convulsions.

519
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,849
The doctor said he probably ended up
with aphasia

520
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,643
due to the trauma from the accident.

521
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,855
This is what he was wearing
when he was found.

522
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,900
Both the DNA samples from the evidence

523
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,110
and the ones that were directly

524
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,488
obtained from the victim
match Park Jeong-sun's DNA profile.

525
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,410
Even people at the NFS
said this is outright impossible.

526
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,579
He has no record
of having sex reassignment surgery,

527
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,498
but he somehow has XX chromosomes.

528
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,588
- I'm sorry. I have to get this.
- No problem.

529
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,173
Hey, Detective Choe.

<i>His phone just turned on.</i>

532
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,561
Why did she want to meet here?

533
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,399
Where is she?

<i>Call me if you want to hear more.</i>

536

<i>But to hear about what you want to know,</i>

537
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:28,006
<i>you'll have
to have the information that I want.</i>

538
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,179
<i>Who are you?</i>

539
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,893
I guess you really are alive.

540
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,145
Who are you?

541
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,897
Shut your mouth,

542
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,775
or I'll rip your jaw off.

543
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,237
I've always told you.

544
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,240
Only your dad can ask questions.

545
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,827
<i>All right.</i>

546
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,998
<i>Then here's my first question
and the most important one.</i>

547
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,001
You'd better answer it well.

548
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,421
<i>That marble</i>

549
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,300
brought you back to life, didn't it?

550
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,228
Hey, how could you misplace
something that important?

551
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,273
I put it right here.
Hey, did you touch it?

552
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,900
My gosh, don't put the blame on me.

553
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,445
You took it with you
when you went out to look for Park Gi-man.

554
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,697
But I remember bringing it back.

555
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,575
- Where is it?
- Perhaps it's in the living room.

556
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,996
- I found it.
- Where? Give it to me.

557
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,542
There must be something definitive here.

558
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,754
I've read the entries
about a hundred times give or take.

559
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,215
There's nothing that proves
Oh Yeong-cheol killed you.

560
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,508
I WILL PUNISH WITH MY OWN HANDS

561
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,473
I can only imagine just how much
Park Gi-man wanted to kill Oh Yeong-cheol.

562
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,976
It's the man
who took his sweet daughter away.

563
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,274
What's this?

564
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,401
Does he have a son too?

565
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,243
This time, you blew things out
of proportion, which is unusual of you.

566
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,621
I never did such a thing.

567
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,167
Witness statements, motive,
and the time of the murder

568
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,294
all pointed to one man.

569
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,340
I couldn't stop looking into Cha Min
just because he's well off.

570
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,093
You insisted on an open investigation

571
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,388
and tried to urgently
close the case by leaking to the press

572
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,849
of a dead body
which doesn't match Cha Min's DNA.

573
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,977
Is this all to just cover up your mess?

574
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,397
I'm not the one who leaked it
to the press.

575
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,901
I didn't have any hand
in NFS' faulty forensic report either.

576
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,410
Is your judgment clouded
because Ms. Go is the victim, or...

577
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,996
is there something else going on?

578
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,041
What are you getting at, Father?

579
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,918
There's an APB out...

580
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,255
on Oh Yeong-cheol.

581
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,801
I want you

582
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,096
to wrap up this case
without making any mistakes.

583
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,683
Be thorough and nifty
like you've always been so far.

584
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,728
If you fail,

585
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,564
I won't let it slide.

586
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,574
<i>That marble</i>

587
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,660
<i>brought you back to life, didn't it?</i>

588
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,545
Answer me.

589
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,340
How...

590
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,885
did you come back to life?

591
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,474
Tell me.

592
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,312
You can see this too, right?

593
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,528
I'll take that as a yes.

594
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,246
Then here's my next question.

595
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,081
You, me,

596
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,375
and that weasel Cha Min.

597
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,627
Apart from us three,

598
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,755
is there anyone you know

599
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,051
that has been brought back to life

600
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,929
with this?

601
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,398
Go Se-yeon, that bitch was revived too?

602
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,529
I'm curious

603
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:06,325
as to what her new face and life
look like.

604
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,666
Dong-cheol.

605
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,167
Oh Yeong-cheol is on the move.

606
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,585
All right.

607
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,963
Where? Gurim-dong?

608
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,464
Got it.

609
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,883
- He's in Gurim-dong. Let's go.
- Okay.

610
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,975
I'll have an employee send you an email

611
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:35,062
on last month's sales
and the estimate for next month.

612
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,981
Thank you.

613
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,966
I'm sorry for being so loud on the phone.

614
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,178
Work got piled up
while I was out of commission.

615
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,182
I only have one more call to make.
If I'm bothering you--

616
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,184
No, it's fine.

617
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,519
I've tried calling in that room.

618
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,147
The reception is bad for some reason.

619
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,940
Just take it here.

620
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,443
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

621
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,778
Thanks.

622
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,075
Who's that?

623
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,243
Beats me. I'm not expecting anyone.

624
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,917
Thank you.

625
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,253
I cooked the dishes Min used to like.

626
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,130
I hope you still like them.

627
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,423
Auntie.

628
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,054
Are you kidding me? You have
no idea how much I missed your food!

629
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,139
Se-yeon...

630
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:56,394
I mean, Lawyer Lee
only fed me crap this whole time.

631
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,937
Look how much weight I've lost.

632
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,064
Goodness gracious. Your tummy is so flat.

633
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,276
It's not because I starved you.

634
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,654
Your soul was just skinny, you prick.

635
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,822
Whatever. Let's eat.

636
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,916
This is what you call food, okay?

637
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,127
Ms. Lee, please dig in.

638
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,920
Sure. Thank you so much.

639
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,424
- Pace yourself, Min.
- Okay.

640
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,220
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

641
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,854
- Is it good?
- It's to die for.

642
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,321
Jeez, this is amazing.

643
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,991
Let me get you some.

644
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,618
Thank you.

645
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,418
Se-yeon, eat it all
before your dad gets home.

646
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,336
Here. It's really tender.

647
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,799
Have some <i>japchae</i> too.

648
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,925
When did you make all this?

649
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,928
As long as you like it,
I can make it any day.

650
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,434
- How is it?
- Mom, it's delicious.

651
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,771
- That's good to hear.
- Mom.

652
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,732
Eat all of it before you go.

653
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,988
- Is it good?
- It's amazing.

654
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,869
Try some.

655
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,247
- What?
- Grilled corvina is your favorite.

656
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,292
Right.

657
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,007
Her pancakes are amazing too.

658
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,676
- Here you go.
- It's good.

659
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,802
There.

660
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,225
Everything's delicious.

661
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,398
Hello?

662
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,901
Hello?

663
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:09,818
Who is it?

664
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,530
I don't know. No one's talking.
Maybe it's a spam call.

665
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,073
<i>Go Se-yeon.</i>

666
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,116
Who is this?

667
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,660
<i>Come here if you wish to know.</i>

668
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,955
<i>There are many people here</i>

669
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,831
<i>who wish to see you.</i>

670
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,296
What was that?

671
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,133
What do you think? It's a clock.

672
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,677
Did you forget you bought that?

673
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,889
<i>Don't tell anyone and come alone.</i>

674
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,060
<i>I'm sure you know what I mean.</i>

675
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,529
Thanks for letting me use the phone.

676
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,741
I'm sorry, but it's almost time to close,
so we can only offer takeout.

677
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,160
I'll take one to go then.

678
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,705
I'll fry one for you right away.

679
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,207
- Please have a seat.
- Sure.

680
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,803
- Wait.
- You should at least finish your dinner.

681
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,597
No, it's fine. Thank you for everything.

682
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,223
Where are you off to?

683
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,142
- Let me come with--
- I must go.

684
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,894
Se-yeon, what's wrong?

685
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,355
Who called you? What's going on?

686
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,779
I need to go.

687
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,282
What...

688
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,742
SE-YEON FRIED CHICKEN

689
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,997
If only she had just died
like she was supposed to,

690
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,206
she would've died alone.

691
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,460
But she had to come back to life

692
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,004
and now her parents must die too.

693
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,386
This is why they say your children
determine your fate.

694
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,096
Right?

695
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,063
SE-YEON FRIED CHICKEN

696
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,274
Finally. Go Se-yeon is here.

697
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,669
Look who it is!

698
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,215
You were brought back
into a completely different body.

699
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,842
I'm here, so let them go.

700
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,347
Hold on.

701
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,850
How can I believe

702
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,853
that you're really Go Se-yeon?

703
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,029
ID CARD
GO SE-YEON

704
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,368
There. Now let them go.

705
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,831
That's the thing with morons like you.

706
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,584
They easily lose their reason
when they get provoked just a little.

707
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,551
Did you actually believe what I said?

708
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,762
I'm disappointed, Go Se-yeon.

709
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,439
Dong-cheol.

710
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,029
Son of a bitch.

711
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,364
He's already in the wind.

712
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,244
Damn it!

713
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,209
Yes, hello?

714
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,879
What?

715
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,964
Where are you headed?

716
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,762
SE-YEON FRIED CHICKEN

717
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,184
Why did you go alone?

718
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,687
I need to go.

719
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,315
What...

720
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:20,903
Min.

721
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:21,987
If...

722
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,698
Even if something happens to me,

723
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,950
you shouldn't try to save me first, okay?

724
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,952
Just like how I brought you back,

725
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,872
you have to make sure to save the ones

726
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,082
I've been trying to protect at all costs.

727
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,543
- All right?
- What the...

728
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,462
Se-yeon?

729
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,069
Good, you're awake again.

730
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,321
Oh Yeong-cheol,

731
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,406
what is it that you want?

732
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,826
That's the mistake...

733
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,246
you people always make.

734
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,960
In life, there are some events
that happen for no reason.

735
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,130
But if you insist on knowing what I want,

736
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,926
it's the perfect murder.

737
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,266
If you had just stayed dead,

738
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,060
I wouldn't have to go through
all this trouble.

739
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,938
My murders were always perfect.

740
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,357
But you...

741
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,318
You disrupted my world

742
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,823
and messed with the one thing
I wished to preserve!

743
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,743
Now tell me.

744
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,288
What else do you know?

745
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,040
If you want me to tell you what I know,

746
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,251
you'll have to

747
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,753
let my parents go.

748
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,092
Does it look like...

749
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,763
I want to play games with you?

750
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,854
No...

751
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,481
Don't...

752
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,111
Not my dad...

753
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,780
It seems like your daughter here

754
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:34,369
wants to hear you cry out loud.

755
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,412
No...

756
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,582
There you go.

757
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,959
Why don't you beg for mercy?

758
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,838
Beg for your daughter to spill it all out

759
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:50,010
and spare your life!

760
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,887
Why are you doing this?

761
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,805
My daughter

762
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,183
is already dead!

763
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:01,897
Stop...

764
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,774
Please stop!

765
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,776
Stop it!

766
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:06,693
Stop!

767
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,778
Stop!

768
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,908
A perfect murder, you say?

769
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,037
Why don't you just kill me right now?

770
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,791
Go ahead, just get it done with!

771
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,127
But

772
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,880
even if you kill me now,

773
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,508
it won't be the perfect murder.

774
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,803
The perfect crime you've always wanted

775
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,431
is already a perfect failure.

776
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,355
So much chitchat.

777
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,358
I can't take it anymore.

778
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,362
I think I'd rather just kill you.

779
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,035
Dad.

780
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,455
Mom.

781
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,043
Fine.

782
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,629
I'll get it done
since that's what you wanted.

783
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,507
Just...

784
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,802
die!

785
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,146
Stop it right now, Oh Yeong-cheol.

786
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,737
I see you've revived again, Cha Min.

787
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,030
How interesting!

788
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,660
So...

789
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,331
Would you like me to kill you again?

790
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,376
This is it for you, anyways.
The police are already on their way.

791
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,753
Why don't you--

792
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,392
No! Mom!

793
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,021
Which way is the back door?

794
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,189
No...

795
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,316
No. I won't let you go this time!

796
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,027
Why don't you step aside?

797
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,114
Unless you'd rather see me

798
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,494
crack her head open.

799
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,664
Min, please.

800
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,500
Don't...

801
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,303
Mi-do!

802
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,430
Oh my god, Mi-do!

803
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,723
What's going on?

804
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,934
Oh Yeong-cheol got away
with Prosecutor Go's mother.

805
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,227
What?

806
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,289
Hands up, Oh Yeong-cheol.

807
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,137
It's all over for you,

808
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,306
Oh Yeong-cheol.

809
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,270
You should pay for your mistakes,

810
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,064
not run away like this.

811
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,245
Give up.

812
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:47,747
You have

813
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,000
already lost.

814
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,673
Father, I'm sorry.

815
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,176
- Father, I'm sorry.
- You should pay...

816
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,888
Father, I'm sorry.

817
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,097
for your mistakes.

818
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,101
What is it?

819
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,020
Are you angry?

820
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,991
Give up.

821
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,035
You have

822
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,287
already lost.

823
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:41,843
Did you find him?

824
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,845
- No. Was he not there, either?
- No.

825
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,850
DETECTIVE CHOE

826
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,686
What is it?

827
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,648
<i>- We've arrested Oh Yeong-cheol.</i>
- Okay.

828
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,235
They got him.

829
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:02,989
What?

830
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,658
She seems very injured.

831
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,867
Are you okay?

832
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:06,952
Good job, Detective Choe.

833
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,120
Are you all right, ma'am?

834
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,957
- Did you call an ambulance?
- Yes, it'll be here soon.

835
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,875
How did you find out, Prosecutor Seo?

836
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,670
- I came over as soon as I got the report.
- That was fast.

837
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,796
It's here.

838
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,218
Make sure people don't take photos.

839
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,260
- Stay there.
- Yes, sir.

840
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,596
Hurry up, this way.

841
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,931
- Be careful!
- Yes, sir.

842
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,849
- Careful.
- Yes, sir.

843
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,351
Mom.

844
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,978
Mom.

845
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,145
Mom.

846
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,775
Oh no. Mom.

847
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,520
The doctor said the wound isn't severe.

848
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,855
Don't worry.

849
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,691
- When she wakes up--
- I'll tell them

850
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,152
everything and go back
to being their daughter.

851
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,239
You proved
that you're the same person, too.

852
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,199
- If I do the same--
- Se-yeon.

853
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,368
Your case is far different from mine.

854
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,747
Everyone in this country
as well as your parents

855
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,206
saw you dead.

856
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,377
They buried your body

857
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,213
with their own hands.

858
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,426
It'll be hard for them to accept it.

859
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,887
I'm still going to try.

860
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,640
Oh Yeong-cheol got arrested,
so there's no reason I can't go back.

861
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,309
I'm going to do it all, too.

862
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,478
From the iris, fingerprints, to DNA,

863
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,896
I'll get them all checked

864
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,023
and prove to them that I'm Go Se-yeon.

865
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,359
And I'll live the rest of my life
as who I am.

866
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,739
I...

867
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,493
I promised Mom

868
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,120
that I'd go on a trip with her
on her birthday,

869
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,039
but I didn't make it.

870
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,671
I bought the tickets in advance
after telling her.

871
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,340
Maybe if I show her those,

872
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,717
she'll believe...

873
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,887
Maybe she'll realize
that I'm her daughter.

874
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,198
I just need to pack the essentials,
so it won't take long.

875
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,366
Okay. Take your time.

876
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,089
That old man...

877
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,467
This old man? I know this old man.

878
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,052
He always keeps a pile of...

879
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,597
Wait a second. Where is his stuff?

880
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,475
Come on. I can't believe this old geezer.

881
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,936
I even saw him load his stuff
on his wagon that night.

882
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,109
Excuse me, sir.

883
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,237
Jeez.

884
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,990
You shouldn't keep these
on someone else's property.

885
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:35,160
- The lady who lives here doesn't want--
- No one lives here. It's empty.

886
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,621
I know that,
but someone will be moving in soon.

887
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:40,832
Hey, sir!

888
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,335
I told you not to keep these here.

889
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,046
Fine.

890
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,340
I'll let you off the hook just this once.

891
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:53,136
You can keep them here, but get rid
of them when it rains since it stinks.

892
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,471
It's okay. Let's go.

893
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,848
Are you friends of the lady
who used to live here?

894
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,976
If you are, take this.

895
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,272
Why do you have this?

896
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:05,857
Leave them here!

897
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,903
Sir! Did you just hit me?

898
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,113
Fine. I'll put them away. I will.

899
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,992
<i>It must have gotten mixed up with my stuff</i>

900
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,619
<i>when she fell.</i>

901
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,079
You must know where her grave is.

902
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,499
- Why don't you take it there?
- Okay, we'll do that.

903
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,709
By the way,
did they catch the bastard who did it?

904
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,961
Yes, he got caught.

905
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,838
I heard it was a friend of hers.

906
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,509
Why would such a young man
do something so heinous?

907
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,136
Are you talking about the one
who was on the TV news?

908
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,555
That young man was falsely charged

909
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,891
- and the culprit was an old man--
- No, he wasn't!

910
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,519
I didn't see his face,
but he wasn't old, for sure!

911
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,815
Where else am I supposed to leave these?

912
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,317
Darn it.

913
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,403
I was coming back here
to pile up the papers again

914
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,905
after she fell asleep.

915
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,617
And I saw the door open.

916
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:02,622
I thought she was coming out again,
so I hid.

917
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,083
I didn't want her to make a fuss again.

918
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,337
However,

919
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,257
I saw a young man walk out of her place.

920
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,511
I thought he must be her boyfriend,

921
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,555
but I heard that she was killed
on that very night.

922
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,474
And the estimated time of her death
was around the time I saw him too.

923
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,602
I told the prosecutor what
I saw that night as...

924
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,812
What's it called?

925
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,105
Right, as a witness.

926
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,857
That's how her friend got pinned
as a suspect

927
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,943
and his face was revealed to the public.

928
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,196
You could say I played a big role
in catching the culprit.

929
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,619
That's right.

930
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,455
There was another one.

931
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,249
What?

932
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,296
Are you really Oh Yeong-cheol?

933
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,339
Can you tell us why you look so different?

934
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,425
- Do you admit to the murder?
- Was it planned?

935
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,637
<i>Oh Yeong-cheol...</i>

936
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,640
He was not the only one.

937
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:05,893
Another one...

938
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,396
There was another one.

939
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,473
<i>Could you go and meet him for me?</i>

940
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,934
Ask him if he had an accomplice.
You need to ask about it no matter what.

941
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,270
<i>Prosecutor Seo took the data
from the dash cam.</i>

942
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,648
<i>Will he hand it over to you
just because you're his senior?</i>

943
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,191
<i>Or, I'll just have to steal it.</i>

944
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,777
<i>Do you think you can share a bed
and eat meals with this face?</i>

945
01:00:55,860 --> 01:01:00,073
I'm even more messed up than you think.

946
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,075
You haven't forgotten our deal, have you?

947
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,663
<i>Shall we begin planning
all the wildest things with this?</i>

948
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,831
<i>Things that only those</i>

949
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,376
who came back to life can do.

950
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,422
