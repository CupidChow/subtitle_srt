1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,170
- Make way, please!
- What's going on?

2
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,048
- Excuse us.
- Hurry up.

3
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,092
- Are you all right, sir?
- Why is he here?

4
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,719
Oh, no.

5
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,637
- Be careful.
- Let's lift him.

6
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,225
Yeong-cheol...

7
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,143
What?

8
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,689
The father...

9
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,149
Park Gi-man! Hang in there!

10
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,358
Park Gi-man!

11
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,494
- Is he dead?
- Is he?

12
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,788
Are you his guardian?

13
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,247
- Are you coming with us?
- Yes, sir.

14
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,624
That's Hee-jin.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,252
Come on, what are you doing?

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,546
- Hee-jin.
- What?

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,840
- Hee-jin!
- Hee-jin? Your fiancée?

18
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,009
Hey, Min! Hey!

19
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,998
Oh Yeong-cheol.

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,627
Give up already.

21
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,609
What are you doing here?

22
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,528
Well, you already knew

23
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,739
that I wasn't Oh Yeong-cheol's father,

24
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,159
didn't you?

25
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:46,416
You'll never be able
to catch Oh Yeong-cheol.

26
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,672
What makes you
jump to a conclusion like that?

27
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,091
I know you better than anyone else.

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,725
My blood...

29
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,479
runs through your veins.

30
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,331
Hee-jin!

31
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,836
Hee-jin, wait.

32
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,757
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

33
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,800
- Hee-jin.
- Hey, Min!

34
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,761
Can you go after her? She went--

35
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,721
Stop it. You're probably mistaken.

36
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,931
Why would she be here?

37
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,724
No, I'm sure it was her.

38
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,434
She didn't seem herself, though.

39
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,269
I know for sure that something's wrong.

40
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,188
That's why she didn't call.

41
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,233
You crazy bastard. Stop being such a fool!

42
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,442
Have you forgotten?

43
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,279
You don't look like the old Cha Min,
and you can't say you're him anyway.

44
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,076
Right now,
he's a brutal murderer at large.

45
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,288
Are you hurt?

46
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,290
How bad is it? Let me take a look.

47
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,416
It's nothing.

48
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,669
As if.

49
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,505
Lean on me. Come on.

50
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,382
Prosecutor Seo!

51
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,925
Prosecutor Seo, are you all right?

52
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,344
Prosecutor Seo, can you hear me?

53
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,679
Open your eyes.

54
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,015
He went that way...

55
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,143
You don't have to talk. It's all right.

56
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,645
Ji-uk!

57
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,814
Ji-uk, what's wrong?

58
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,357
Are you all right? What's going on?

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,110
He's gone. Oh Yeong-cheol, that bastard!

60
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,155
Hold on. Oh Yeong-cheol...

61
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,660
It wasn't him.

62
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,828
What?

63
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,581
Are you all right?

64
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,708
Look at all this blood.

65
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,793
It's all right. Hang in there.

66
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,047
We were able to suture
the laceration on his head.

67
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,050
He only has a minor concussion,
so he'll wake up soon.

68
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,927
Sure. Thank you, doctor.

69
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,228
Jeez.

70
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,189
Prosecutor Seo was injured
fighting a suspect,

71
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,483
but why are you all bruised up?

72
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,819
- You must be clumsy.
- None of your business.

73
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,780
- What?
- So how's Prosecutor Seo?

74
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,826
He suffered a big blow to his head,

75
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,663
but he only has a minor concussion,
so he'll wake up soon.

76
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,040
And Park Gi-man?

77
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,420
He's currently in surgery, but...

78
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,092
- Prosecutor Seo.
- Ji-uk?

79
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,178
- Are you all right?
- How do you feel?

80
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,262
Are you trying to sit up?

81
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,139
- Be careful.
- Take it slow.

82
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,182
Don't rush it.

83
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,769
Did you catch the culprit?

84
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,190
We searched the area,
but he was long gone.

85
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,985
Before you passed out,
you said it wasn't Oh Yeong-cheol, though.

86
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,406
It wasn't Oh Yeong-cheol
who stabbed Park Gi-man.

87
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,617
It was Dr. Oh's father.

88
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,827
The man at Dr. Oh's house.

89
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,081
- The old man we found at the house?
- Yes.

90
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,208
What does he mean? What old man?

91
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,252
The old man who Park Gi-man assaulted?

92
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,089
- No, it's--
- Mi-do used to work with us,

93
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,299
but she left our office
quite some time ago.

94
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,512
It's not appropriate to tell her
sensitive details about the case.

95
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,391
I kept telling her I couldn't,

96
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,601
but we just go way back.

97
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,395
Get out of here!

98
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,771
I'm not a bystander in this case.

99
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,482
I'm representing Mr. Park now.

100
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,653
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.
PLEASE HELP ME.

101
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,949
I guess they're involved in the case now.

102
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,411
PARK GI-MAN
IN SURGERY

103
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,745
I hope he's all right.

104
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,958
He has to be, he's the only one
who can help us arrest Oh Yeong-cheol.

105
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,169
Did Park Gi-man tell you anything else?

106
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,130
How about Oh Yeong-cheol's description?

107
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,132
Maybe we can get a composite sketch.

108
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,383
He didn't mention that.

109
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,302
If I had known what would happen,
I would've asked him.

110
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,766
RESTRICTED AREA

111
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,725
Park Gi-man,

112
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,063
you can't die at his hands
just like your daughter.

113
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,774
Please. You must wake up.

114
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,445
Only you can recognize Oh Yeong-cheol.

115
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,157
He was rushed to the ER, so he'll be fine.

116
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,911
- Call me when he comes out.
- What? Where are you going?

117
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,955
The crime scene.

118
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,957
I'm heading back to your neighborhood.

119
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,417
I'll look wherever she may be.

120
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,544
What? Don't tell me...

121
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,881
- Seriously?
- You never know.

122
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,175
If there's even a tiny chance--

123
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,470
It's not her.
You said she most likely left the country.

124
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,764
Your relationship is over.
Why aren't you moving on?

125
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,558
No way.

126
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,227
- Are you hoping to--
- I wouldn't do this

127
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,480
if she was happily living her life
after abandoning me.

128
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,148
I would've moved on.

129
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,775
However, it doesn't seem that way.

130
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,862
I'm worried that
the woman I saw was really her,

131
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,323
which is the last thing I want.

132
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,452
Hey, wait!

133
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,730
Excuse me.

134
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
Wait. What about Park Gi-man?

135
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,199
His surgery went well,
but he's still unconscious.

136
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,786
The doctors say that
he might never wake up.

137
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,039
What good will it do
to just sit around and wait?

138
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,792
Here. Go ahead.

139
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,755
Let's recharge ourselves

140
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,133
and search for your fiancée.

141
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,889
You said once you see
that she's okay and doing well,

142
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,516
you'll be able to move on.

143
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,103
If that's what you need to forget her,
then I'll help.

144
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,063
Aren't you thirsty?

145
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,398
Come on, let's go then.

146
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,031
I've been here more than a dozen times.

147
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,116
She's not here. I think--

148
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,494
Yes, she would be long gone by now.

149
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,372
However, she was at the scene,
but immediately ran away.

150
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,750
My guess is that
she's guilty of something.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,462
Anyway, while on the run,
you tend to drop things.

152
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,423
So which way did she go again?

153
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,718
To the right? Okay, let's go.

154
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,473
DONGBU POLICE STATION

155
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,891
Why not?

156
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,770
Dong-cheol, my dear, just this once!

157
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,229
Unbelievable.

158
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,524
You only call me that
when you need something.

159
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,943
Prosecutor Seo gave me an earful
because of you.

160
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,657
Finding someone with just a single photo

161
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,034
is something you can do
with your eyes closed.

162
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,661
Just take a look at it.

163
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,372
Come on. Just this once.

164
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,707
Forget it. He's being a jerk.

165
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,335
We'll find another way.
He's not the only detective we know.

166
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,213
Hey, I never said I wouldn't help.

167
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,839
I was just about to say yes.

168
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,383
Really? You'll do it?

169
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,301
Help me out just this once.

170
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,719
Why did you bring him along?

171
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,404
Hee-jin?

172
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,409
She looks like Hee-jin, but her style...

173
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,077
Is that how she dresses?

174
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,996
Do you know her?

175
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,167
I have information
regarding a murder case.

176
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,169
- Which case?
- What murder?

177
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,130
Which case is it?

178
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,965
The death of Prosecutor Go Se-yeon.

179
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,592
I'd like to give information on Cha Min.

180
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,184
EPISODE 4

181
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,937
Are you Oh Su-jin?

182
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,314
Yes.

183
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,152
That's not what it says here.

184
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,988
I was going to change it after marriage

185
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,658
which is why that name was
on the invitation.

186
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,077
What's important

187
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,664
is that I'm the fiancée who broke
off the wedding with Cha Min.

188
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,376
Min's family will confirm that--

189
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,878
They never mentioned this.

190
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
Well, his family never approved of me.

191
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,306
The chairman of a conglomerate
wouldn't be satisfied with me.

192
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,892
The wedding was kept a secret,

193
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,145
and only close family and friends
were invited.

194
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,981
Now that the wedding is off,

195
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,233
they'll pretend it never happened.

196
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,988
Okay, sure. I'll believe that for now.

197
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,073
So let's get to it.

198
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,035
What information do you have on Cha Min?

199
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,372
The real reason I called off the wedding.

200
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,418
It seems connected to the murder case.

201
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,547
Let me go in there with you.

202
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,926
I should explain to Hee-jin
what's going on--

203
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,344
Explain what exactly?

204
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:28,516
The fact that you were reborn
as a handsome stud

205
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,434
and that Go Se-yeon is alive?

206
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,522
Who'll believe you?

207
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,941
You're lucky if you don't
get sent to a psychiatric hospital.

208
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,110
I'll head in there
and find out what she's saying.

209
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,864
You stay right here and wait.

210
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,824
All right?

211
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,909
But Se-yeon...

212
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,374
It's all because of her.

213
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,918
Se-yeon.

214
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,296
Se-yeon? You mean Prosecutor Go?

215
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,632
Yes.

216
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>How do you know her?</i>

217
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,513
<i>I met her at my part-time job.</i>

218
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,640
<i>You see...</i>

219
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,395
Well, Prosecutor Go
was the boss' daughter.

220
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,897
She set me up on a blind date,

221
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,900
and that's how I met Min.

222
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,863
My deed is done,
so I'll give you some space.

223
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,407
You're leaving?

224
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,492
The matchmaker should go.

225
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,743
- Still...
- Have fun.

226
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,295
<i>From the moment we met until he proposed,</i>

227
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,755
<i>she was always between us.</i>

228
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,179
What are you doing?

229
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,307
What is that?

230
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,600
Just a second.

231
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,394
<i>We were in a relationship,</i>

232
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,521
<i>but he was never fully mine.</i>

233
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,940
Stop stalking Se-yeon on social media.

234
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,400
Why are you even dating me?

235
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,987
She says she wants to thank the woman
who finally gets me away from her.

236
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,366
Even after all this time,
Se-yeon still thinks I'm nothing.

237
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,287
Have you been using me
to make Se-yeon jealous?

238
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,457
If that's the case, let's end this.

239
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,921
<i>He got so angry that</i>
<i>Se-yeon was unfazed even after</i>

240
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,923
<i>receiving our wedding invitation.</i>

241
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,887
He thought the wedding
might trigger some regret. Jeez.

242
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,140
So you broke off the wedding?

243
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,391
You saw the photo.

244
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,185
Who'd like a guy with such an ugly face?

245
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,439
He seemed loyal, pure and innocent,

246
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,816
which is why I accepted his proposal.

247
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,151
However, hearing that...

248
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,655
Well, I felt betrayed.

249
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,033
That gold digger bitch dares to lie?

250
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,077
She was only after his money.

251
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,958
Sorry.

252
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,126
A few days after Se-yeon died,

253
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,836
Min came to see me.

254
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,592
Wait, he wouldn't have had the time.

255
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,179
They met?

256
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,265
After calling off the wedding,
I went on a trip to clear my head.

257
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,728
I wasn't even aware
of Se-yeon's death back then.

258
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,021
Anyway,

259
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,065
when I got back,

260
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,777
I don't know how he knew my new address,
but he came looking for me.

261
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,655
Who is it?

262
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,077
How did you find me?

263
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,749
Go away. I'm done talking to you.

264
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,921
That's why I always warned you

265
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,174
to check before opening the door.

266
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:58,976
So what's this about?

267
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,644
Say your piece and leave.

268
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,688
Hee-jin.

269
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,649
You see,

270
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,902
I always got what I wanted,

271
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,071
no matter what it was.

272
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,323
It didn't matter how.

273
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,410
One way or another, I got what I wanted.

274
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,954
<i>I thought he was asking me</i>

275
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,041
<i>to get back together with him.</i>

276
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,877
<i>I kicked him out because I didn't want to.</i>

277
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,298
The more I thought about it,
it seemed weird.

278
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,260
He never once showed up
or called me since that day.

279
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,763
So?

280
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,312
That day,

281
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,524
he dropped this.

282
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,583
I know everything.

283
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,377
I'm the one who brought you back to life.

284
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,587
I don't have any allergies.

285
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,048
Maybe I got allergies
along with my new face?

286
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,475
Right.

287
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,811
Why did I easily believe

288
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,356
that the guy was really Min?

289
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,911
What did she say?
She says I'm not the killer, right?

290
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,247
She came here to say that, right?

291
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,748
Please tell me what she said.

292
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,459
Hey!

293
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,340
Hey.

294
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,509
Se-yeon.

295
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,680
What's wrong?

296
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,557
What on earth did Hee-jin say?

297
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:03,892
Who are you?

298
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,939
Are you really the Cha Min I know?

299
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,400
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

300
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,318
Just what did Hee-jin say?

301
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,656
You can ask her yourself.

302
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,122
I just left the building
after telling them everything.

303
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,042
Yes, I gave them the bracelet.

304
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,878
Why would I go back inside?

305
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,129
Excuse me.

306
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,464
Hold on. I'll call you back.

307
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,801
And who might you be?

308
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,471
Weren't you inside earlier?

309
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,557
So how can I help you?

310
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,517
Well...

311
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,315
I'm sorry,

312
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,775
but I don't have the time
to talk right now.

313
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,737
Then when...

314
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,339
My precious daughter...

315
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,470
Se-yeon...

316
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,193
This can't be happening.

317
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,949
This man?
Yes, he came here. I remember seeing him.

318
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,203
He came in the evening
and stayed for hours.

319
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,705
<i>Before I closed up,</i>

320
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,666
<i>I checked to see if anyone was still here.</i>

321
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,542
<i>He was there by the grave.</i>

322
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,044
What are you doing, sir?

323
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,634
It was so weird that
I made a mental note of his face.

324
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,011
Are there any security cameras here?

325
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,348
Of course there is. Come over here.

326
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,683
Here.

327
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,480
Here. It's this man.

328
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,195
You can't exactly see his face.

329
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,989
Are you sure it's him?

330
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,448
I'm sure.

331
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,075
It's the same man.

332
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,703
I saw him in person, so I'm sure of it.

333
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,664
Okay, thanks.
Have forensics go over the footage.

334
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,375
- Sure.
- Detective Park, let's dig her up.

335
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,752
Her family already signed off on it.

336
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,424
We'll know if Cha Min was there
once we dig her up.

337
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,010
Be careful.

338
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,886
Se-yeon...

339
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,556
- Gently on three.
- No...

340
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,072
He must be a real nutjob.

341
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,493
Oh, no. She's fainted.

342
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,371
Scan every inch of this casket
and check for even partial prints.

343
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,539
Yes, sir.

344
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,427
Get up.

345
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,348
Wait. What are you doing?

346
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,392
- Stab.
- What?

347
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,645
Imagine you're stabbing someone
and show me how you'd do it.

348
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,524
Why are you acting this way?

349
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,401
You wouldn't tell me what Hee-jin said,

350
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,986
and you didn't answer my calls.

351
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,946
Where were you and why are you...

352
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,989
Se-yeon!

353
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,950
Se-yeon!

354
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,916
Did she lock it? Seriously?

355
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,418
What the hell is wrong with her today?

356
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,586
Se-yeon!

357
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,380
Se-yeon!

358
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,924
Se-yeon!

359
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,009
I'm the one

360
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,344
who brought you back to life.

361
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,096
With this.

362
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,430
You're...

363
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,681
Se-yeon, right?

364
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,267
- Who are you?
- It's me. Cha Min.

365
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,061
The night of your murder,

366
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,480
I bought the hangover cure drinks here.

367
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,399
Had I not bought them

368
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,651
and kept waiting
for you in front of your house...

369
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,820
you wouldn't have been murdered.

370
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,405
I'm sorry, Se-yeon.

371
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,073
Se-yeon, you're brave,

372
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,950
invincible,

373
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,660
and the most powerful in this universe.

374
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,540
What am I supposed to believe?

375
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,254
Let me get you new blankets.
You said you were cold last night.

376
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,720
You heard her. Get out.

377
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,390
Se-yeon. No, Ms. Lee Mi-do.

378
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,726
I really don't understand
why you're shutting me out like this.

379
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,645
If you have a problem with me,
tell me. Why--

380
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,980
I don't have a problem with you.

381
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,315
I just want you off this case.

382
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,568
Did you get the result from the NFS?

383
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,819
Yes. We got...

384
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,614
Ms. Lee, you and I should talk.

385
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,700
- Hey!
- Hey.

386
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,826
Don't hold her hand!

387
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,578
Get your hand off me!

388
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,413
What is the matter with you?

389
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,915
You have to tell me why you're pissed off.

390
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,959
This is my business. You stay out of it.

391
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,794
This isn't just your business.

392
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,422
I'm involved in this case, too.
I'm the murder...

393
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,840
suspect.

394
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,676
It's me who has to get
the culprit and clear my name.

395
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,927
Is that really true?

396
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,554
Right now, Min is missing.

397
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,973
How can I believe that you're really Min?

398
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,685
You checked me that day.

399
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,312
Here's my cellphone.

400
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,940
- This is my ID card.
- How do I know that

401
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,068
you didn't abduct Min after killing me--

402
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,153
Sir!

403
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,030
We have the result from the NFS.

404
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,158
They found Cha Min's fingerprints
in Go Se-yeon's casket.

405
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,336
Hey, let go. Where are we going?

406
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,631
I have to check something right now.
Be quiet and just come with me.

407
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,925
- What do you need to check?
- I have to!

408
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,260
- Hey, hurry.
- This is crazy.

409
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,682
We're not open yet.

410
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,559
You have an ID scanner here, right?

411
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,311
Pardon?

412
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,188
ID CARD
CHA MIN

413
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,580
It's a match. The fingerprints match.

414
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,750
You're Min. You're my friend, Min.

415
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,834
Hey.

416
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,628
Seriously. I really thought...

417
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,256
I was worried sick
that you might not be my friend Min

418
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,592
and that you were lying to me when you're
actually the murderer who killed me.

419
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,219
- Do you know--
- Did you suspect me?

420
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,430
- What?
- I'm the one who saved you.

421
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,101
I told you that I was Min.
I told you that.

422
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,520
I answered your questions
and proved everything!

423
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,438
But still...

424
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,109
There wasn't definite proof
that you were really Min.

425
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,070
Do you think I can believe
that you're Se-yeon

426
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,030
because I had definite proof
that you are her?

427
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,575
We've been friends for a long time.

428
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,785
Must you check it with your eyes
to actually believe it?

429
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,580
Unbelievable. You're so not loyal.

430
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,249
But I'm really glad that you're him.

431
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,044
Let me get this straight.
You're really Min.

432
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,422
And you did come back to life
with that handsome face.

433
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,756
And you did save me.

434
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,384
I'm really relieved
that everything I know is true.

435
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,679
Right. You probably left
your fingerprints on my coffin

436
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,056
when you came to say goodbye to me, right?

437
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,433
You said you saved me that day.

438
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,475
Darn it.

439
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,148
Hey, this is it.

440
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,608
Oh Yeong-cheol.

441
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,276
Oh Yeong-cheol!

442
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,487
He probably came back to life
in someone else's body just like us.

443
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,489
But he probably didn't know, either,

444
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,576
that our fingerprints don't change
even if we have different bodies.

445
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,912
What? He's never even left behind
a single strand of hair.

446
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,247
He left a fingerprint this time?

447
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,250
That was it.

448
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,836
He hasn't found out that
his fingerprints are the same.

449
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,381
In this case,
the investigation will speed up,

450
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,966
and he'll get arrested in no time.

451
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,845
<i>That is why we will release details</i>
<i>regarding the case to the public</i>

452

458
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,741
<i>if you've seen someone who resembles him</i>
<i>or know his whereabouts.</i>

459
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,536
I get that it's an important case,
but how could they so quickly...

460
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,748
Right. They found your fingerprints there.

461
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,210
Hold on. We should do something right now.

462
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,962
- Give me a second. Be quiet.
<i>- I was informed that</i>

<i>Let's hear the story from her.</i>

467
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,932
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

468
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,602
<i>First of all, let me thank you</i>

00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,313
<i>Sure.</i>

471
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,192
<i>I wanted to do this interview</i>
<i>to share information,</i>

472
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,278
<i>but more importantly,</i>

473
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,990
<i>I decided to do it</i>

474
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,119
<i>Please tell us about the suspect.</i>

475

SUSPECT'S EX-FIANCÈE

477

478
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,171
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

479
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,591

483
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,898

00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,158
I'm sorry.

00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,911
I know that everyone
in this country is angry at him.

487
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,205
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,792
<i>I understand that you must be</i>
<i>going through a very difficult time.</i>

489
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,628
<i>Is there anything you'd like</i>
<i>to say before we finish?</i>

490
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,436
Min.

491
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,815
If you're watching this from somewhere,

492
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,779
I want you to turn yourself in
and pay for your crime.

493
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,867
Hey. Don't listen to her. She's lying.

494
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,036
I started doubting you
because that witch lied--

495
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,121
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

496
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,793
Please do it for our baby.

497
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,922
<i>Please turn yourself in.</i>

498
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,384
"Our baby"?

499
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,347
Hey, Min.

500
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,391
Let go of me. I'll tell them everything
and let them investigate me.

501
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,227
Hey, Min. Come on.

502
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,104
You're someone else right now.
How will you do that?

503
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,065
You won't be able to clear your name.

504
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,483
It's hard to prove

505
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,985
- that you're Min to begin with.
- It's all because of this.

506
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,571
Let's show them this and explain to them.

507
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:24,989
Yes, come with me.

508
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,575
If people don't believe me,
I'll kill myself or something.

509
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,244
You can save me with this, then.

510
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,579
When they see it with their eyes,
they'll believe me.

511
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,872
- Take this.
- No.

512
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,124
- Just take this. Come on.
- I said no. You do it then.

513
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,751
- Just take this.
- No.

514
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,169
- I won't.
- Just this once.

515
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,338
- Please just take it.
- You do it.

516
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,422
- Take this.
- I won't.

517
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,590
- No, I won't.
- Hold on.

518
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,842
Hey!

519
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,724
What were you talking about?

520
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,725
It looked like...

521
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,354
It looked like you were doing <i>taekkyeon</i>
or something.

522
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,856
You were, weren't you?

523
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,233
There's nothing here.

524
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,947
You can't see it?

525
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,658
See what?

526
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,578
I get it. I must pay you 500 won
to get you to tell me what it is.

527
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,746
Here. Now, tell me.

528
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,708
I guess he can't see it.

529
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,878
What? What is it?

530
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,046
What's there?
Why are you doing that with your fingers?

531
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,762
ONLY THE ONES WHO WERE REVIVED
BY ABYSS CAN SEE IT

532
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,265
Take down all the articles right now!

533
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,601
Are you guys even doing your job?

534
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,768
Right now, the legal team--

535
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,978
I told you to find everyone

536
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,023
who can help us with this case,
even if they aren't lawyers!

537
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,401
What about the others?

538
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,986
Haven't you heard any news from them?

539
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,155
We're searching every corner
of the country,

540
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,948
but we haven't found any traces
that Director Cha--

541
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,242
What is it that you want to tell me, then?

542
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,454
Are you telling me
that my son is dead somewhere?

543
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,081
Ma'am.

544
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,176
Dr. Jang keeps calling.

545
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,761
You should be admitted...

546
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,930
Admitted? In this situation?

547
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,600
Are you suggesting
that I throw away Lan Cosmetics?

548
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,519
If you're that worried about me,

549
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,273
bring my son to me this instant!

550
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,442
Darn it.

551
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,736
When we were looking at the CCTV footage,

552
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,404
I thought catching him would be easy.

553
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,823
I don't get what's happening right now.

554
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,369
Hey, I'm certain that I wasn't
Oh Yeong-cheol's first victim.

555
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,537
I was looking into him for Eomsan-dong--

556
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,457
I should meet with Hee-jin first.
I should tell her the truth.

557
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,751
How?

558
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,420
Other people can't see Abyss.
How will you explain it to her?

559
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,256
She's carrying my child.
I can't let her be a single mom.

560
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,927
Being a child of a single mom might be
better than being a murderer's child.

561
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,805
Besides, if you meet with her,
I'm sure they'll catch you.

562
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,348
Nothing about this makes sense,

563
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,850
but everything makes sense
if you turn yourself in.

564
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,769
They're trying to frame you
for the murder,

565
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,062
so they can close this case.

566
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,147
I'm not saying I'll turn myself in.

567
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,108
Let me calm her down first.

568
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,651
You think she won't call the cops?

569
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,655
Hey, do you know what she said
at the police station last night?

570
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,700
She told the cops that
she was sure that you were the murderer.

571
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,660
I suspected you for a reason.

572
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,495
And she even brought the smoking gun.

573
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,914
She brought the bracelet
that was on my dead body.

574
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,459
Hey, why do you blindly believe
every word that comes out of her mouth?

575
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,005
Fine. Since we're on the subject,
let's be frank here.

576
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,425
Can you be absolutely certain
that the baby is yours?

577
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,592
You must know better.

578
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,720
Was there ever a situation
to make that happen?

579
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,097
Well...

580
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,976
After I passed out from drinking too much,
we woke up in bed,

581
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,269
so I'm not sure.

582
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,439
How could you not be sure about that?

583
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,400
You never dated before,
and you're too naive for your own good.

584
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,860
There's no way you'd do that drunk.

585
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,279
I know you.
We've been friends for 20 years!

586
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,531
Are you that dumb or that naive?

587
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,659
Yes, because I'm that dumb and that naive,

588
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,286
I believed you and did what you told me.

589
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,330
You doubted me and didn't believe me!

590
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,376
Hee-jin was the first

591
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,796
and the only woman who loved me.

592
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,674
Why should I believe you over her?

593
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,678
Stop criticizing her in front of me.

594
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,389
I'll take care of it.
Mind your own business.

595
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,850
Hey...

596
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,066
Damn it.

597
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,172
I know that you don't drink coffee.

598
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,174
But they only serve coffee here.

599
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,096
Do you think I want to sip coffee
with you right now?

600
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,189
This has always been your problem.

601
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,733
You're ignorant and cheap.

602
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,361
Jang Sun-young.

603
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,281
You're just like that woman.

604
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,744
How do you know my mother?

605
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,915
I know her well enough.

606
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,502
If you raise your voice again,

607
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,089
you'll end up like your mother.

608
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,345
My mom isn't dead, right? Where is she?

609
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,348
If you touch her,

610
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,934
I'll make you pay.

611
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,603
I don't know

612
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,356
why you're doing Oh Yeong-cheol's
dirty work for him,

613
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,483
but be careful.

614
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,028
Unless you want to shorten
your life even more.

615
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,035
I won't see you again
since I did what he asked, right?

616
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,331
Tell Oh Yeong-cheol never
to look for me again.

617
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,457
And if he does,

618
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,502
I'll reveal everything
even if it means risking my life.

619
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,141
You'll reveal everything
even if it means risking your life?

620
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,733
Excuse me.
One more cup of Mandheling coffee, please.

621
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,527
Sure.

622
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:45,494
THE METAMORPHOSIS

623
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,915
- Where? Gimcheon?
- You saw him in Busan?

624
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,208
- Thank you.
- Go on.

625
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,919
- Just because he's ugly...
- Gyeongsang Province?

626
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,755
- I know that he's very ugly.
- Jeolla accent?

627
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,007
Was there anything suspicious about him?

628
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,508
- He's from Seoul.
- Hello?

629
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,219
Okay. Thank you.

630
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,473
This is why making cases public sucks.

631
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,767
Credible reports are less than 5%.

632
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,646
Still, we should be glad
we have any chance at all.

633
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,357
Where was the most credible report from?
Donghae and where?

634
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,733
Donghae and Incheon.

635
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,402
We sent a team to Incheon.
We're getting one for Donghae.

636
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,488
- Okay.
- Come on.

637
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,740
- What? This is mine.
- Give it.

638
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,784
This is all you've been eating
for three days.

639
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,203
We ordered <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.
Go have a meal, not this.

640
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,664
Why do you keep eating junk food?
You're not a kid anymore.

641
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,376
- Thank you.
- Treat me better.

642
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,216
- Cancel it.
- Why? You want something else?

643
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,469
- Crabmeat porridge.
- Crabmeat porridge?

644
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,887
She likes that. Order me that.

645
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,514
Hello.

646
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,890
Yes.

647
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,643
Are you going to move in here?

648
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,562
Don't pick a fight with me.
I'm just sitting here quietly.

649
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,647
Leave me alone.

650
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,026
Goodness, my eyes!

651
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,154
How can I leave you alone
when you're so beautiful?

652
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,199
You're radiating right here
in this dull-looking precinct.

653
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,159
I can't focus on my job because of you.

654
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,207
I ordered crabmeat porridge. Eat it.

655
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,751
You need energy
to dig information out of me.

656
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,171
What? Detective Park,
Cha Min just resurfaced.

657
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,013
Hey, Hee-jin.

658
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,890
Hey. I'm almost there.

659
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,517
Where are you?

660
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,906
- Hello.
- Hi.

661
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,158
- Long time no see.
- Right.

662
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,284
By the way,

663
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,579
I'm going to borrow this.
It won't take long.

664
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,289
What? Hey.

665
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,418
Hey! Seriously?
In front of the police station?

666
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,295
That's dangerous!

667
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,298
Excuse me. Hey!

668
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,302
Min, are you sure you're
at Jisan Park right now?

669
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,804
Yes, I'm at Jisan Park in Sansa-dong.

670
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,931
Okay. I got it.

671
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,976
I'm almost there. Meet me at the entrance.

672
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,478
Okay.

673
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,945
This is Oh Su-jin.

674
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,448
You are on your way, right?

675
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,662
Okay. I'll stall him as much as I can.

676
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,006
Excuse me.

677
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,717
It's closing time now.

678
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,095
- Is that so?
- Yes.

679
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,263
- Okay.
- Okay.

680
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,146
Hello.

681
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,024
Please hold.

682
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,110
Someone is asking for you.

683
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,448
It's me.

684
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,993
Okay.

685
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,623
It's best to dispose of it
once it has served its purpose.

686
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,960
So where is the location?

687
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,426
Hey, Min! Goodness.

688
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,718
Hey, how did you find me here?

689
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,054
Hey, we don't have time
for chit-chat. Hop on now.

690
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,140
- Let's get out of here first.
- What?

691
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,685
The police are coming to get you.
Hop on already.

692
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,353
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

693
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,605
Hey, didn't I tell you?

694
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,359
I told you she'd report you to the police,
so I told you not to call her.

695
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,782
That's better.
My fingerprints haven't changed,

696
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,160
so I can tell them who I am
and let them investigate me.

697
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,786
- And I'll prove my innocence.
- How?

698
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,414
Min, get a grip. I'm the prosecutor here.

699
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,292
You will never be able to prove
your innocence even in your next life.

700
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,586
All the evidence and witnesses
are saying you're the killer.

701
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,671
Besides, you think Ji-uk will let you go?

702
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:09,175
No way. He'll indict you and make you
the culprit whatever it takes.

703
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,177
It doesn't matter how innocent you are.

704
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,053
I'm telling you the hard facts here.

705
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,850
Why isn't he answering?

706
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,437
Even if that happens,
I must meet with Hee-jin first.

707
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,813
Hey!

708
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,734
- I can see you. I'll go over there.
- Hey, Min.

709
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,744
Hee-jin.

710
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,890
When humans are no longer useful,
they are just like bugs.

711
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,559
Those useless beings aren't humans.

712
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,524
Hee-jin, wake up.

713
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,734
Hee-jin. Open your eyes! Hee-jin!

714
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,069
Hee-jin!

715
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,706
She's not dead, is she?

716
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,088
Shit, it's hot!

717
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,757
- Why you--
- Who's there?

718
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:32,883
Pardon.

719
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,141
What's wrong with her?

720
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,727
Hey, Hee-jin.

721
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,855
Hey, Hee-jin. Wake up.
What's wrong with her?

722
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,274
Hey.

723
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,446
Yes... The hospital.
Let's go to the hospital first.

724
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,659
Be careful.

725
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,080
- You can't. Stay away.
- What?

726
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,498
There's a rule for it to activate.

727
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,418
It only works when
it's just the body, Abyss and me.

728
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,169
If someone else gets involved,

729
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,298
- I can't save her.
- What?

730
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,427
I'm sorry, Se-yeon. Wait here for a bit.

731
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,139
Hey, Min!

732
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,059
Hey, hold on. Hey, Min. Open up.

733
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,185
Hey, Min!

734
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:32,693
ABYSS ACTIVATES ONLY WHEN
THE OWNER AND THE CORPSE IS ALONE

735
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,695
Damn it.

736
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,961
Please.

737
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,130
Please save her just this once. Please.

738
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,799
Please save her.
Please wake up, Hee-jin. Please!

739
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,384
Please...

740
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,928
Hee-jin...

741
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,114
Hee-jin.

742
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:37,633
Hey.

743
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:39,927
Mi-do.

744
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,846
- Search everywhere.
- Okay.

745
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,642
What happened here?

746
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,355
Excuse me.

747
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,399
Get me a doctor. A doctor, please.

748
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,075
What's happening?

749
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,369
Why are you...

750
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,496
Hold on. I saved you.

751
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,581
- But we must run tests for the baby.
- What is this?

752
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,874
Lie down.

753
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,584
When is that doctor coming?

754
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,171
What happened?

755
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,217
I was hit by a truck.

756
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,691
- He's not here.
- Can you reach his fiancée?

757
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,902
I saw this coming.

758
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,571
Do you think he abducted her?

759
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,533
Hey, could you uncuff me?

760
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,995
After you explain to me

761
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,874
why you are here
and why there's so much blood there,

762
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,125
I'll uncuff you.

763
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,253
Okay. I'll explain everything.
Please just uncuff me.

764
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,213
Hey, go. Keep searching the area.

765
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,299
<i>She's not pregnant.</i>

766
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,886
<i>There's no possibility that she'd</i>
<i>be pregnant even with the ultrasound.</i>

767
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,482
I...

768
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,403
I think I'd better be hospitalized.

769
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,447
Why? Don't you feel well?

770
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,033
The doctor says you're fine.

771
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,328
No, it's just that...

772
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:34,625
I was wondering
if my eyebrows disappearing

773
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,252
and my acne scars suddenly reappearing

774
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,547
had anything to do with the accident.

775
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,927
It was a big accident,
so that may be the reason.

776
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,678
Anyway,

777
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,681
weren't you pregnant?

778
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:51,892
What?

779
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,144
I heard you were...

780
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,395
Me?

781
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,315
No way!

782
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,860
How could you say such a thing
to someone who's single?

783
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,157
All right.

784
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,200
Go on.

785
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,411
You said that you needed to go home.
Why were you out there?

786
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,663
Is that where you live?

787
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,581
I was on my way...

788
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,625
but I wanted to go for a walk.

789
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,627
Why did you steal that motorcycle then?

790
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,170
Do you go on walks on motorcycles?

791
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,381
I didn't exactly steal it.

792
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,883
I borrowed it. Right? I asked you first.

793
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,885
- I got permission from him.
- Are you serious--

794
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,136
Detective Park.

795
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,639
The bloodstains
on the road match Oh Su-jin's.

796
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,726
Cha Min must have kidnapped
his fiancée as well.

797
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,980
That son of a bitch.

798
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,523
Contact all the nearby hospitals

799
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,775
- and check all the surveillance cameras.
- Sure.

800
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,278
He must have used a car for sure

801
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,029
so call all the car rental shops

802
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,074
- and ask if Oh Su-jin--
- Wait. The brat's name is...

803
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,035
I mean, the fiancée's name is Oh Su-jin?

804
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,287
Not Jang Hee-jin?

805
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,747
Didn't you ask us to look into it
because she seemed shady?

806
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,125
What the...

807
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,043
- Go on and find out.
- Yes, sir.

808
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,215
She's a total fraud!
Her age, name, everything!

809
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,217
She has four previous records of fraud

810
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,553
and was sued six times
for false pretense of marriage!

811
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,180
So? What are you trying to say?

812
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,933
Please come to your senses.

813
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,686
I kept trying to tell you
that she was lying on television--

814
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,187
I know. I already checked it.

815
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,899
<i>You do? And you went to save her?</i>

816
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:26,153
<i>Min, the cops are even suspecting you</i>
<i>of abduction.</i>

817
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,865
She did that interview and everything
to get you caught!

818
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,575
I think so, too.

819
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,745
Let's talk about it later.

820
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,538
What? Hey, Cha Min.

821
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,081
Wait. Hey!

822
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,423
I need you to come with me.

823
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,803
Why did you bring that brat here?

824
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,139
I'm baffled, too.

825
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,767
Isn't it rude to bring someone else
to your place

826
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,644
when you already have a girl
living with you?

827
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,270
I'm leaving.

828
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,316
Stay here for the time being.
It's dangerous out there.

829
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,153
We need to talk.

830
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,415
Are you out of your mind?
Why did you bring her here?

831
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,876
She lied on the news to trick you

832
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,836
and turn you over to the police.
How could you--

833
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,798
It was a murder.
The accident that happened to her.

834
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,343
You saw it yourself.
It was a murder disguised as an accident.

835
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,930
After everything that happened,

836
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,349
I could only think of one thing.

837
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,434
"Why did she have to do that?

838
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:44,189
Why did she have to lie
and make them think I was the culprit?

839
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,441
What would she gain from it?"

840
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:50,529
- She might be an accomplice to the killer.
- Then there's no reason to be killed.

841
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,450
Now I know one thing's for sure.

842
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,369
Someone's trying to end the case

843
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:00,038
by fabricating it
and making you look like the killer.

844
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,793
Why is everyone screwing around
with the wrong conclusion

845
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,087
when I, the victim, am not convinced?

846
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,506
- What do we have to do to prove--
- There is...

847
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,300
a way, actually.

848
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:16,847
Is there another way except
for catching the culprit?

849
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:21,059
Park Gi-man said he knew the key
to all the secrets.

850
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,021
We can make him tell us what he knows.

851
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,065
He's the only one who knows
the current face of Oh Yeong-cheol.

852
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,817
Do you think I don't know that?

853
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,612
How are we going to get him to talk?
He's in a vegetative state now.

854
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:36,992
Abyss.

855
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,537
We can kill and revive him again with it.

856
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,373
I know how to use it now.

857
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,458
What?

858
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,793
I'll do it. You just stay here.

859
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,211
Hey.

860
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:53,050
Do you even realize what you're saying?

861
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,594
- You're saying you'll kill a person.
- There's no other way,

862
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,556
if we want to prove my innocence
and catch the bastard who killed you.

863
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,100
Hey!

864
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,437
What is he saying?

865
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,237
Excuse me!

866
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:20,243
Could I use your phone? Mine's broken.

867
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,246
It's better off if you don't
let anyone know that you're alive.

868
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,791
- What?
- I want...

869
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,087
I mean, there's a lot of things
we need to talk about.

870
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,421
And I have many questions.

871
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:37,469
I have something to deal with right now.
Wait here in the meantime.

872
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:38,887
Hey, Min.

873
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,430
Min. Hey, Cha Min!

874
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,640
Hey!

875
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:47,854
Hey, you gold digger. I have a lot to say,
but I'll hold it in because I'm busy now.

876
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,398
We're going to discuss
everything you've done later on

877
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,567
so don't do anything or touch anything

878
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,153
and don't you dare move an inch
until we return. Understand?

879
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,156
Who are you to keep talking down to me--

880
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,118
Hey! I would've killed you already
if these were the old days.

881
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,077
You nasty brat!

882
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,164
Unless you have a death wish,
stay right here. Got it?

883
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,167
Answer me.

884
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,343
Hey, Min!

885
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:19,886
Min!

886
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,389
Wait! Hey!

887
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,349
Damn it!

888
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,311
What is he going to do...

889
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,438
Seriously.

890
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,403
Aren't you supposed to leave tomorrow?

891
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,156
Yes, but I have something
to take care of tonight.

892
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:42,159
I already told the doctor
that I'll be leaving early.

893
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,869
- Okay.
- All right.

894
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,281
You seem very tired.

895
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,992
I'm the prosecutor in charge.

896
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,286
I came to check on Park Gi-man.

897
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,958
There's no improvement.
He's still unconscious.

898
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,793
May I go in and check on him?

899
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,754
Sure. His room is that way.

900
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,464
Thank you.

901
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,935
It's a fresh cup. Enjoy.

902
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,228
You look very tired.

903
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,856
Thank you, sir.

904
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,720
<i>It's already past visiting hours.</i>
<i>Stop with the nonsense and just--</i>

905
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,348
I'll just try.
I've already arrived at the hospital.

906
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,683
<i>Hey, Min. Hey!</i>

907
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,934
What do you think you're doing?

908
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,062
It's something urgent--

909
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,022
- It's past visiting hours.
- Just one minute.

910
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,482
- Please.
- No. You can't.

911
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,776
- It will only take a minute.
- It's past visiting hours.

912
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,319
Did anyone come by, then?

913
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:07,364
- Of course not! It's past visiting hours!
- I really need to check on him.

914
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,616
Please, ma'am. I'm begging you.

915
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,825
I really need to check.

916
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,744
- No, you may not.
- Please...

917
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,997
I'm only letting you check on him

918
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,999
since you're his lawyer.

919
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,086
Of course.
I only need to see if he's dead or alive.

920
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,797
The alarm would have gone crazy
if he had died.

921
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,886
This means his heart is beating, right?

922
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,017
I knew it.

923
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,812
He's way too soft to do that.

924
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,022
Are you good now?

925
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,274
Yes, ma'am.

926
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,402
Thank you so much.

927
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,283
<i>- The number you have dialed--</i>
- Damn it.

928
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,743
Why won't he pick up?

929
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,750
Why won't he pick up?

930
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,867
Min! What happened? Are you all right?

931
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,536
I'm fine.

932
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,165
You're not fine at all, you moron!

933
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,877
Hang in there. I'll call the doctor.

934
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,091
- What?
- This...

935
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,096
Abyss.

936
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,932
Why...

937
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,693
Hey.

938
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:11,946
Min.

939
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,959
It can't be.

940
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,795
Hey.

941
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,673
Hey!

942
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,468
You're not dead, right?

943
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,138
Hey, wake up, Min!

944
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,848
Hey.

945
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,683
Hey!

946
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:47,857
Right.

947
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,609
This marble.

948
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,112
I can revive him with this.

949
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,407
How does this work?

950
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,868
How am I supposed to...

951
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,620
Save him...

952
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:09,504
IF THE OWNER OF THE ABYSS DIES,
THE NEXT REVIVED IS ITS TEMPORARY OWNER

953
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,764
What...

954
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,642
What...

955
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,395
What should I do?

956
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,938
What's going on?

957
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,109
No!

958
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,635
Min, wake up!

959
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,558
Wake up, Min.

960
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,727
Come on.

961
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,925
<i>We got the results</i>
<i>from the hospital murder case.</i>

962
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,011
<i>We found some things</i>
<i>that shouldn't have been there.</i>

963
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,305
<i>If anyone has a weird marble,</i>

964
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,641
<i>- make sure to catch them.</i>
