1
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,191
WE INVITE YOU TO CELEBRATE OUR MARRIAGE

2
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,160
<i>The number you have dialed is
unavailable now. Please leave...</i>

3
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,832
Hee-jin!

4
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,585
Please open the door. Hee-jin!

5
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>I'm sorry. Let's call off the wedding.</i>

6
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,177
<i>I just don't think I can</i>

7
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,389
<i>share a bed and eat meals with
your ugly face for the rest of my life.</i>

8
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,060
<i>I'm sorry I don't have the stomach for it.</i>

9
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,168
Shit, it's high.

10
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,087
It's so high up.

11
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,346
I can do this.

12
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,643
I can do this!

13
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,448
No, I can't do this.

14
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,086
Why did he call me so many times?

15
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,448
SE-YEON

16
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,126
Why isn't he picking up
now that I'm calling back?

17
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,421
SE-YEON

18
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,550
Hello? Hey, Min.

19
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,928
<i>Cha Min?</i>

20
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,347
- Se-yeon!
- <i>Hello?</i>

21
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,267
Se-yeon, help me!

22
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,313
I'm about to fall to my death!

23
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,820
Where are you? What's going on?

24
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,948
<i>If I caught you in a bad moment,
we can talk again later.</i>

25
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,575
No! There's no "later"!

26
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,994
Don't hang up on me!

27
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,538
I'm going to die!

28
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,457
This is all because of you, Se-yeon.

29
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,295
If only you hadn't
introduced me to Hee-jin...

30
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,631
<i>If only you had
accepted my feelings for you,</i>

31
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,633
<i>I wouldn't have come this far.</i>

32
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,887
You always lash out at me
when you're dumped.

33
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,724
If that's why you called me,
I'm going to hang up.

34
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,273
Hello? Min?

35
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,066
<i>Min?</i>

36
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,993
What was that?

37
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,379
- You're here.
- Hi.

38
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,131
- Come on.
- Sure thing.

39
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,151
<i>Life and death are providential.</i>

40
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:04,238
<i>There is nothing a man can do
in the face of death.</i>

41
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,825
<i>I also believed that life and death</i>

42
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,869
<i>are in the hands of providence.</i>

43
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,714
<i>Until we rose from the dead.</i>

44
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,469
<i>Until Abyss came into
Min's and my possession.</i>

EPISODE 1

46
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,225
24 HOURS BEFORE GO SE-YEON'S DEATH

47
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,720
<i>LONG LIVE THE KING</i>
VOLUME 7

48
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,946
Why did you come to the crime scene?

49
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,239
It's not a pretty sight.

50
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,449
Hi.

51
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,328
Se-yeon, let me take over this case.

52
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,872
You and Seung-hun
were close in law school.

53
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,417
- Save yourself from--
- No, this is my case.

54
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,172
He was attacked by
the Eomsan-dong serial killer.

55
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,258
It's not a copycat?
He hasn't been active for four years.

56
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,510
No, I'm sure it's him.

57
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,596
The M.O. is the same,
right down to the murder weapon.

58
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,890
He was killed
just like the victim in 2000.

59
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,107
This bastard must want to
be caught by me more than you.

60
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,484
He was off the grid,

61
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,737
but he resurfaced
once you stepped off the case.

62
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,818
Doctor, how's my husband?

63
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,320
Don't worry too much.

64
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,739
The surgery went well.

65
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,742
Come on.

66
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,119
Thank you, Doctor.

67
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,455
- Mommy, don't cry.
- Thank you.

68
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,291
It's all right.

69
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,126
Your dad is all right.

70
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,342
Hey, kid.

71
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,678
How about a lollipop?

72
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,225
If you cry, you're going to
upset your mom even more.

73
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,768
Now, that's enough.

74
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,145
That's enough.

75
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,272
That's a good boy.

76
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,065
Take this candy.

77
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,944
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

78
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,988
Thank you, Doctor.

79
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,836
Sorry about that.

80
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,590
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

81
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,571
You're off to the office, right?

82
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,657
I'll give you a lift.

83
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,162
You said you only slept for two hours.

84
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,332
I'll drive.
You get some shut-eye on the way.

85
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,186
I'm not depressed, you know.

86
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,188
There's no need to be concerned.

87
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,858
I know. The music is for me.

88
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,905
Is he getting married?

89
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,699
Up until a few months ago,
he said he loved you.

90
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,993
It just happened that way.

91
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,000
He's had a crush on you for 20 years.

92
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,503
How can one have
such a quick change of heart?

93
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,755
Beats me.

94
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,592
It's not just women.
Men change their minds easily too.

95
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,302
His 20 years of love for me

96
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,139
was thrown out the window
once he met someone pretty who liked him.

97
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,306
Pure love, my ass.

98
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,143
Do you regret it now that he's taken?

99
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,646
Regret? Seriously?

100
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,691
I'm Go Se-yeon.

101
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,192
Didn't you see what he looks like?

102
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,363
- He's not even close to being my type.
- Still, you let him

103
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,115
hang around you for 20 years.

104
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,325
You've been leading him on for too long.

105
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,661
Hey! Are you kidding me?

106
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,623
That is what I hate the most
in a relationship.

107
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,710
Also, I never asked him to do anything.
It was his choice.

108
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,464
It's better seeing you throw a fit
like this than seeing you so depressed.

109
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,424
I was never depressed,

110
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,593
and I wasn't throwing a fit.

111
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,261
Sure. If you say so.

112
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,473
I really didn't. Why won't you believe me?

113
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,807
15 HOURS BEFORE GO SE-YEON'S DEATH

114
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,933
<i>I said I got it.</i>

115
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,645
<i>- I'm not depressed or angry.
- All right, fine.</i>

116
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,678
Who is it?

117
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,472
FRONT DOOR

118
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,892
Why are they here so early in the morning?

119
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,647
Unbelievable.

120
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,276
I told you not to fly at a low altitude.

121
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,778
Shift back into human form.

122
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,533
Jeez.

123
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,579
You just had to cause trouble
on our last day here, didn't you?

124
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,830
I bet you did this on purpose.

125
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,292
Did I pick this up for nothing?

126
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,837
There. It's back on.

127
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,755
I got the phone back on...

128
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,551
What are you doing with Abyss?

129
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,684
I'll just bring him back to life.

130
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,537
That's brilliant.

131
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,292
I'm sure it worked.

132
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,919
Why isn't he waking up?

133
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:26,759
His face isn't the same
as it was before he died though.

134
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,179
Do blood splatters
make him look more handsome?

135
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,271
Oh my.

136
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,567
Jeez.

137
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,953
Who are you people?

138
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,915
Have you come to your senses, Cha Min?

139
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,794
Are you the Grim Reaper?

140
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,004
Am I in Heaven?

141
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,674
It looks a lot like Korea though.

142
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,217
You are in Korea.

143
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,135
Yangchon 5-ri, Pyeonggu-eup,
Gyeonggi Province.

144
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,012
You didn't die.

145
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,517
What happened?

146
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,394
What is all this?

147
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,231
Let me explain it
so that it's easier for you to understand.

148
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,316
You were in an accident,

149
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,026
but you didn't die.

150
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,779
In fact, you were reborn

151
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,115
with a face
that'll make the rest of your life easier.

152
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,200
That's right.

153
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,369
- Right.
- Right.

154
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,248
I'm reborn?

155
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,666
Yes.

156
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,167
Yes.

157
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,730
So this is what my soul looks like.

158
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,190
It's weird though.

159
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,444
Don't human souls

160
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,572
usually look the same on the outside?

161
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,367
Why did he become so good-looking?

162
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,994
Look at him.

163
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,704
That's no ordinary human being.

164
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,623
Most humans in this situation

165
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,418
would be surprised or in denial.

166
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,627
That's the usual response.

167
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,130
Him? Not so much.

168
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,592
They say good looks are all that matters.

169
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,137
Even when I'm covered in blood,
I look fashionable.

170
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,682
I look good, don't I?

171
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,564
- A nutjob, right?
- Yes.

172
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,984
Do you have what I gave you?

173
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,074
Let me get this straight.
You killed me by accident

174
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,285
but brought me back to life
with this Dragon Ball.

175
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,413
It's not a Dragon Ball. We call it Abyss.

176
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,915
"Abyss"?

177
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,335
Whatever it is,
this brought me back to life.

178
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,920
That's right.

179
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,348
I like it.

180
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,059
This...

181
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,187
and also this.

182
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,649
- He's a lunatic.
- I'm sure of it.

183
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,070
Keep it safe rather than using it.

184
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,114
I left you a user manual,
so read it when you can.

185
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,157
Sure. Whatever.

186
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,618
You're the owner of that Abyss now,

187
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,787
so make good use of it.

188
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,377
The 100 millionth star just fell.

189
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,505
- We should hurry.
- Okay.

190
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,678
Human, we brought you back to life,

191
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,971
so don't ever get mad at us.

192
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,349
Why would I when I look like this now?

193
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,768
Don't worry, and get back on your way.

194
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,188
Wait, hold on.

195
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,943
When will this face expire?

196
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,945
"Expire"?

197
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,741
When you die.

198
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,748
I should get changed first.

199
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,377
Min.

200
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,754
I know you're home, so open the door.

201
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,758
Unbelievable.
How can you say you looked out for him?

202
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,552
You don't even know
the password to his door.

203
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,554
I never said I didn't know it.

204
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,639
- So you do?
- Yes.

205
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,185
And you're telling me this now?

206
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,394
Are you messing with me?

207
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,854
Before you asked,

208
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,399
you rang the bell
and banged on the door. So...

209
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,736
- Should I?
- Then should I break in?

210
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,029
Of course not.

211
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,786
Mom, you know better
than to cause a ruckus.

212
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,833
Who are you?

213
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,797
Well...

214
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,343
I must've startled you.

215
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:23,305
I used to study
the same major as Min in college--

216
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,598
In college,

217
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,184
Min was the only Korean in his class.

218
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,064
I mean the church next to the college.

219
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,567
I went to church there,
and we became friends.

220
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,987
So you first met him in Australia?

221
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,572
Yes, that's right.

222
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,119
I heard a lot about you though.

223
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,581
Min came to my house often
with the braised short ribs you made.

224
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,501
Because of the smell
of the kimchi you made,

225
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,920
- the police came to his apartment.
- My gosh.

226
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,713
Did Min tell you that?

227
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,839
Of course.

228
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,054
So you must know where Min is right now.

229
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,306
Where is he?

230
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,644
MOM

231
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,068
He was here a minute ago,
but he stepped out to buy something.

232
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,404
I can't believe he left his phone behind.

233
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,571
Sit tight.

234
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,075
I'll go and bring him his phone.

235
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:27,953
Hey.

236
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,621
I told you to hold it off for a while.

237
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,458
Not until Director Cha
approves to change the factory.

238
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,378
Tell them it's the same
for the new product launch.

239
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,508
How can he not show up for work
at an important time like this?

240
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,178
Does Mr. Yang
want to change factories again?

241
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,140
Hasn't he talked enough nonsense?

242
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,684
Don't let him get his way.

243
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,730
How do you know
the works of our company so well?

244
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,029
Whenever Min has too much to drink,

245
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,115
he babbles on about
how incompetent Mr. Yang is.

246
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,742
That's how I know.

247
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,537
Mr. Kim is here.

248
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,832
It seems like you're busy.
I'll tell Min to call you right away,

249
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,792
so you should head to work.

250
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,089
He has tons to do before his wedding.

251
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,050
I can't believe he vanished like this.

252
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,802
Take care!

253
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,249
How did it go?

254
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,044
The number she gave you
is now out of service.

255
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,671
She must've had a secondary phone.

256
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,257
It's turned off though,
so there's no way to track it.

257
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,551
Am I supposed to sit and wait then?

258
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,262
Please calm down.
It's not good for your health.

259
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,972
Unbelievable!

260
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,351
Where did that low-life bitch come from?

261
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,645
I only approved
because Min was in love with her.

262
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,481
How can she fall off the grid?

263
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,402
Does she not know who she's dealing with?

264
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,994
<i>The number you have dialed
is no longer in service.</i>

265
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,747
<i>Please check the number and call again.</i>

266
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,458
HEE-JIN

267
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,852
PHOTO OF MURDER VICTIM

268
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,730
DETAILS OF THE VICTIM'S FAMILY
NAME: PARK GI-MAN

269
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,073
I just don't get it.

270
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,160
Why was it Seung-hun of all people?

271
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,748
You know as well as I do
that he's not one to have enemies.

272
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,792
How would I know that

273
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,086
when we've never met?

274
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,299
The past victims weren't ones
to harbor enemies either.

275
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,722
Did you solve the fraud case
you were assigned to yesterday?

276
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,349
- Rather than chasing a losing game--
- A game?

277
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,186
Is this a game to you?

278
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,272
I'm just saying.

279
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,276
You performed the worst last month

280
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,069
because you couldn't let go of cold cases.

281
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,322
Our boss won't let it fly this time.

282
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,782
That won't happen. You wait and see.

283
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,161
We finally received the photos
from the outing last fall.

284
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,495
You look amazing, Prosecutor Go.

285
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,334
She's right. I look incredible here,

286
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,462
but an annoying face
is right next to mine.

287
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,755
Who?

288
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,964
You mean Mi-do?

289
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,095
Must you hate her so much
when she doesn't work with us anymore?

290
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,890
That's why I don't need to hide
my hatred toward her.

291
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,017
2018 FALL TEAMBUILDING OUTING

292
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,188
Yes?

293
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,984
Okay. I'll be right down.

294
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,156
- What is it?
- Someone must have punctured my car tire.

295
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,326
Last month, some jerk broke
the wing mirrors and ran away.

296
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,120
There's no rest for my dash cam.

297
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,665
Why are they torturing
an innocent prosecutor?

298
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,376
Wait a few minutes before you go.

299
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,544
If you go down now, it won't be pretty.

300
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,387
He's the father of Park Mi-jin,
the victim who was murdered in 2010.

301
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,389
LETTING THE EOMSAN-DONG
SERIAL KILLER GET AWAY?

302
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,309
He was a lieutenant at a patrol division.

303
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,688
He was on a patrol nearby.

304
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,816
His daughter was murdered
where he was walking the beat.

305
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,317
INCOMPETENT PROSECUTORS MUST REPENT!

306
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,902
It's probably why he can't let it go.

307
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,114
Even so. Putting on a protest
won't make a difference.

308
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,199
It's not like
we don't want to catch the culprit.

309
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,367
We want to catch the culprit

310
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,536
- more than anyone else.
- If it was an easy case,

311
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,913
I would have put the culprit in jail
when I had the case.

312
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,749
We wouldn't be working
our asses off day and night.

313
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,753
Well, it looks like I might be able
to put an end to that.

314
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,342
DETECTIVE PARK DONG-CHEOL

315
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,262
Yes, Detective Park.

316
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,722
Yes, that's correct.

317
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,141
Please look into
the whereabouts on that day.

318
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,936
And remember the mark
I told you about the other day?

319
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,690
Did you get to compare it
with a patient who was treated there?

320
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,027
Okay, I got it. Thank you for your work.

321
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,113
What is it? Any leads?

322
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,741
Why?

323
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,743
Are you getting anxious

324
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,247
that things start to pan out as soon as
I took over the case you couldn't crack?

325
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,000
Do you think I'm that petty?

326
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,377
If you catch the guy I couldn't,

327
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,379
I would thank you and show you my respect.

328
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,423
Anyway, do you really have a lead?

329
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:14,966
Yes, I do.

330
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,259
Here's a hint.

331
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,012
Signature.

332
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:20,972
"Signature"?

333
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,726
Do you really have a suspect in mind?

334
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,398
Even if you're my colleague,
I can't tell you that.

335
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,611
Anyway, I have a feeling that
I will be able to

336
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,197
face the bereaved family
with my head held up high soon.

337
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,283
So, I will march past him.

338
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,636
LETTING THE EOMSAN-DONG
SERIAL KILLER GET AWAY?

339
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,526
Take this.

340
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,444
RESUME THE INVESTIGATION

341
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,370
7 HOURS BEFORE GO SE-YEON'S DEATH

342
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,838
How can she say she's not at work?
Her car is right here.

343
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,428
<i>What is it again?</i>

344
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,763
Let's meet. I can't get ahold of Hee-jin.

345
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,932
I told you not to put me
in the middle of this.

346
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,518
I don't want to,
but you set me up with her.

347
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,978
You introduced me to Hee-jin.

348
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,732
You're the only one I know
who is friends with Hee-jin.

349
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,400
That's why I'm regretting it.

350
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,069
If I had known

351
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,280
that you'd pester me
by calling me about your love life,

352
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,781
I wouldn't have set you up with her.

353
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,701
I'll wait. I'm in front of your office.

354
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,369
<i>I told you I'm not at work.</i>

355
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,706
I'm busy. I don't have time
to listen to your love life.

356
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,753
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

357
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,087
<i>Se-yeon. Hold on. Don't...</i>

358
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,382
Darn it.

359
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,429
Hey, who are you? What are you doing?

360
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,890
What are you doing?

361
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,323
Gosh.

362
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,283
I'm sorry.

363
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,660
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

364
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:52,040
A lot of people hate me for doing my job.
It was instinctive.

365
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,167
But are you all right?

366
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,418
Take this.

367
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,714
Oh, no. You're bleeding.

368
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,846
Unbelievable, Se-yeon.

369
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,477
People can see through my shirt.

370
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,937
- Look at him.
- He's so handsome.

371
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,064
- He's very fit.
- He's gorgeous.

372
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,665
Excuse me.

373
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,835
- Why did you take that?
- Is this yours?

374
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,711
I'm in a pickle as my shirt is wet.

375
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,421
How much is this? I'll pay you double.

376
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,632
What? That's not for sale. Give it back.

377
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,760
No, my body isn't something
to show off to other people.

378
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,720
If paying double isn't enough,
how about triple?

379
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,514
- Come on. It's not for sale.
- No.

380
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,640
- I hate being naked.
- No.

381
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,183
You stubborn...

382
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,612
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

383
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,281
My gosh.

384
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,533
The buttons...

385
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,619
The buttons shouldn't
fall off this easily.

386
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,374
My gosh.

387
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,211
Seriously. You should've returned it
when I asked.

388
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,089
Forget about the money. Here, take it.

389
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,385
It looks good on you.

390
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,470
POLITICS IN PROSECUTION

391
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,724
It was an expensive shirt.
How could it be so frail?

392
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,151
Why are you wearing that?

393
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,236
Well, I had a bit of a situation.

394
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,700
Wait...

395
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,203
Why are you holding my hand
all of a sudden?

396
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,790
You got hurt because of me.

397
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,417
I'm sorry.

398
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,298
I don't remember you being this nice.

399
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,178
Well, I'm not doing this
because I'm a nice person.

400
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,971
You got hurt because of me.

401
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,724
And your shirt got wet because of me.

402
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,102
I'm not sure if this will fit,

403
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,229
but put this on since this is all I have.

404
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,149
I don't need the shirt.
If you're available, can we have some tea?

405
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,362
<i>Are you going on a pre-honeymoon?
Your bride-to-be is stunning as always.</i>

406
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,279
<i>Well done, Min.</i>

407
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,406
Why don't you dry your shirt

408
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,117
- while having a warm cup of--
- Sorry, not now. I'm busy. Sorry.

409
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,746
Excuse me. You have to return
the shirt after you wear it.

410
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,247
Excuse me!

411
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,749
Who was that?

412
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,126
A new guy you're seeing?

413
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,295
No, I had an accident with him.

414
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,172
"Accident"?

415
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,667
Excuse me.

416
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,836
Hee-jin.

417
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,546
What's your deal?

418
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,091
I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.
I'm sorry.

419
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,592
What's your problem, seriously?

420
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,771
PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

421
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,275
Yes, Doctor. I just came back.

422
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,744
Are you Ms. Oh Su-jin?

423
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:08,921
I'm looking for...

424
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,716
I'm looking for someone. Her name is...

425
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,844
<i>We're looking for
a passenger named Jang Hee-jin.</i>

426
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,805
<i>If you are Jang Hee-jin
who is 28-years-old,</i>

427
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,892
<i>please come to the information desk
at Row F on the first floor</i>

428
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,643
<i>of the terminal as soon as you hear...</i>

429
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,396
How impressive.

430
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,857
How many presidential citations
did he receive?

431
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,734
OH YEONG-CHEOL RECEIVES
A PRESIDENTIAL CITATION

432
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,611
BLUE HOUSE
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

433
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,919
<i>The last knot here was tied
in the opposite direction as well.</i>

434
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,090
I'm hauled into an OR
during my short naps.

435
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,092
And even if I work
for over 80 hours a week,

436
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,886
I lose so many patients
because they arrive here too late.

437
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,472
What's the point in repeating myself?

438
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,849
The emergency medical treatment system
doesn't improve.

439
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,271
Anyway, here's my final answer.
I won't do the interview.

440
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,190
I'd rather save one more patient.

441
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,900
Goodbye now.

442
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,571
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
I know you're busy.

443
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,117
No, thank you for sparing us your time.

444
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,119
We met a long time ago.

445
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,287
Yes, we met around last winter.

446
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,081
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

447
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,750
What is this regarding?

448
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,462
I have a few questions about the emergency
patient who was transported here

449
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,005
and died two days ago.

450
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,842
- Okay.
- Do you remember the patient?

451
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,474
Yes, I do.

452
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,603
But he was dead before
the ambulance arrived at our hospital.

453
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,021
There was nothing for me to do.

454
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,274
After I pronounced him dead,

455
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,860
the hospital medical examiner
took the body.

456
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,445
I'm not curious about how you treated him.

457
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,030
It's about this suture.

458
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,956
Doctor, the transfer patient
from Jinsong Hospital is here.

459
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,291
Okay.

460
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,335
What bad timing.

461
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,172
You should go.

462
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,882
I'm sorry. Here.

463
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,057
He is a great doctor,
but not a good expert witness.

464
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,477
I barely managed to see him once or twice
after making several trips.

465
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,938
As you saw, he's busy all the time.

466
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,481
Yes, he is.

467
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,358
Let's go.

468
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,737
I'll buy you soju and beer, your favorite.

469
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,616
What? You usually drink hard liquor.

470
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,328
Hey, since you're treating me,
let's get my favorite food too.

471
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,371
Pork rind, entrails, or tripe. Which one?

472
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:05,223
I can't find a passenger
named Jang Hee-jin on the flight.

473
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,350
I'm sorry.

474
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,977
It's confirmed that she's not
on the list of the passengers.

475
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,772
I'm Jang Hee-jin. Who's looking for me?

476
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:50,434
I WILL PUNISH WITH MY OWN HANDS

477
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,612
Let me give you a ride. It's raining too.

478
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,532
Come on. I'm fine.

479
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,033
Bye.

480
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,120
- Taxi.
- Are you sure you'll be fine?

481
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,831
There was a criminal case
in your neighborhood last week.

482
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,000
It only seems right
for me to give you a ride.

483
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,378
Right. That was your case.

484
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,133
Exactly. You ought to do your job right.

485
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,720
That way, I won't have to worry.

486
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,513
I'm doing my job right.

487
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,557
I just don't think
letting a woman go home alone

488
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,809
at this hour is very gentlemanly.

489
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,108
I'm not a woman to you, so it's all good.

490
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,444
Hold on.

491
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,113
- Sir.
- Yes?

492
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,409
- Please go to 12-7 Chungdang-dong.
- Okay.

493
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,785
No.

494
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,706
Why are you paying for my taxi?

495
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,041
- Sir.
- Yes?

496
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,042
- Please drive.
- Hold on.

497
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,294
Take this with you, at least.

498
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,881
Gosh, Seo Ji-uk.

499
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,385
See you tomorrow.

500
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,620
Hello?

501
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,497
Where are you? When are you coming home?

502
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,416
Who are you to nag me
about when I'm coming home?

503
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,377
Did you drink?

504
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,047
- I said I had to discuss an important--
<i>- Stop it.</i>

505
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,007
Hey, buy me some hangover cure drinks.

506
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,886
Am I your butler or something?

507
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,805
I'm not the same guy anymore.

508
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,265
Stop talking crap, and come home! Got it?

509
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,604
ZERO HANGOVER

510
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,901
It's seven thousand won.
Would you like a bag?

511
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,152
Yes, please.

512
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,824
Here.

513
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,826
- Thank you.
- Bye.

514
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,374
He's crazy handsome.

515
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,253
1 HOUR BEFORE GO SE-YEON'S DEATH

516
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,050
Thank you.

517
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,062
Come on, what's wrong with him?

518
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,773
He made a fuss and asked me
to come home quickly.

519
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,820
Sir!

520
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,117
I told you so many times

521
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,035
not to pile those up here.

522
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,787
But I got nowhere else to put them.

523
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,832
You can keep them in your house!

524
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,127
If you put them here on a rainy day,
it's going to stink.

525
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,172
I can't even open the window
because of your pile here.

526
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,675
- Take them back. Take them back now.
- No, I can't do that.

527
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,051
- Leave them.
- Take them now!

528
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,261
Leave them here!

529
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,392
Sir! Did you just hit me?

530
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,770
No, I didn't. I just pushed you a little.

531
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,689
You fell because you're drunk.

532
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,734
Do you think I'm a joke?
You keep bossing me around.

533
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,445
Fine. I'll put them away. I will.

534
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,740
Come on. This is where I live.

535
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,367
I'm not even allowed to say that?

536
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,828
Fine. I'll take them back.

537
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,581
This is my last stop. What is
so wrong with leaving my stuff here?

538
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,625
Gosh, what a goodhearted woman you are.

539
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,673
She acted all nice and kind
this afternoon.

540
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,008
Now, I'm her errand boy?

541
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,386
I can't do this anymore.
I must tell her who I am.

542
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,853
Hey. Are you okay?

543
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,230
Hey.

544
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,157
<i>Yes, 911.</i>

545
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,034
A man collapsed here.

546
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,912
The location is...
Turn right at Sangpyeong Intersection.

547
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,205
<i>We'll set out now.</i>

548
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,250
Hey, look. Please wake up. Please.

549
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,001
Hey! Damn it.

550
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,184
He said he had something important
to discuss. Why isn't he here?

551
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,482
How dare he make me wait for him?

552
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,196
That punk, Cha Min.

553
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,866
Now that he's getting married,
this is how he's going to treat me?

554
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,297
<i>I won't lock the door.
Come inside and wake me up.</i>

555
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,719
You haven't left yet?

556
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,138
I don't think this man is breathing!

557
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,056
Damn it.

558
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,231
No.

559
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:38,907
"Abyss"?

560
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,202
Whatever it is,
this brought me back to life.

561
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,958
Who knows? This might
be able to save this guy too.

562
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,961
But how do I use this?

563
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,548
Damn it.

564
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,844
<i>Where are you exactly?</i>

565
00:43:58,927 --> 00:43:59,762
It's...

566
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,555
It's the second alley
after you turn right.

567
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,265
I'll go to the main road.

568
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:12,566
AN ABYSS CAN REVIVE ANYTHING THAT HAS DIED

569
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,247
Right here. Here!

570
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,834
All right. He's over there,
but he's not breathing.

571
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,836
Hurry. That way.

572
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,632
Over there.

573
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,931
Where is he?

574
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,184
There was definitely a man lying here...

575
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,352
No one is here.

576
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,187
Look.

577
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,147
Come on.

578
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,024
You're not a kid.

579
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,819
How could you make a prank call?

580
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,113
I'm not joking around.
He was here covered in blood.

581
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,032
This is a clear violation of
Framework Act on Fire Services.

582
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,244
You can be fined up to two million won.

583
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,328
And...

584
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,123
The traffic was crazy
because it's raining.

585
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,333
- He was really here.
- <i>Car accident in Sangji 3-dong.</i>

586
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,001
<i>Car accident.</i>

587
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,462
We'll set out right now.

588
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,721
It looks like you drank a lot.

589
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,932
Drink that up and go to sleep.

590
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,851
- Let's go.
- Okay.

591
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,359
Even if he's not dead, he couldn't
have gotten far in that condition.

592
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,944
Is he okay?

593
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,992
Or am I really seeing things?

594
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,915
What was that?

595
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,333
Hey!

596
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,545
Seriously? It almost ran me over.

597
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,505
Unbelievable.

598
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,801
How many shirts have I ruined today?

599
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,246
She's home.

600
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,920
Right.

601
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,131
Hey, Se-yeon.

602
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,555
Is she upset because I'm late?

603
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,518
Hey, Se-yeon!

604
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,311
Stop yelling in the middle of the night!

605
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,188
I'm sorry.

606
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,816
Hey, Se-yeon. Come out!

607
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,610
I told you to be quiet!

608
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,487
I'm sorry.

609
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,324
I'll leave the drinks here.
Drink it before you go to bed.

610
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,408
Hey!

611
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,873
I'm sorry. I'm leaving now.

612
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,604
Prosecutor Seo.

613
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,440
How could this happen?

614
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,694
Where is the body?

615
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,051
Are you done with the crime scene photos?

616
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:10,554
Yes.

617
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,198
Did you identify the suspect?

618
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,293
I'm visiting someone.

619
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,546
Please give me your ID and fill this out.

620
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,964
Okay.

621
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,717
ID CARD
CHA MIN

622
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,513
I need an ID to get in, right?

623
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,432
Pardon?

624
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,977
I forgot my ID. I should go get it.

625
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,856
Gosh, this is so inconvenient.

626
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,983
I should fix my phone first.

627
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,613
Can you believe Prosecutor Go is dead?

628
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,239
She was a murder victim.

629
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,951
People say pretty women
have difficult lives.

630
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,080
Se-yeon's life was indeed
full of twists and turns.

631
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,166
- When is the funeral?
- Excuse me.

632
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,752
What did you just say?

633
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,224
She was such a well-mannered

634
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,267
and sweet young lady.

635
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,644
It's such a shame.

636
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,689
Who would be bold enough
to murder a prosecutor like that?

637
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,900
I know! It's such a scary world.

638
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,946
You were next-door neighbors with her.

639
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,906
Shouldn't you attend her funeral?

640
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,825
Hey, Se-yeon.

641
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,704
I'll leave the drinks here.
Drink it before going to bed.

642
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,873
I'm sorry. I'm leaving now.

643
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:03,750
I...

644
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,045
I was right out here.

645
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,298
I was right outside...

646
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,260
I saw the lights turn off, too.

647
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,179
I...

648
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,057
I should have gone inside.

649
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,893
I...

650
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,604
- I...
- Young man!

651
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,231
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong?

652
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,691
I should have gone inside.

653
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,276
- Oh no!
- Oh my...

654
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,823
- I should have...
- How sad.

655
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,578
I should have...

656
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,510
What's this?

657
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,138
Goodness!

658
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,452
Are you planning on staying here for good?

659
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,080
No, I just...

660
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,459
Min asked me to come see him today.

661
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,044
Are you in touch with him?

662
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,295
Where is he now?

663
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,672
The thing is...

664
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,551
FRONT DOOR

665
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,179
Who is it?

666
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,931
<i>Hello? We're the police.</i>

667
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,433
<i>Is Mr. Cha Min home?</i>

668
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,145
<i>Is it even working?</i>

669
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,775
So where is Min?

670
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,860
Is he all right?
Did something happen to him?

671
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,862
He's fine, so don't worry.

672
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,280
Then why are the police...

673
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,950
I don't have time for this now, Auntie.
I'll explain later.

674
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,912
Auntie?

675
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,747
Me?

676
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,460
Which way is it?

677
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,963
This way, sir.

678
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,798
This way?

679
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,469
What's up with that guy?

680
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,888
- It's not him.
- On what grounds?

681
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,267
The suspect is 170cm and chubby.

682
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,269
Look at how his body's built.

683
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,729
He's basically a midget.

684
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,190
That guy, however,
could practically be a model.

685
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,110
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

686
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,238
<i>The police have singled out
the key suspect</i>

687
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,906
<i>for the murder case of Ms. Go</i>

688
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,326
<i>and are devoting all their power to
capture the suspect as soon as possible.</i>

689
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:47,247
<i>Let's move on to the press conference
that was led by the prosecutor in charge.</i>

690
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:50,083
<i>The suspect, Mr. Cha,
is a 30-year-old male.</i>

691
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,335
<i>He was acquainted with Ms. Go</i>

692
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,380
<i>and found to have been stalking her
for many years.</i>

693
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,217
<i>- The police are locating his whereabouts</i>
- I still can't believe she's dead.

694
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,927
<i>as he's gone missing after Ms. Go's death.</i>

695
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,180
<i>- It is assumed that he is hiding</i>
- And they're saying I killed her?

696
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,809
<i>in different locations away from home,
since he has not been caught</i>

697
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,936
<i>in any surveillance cameras
near his neighborhood</i>

698
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,273
<i>or reached out to
any of his acquaintances.</i>

699
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,693
<i>As he is not using his own car,</i>

700
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,195
<i>he is assumed to be using
public transportation to get around.</i>

701
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,950
Hello. We're the police.

702
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,953
Has a man named Cha Min
checked in at this hotel?

703
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,623
- One moment, please.
- Sure. Thank you.

704
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,086
How much does a hotel room here cost?

705
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,213
Jeez, how did they find out I was here?

706
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,382
How about a few-hour stay?

707
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,719
- Bill, please.
- All right.

708
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,276
- Thank you.
- Sure.

709
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,404
- Welcome.
- How did he know--

710
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,365
Hey! Excuse me, young man.

711
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,492
Excuse me.

712
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,369
Can I have a word with you?

713
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,829
This is the police.

714
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,790
Could you lift up your cap just a bit?

715
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,796
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

716
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,718
Isn't it the last day of the funeral?

717
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,054
It is. We should all go later on.

718
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,640
When I hear about people dying,
it gives me goosebumps.

719
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,934
- Same here.
- I think I might have nightmares.

720
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,244
REST IN PEACE

721
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:57,460
LATE GO SE-YEON

722
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,759
Please come this way
to see the deceased one last time.

723
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,847
Okay. Go and call your sister-in-law.

724
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,348
- Se-yeon.
- Se-yeon!

725
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,892
- Se-yeon!
- Se-yeon!

726
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,310
- Se-yeon!
- Se-yeon!

727
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,980
- Se-yeon!
- Se-yeon!

728
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,691
Get out of my way.
I already got myself a man.

729
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,986
- What?
- Who is that?

730
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,073
- Come on!
- What about us?

731
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,285
Daddy!

732
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,870
- Daddy?
- Daddy?

733
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,914
- Father-in-law?
- Sir!

734
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,916
- Sir!
- Sir!

735
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,627
- Sir!
- Father-in-law!

736
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,671
- Father-in-law!
- Father-in-law!

737
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,007
- Father-in-law!
- Father-in-law!

738
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,675
I love you, Father-in...

739
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,680
I see you didn't need me to come.

740
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,933
What are you talking about?

741
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,268
You mean much more to me than all of them.

742
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,020
Goodness. Here.

743
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,609
It's so pretty!

744
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,028
- Put it on for me, Daddy.
- All right.

745
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,240
- Father-in-law!
- Father-in-law!

746
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,951
- Father-in-law!
- Father-in-law!

747
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,703
- Father-in-law!
- Father-in-law!

748
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,331
- Father-in-law!
- Father-in-law!

749
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,209
- Father-in-law!
- Father-in-law!

750
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,138
Se-yeon...

751
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,684
Come on, honey.

752
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,108
Let her rest in peace.

753
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,317
My girl...

754
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,278
I can't give her up.

755
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,573
My girl, Se-yeon...

756
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,451
- Calm down.
- My gosh.

757
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,411
- Hey!
- Oh, my gosh!

758
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,204
- Wake up!
- Hold her up!

759
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,415
- Wake up!
- Honey!

760
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,083
- Hey!
- Honey!

761
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,127
Honey!

762
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,171
It's so heartbreaking.

763
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,589
She's too young.

764
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,467
- Let's close the casket.
- Yes, sir.

765
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,762
Didn't you leave the lid over here?
Where did it go?

766
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,391
Where do you think it is?
Maybe you left it somewhere else.

767
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,185
Hurry up and get it!

768
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,941
LATE GO SE-YEON

769
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:07,984
Excuse me.

770
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,236
I'm Se-yeon's friend.

771
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,865
Can I say goodbye one last time?

772
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,241
Sure, go ahead.

773
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,757
Se-yeon, you brat.

774
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,555
You're the worst.

775
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,516
Do you know that?

776
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,353
How could you...

777
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,443
How am I supposed to find Hee-jin
without you?

778
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,739
How am I supposed to clear my name?

779
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,951
Se-yeon...

780
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,286
Is that it for you?

781
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,289
What am I supposed to do
without you, Se-yeon?

782
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,416
Se-yeon...

783
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,128
Se-yeon.

784
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,089
Se-yeon!

785
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,682
What do you want? You don't even work!

786
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,815
Please bring her back to life.

787
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,485
Just this once, please.

788
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,613
Just this once.

789
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,323
Please.

790
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:40,910
Please.

791
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,426
You damn alien scammers!

792
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:00,388
You said it can bring back the dead!
You said it'll save them!

793
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,726
Are you finished saying goodbye?

794
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,894
- Yes, thank you.
- Not at all.

795
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:20,908
- This doesn't fit, either.
- What's wrong with you?

796
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,578
- This isn't the right one!
- Where did it go, then?

797
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,913
Are you saying it ran off or something?
Go find it!

798
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,565
Se-yeon.

799
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,402
Gosh, it's cold!

800
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,991
Where am I?

801
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,037
And what am I wearing?

802
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,540
I should stop drinking.

803
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:19,133
Excuse me, can I borrow your phone?

804
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,886
What?

805
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:23,888
I'm sorry.

806
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,850
I see you're not in the mood.

807
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,315
Excuse me.

808
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,944
Haven't we met before?

809
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,284
You're the guy who stole my shirt!

810
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,288
- Sorry?
- You know, on the other day,

811
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,873
in front of the prosecutor's office.

812
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,043
Don't you remember me?

813
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,673
Seriously?

814
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,842
You don't remember me at all?

815
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,594
You got the wrong person.

816
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,891
I'm pretty sure it's him.

817
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,749
I really don't know you.

818
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,293
I'm not trying to follow you.

819
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:38,254
I was just headed this way, too.

820
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,840
Are you sure you really don't remember me?

821
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,467
It was raining that day, too.

822
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,179
- Which way is it?
- Sorry?

823
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,598
Which way are you headed?

824
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,976
That way.

825
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,437
Oh, come on!

826
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,900
Hey. I'm not usually the clingy type,

827
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:03,279
but running off with someone else's shirt

828
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,989
is also considered theft,

829
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,450
just so you know.

830
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,626
LATE GO SE-YEON

831
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,557
What's going on?

832
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,894
Why am I dead?

833
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,395
I'm not dead!

834
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,147
- Mom.
- Honey!

835
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,274
Why are you crying? I'm right here!

836
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,567
Stop crying!

837
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,110
- Mom.
- Hey!

838
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:47,865
I don't know how close you were
with my daughter,

839
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,368
but your pain is nothing compared to ours,

840
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,661
so stop creating a scene!

841
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,621
What do you think you're doing?

842
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,581
Dad, what are you saying?

843
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,583
You're scaring me. Stop it.

844
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,668
What are you all doing?

845
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,545
- Hurry up and load the casket!
- Dad!

846
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,381
Dad!

847
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:04,924
Mom!

848
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,970
That's not me...

849
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,597
- Dad!
- Go ahead.

850
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,725
Wait a minute! Please!

851
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:15,893
Let go!

852
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,728
Move over!

853
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:32,285
Let go!
I'll tell them that Go Se-yeon isn't dead!

854
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,537
- Let go!
- I know what's going on, so calm down.

855
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,788
What do you know?

856
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,665
I know everything.

857
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,626
I'm the one

858
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,421
who brought you back to life.

859
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:49,427
With this.

860
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:58,769
AN ABYSS REVIVES THE DEAD
INTO THE FORM OF ITS SOUL

861
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,443
You're...

862
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,487
Se-yeon, right?

863
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:12,950
Who are you?

864
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:14,994
Are you a ghost?

865
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,873
Or the Grim Reaper or something?

866
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,042
It's me.

867
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,085
Cha Min.

868
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,171
It's me, Go Se-yeon.

869
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:10,633
How can I let it go when I'm still alive?

870
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,843
<i>They won't believe it's you
if you show up like this.</i>

871
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,179
<i>They'll be devastated
once they see the body's gone.</i>

872
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,722
<i>I'll find whoever murdered you.</i>

873
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,767
<i>What do we know about
Cha Min's whereabouts?</i>

874
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,727
<i>Why would you use your card?
You're on the run.</i>

875
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,979
You idiot.

876
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,605
I said I didn't kill you.

877
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:27,066
Considering everything,
should you do your best

878
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,193
<i>in helping me find the killer or not?</i>

879
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:31,737
<i>Should you trust me
and do what I tell you to do or not?</i>

880
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,573
<i>- What's all this?
</i>- I know this person.

881
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,579
