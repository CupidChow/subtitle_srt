1
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,132
I'm home.

2
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,678
Tae-jin. Why are you so late?

3
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,557
You promised to come home right after
school ended and play with me.

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,476
- Sorry.
- You're late.

5
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,811
- Go wash up. Let's eat.
- Okay.

6
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,776
Tae-jin, there's blood.

7
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,486
Are you hurt?

8
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,029
No.

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,326
"Hansel and Gretel

10
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,453
took out pearls and gems
from their pockets

11
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,747
and spread them out in the room.

12
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,124
All their worries were gone,

13
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,044
and the three of them
lived happily ever after."

14
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,048
I wish Dad wouldn't come home every day.

15
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,466
Right, Tae-jin?

16
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,344
Then I would be able to play with you

17
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,180
until I go to sleep like this
without him here.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,350
Tae-jin.

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,560
Can you read it one more time?

20
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,395
Let's go to our room now.

21
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,189
I have school tomorrow.

22
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,777
I want to go to school just like you.

23
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,153
Honey.

24
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:53,863
Dad is here!

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,578
- You're home.
- Hi.

26
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,666
- Where are the kids?
- They're sleeping.

27
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,920
I thought you said you were
on night duty tonight again.

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,589
Yes, but I'm not anymore.

29
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,008
Here are the dumplings you like.

30
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,427
Tell the kids to come out and eat.

31
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,765
Okay.

32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,147
Don't just stand there.
Go wake up the kids.

33
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,857
Okay.

34
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,486
Kids, come out. Your father is home.

35
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,033
- Hello.
- Hi. Come and have some dumplings.

36
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,639
Father.

37
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,560
I have something to tell you.

38
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,609
Su-jin.

39
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,119
Okay. Tell me.

40
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,380
So please let me do that.

41
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,011
Are you threatening me?

42
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,430
Please give me a chance

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,891
to choose my own father.

44
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,858
I don't care who it is.

45
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,653
Will you still go?

46
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,662
You are indeed my son.

47
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,707
Those fierce eyes of yours.

48
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,210
I like them.

49
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,136
He will scold you if he finds out.

50
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,388
Go back inside.

51
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,016
Why? Dad and Tae-jin are sharing a secret.

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,559
I want to hear it, too.

53
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,399
You have one nasty habit.

54
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,870
Mom!

55
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,718
Hee-jin.

56
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,180
Your mother...

57
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,451
Hee-jin.

58
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,953
I don't think you should see her.

59
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,275
- Hey, Hee-jin.
- Mom.

60
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,446
Please save her.

61
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,075
Please save her.

62
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,288
Please save my mom.

63
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,083
You saved Se-yeon and me, too.
Why can't you save my mom?

64
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,127
- Please save her.
- Hee-jin.

65
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,256
Please save her.

66
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,175
Hee-jin.

67
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,347
Mom.

68
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,518
EPISODE 13

69
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,822
Should we perform the autopsy?

70
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,616
Well...

71
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,328
I'll inform you
after I've talked to the daughter.

72
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,956
- Okay.
- Okay.

73
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,218
It's been confirmed
that Oh Yeong-cheol is dead.

74
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,312
Damn it. I can't even see that thing,
so I don't know what to say.

75
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,147
This is so frustrating.

76
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,691
Prosecutor Go.

77
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,029
So there is a marble that can bring
dead people back to life, right?

78
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,865
She wants to bring her mom back to life
with it, right?

79
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,283
Yes.

80
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,452
I can't believe this.

81
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,748
Do you know how many people
witnessed her body?

82
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,043
If a woman who died yesterday
comes back to life today,

83
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,338
the NFS, Korea...
No, the whole world will be in shock.

84
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,673
I don't care if people go into a frenzy.

85
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,470
But you saw this photo.
This is clearly a murder.

86
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,305
He's provoking us, you know?

87
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,936
How... How did this...

88
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,649
That photo was next to your mother's body.

89
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,828
Please know that

90
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,748
I understand
how you must be feeling right now.

91
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,584
But if you revive her now,

92
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,630
the guy who killed your mom
will surely hear about it.

93
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,466
If that happens,
you won't be able to get your revenge.

94
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,886
Also, you and your mother
could be in danger again.

95
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,596
Then...

96
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,269
are you telling me to leave my mom
in that cold, scary place?

97
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,856
Poor Mom.

98
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,429
Well,

99
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,931
what should I tell them?

100
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,852
Should I say the bereaved family
doesn't want the autopsy

101
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,146
and wishes to take the body?

102
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,450
I want to proceed with the autopsy.

103
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,538
We only have
circumstantial evidence that Tae-jin...

104
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,586
that Oh Tae-jin killed my mom, right?

105
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,090
When the autopsy is done
and I get definite evidence

106
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,678
so that I can catch him
and make him pay for what he did...

107
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,849
I will meet my mom again then.

108
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,529
- Prosecutor Seo.
- Hello.

109
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,656
- Hello.
- Hi.

110
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,408
Is my father inside?

111
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,285
Judge Seo isn't in his office.

112
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,703
Does he have a trial today?

113
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,581
No, he said it's a personal matter.
Should I give him a call?

114
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,375
No, there's no need. I'll call him myself.

115
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,508
"A personal matter"?

116
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,184
Come in.

117
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,145
You didn't have to come all the way here.

118
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,397
My gosh, thank you.

119
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,066
Thank you for coming all the way here.

120
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,902
How is your wife? Is she all right?

121
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,069
Yes.

122
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,031
Thank you for getting her admitted.
It wasn't even a serious accident.

123
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,908
- Thank you again.
- Don't thank me.

124
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,744
If there was an accident,
the assailant must be punished.

125
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,580
And the victim must be properly
compensated for it.

126
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,165
- Okay.
- But you know that you can never

127
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,250
tell anyone
about what we discussed, right?

128
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,419
You don't need to ask me twice.

129
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,215
- This is an ex gratia payment.
- Gosh.

130
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,092
And we'll take care of the medical bills.

131
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,304
Rest here as long as she needs.
She can leave when she's well.

132
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,350
You should never settle even if someone
keeps calling you and asking to settle.

133
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,353
If there's anything you need,
call me right away.

134
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,022
Okay, I'll do that.

135
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,690
Thank you.

136
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,108
- I'll leave now.
- Okay. Bye.

137
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,568
- Go back inside.
- I'll see you off.

138
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,695
- Go back inside.
- Bye. Take care.

139
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,506
Did you make it clear?

140
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,424
Of course. I was clear as day.

141
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,679
See it through to the end
to make sure there are no loose ends.

142
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,722
There won't be any loose ends.

143
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,141
It's not like I made up an accident
that never occurred.

144
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,227
The victim's family hit the jackpot.

145
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,940
Here's the dashcam memory card.

146
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,542
Poor Park Gi-man.

147
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,044
He picked the worst time
to cause an accident.

148
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,136
She'll be fine, right?

149
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,346
She's fine. Don't worry.

150
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,348
I think I should stay with her.

151
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,143
Think about it. Having Detective Park is
way more reassuring

152
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,895
than having a tiny girl like you
beside her.

153
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,815
If you're that worried,
stay with me and protect me instead.

154
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,692
I might not look weak, but I am.

155
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,653
As if that's true. You have a big build.

156
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,907
I might have a big build, but you have me
wrapped around your fingers.

157
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,785
By the way, shouldn't Detective Park
go back to his station?

158
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,662
He said he's on probation.

159
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,966
What are you doing there?

160
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,053
This is Prosecutor Go's case notebook.

161
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,305
She told me to check
if we missed anything.

162
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,391
- What about Hee-jin?
- She just fell asleep.

163
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,602
I told you to make yourself comfortable.

164
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,229
Why are you sitting over there?
It's bothering me.

165
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,733
That's all right.
I did say I would stay here,

166
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,151
but it must be uncomfortable

167
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,280
for both of you
to have a guy walking around the house.

168
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,617
I said I'd guard this place,
so I'll focus on my duty. Go back inside.

169
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,869
Be my guest.

170
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,795
- Mi-do.
- What?

171
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,588
I'm thirsty.

172
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,470
Here.

173
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,888
Open it for me.

174
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,184
- Here.
- Thank you.

175
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,319
Gosh, I spilled it.

176
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,364
Mi-do, I spilled water.
Get me some tissue!

177
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,949
Come on.

178
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,243
- Damn it.
- I spilled water.

179
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,245
Tissue. I need the tissue now.

180
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,746
- Here.
- Thank you.

181
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,249
- Stop ordering me around.
- Sorry.

182
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,710
I can't believe I spilled it.

183
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,878
- Mi-do.
- Come on!

184
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,131
What? Are you sending me
on a fool's errand again?

185
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,757
Are you picking a fight with me?

186
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,968
- Do you have a death wish?
- No, that's not it.

187
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,429
- What is it, then? Do you want to die?
- Wait. Let's try this.

188
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,848
- Try what? What is it?
- Listen. Let's give it a try!

189
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,017
Let's try it. Let's give it a try.

190
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,061
You know,

191
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,564
marriage. Let's give that a shot.

192
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,279
Wait, wait. Hold on a second.

193
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,366
My gosh.

194
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,413
Right now,
I'm busy with Prosecutor Go's case.

195
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,373
And things are really hectic.

196
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,293
Once things get wrapped up,

197
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,464
let's get married.

198
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,718
Marry me.

199
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,145
I'm sorry you had to bring it up first
the other day.

200
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,067
Are you serious, Dong-cheol?

201
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,318
Are you crying?

202
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,361
Why are you crying? You should be smiling.

203
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,738
Stop crying.

204
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,616
Stop crying. If you keep crying,
I'll take the ring back.

205
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,743
So stop crying.

206
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,286
Go to bed now.

207
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,789
Darn it!

208
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,792
Gosh, stop it. Stop it.

209
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,090
Go to your room!

210
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,967
Director Cha.

211
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,262
We are going out for lunch.

212
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,139
Would you like to join us?

213
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,558
I'll have it separately.

214
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,269
Why don't we join them? Let's go.

215
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,440
I guess I'm joining you.

216
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:33,487
We were talking about going
to a new seafood stew restaurant nearby.

217
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,906
But if there's something
you'd like to eat...

218
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,574
I like everything.

219
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,327
Really? I thought
you would only eat classy food.

220
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,412
You're so down-to-earth.

221
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,039
Welcome.

222
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,960
This is our table.

223
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,297
It's so good that we ordered
in advance, isn't it?

224
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,967
- Right.
- This looks delicious.

225
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,761
Let me scoop it up for you.
Hand me your plate.

226
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,763
Okay.

227
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,683
This looks so good. Gosh.

228
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,268
Do you like crabs?

229
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,145
What? Crabs? Yes, I like them.

230
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,564
I thought you would like vegetables more.

231
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,983
Isn't it really good?

232
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,071
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

233
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,197
- Eat up.
- Thanks.

234
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,292
I'm so full. My gosh.

235
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,794
Their food was so good.

236
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,130
Was it that good?

237
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,049
Yes. Why? You didn't like it?

238
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,552
It looked like you were barely eating.

239
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,637
I wanted a meal with you in private.

240
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,849
Weren't you even jealous?

241
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,977
A female employee got between us
and sat right next to me.

242
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,314
Jealous? Why would I ever get jealous
because of you?

243
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,401
I've only been an object of envy.
I've never gotten jealous myself.

244
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,236
Things have changed now.

245
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,821
I'm crazy popular now. You know?

246
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,241
Whether you're crazy popular or not,
that doesn't concern me.

247
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,576
I'm Go Se-yeon, you see?

248
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,667
- Director Cha.
- Yes?

249
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,713
This is the poster draft
of the new product that we talked about.

250
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,383
Okay. I'll give you feedback
after looking it over.

251
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,303
Okay. And please take these, too.

252
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,975
My hobby is baking. I baked them myself.

253
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,727
I see.

254
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,696
Thank you. I'll enjoy these.
I love cookies.

255
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,574
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

256
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,826
I was worried
that you might not like sweets.

257
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,496
Don't be silly. I love cookies.

258
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,128
You really baked this yourself?

259
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,881
- Yes.
- Gosh, that's impressive.

260
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,842
- Ms. Go.
- Yes.

261
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,469
Would you like to try one?

262
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,805
Is it good? Then can I try just one?

263
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,474
Wait, no. Ms. Bae baked these just for me.

264
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,558
It's rude to share.

265
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,436
- Is that so?
- My gosh, Director Cha.

266
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,690
Next time, I'll bake macarons for you.

267
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,149
Do you like macarons?

268
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,568
I can't get enough of them.

269
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,072
This is just perfect.
My specialty is macarons.

270
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,908
- Thank you, Ms. Bae.
- My pleasure.

271
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,162
I'll leave now.

272
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,794
This tastes good.

273
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,754
How is this so delicious?

274
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,300
- Where are you going?
- What?

275
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,885
I need to send a fax. I'll be right back.

276
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,813
How did he like it? Tell us.

277
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,857
He really liked them.

278
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,110
What did I tell you?
There's nothing going on between them.

279
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,278
- Really?
- Yes.

280
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,322
Damn it. I should've made the move.

281
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,282
I made the move on him first.

282
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,491
I liked him first.

283
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,410
You should make macarons, then.

284
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,832
- Do you want some coffee, too?
- What? No, thanks.

285
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,635
I told you I didn't want coffee.
I have some left.

286
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,013
This isn't for you. It's for Ms. Bae.

287
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,475
She baked me cookies.
I should at least make her some coffee.

288
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,935
You're right. Nothing is free in life.

289
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,522
It'd be rude not to give her something
in return after getting those cookies.

290
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,317
Ms. Bae will be over the moon.

291
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,404
- Right?
- Yes.

292
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,337
She's not at her desk.

293
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,596
I need to send a fax. I'll be right back.

294
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,311
DIRECTOR CHA HAS A GIRLFRIEND
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL PROSECUTOR

295
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,814
P.S. HE HAS HIGH STANDARDS
DON'T HIT ON HIM

296
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,320
Director Cha?

297
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,909
I looked over the draft you gave me.
We can go ahead with that.

298
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,411
Okay.

299
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,498
By any chance, is that coffee for me?

300
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,253
No, both cups are for me.

301
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,089
I see. Drinking that much coffee
isn't good for you.

302
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,717
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you this.

303
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,636
I have a girlfriend.

304
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,430
Pardon.

305
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,057
Not just any girlfriend. She's perfect.

306
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,518
I have very high standards.

307
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,520
So don't bake macarons for me.

308
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,285
What's wrong?
Ms. Bae won't drink your coffee?

309
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,246
No. She doesn't want coffee
from a guy who's already taken.

310
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,665
In that case, you can give that to me.

311
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,585
- Here.
- Thanks.

312
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,347
Hello.

313
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,475
<i>I'm Jeong Gi-yeong</i>
<i>from the Traffic Investigation Unit</i>

314
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,517
<i>in Seobu police station.</i>

315
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,103
<i>- Is this Mr. Cha Min?</i>
- Yes, this is he. What is this about?

316
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,438
This is about Mr. Park Gi-man.

317
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,440
He's in our custody
for a hit-and-run case.

318
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,358
He requested to call this number
and meet you.

319
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,902
"A hit-and-run case"?

320
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,830
By the way, the victim needs
to be hospitalized for two weeks only.

321
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,040
Isn't arresting him too much?

322
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,583
It's a hit-and-run.

323
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,294
It's not common, but it's possible
depending on the case.

324
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,462
Let's go and find out more.

325
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:12,928
Prosecutor Lee.

326
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,888
Yes.

327
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,725
I heard you went to the States
after you quit. When did you get back?

328
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,480
I just got back. Have you been well?

329
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,024
Well, it's all the same for me.

330
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,068
What brings you here?

331
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,738
Someone I know was arrested
for a hit-and-run.

332
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,906
I came as his attorney.

333
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,409
His name is Park Gi-man.
He's a taxi driver.

334
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,121
You're taking his case?

335
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,332
Yes.

336
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,376
I'm sorry.

337
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,920
I know it's rude of me to ask,

338
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:51,424
but I couldn't think of anyone who could
help no matter how hard I thought.

339
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,884
I'm glad you called.

340
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,887
I'm sure you knew better.
You had this job for a long time.

341
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,056
Why didn't you give her
your business card?

342
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,225
No, I definitely gave one to her.

343
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,770
But she kept claiming
that she didn't get one.

344
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,439
Then what about the dashcam footage?

345
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,857
That's the strange part.

346
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,360
They said there was no memory card.

347
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,406
But that's impossible
because I always check it.

348
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,374
Can you at least give us
the victim's phone number?

349
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,918
We'll try to settle the case
with the victim again.

350
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,003
I'm afraid I can't.

351
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,798
The victim firmly stated
that she wouldn't settle.

352
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,927
She was also adamant about
not giving out her contact information.

353
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,723
Still, isn't it a little harsh
to keep him in custody?

354
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,267
It may be a hit-and-run,
but he's a first offender.

355
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,185
Also, his background checks out.

356
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,854
There's no reason to keep him in custody.

357
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,232
Because of his previous assault charge,

358
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,151
we really had no choice.

359
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,361
He assaulted Oh Yeong-cheol
and fled the scene

360
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,488
before Oh Yeong-cheol was identified
as a murderer.

361
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,828
I was going to question him
and send him home at first,

362
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,497
but my bosses hounded me,
asking if I'll take

363
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,416
the responsibility if he flees again.

364
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,628
We're keeping him in custody
because he fled the scene once.

365
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,388
I know it's a long shot,

366
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,307
but please tell the victim

367
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,517
that we'd like to settle
in any way we can.

368
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,438
You know, this is complicated for me, too.

369
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,235
Still, since he's your client,

370
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,198
I'll try to reach out once more.

371
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,242
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the favor.

372
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,625
He barely pulled his life together,

373
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,126
but how could this happen?

374
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,339
I know. I'd really like to help him out.

375
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:01,054
By the way, I've always been altruistic,

376
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,225
but you being this compassionate is
way out of character.

377
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,727
You even suspected Park Gi-man once.

378
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,771
I only did so

379
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,440
because you should think of all
possibilities when you're on a case.

380
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,403
Besides, I think I owe him that much.

381
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,738
You owe him? What do you mean?

382
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,992
I was the lead prosecutor on the case,
but I wasn't able to catch Oh Yeong-cheol.

383
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,578
I feel like I owe him.

384
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,291
That's why I'm going to prove
his innocence this time no matter what.

385
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,419
I don't know about anything else,

386
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,923
but it's definitely suspicious
that the dashcam memory card is missing.

387
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,634
How could it have disappeared

388
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,178
unless someone removed it on purpose?
It's not like it can walk.

389
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,057
Something definitely smells fishy.

390
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,649
PRESIDENT IM JUN-HYEOK

391
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,401
You're being ridiculous.

392
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,945
There's no need to worry.

393
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,615
The dashcam footage is gone,
and there isn't a CCTV in the area.

394
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,494
There is no evidence
to put you in a tight spot.

395
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,539
Just play innocent
and say you won't settle.

396
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,917
Still, the detective keeps calling me
and it's making me nervous.

397
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,253
Damn it.

398
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,048
If that's the case,

399
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,051
give them my number
and say I'm your legal representative.

400
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,304
Sure.

401
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,141
What a pussy.

402
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,853
He's such a coward, and yet he wants
such a huge sum of money.

403
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,189
Damn it.

404
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,782
Are you Mr. Park's lawyers?

405
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,866
- Yes.
- Yes.

406
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,994
Come on.

407
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,248
My client has expressed her wishes
more than enough.

408
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,209
Pestering her to settle--

409
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,003
We're not pestering her but asking.

410
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,630
Besides,

411
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,174
my client wanted to call the accident in,

412
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,969
but your client is the one who refused.

413
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,599
Are you saying that
my client is conning yours?

414
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,559
You're clearly victimizing her again.

415
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,813
He tried to call it in? Where's the proof?
Do you have it?

416
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,482
The taxi was operating without a dashcam,

417
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,235
and the driver fled the scene
after hitting a pregnant woman.

418
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,529
You guys are totally out of line!

419
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:29,035
That's why we're asking
to meet with the victim.

420
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,912
Her wounds need only two weeks to recover,

421
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,956
but you're adamant about not settling.

422
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,124
How can one not be suspicious of that?

423
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,711
Also, my client handed the victim
his business card.

424
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,175
Let's all calm down for a moment.

425
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,886
It's not our intention
to victimize your client again in any way.

426
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,056
The stories don't match,
so we should get them straight--

427
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,600
I get it now. You're a nobody.

428
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,687
You're all worked up
because you think you hit the jackpot.

429
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,938
What?

430
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,732
Nobody? Is that what you said?

431
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,484
Do I seem like a nobody to you?

432
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,111
Yes, you do.

433
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,572
You little bitch. You don't know shit--

434
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,906
"Little bitch"? How dare you!

435
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,075
You're going too far. Please sit down.

436
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,747
I wonder why you're getting
worked up about this.

437
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,457
Maybe you're a rookie.

438
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,626
Which firm do you work at?

439
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,753
A rookie? You're the one who's green here.

440
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,171
How dare you call me a bastard?

441
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,090
When did I ever call you...

442
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,385
You're not a lawyer, are you?

443
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,096
What are you talking about?

444
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,641
Where did you study at exactly?

445
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,727
When did you graduate and which school?

446
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,770
I don't need to answer that.

447
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,065
My client has made up her mind,
so don't contact her again.

448
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,027
If you harass my client again,

449
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,030
I won't just let it slide.
Do you understand?

450
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,991
Come on, when did you graduate?

451
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,536
- Why won't you answer me?
- This is bullshit.

452
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,374
Darn it, this is so frustrating.

453
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,505
Shoot, what's with those crazy people?

454
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,468
What do I do now?

455
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,304
That piece of garbage.

456
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,265
- I'm so pissed off.
- Calm down.

457
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,436
We pissed him off,
so settling is out of the question now.

458
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,190
It serves you right
for calling him a bastard.

459
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,026
That's not what I meant
when I called him a nobody.

460
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,486
It means he opened his own firm.

461
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,448
Also, a rookie means
a rookie attorney of a law firm.

462
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,285
It just doesn't make any sense.

463
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,080
They're commonly used words
in the legal field,

464
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,124
but he misunderstood me
and bit my head off.

465
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,711
- Hey.
- Yes.

466
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,546
- Come with me.
- Where are you going?

467
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,840
Wait for me.

468
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,767
It's me.

469
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,645
I talked to his lawyers,
so they won't call you anymore.

470
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,315
Yes. If they try to contact you again

471
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,817
or ask to settle,

472
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,653
say that you'll make
a harassment complaint.

473
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,029
Got it?

474
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,198
Goodness.

475
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:17,537
This is a nice office for a lawyer.
Right?

476
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,670
Article 109 of the Attorney-at-Law Act

477
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,298
states that impersonating an attorney
can be punished by imprisonment

478
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,884
not more than 7 years
or by a fine not exceeding 50 million won.

479
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,928
You're done for.

480
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,471
What is it that you want?

481
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,889
Mr. Park's case?

482
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,308
I'll have the victim settle...

483
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,978
I didn't come all the way here
for just that.

484
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,187
A settlement?

485
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,189
You should have agreed to that
when we called.

486
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,234
- Then what?
- Who's behind all this?

487
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,821
I can't tell you that.
I never reveal my clients'...

488
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,323
You illegally obtained information
on people.

489
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,743
It's a violation
of Personal Information Protection Act.

490
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,787
This counts as an invasion of privacy.

491
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,042
Those aren't real,
which means you forged documents.

492
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,795
I can smell the stink from a mile away.

493
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,756
So shall I take a better look?

494
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,424
I'll sue you for blackmail.

495
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,801
Is that so? Sure thing.

496
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,012
Go ahead and sue me.
And where can you do that? Here.

497
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,140
"Public Prosecutor's Office"?

498
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,528
It's already as good as decided.

499
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,491
Judge Seo, congratulations in advance
on your promotion to Chief Justice.

500
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,825
Gosh, thank you.

501
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,496
It may have been a promotion in your days,

502
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,706
but I'm headed to a rural area

503
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,084
where I'll be counting my days
to come back as a judge.

504
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,460
What's there to worry about?

505
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,755
You know how good Judge Seo is.

506
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,591
However,

507
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,719
I can't say the same for your son.

508
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,846
What are you talking about?

509
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,349
I've only heard good things about his son

510
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,476
even when he was still in training.

511
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,602
I know that, too.

512
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,815
But is there something
troubling him these days?

513
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,067
Evaluations are coming up

514
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,488
and it's not like your son
to raise his voice at someone at work.

515
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,159
A detective came and demanded a DNA test.

516
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,994
A DNA test?

517
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,913
What for?

518
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,624
Well...

519
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,670
He suspected Prosecutor Seo
of being Oh Yeong-cheol's son.

520
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,673
Who would say such nonsense?

521
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,467
The test result proved that he's my son.

522
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,011
How did you even hear about this nonsense?

523
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,888
Your people sure have big mouths.

524
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,268
I laughed due to the absurdity
of the whole notion.

525
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,436
Of course.

526
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,815
You know how it is these days.

527
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,152
Some detectives bark up the wrong tree
in the most idiotic way.

528
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:58,948
I bet he was just trying
to ruin Prosecutor Seo's reputation.

529
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,075
Don't you agree, Judge Seo?

530
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,082
<i>How can you not know his name, age, job</i>

531
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,168
<i>or anything about him?</i>

532
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,502
I really don't.

533
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,921
Some clients openly tell me,

534
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,592
but most take their business elsewhere
the moment I ask.

535
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,677
We dig up information on the subjects,

536
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,220
not our clients.

537
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,181
You must have a contact number, at least.

538
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,099
You'd be in touch with him.

539
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,811
There's a reason why we're
the number one private detective agency.

540
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,730
We offer something special.

541
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,024
Here.

542
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,985
Once they pay the retainer,
we give our clients these.

543
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,404
- What are these?
- After we get the job

544
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,156
and the retainer, the client gets a phone.

545
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,365
It's a phone to contact us.

546
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,869
You're revealing yourself
by giving us your number,

547
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,246
so someone in need of our service
wouldn't risk it.

548
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,416
What are you saying?
Are you saying you have no idea?

549
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,543
But I know the most important thing.

550
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,922
His face.

551
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,381
"His face"?

552
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,884
His face is round

553
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,762
and his hair... Well, he's not bald.
It's ordinary.

554
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,889
- Ordinary?
- Yes, and his hair is slightly curled.

555
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,140
- Slightly curled?
- Yes.

556
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,477
His eyes are narrow and wide.

557
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,104
- Downwards?
- Yes, with monolid eyes.

558
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,564
- Monolid eyes?
- Yes.

559
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,778
We got his eyebrows. What about his nose?

560
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,529
- It's quite big.
- What about his lips?

561
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,324
His bottom lip is fatter
than his upper one.

562
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,700
- Like someone pulled on it?
- Yes.

563
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,704
- Like this.
- Stay exactly like that. Don't move.

564
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,164
Okay.

565
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,877
It's done. Is this how he looks?

566
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,259
Is this supposed to
help us track him down?

567
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,344
What? Why?

568
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,556
Hey! I didn't get the drawing right
because you didn't describe him properly.

569
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,141
Just call the cops on him.

570
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,435
Spending time in prison
will clarify your description.

571
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,437
What now? I really did my best.

572
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,231
I did, too.

573
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,817
I sketched the face
just like how you explained it.

574
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,944
It's what you described.

575
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,195
No, it's your fault.

576
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,783
So with this crappy sketch... Wait.

577
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,286
Can't you see
his defining features, though?

578
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,538
It's enough to catch
the suspect with, so...

579
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,332
He's calling the victim
to settle the case,

580
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,626
we'll get a call right away
unless things go wrong.

581
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,169
Right.

582
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,506
He said he was hired
to keep the victim from settling

583
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,383
so that Park Gi-man goes to prison.

584
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,469
But why? And by whom?

585
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:29,473
Park Gi-man is trying
to finally get on with his life,

586
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,143
so why would anyone want to ruin it?

587
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,145
Who is it?

588
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,355
Detective Park?

589
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,066
What?

590
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,444
The photo in the case notebook?

591
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,032
May I?

592
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,872
This man did turn out
to be Oh Yeong-cheol.

593
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,500
Why did Prosecutor Go have this
in her possession?

594
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,794
You said it was in her case notebook.

595
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,963
She must have had it for a while.

596
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,633
So who are those kids?

597
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,094
Is this Se-yeon as a child?

598
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,307
I had a photo of Oh Tae-jin?

599
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,516
What do you mean by that?

600
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,770
It's the photo you kept
in your case notebook.

601
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,771
Here.

602
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,940
This is a photo of Seung-hun.

603
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,985
The boy behind him is Tae-jin.

604
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,738
What?

605
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,240
Seung-hun? You mean Lee Seung-hun?

606
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,534
The last victim
of the Eomsan-dong murder case?

607
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,124
So it was because he knew his past.

608
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,794
That's why he was killed.

609
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,672
This means that Oh Yeong-cheol
and Seo Ji-uk have been

610
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,300
accomplices from the beginning.

611
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,886
Let me take over this case.

612
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,096
It's not a copycat?

613
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,389
How would I know that

614
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,391
when we've never met?

615
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,144
The past victims weren't ones
to harbor enemies, either.

616
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,145
If it was an easy case,

617
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,439
I would have put the culprit in jail
when I had the case.

618
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,440
"Signature"?

619
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,985
Do you really have a suspect in mind?

620
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,995
You're dead meat, you asshole.

621
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,497
Se-yeon!

622
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,422
She's on her way
to kill Prosecutor Seo, right?

623
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,049
- Probably.
- At the Public Prosecutor's Office?

624
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,177
Looking like you?

625
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,896
Why won't this work?

626
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,107
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me.

627
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,775
- Let go!
- Se-yeon!

628
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,610
- Seo Ji-uk! Let go!
- What's wrong with you?

629
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,154
- Where is he?
- I'll take her.

630
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,530
Get Seo Ji-uk down here!

631
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,615
- Se-yeon, please calm down.
- Let go!

632
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,034
Seo Ji-uk!

633
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,997
Isn't that Prosecutor Lee?

634
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,833
Seo Ji-uk.

635
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,561
Why are you making a scene?

636
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,898
This is all your doing, isn't it?

637
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,359
You killed Seung-hun as well!

638
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,698
Stop accusing an innocent man.

639
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,327
If you keep accusing me,

640
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,787
I won't let it slide.

641
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,791
You think I'm not capable?

642
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,377
You think you'll get the best of me?

643
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,630
Just you wait.

644
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:52,718
I'm going to reveal your disgusting self
whatever it takes.

645
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,514
Look forward to it.

646
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,943
Prosecutor Seo, are you all right?

647
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,799
How did this end up with Go Se-yeon?

648
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,482
Over here.

649
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,207
It's been a while, hasn't it?

650
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,795
I was surprised to see you on TV.

651
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,298
You used to be a wimp as a kid

652
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,758
so other kids knocked you around
all the time.

653
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,553
My gosh. Look at your broad shoulders.

654
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,264
Have you been working out?

655
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,146
You're a hotshot now.

656
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,273
I didn't even recognize you.

657
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,774
Just cut to the chase.

658
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,402
You said you needed to show me something.
What is it?

659
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:37,364
Well, I was going to just let it pass,

660
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,327
but I thought I should bring it up
since you were so strongly denying it.

661
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,495
You made me the crazy one.

662
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,291
I have a really good eye, you know.

663
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,501
Why are you keeping it up?

664
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,462
You're Oh Tae-jin, aren't you?

665
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,346
Here.

666
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,974
Isn't this you and your father?

667
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,312
I thought something was fishy,
so I did some research

668
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,106
and it turns out, people know you
as Judge Seo Cheon-sik's son.

669
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,151
What's going on? Did he adopt you, then?

670
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,529
But why did he? Your father's also
a famous doctor, isn't he?

671
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,200
Are you just curious,

672
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,119
or do you want something from me?

673
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,083
Well, I guess you could say
it's the latter.

674
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,671
I usually never ask anyone for anything.

675
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,131
I spent years preparing for the bar exam,

676
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,425
and since it was abolished,
I don't have much to do.

677
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,928
Getting into law school isn't easy,
either.

678
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:48,018
So I was thinking of getting a job
at a law firm or something.

679
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,521
The bigger, the better.

680
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,318
You know a lot of people in that field,
don't you?

681
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,254
Hello.

682
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,506
Did you think about it?

683
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,219
Of course I'd appreciate it
if you can help me out.

684
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,388
Yes, okay.

685
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,724
I'll sort the details out

686
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,434
once you find out more about it.

687
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,276
Finally, I'm getting a job.

688
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,237
Let's see...

689
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,249
Did I leave the door open?

690
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,637
What's wrong with this now?
Is it a blackout?

691
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:56,939
There we go.

692
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,150
Who are you?

693
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,883
It's nothing to worry about.

694
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,846
Something happened to come up
between him and me,

695
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,723
and we were just squabbling a bit.

696
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,560
My battery's running low.

697
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,270
All right, then.

698
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,900
Everyone's calling me now.
I should just keep my phone off.

699
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,737
I'm sorry, Mi-do.
I guess I should've thought twice.

700
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,240
Why did you have to go and be so...

701
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,702
awesome?

702
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,831
You did a great job. Very Nice!
You shouldn't have stopped there.

703
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,584
You should've shamed him
into leaving the office for good.

704
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,545
You should've beaten the hell out of him.

705
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,298
I would've done the same.
You did a good job.

706
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,634
The autopsy results come back tonight,

707
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,970
so let's hang in there a little longer.

708
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,600
We're very close to bringing him down.

709
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,977
Oh, right. What about Park Gi-man?

710
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,936
Did they agree to settle?

711
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,606
Take a look at this.

712
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,192
Here.
Do you have any idea who this may be?

713
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,236
Does he look familiar?

714
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,655
Is it a Picasso piece?

715
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,490
Maybe impressionist art?

716
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,619
Not really...

717
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,371
- Did you draw that?
- Yes.

718
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,874
You should just focus on your job.

719
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,214
Since it was all set up,

720
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,175
I was wondering if it may be

721
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,261
anyone who could be
holding a grudge against you.

722
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,432
Do you have anyone in mind?

723
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,730
I cut ties with all my friends,
colleagues and family

724
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:06,193
after my daughter passed away.

725
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,822
I hid away from the world
like a dead person.

726
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,577
I don't think there's anyone

727
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,039
other than Oh Yeong-cheol who would--

728
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,083
He said it was a man in his 50s.

729
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,507
Do you have any idea who it could be?

730
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:43,939
Did you call for me?

731
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,649
Have a seat.

732
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,165
Step down from everything

733
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,292
and leave.

734
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,005
- Father.
- Don't even call me that!

735
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,717
I heard about what happened yesterday
at the lobby.

736
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,429
What have you been up to these days?

737
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,183
If you leave now,

738
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,061
we may be able to avoid the worst.

739
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,357
Leave the country and live
like you don't exist, just as you used to.

740
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,985
I won't drag it out any longer.

741
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,781
Leave this country immediately.

742
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,997
Why should I do that?

743
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,791
Why should I?

744
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,545
You were the one who brought me in
to cover it up

745
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,130
after you killed your own son.

746
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,633
Do you know how much I struggled

747
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,595
to live up to your expectations?

748
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,097
- Why, you--
- You and I

749
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,142
are in this together.

750
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,268
Therefore,

751
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,897
we both have to pay equally
for what we did.

752
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,570
It won't be

753
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,242
the end for just me. Bear that in mind.

754
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:58,949
Hello.

755
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,787
At what time?

756
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,380
Thank you, Mi-do.

757
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,058
What's wrong?

758
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,479
I'm scared of facing Mom's body again.

759
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,524
You're right.

760
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,360
I guess there's no reason for you
to see it again.

761
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,946
I'll check her body for you.

762
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,532
I'll call you after we transfer
her coffin to the car.

763
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,616
Will you wait here, then?

764
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,494
- Thank you, Se-yeon.
- No problem.

765
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,289
Mi-do, could you wait with her?

766
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:01,761
It's her.

767
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,932
Please review the form and sign here.

768
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,566
We keep talking about saving my mom

769
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,151
with a marble that you can't even see.

770
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,779
Se-yeon, Min and I...

771
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,990
We must all sound crazy to you.

772
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,243
Well, just a tiny bit.

773
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,914
It was so absurd at first

774
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,582
that I thought it was a dream.

775
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,751
Or maybe some kind of a prank.

776
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,461
I couldn't understand what was going on,

777
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:39,507
but I realized that there are
so many other things in this world

778
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,635
that are even more absurd.

779
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,889
A highly respected doctor
turned out to be a serial killer,

780
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:50,101
and Seo Ji-uk was the one
who had been helping him out.

781
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:54,773
And the fact that those two were
the ones who killed Se-yeon.

782
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,651
That's harder to believe

783
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,029
than the fact that you all came back
from the dead.

784
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,742
Just keep your mind focused

785
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,704
on how you'll keep yourselves happy
once you reunite with your mother.

786
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,249
When the case is closed,

787
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,877
I'll restore your mother's family register
that Oh Yeong-cheol removed.

788
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:22,509
Then we can pretend
your mother never died.

789
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,055
Everything will be fine.

790
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,641
Thank you so much.

791
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,521
It's taking longer than I thought.

792
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,857
I know.
I thought she only had to sign the form.

793
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,611
- I think I should check on her.
- Do you want me to go with you?

794
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,156
No, it's fine. You should get home.

795
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,325
We're going straight to the vacation home

796
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,077
once we get my mom.

797
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,496
Will Director Cha be there, too?

798
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,415
- Yes.
- All right, then.

799
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,751
I hope everything works out
and you can reunite with your mom.

800
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,796
- I'll wait at home, then.
- Okay.

801
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,008
See you.

802
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,587
<i>Se-yeon, I think I need some time</i>
<i>to get myself mentally prepared.</i>

803
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,505
<i>I'll be waiting at home.</i>

804
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,270
- Hello.
- Are you done?

805
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,898
Yes, I'm going to get her transferred
and leave soon.

806
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,316
<i>Okay, thanks for the trouble.</i>

807
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,652
Don't mention it. Are you coming
straight to the vacation home?

808
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,155
Yes, I'm done with work
and just about to leave.

809
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,573
Are you coming with Hee-jin?

810
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,659
No, I'll be going on my own.

811
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,121
Hee-jin tries not to show it,
but I think she's taking it hard.

812
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,291
I went to check her mom's body for her.

813
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,170
She said she'll just wait at home

814
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,713
and see her mom after she's revived.

815
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,508
Don't you think she should go with you?

816
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,760
If she gets revived to another body--

817
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,262
<i>No way, that won't happen.</i>

818
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,848
Hee-jin was revived to her own self.

819
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,476
Besides, when you were revived,
didn't they say

820
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,896
that most people have
the same soul as their own self?

821
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,274
I think the two of us were
rare exceptions.

822
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,986
Also, Oh Yeong-cheol only got much older.
That's why we didn't recognize him.

823
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,863
He didn't turn into another person.

824
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,032
You're right.

825
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:55,870
<i>Do you really think we should be</i>
<i>using Abyss like this, though?</i>

826
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,331
I know we have no other choice,

827
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,042
but it's kind of getting me worried.

828
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,587
You're right.

829
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,800
Let's just discuss it again
after we revive Ms. Jang.

830
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,219
All right.

831
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,496
Is it ready?

832
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,541
Yes. Wasn't someone else coming?
When will she be here?

833
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,877
She won't be coming.

834
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,795
- All right, then. After you.
- Sure.

835
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,508
They're having a private funeral,

836
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,428
so please have it transferred
to this address, not the hospital.

837
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,181
- Detective Lee!
- Yes?

838
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,558
- I need you to check something.
- What is it?

839
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,479
You got the address, right?

840
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,814
We're headed towards Gyeonggi Province.

841
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,529
Detective Lee is still outside.

842
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,530
Isn't he supposed to...

843
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,826
Sir! Excuse me!

844
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,964
Seo Ji-uk?

845
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,007
Hey!

846
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:56,199
<i>Min, something's come up.</i>
<i>Can you come to this address?</i>

847
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,434
- What do you know?
- I know everything.

848
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,437
I'm the one who brought you back to life.

849
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,063
<i>Why don't you just cry?</i>

850
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,064
I won't cry yet.

851
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,107
<i>No, I can't.</i>

852
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,775
<i>To me, you're not a prosecutor.</i>

853
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,319
<i>I need to keep you safe this time.</i>

854
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:15,903
<i>For me, you're the gift.</i>

855
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,741
Come to think of it,
you've always been by my side.

856
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,326
- We can kiss.
- What?

857
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,872
<i>Since we're being honest with each other,</i>

858
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,832
starting today...

859
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,502
<i>I really... I really like you, Se-yeon.</i>

860
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,466
