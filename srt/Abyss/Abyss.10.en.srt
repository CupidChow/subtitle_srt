1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,170
Yes, I'd appreciate that.

2
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,843
- It really is you.
- Mi-do!

3
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,305
Funny running into you here.

4
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,931
What brings you here?

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,726
I just had some business nearby.

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,853
What about you?

7
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,483
I also had some business,
but my friend got hurt.

8
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,568
A friend?

9
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,112
Would you like some water?

10
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,906
No, I'm good.

11
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,576
I only bought one can of coffee.
I have to stay up all night.

12
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,288
Was your friend hospitalized?

13
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,957
Yes. How about you? Are you headed home?

14
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,376
Yes.

15
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,544
Actually,

16
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,339
we received a tip
about the Oh Yeong-cheol Case,

17
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,882
so I was here to investigate.

18
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,051
Oh Yeong-cheol?

19
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,720
Someone reported that they saw
Oh Yeong-cheol's ex-wife

20
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,014
who had been presumed dead
after going missing.

21
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,682
Is that so?

22
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,400
Do you think the tip is reliable?

23
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,902
Yes, it seems so.

24
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,655
But I don't know if we'll be able
to communicate with her.

25
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,572
Why not?

26
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,909
According to the informant,
she's not mentally stable.

27
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,787
I think her name was Jang Sun-young.

28
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,041
- Are you coming?
- Yes, I am.

29
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,015
Princess.

30
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,270
My princess.

31
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,482
I don't understand what's going on.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,318
That young lady is her daughter.

33
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,238
What? That can't be true.

34
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,075
I heard all her children passed away.

35
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,702
No. I'm certain of it.

36
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,538
I think it's best to take her with us.

37
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,500
I'm not her guardian.

38
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,963
I think I'd better let the prosecutor
know about this.

39
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,257
What do I do?

40
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,426
"Prosecutor"?

41
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,555
He was the one who brought her to me,

42
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,640
so why don't you talk to him?

43
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,142
PROSECUTOR SEO JI-UK

44
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,868
Is it a lot farther?

45
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,121
I don't think there are any houses
around here.

46
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,915
We're almost there.

47
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,363
Please pick up. Please.

48
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,170
I used to love this song.

49
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,297
Didn't you like this song too?

50
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,675
You always sang it
when we went to karaoke.

51
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,136
I had no idea that
you remembered my taste in music.

52
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,224
Did I sing this in front of you?

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,477
Of course you did.

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,812
Don't you remember?

55
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,648
You sang it at the team dinner.

56
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,442
I may not look it,
but I have a good memory.

57
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,367
<i>Incoming call. 0, 1, 0, 2, 5...</i>

58
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,576
CALL DECLINED

59
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,620
You can take it.

60
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,956
I'll just call them back later.

61
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,544
- <i>Incoming call. 0, 1, 0...</i>
- It's fine.

62
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,962
- It seems urgent.
- Wait.

63
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,547
<i>Prosecutor Seo.</i>

64
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>Someone's here, claiming to be
the daughter of the woman you brought.</i>

65
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,219
<i>Mom!</i>

66
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,763
CALL ENDED

67
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,521
I used to get pestering calls
like that too.

68
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,358
Isn't it exasperating
to be a prosecutor in Korea?

69
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,027
I feel your pain.

70
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,071
You poor thing.

71
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,532
Anyway, let's go back to that song.

72
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,916
What? Kim Ha-jin's dating?

73
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,046
Who is it? Whom is he dating?

74
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,547
Let me see.

75
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,896
Is this the place?

76
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,025
No, but the call earlier seems important.

77
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,735
I'll be right back.

78
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,403
Okay.

79
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,616
Yes, Detective Park.

80
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,868
Here?

81
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,454
Ji-uk, where are we?

82
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,873
Let me check.

83
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,501
It's too dark out here.

84
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,922
We're at a lake
near Chupyeong in Gyeonggi Province.

85
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,842
I'm not sure since
Prosecutor Seo brought me here.

86
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,553
There's a sign over there. Hold on.

87
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,600
I just sent you a photo.

88
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,561
Do you see the sign behind Prosecutor Seo?

89
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,106
Yes, that's where we are. Sure thing.

90
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,739
Detective Park is in charge
of Oh Yeong-cheol's case.

91
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,575
I texted him since
he should know about the tip too.

92
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,786
I told him that you and I

93
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,331
were on our way to verify
the tip regarding Jang Sun-young.

94
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,888
EPISODE 10

95
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,944
I don't know why
my stomach's suddenly acting up.

96
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,489
You said you needed to make a call, right?
Take your time.

97
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,867
I think I may be a while.

98
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,452
- It's fine.
- Sorry.

99
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
- It's fine. It seems urgent.
- Wait.

Hee-jin.

104
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,604
It was Hee-jin's voice.

Someone's here, claiming to be

Mom!

Mom, no! Are you all right?

113
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,968
Prosecutor Seo?

114
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,720
Is that Prosecutor Seo?
Let me talk to him.

115
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,180
We got disconnected.

116
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,601
I have no idea what's going on.
I'm so confused.

117
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,978
Excuse me.

118
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,525
I really think
you're mistaken about something.

119
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,776
CAN'T PICK UP

120

<i>Can't pick up. What's going on?</i>

121
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,701
What? Kim Ha-jin's dating?

122
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,705
Darn it. I really liked this actor.

123
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,335
Kim Ha-jin...

124

<i>Prosecutor Seo is the kidnapper.</i>

126
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,305
<i>It's dangerous to be alone with him.</i>

127
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,682
Damn it.

128
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,810
Why can't she pick up?

129
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,478
<i>Yes, Detective Park.</i>

130
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,105
<i>Here?</i>

131
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,857
Ji-uk, where are we?

132
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,985
Let me check.

133
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,571
<i>It's too dark out here.</i>

134
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,947
Are you all right?

135
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,034
Se-yeon, please...

136
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,171
Hey, look. Isn't that the car?

137
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,468
She's not dead yet.

138
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,248
What's taking him so long?

139
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,519
- Se-yeon.
- Min!

140
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,024
- I got you. Are you all right?
- Yes.

141
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,745
Where's Ji-uk?

142
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,705
He was gone when I got here.

143
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,845
Are you sure nothing happened?

144
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,764
Yes.

145
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,851
Anyway, what the hell is going on?

146
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,355
Are you sure Ji-uk was the one
who abducted Ms. Jang?

147
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,191
I thought it could be a possibility

148
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,735
which is why I took precautionary
measures when I saw your text,

149
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,071
but why would Ji-uk...

150
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,781
He has no reason to do that.

151
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,741
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's the truth.

152
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,161
I heard it from the lady
who was looking after Ms. Jang.

153
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,670
<i>Mi-do, something urgent came up
so I had to leave.</i>

00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,922
<i>Detective Park will be there soon, right?</i>

155
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,508
- Who is it?
- Ji-uk.

156
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,260
What did he say?

157
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,263
He had to leave
because something urgent came up.

158
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,889
Also...

159
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,478
<i>The tip regarding

162
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,592
<i>That's really all I know.</i>

163
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,471
I don't know about any kidnapping.

164
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,351
Prosecutor Seo just asked me
to look after her for a while.

165
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,563
Detective.

166
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,568
Do I really need to tell you all of this?

167
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:04,200
I don't think I should
be telling you all of this.

168
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,912
Ma'am, we're only asking
you these questions

169
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,833
so that we can clear
Prosecutor Seo's name.

170
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,336
He's not a monster,

171
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,587
- right?
- No.

172
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,008
So please tell us everything you know
in as much detail as possible.

173
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,137
All right. I get it,

174
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,140
but my head is spinning.

175
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,643
- Let's stop.
- I see.

176
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,188
This is a lot to take in,
so we'll let you rest today.

177
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,690
I'll take you home. Come on.

178
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,235
This way, ma'am.

179
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,694
See you later.

180
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,036
The date coincides.

181
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,290
Last Tuesday is when
the kidnapper managed to ditch us.

182
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,386
Detective Park,
we weren't expecting you today.

183
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,720
Is Prosecutor Seo inside?

184
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,765
- Detective Park.
- There he is.

185
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,561
- You may go.
- All right.

186
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,564
Hello, sir.

187
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,233
Have you eaten?

188
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,570
What brings you by?

189
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,739
I came by to ask a few things.

190
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,450
- You could've called.
- I did. Several times.

191
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,579
But you seemed to be avoiding me.

192
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,872
Not at all.

193
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,623
My phone broke.

194
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,793
If it were urgent,
you could've called the office.

195
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,171
- What is this about?
- I see. Your phone's broken.

196
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,592
Here.

197
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,721
What do you know about this?

198
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,980
How do you have a photo of her?

199
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,696
I'll cut right to the chase then.

200
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,825
Why did you

201
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,619
hide Ms. Jang Sun-young?

202
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,623
Ms. Jang Sun-young?

203
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,469
A picnic.

204
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,179
A picnic.

205
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,390
I'm on a picnic with my princess!

206
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,436
We could've just stayed at a hotel.

207
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,022
It'll be uncomfortable
since your mom isn't well.

208
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,651
I don't want to inconvenience Se-yeon.

209
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,570
There you go again,
pretending like you care.

210
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,989
Save it. It's not like
you've ever cared about me.

211
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,616
It's not an inconvenience.

212
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,286
That's why I got a separate place
for Se-yeon.

213
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,503
Wait a second.

214
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,758
Are you telling me
to stay with you from now on?

215
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,845
I know we kissed a little,

216
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,807
but this is a bit too fast.

217
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,433
I'll just stay with Hee-jin.

218
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,405
I'm not comfortable sharing a room
with you either,

219
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,739
so you can stay here.

220
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,950
This is my secret hideout.

221
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,910
It's the safest place in the world.

222
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,622
Did you whisk me off to Hogwarts?

223
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,671
I didn't know such rooms existed.

224
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,008
What is all this?

225
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,433
They are my most prized possessions
that I can never get rid of.

226
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,562
My mom hated them,
so I couldn't keep them in my room.

227
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,774
It's you when you were little.

228
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,443
How adorable.

229
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,124
You said you rarely got to see him

230
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,168
after the divorce, right?

231
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,379
My mom never saw him again,

232
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,549
but I did once or twice a month

233
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,011
before he passed away
without telling my mom.

234
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,309
He was a weak and incompetent husband
in my mother's eyes,

235
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,854
but he was the perfect dad to me.

236
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,321
Why did you want to take a picture
out of the blue,

237
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,365
- like we won't see each other again?
- It came out nice.

238
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,868
Look. I'm so glad we took it.
It came out nice.

239
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,163
Hey, Min.
You can't show this to your mom, okay?

240
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,083
All right, I won't. I promise.

241
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,002
Oh, right. Look at this, Dad.

242
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,716
Mom brought these cookies
from her business trip to France.

243
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,176
They look delicious.

244
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,763
These are skincare products for you.

245
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,389
Perfect, I needed some.

246
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,641
And this.

247
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,644
Mom drinks this red ginseng.
I hear it's very expensive.

248
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,312
I see.

249
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,148
- Oh, that's nothing.
- Wait! What is this?

250
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,109
Give it back, Dad. Come on.

251
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,861
Is this a picture of your girlfriend?

252
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,238
She's not my girlfriend.

253
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,657
She's someone I have a crush on.

254
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:38,992
What's her name?

255
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,246
Her name is Go Se-yeon? She's pretty.

256
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,413
Right? Isn't she?

257
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,707
She's super popular at school.

258
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,084
That's why a guy like me...

259
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,462
What?

260
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,422
What's wrong with you?

261
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,259
If this girl is a good judge of character,

262
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,177
she'll know how great you are.

263
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,805
- You really think so?
- Of course.

264
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,850
Dad, are you all right?

265
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,686
Hold on. I'm okay.

266
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,065
Dad, let's tell Mom so that
you can be treated at a big hospital.

267
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,734
You may get better if you get surgery.

268
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,987
I'm really okay.

269
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,036
Trust me. I'm really okay.

270
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,581
Gosh, I can't believe

271
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,792
you're old enough
to have a crush on a girl.

272
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,878
You really are a man now.

273
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,923
Min, give me a hug.

274
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,636
- Stop it.
- Look at you.

275
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,014
You used to be glued to me
when you were little.

276
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,765
Look at you being all difficult.

277
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,019
- I'm going to teach you a lesson.
- No, Dad! I'm sorry!

278
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,854
Don't, Dad. You win!

279
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,064
<i>- I'm sorry.
- I won, right?</i>

280
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,900
<i>Dad, sorry. Stop!</i>

281
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,277
<i>Had I known that would be the last time,</i>

282
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,614
<i>I would've given him a big hug.</i>

283
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,077
FUNERAL HOME

284
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,498
CHA SEUNG-BOK

285
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,471
<i>If I'd had Abyss back then,</i>

286
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,557
<i>I would've brought my dad
back to life first.</i>

287
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,688
Whenever I think about that...

288
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,026
It's such a shame.

289
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,364
At times, I did resent

290
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,866
the alien who gave me the marble

291
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,911
as well as my hapless fate
that led me to it.

292
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,705
But then again,

293
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,333
the more I think about it,

294
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,341
the more I feel that
the marble was in fact a gift.

295
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,602
For me, you're the gift.

296
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,981
I know this is belated,

297
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,110
but thanks for saving me.

298
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,831
Hey, what's this heart-shaped thing?

299
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,374
It doesn't suit this room at all.

300
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,960
Oh, that. Don't you remember?

301
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,130
- What?
- You gave it to me.

302
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,466
On Valentine's Day,
junior year of high school.

303
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,593
You said you got too many chocolates

304
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,970
and gave me one.

305
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,930
I did?

306
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,018
I know it was insignificant to you,
but it was your first gift to me.

307
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,436
How could you not remember...

308
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,981
Fine, forget it.
You obviously remember nothing about me.

309
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,107
Forget it.

310
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,443
You're really clueless.

311
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,196
You still buy that obvious lie?

312
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,949
What do you mean?

313
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,243
It was Valentine's Day. Get it?

314
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,579
Don't you know what Valentine's Day is?

315
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,080
It's when girls give boys chocolate.

316
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,333
Why would I get a ton of chocolates?

317
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,709
Am I a guy?

318
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,922
Hey, then was this...
Did you buy this for me?

319
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,383
You haven't changed one bit.

320
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,511
I really can't figure out
if you're just naive or dumb.

321
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,846
Hang on a second.

322
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:32,059
So, are you saying
you bought this yourself for me?

323
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,311
But why? For what?

324
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,563
What do you think? I told you.

325
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,482
It's the day girls give chocolate to boys.

326
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:42,444
Right, but why did you buy this for me
of all people?

327
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,407
I don't know. Why are you grilling me?

328
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,867
I'm not grilling you...

329
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,412
- It's an automatic door.
- Crap!

330
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,165
It opens when you press this button.

331
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,501
Why didn't you tell you sooner?

332
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,419
I hope it doesn't get swollen.
Hey, it's red.

333
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,546
- It's red?
- It's red.

334
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,215
- Is it swollen?
- Yes.

335
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,092
Oh, boy.

336
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,448
What the...

337
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,283
Hey. Hold on.

338
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,954
Auntie! Hello.

339
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,331
- Ms. Lee, why are you coming out of there?
- Pardon?

340
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,375
Sorry, I don't have much experience
with kissing...

341
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,543
Auntie!

342
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,382
Right.

343
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,393
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

344
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,395
What do we do now?

345
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,533
Please bring the dessert
when they're done eating.

346
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,784
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,373
Hello. What about Min?

348
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,210
He has to make a phone call.
He told me to go ahead and eat first.

349
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,171
This way. Have a seat.

350
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,755
Thank you.

351
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,014
Everything looks so good.

352
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,517
It's not much, but I hope you enjoy it.

353
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,646
Oh, I guess this is considered
"not much" to you.

354
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,650
- I'll wait for Min.
- All right.

355
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,990
I've never seen Min let anyone
into that room before.

356
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,992
Pardon?

357
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,161
The secret room.

358
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,999
When I first found out
about the room years ago,

359
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,211
he made a big fuss
about how I cannot tell anyone about it.

360
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,421
I figured even the maids
don't know about it,

361
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,924
so I was going to tidy it up a little,

362
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,176
but he was like, "Don't go in there!"

363
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,178
And he got so mad at me.

364
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,972
- Min got mad at you?
- Yes!

365
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,099
That's how he was.

366
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,646
But my goodness.
He let you in that room today.

367
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,067
It's surprising.

368
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,780
I thought Se-yeon would be
the first person he'd let into the room.

369
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,620
Ms. Lee.

370
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,792
You know that
Min likes you very much, right?

371
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,461
No, I don't.

372
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,090
My gosh, you cooked up a feast.

373
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,133
Auntie.

374
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,181
Oh, right. Please pack some of the food
and take it to the guest house.

375
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,557
Sure, no problem.

376
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,645
Then enjoy your meal.

377
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,897
- Thank you for the food.
- Thanks, Auntie.

378
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,941
- You were waiting for me?
- Yes.

379
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,526
You didn't have to. You must be hungry.

380
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,486
Hey, whether it's for breakfast or dinner,

381
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,738
meat is always the best.

382
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,907
Hey, hold on.

383
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,869
Eat or talk. Choose one.

384
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,581
Hey, don't do that.

385
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,296
PARK & JANG OFFICE MANAGER

386
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,299
- Hello?
- <i>Ms. Lee.</i>

387
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,218
<i>How could you submit your letter
of resignation without even telling me?</i>

388
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,970
<i>You really hurt my feelings.</i>

389
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,222
Come again?
I submitted a letter of resignation?

390
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,767
<i>This can't go on, you know.</i>

391
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,771
Even so, this means
that I've become jobless overnight.

392
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,523
You should've given me a heads-up.

393
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,109
Unbelievable.
Since when was that your job?

394
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,821
- Gosh, this is so frustrating.
- Do you want a drink?

395
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,864
Here.

396
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,124
You see, we have to act
as if we're the same person.

397
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,876
If you're going to do your own thing...

398
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,388
You seemed quite angry, so I thought
this might help you cool down.

399
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,018
So, are you two back together?

400
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,021
Well, not exactly. But you know...

401
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,066
How could you treat him
as if he's invisible?

402
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,861
- Dong-cheol, you should drink some too.
- Open it for me.

403
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,947
Detective Park, don't you have work to do?

404
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,201
You don't have time
to be all lovey-dovey here.

405
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,871
"Lovey-dovey"? What are you talking about?

406
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,540
I questioned Prosecutor Seo
first thing in the morning.

407
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,126
I just stopped by
because I was in the area.

408
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,836
You met with Ji-uk? What did he say?

409
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,131
He said Choe Gi-hun handed
Jang Sun-young over to him.

410
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,050
It looks like he was fooled as well.

411
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,511
It sounds like Choe Gi-hun asked him
to look after her,

412
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,930
saying no one can take care of her
once he goes to jail.

413
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,015
Was Ji-uk the prosecutor
that indicted him?

414
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,059
Yes, everything checks out.

415
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,770
And he has a clear alibi for the time
of Jang Sun-young's abduction.

416
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,313
True.

417
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,233
The speculation that he
and Oh Yeong-cheol conspired

418
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,361
to commit such a crime
is pretty unreasonable.

419
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,950
Right. You died and came back to life,
so I get it.

420
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,997
I must say, you've always been like this.

421
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,042
Saying we must question every doubt,

422
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,420
you poked your nose into everything
and wasted so much time.

423
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,088
You acted all smart,

424
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,674
but taking an irrational,
emotional approach

425
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,300
to every case was your specialty.

426
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,386
Hold on, Mi-do.
What are you talking about?

427
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,054
I was always bright

428
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,556
- and rational--
- It's okay.

429
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,724
- I understand.
- Let go.

430
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,725
- Let go.
- Prosecutor Go.

431
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,601
- Let go. What are you saying?
- Cheer up.

432
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,520
- I said, let go!
- I totally understand.

433
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,313
- Gosh, what's with you?
- Cheer up.

434
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,278
Mom, let's eat!

435
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,949
Mom.

436
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,285
Mom?

437
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,454
Mom!

438
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,247
Mom!

439
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,211
My princess.

440
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,047
Mom, where did you go without telling me?

441
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,132
I was so worried.

442
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,927
Here. This is for you, my princess.

443
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,187
Thanks.

444
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,523
They're so beautiful.

445
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,359
- I'll put them in a vase.
- Okay!

446
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,112
Wash your hands so we can eat.
Look at them.

447
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,699
No, I don't want to.
I'm going to watch TV.

448
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,576
Mom, the dirt!

449
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,205
She's impossible.

450
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,665
I'll get a wet towel. Wait there, okay?

451
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,631
<i>Mr. Oh, the Eomsan-dong serial killer,
left the detention center at 2 p.m.</i>

452
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,509
- <i>for his crime scene reenactment.</i>
- No...

453
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,220
- No!
- <i>According to the police,</i>

454
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,431
<i>he remained silent when the reporters
asked him how he was feeling.</i>

455
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,099
- No!
- <i>The bereaved who were</i>

456
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,142
- <i>on site</i>
- Mom, it's okay.

457
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,770
- <i>expressed their anger when they saw him.</i>
- You're okay.

458
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,814
<i>The police are tightening security
in the area</i>

459
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,607
<i>to prepare for the unexpected.</i>

460
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,776
<i>The Eomsan-dong serial murders</i>

461
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,362
<i>that shocked the entire country will...</i>

462
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,739
How did the information leak?

463
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,534
<i>I'm not sure. He's not even there yet,
but it's already a shit show.</i>

464
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,911
Call all units in the vicinity for backup

465
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,288
and be safe. Okay, I'm leaving now.

466
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,208
I'm off. Prosecutor Go, I'll call you.

467
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,379
Oh Yeong-cheol's crime scene reenactment
is today.

468
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,630
She'll probably go bonkers.

469
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,549
She totally will, knowing her temper.

470
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,592
Oh Yeong-cheol knows what she looks like,

471
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,928
so there's no need to show him
that she's still alive.

472
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,096
It'll be too dangerous.

473
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,140
It's all over the media,
so make sure she doesn't watch the news.

474
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,559
- I'm off.
- Okay, bye.

475
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,853
Detective Park! You're leaving already?

476
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,106
Why? Just play hooky for the whole day.

477
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,399
Well...

478
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,360
- That's why I want to go out.
- What?

479
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,279
I'm off. I need to get some air.

480
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,864
- Bye.
- Bye.

481
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,951
Se-yeon, we're both jobless now,

482
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,786
so let's have some real fun today.

483
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,329
Why are you acting like we're close?

484
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,622
- Let go!
- Come in.

485
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,503
Gi-man.

486
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,595
Were you discharged?

487
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,639
- Yes.
- Are you feeling better?

488
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,978
I'm much better now thanks to you.

489
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,357
Oh, the notebook...

490
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,695
Here you go.

491
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:52,577
Well, I heard about everything
that your daughter went through.

492
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,373
I completely understand

493
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,918
how you must feel.

494
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,383
Oh Yeong-cheol has been caught,

495
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,552
and he'll pay for everything he did,

496
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,264
so please think about your daughter
who must be watching over you

497
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,600
and cheer up.

498
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,771
Please call me if you ever need my help.

499
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,321
Thank you very much

500
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,365
for everything.

501
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,592
OH YEONG-CHEOL CASE ANALYSIS
AND CONCLUSIONS

502
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,594
CHIEF JUDGE SEO CHEON-SIK

503
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,648
A messenger just dropped this off for you.

504
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,359
- You can leave it there.
- Okay.

505
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,550
<i>I presume we have things to talk about.</i>

506
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,093
<i>I'll wait for your call.</i>

507
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,275
Jeez, they're so persistent.

508
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,495
Detective.

509
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,290
Can we open the windows a little?

510
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:07,587
I love how the air smells
at this time of the year.

511
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,505
What?

512
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,301
The weather is...

513
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,928
quite nice today.

514
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,974
Yes, sir.

515
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,310
<i>Hey, what's going on
with the abduction victim?</i>

516
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,021
I told her to come to the station
at her earliest convenience,

517
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,649
but considering the state
Jang Sun-young is in,

518
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,652
I don't think we can get
a witness statement from her.

519
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,781
Yes. Well, that's...

520
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,783
Understood, sir.

521
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,161
What does he want me to do?

522
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,914
Serial killings, abduction,
and confinement.

523
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,793
As if that wasn't enough,
you instigated an abduction behind bars?

524
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,669
Of your ex-wife?

525
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,339
Jang Sun-young?

526
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,966
How the hell do you know her?

527
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,676
What? Why you...

528
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,429
You'd better speak politely to me,
you murderer.

529
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,391
Why must I escort this monster
in a nice car?

530
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,269
This country sure loves human rights.

531
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,647
They think even monsters
deserve human rights.

532
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,151
How many times did I tell you?

533
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,321
DIRECTOR PARK SANG-GIL

534
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,741
Ever since I was here
Nurse Kim and that woman...

535
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,996
So, the nurse who disappeared
was Jang Sun-young's guardian?

536
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,873
Yes, that's right.

537
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,500
When was that, roughly?

538
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,668
I have no idea.

539
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:33,589
I took over this hospital
only three years ago.

540
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:38,010
Oh, God. I'm dying here. I'm dying.

541
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,972
Oh, dear.
I suffer from high blood pressure.

542
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,224
What if I collapse now and die?

543
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,810
What will you do then?

544
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,729
I told you. I don't know anything!

545
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,442
Why don't you track down

546
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,280
the nurse who ran away and ask her?

547
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,828
Yes, Dong-cheol.

548
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:07,290
I'm suspicious of the woman
who was at the information desk that day.

549
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,250
The nurse who said
there was no such patient?

550
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,628
<i>Yes. Apparently, she's the one who brought
Jang Sun-young to the hospital,</i>

551
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,506
and she quit the day after
Jang Sun-young went missing.

552
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,757
She took all the records too.

553
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,302
Then I guess tracking her down
should be our priority now.

554
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,470
Right.

555
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,848
Yes.

556
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,519
Okay, good work.
Come join us here when you're done. Bye.

557
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,648
- He's here!
- There he is!

558
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,650
- No photos, please.
- No photos!

559
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,736
Mr. Oh, how are you feeling?

560
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,654
- Why is his face covered?
- Say a few words!

561
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,872
Mr. Oh!

562
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,208
- Did you have an accomplice?
- Let us through.

563
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,168
- Excuse me!
- How dare you!

564
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,757
- Do you admit everything?
- Was there an accomplice?

565
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,309
We'll now begin
the crime scene reenactment

566
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,394
of the Go Se-yeon murder.

567
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,063
Bring him in.

568
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,106
Record everything, okay?

569
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,282
Oh Yeong-cheol, get started.

570
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,212
I stood here, waiting for Go Se-yeon
to come into the kitchen.

571
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,676
And then?
What did you do after you tied her up?

572
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,138
I did this.

573
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,309
VICTIM

574
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,036
Do you think this is a joke?

575
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,538
- Sir.
- Stop messing around.

576
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,497
Calm down.

577
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,172
Hand me the thread and needle.

578
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,182
Hey, old man. Hang on a second.

579
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,768
Are you sure about this?

580
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,606
Did you stitch up
Prosecutor Go like that too?

581
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,950
Her neck?

582
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,041
Well...

583
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,168
I don't remember exactly.

584
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:03,924
I didn't follow the exact same steps
for every murder.

585
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,135
Hey, do it right!

586
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,180
You didn't leave any suture marks
on Prosecutor Go's body.

587
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,058
Hey, you bastard.
Do you think this is a play...

588
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,186
where he follows a script?

589
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,356
Get out, you prick.

590
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,983
Get out. Get the hell out of here.

591
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,151
I'm sorry, sir.

592
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,823
Hey, old man. You may continue.

593
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,956
I didn't stitch up Go Se-yeon.

594
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,250
Are you sure?

595
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,254
I did not stitch her up.

596
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,548
I'm sure of it.

597
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,433
You despicable monster!
You piece of trash!

598
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,103
You evil monster!

599
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,521
You piece of trash!

600
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,190
- How could you kill her?
- You're a monster!

601
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,192
- You're human trash!
- You scumbag!

602
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,379
- Mr. Go!
- Dong-cheol!

603
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,339
- Mr. Go! I'm sorry.
- Dong-cheol!

604
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,632
- Mr. Go!
- Are you okay?

605
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,759
Mr. Go, please don't do this.

606
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,680
I know how you feel.

607
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,723
Okay?

608
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,017
Mr. Go, I completely understand.

609
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,354
Please come with me.

610
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,776
- Get in.
- Oh, just a second.

611
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,863
I really need to use the restroom.

612
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,782
What the hell did you just say?
Can't you see what's going on?

613
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,452
- Just get in.
- Don't be like this.

614
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,662
Do murderers not have the right
to urinate?

615
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,581
I, too, have rights.

616
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,916
Shall I take a piss right here?

617
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,087
If people write about it
with a nice photo,

618
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,506
it'll cause quite a stir.

619
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,051
Follow me.

620
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,095
Hurry the hell up.

621
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,488
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

622
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,031
No.

623
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,658
I'm a man. This is nothing.

624
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,368
The ice will make the swelling go down.

625
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,669
I would love

626
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,881
to drink with you,

627
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,843
but I should stay focused
and alert on a day like this.

628
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,262
Please drink

629
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,973
on my behalf,

630
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,684
and when you go home...

631
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,090
Oh Yeong-cheol.

632
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,928
Oh Yeong-cheol, let's go!

633
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,181
What the hell?

634
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:40,849
Oh Yeong-cheol.

635
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,854
Oh Yeong-cheol! Hey!

636
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,106
Hey!

637
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,945
Shit, I'm screwed. Hey, Oh Yeong-cheol!

638
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,488
Hey, Oh Yeong-cheol.

639
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,615
Hey! Oh Yeong-cheol! Wake up.

640
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,784
Oh Yeong-cheol! Is anybody there?

641
00:42:59,118 --> 00:42:59,952
Hey.

642
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,460
We're so screwed.
Oh Yeong-cheol took some pills.

643
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,629
What? Then we should call an ambulance--

644
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,755
Think, will you?

645
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,299
Do you want our chief to get fired?

646
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,594
We can't call an ambulance
in front of all these reporters.

647
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,098
Our patrol car is parked
in the back alley.

648
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,392
- Let's move him there for now.
- Let's do that.

649
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,476
We should hurry.

650
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,647
- This way, sir.
- Hurry.

651
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,234
Help me lay him down.

652
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,617
- I'll take him to the closest hospital.
- Okay. Hold on.

653
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,328
I'm a detective from the Investigation
Team in Dongbu Police Station.

654
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,495
I'll be right behind you.

655
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,080
Let's go.

656
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,226
- Here they come!
- They're coming out!

657
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,519
Where is Oh Yeong-cheol?

658
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,979
Is the reenactment over?

659
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,315
- Where is Oh Yeong-cheol?
- Where is the suspect?

660
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,733
- Detective!
- Where is he?

661
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,777
- What's going on?
- Is the reenactment really over?

662
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,446
- Which hospital is it?
- Hyeongju Hospital, sir.

663
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,447
- Step on it.
- Yes, sir.

664
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,616
- Please tell us!
- Is it really over?

665
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,099
Is there a long-stay patient here
who goes by the name Jang Sun-young?

666
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,850
No.

667
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,645
You did a great job, sir.

668
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,317
Powdered soap.

669
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,279
Get me some bleach.

670
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,532
Like a laundry detergent?

671
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,617
Hey, what's going on over there
in Room 236?

672
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,289
Inmate 3851, don't cause trouble.

673
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,167
You just came out of solitary confinement,
remember?

674
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,421
- Hey.
- Yes?

675
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,380
Here.

676
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,010
Inmate 3851, you have a visitor. Come out.

677
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,729
How is your health?

678
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,028
He's very successful
with cases like these.

679
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,615
My name is Kim Yeong-hun.

680
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,370
I don't need a lawyer.

681
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,798
You know how you gave me a heads up?

682
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,301
He came and took Jang Sun-young.

683
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,596
Then suddenly, the police showed up.

684
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:09,683
I tried to stop them the best I could,
but I don't know if it--

685
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,018
There's no need

686
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,645
to work so hard for me anymore.

687
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,191
You've done more than enough.

688
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,109
I only

689
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,070
want to return the favor.

690
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,157
You killed my father for me--

691
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,366
I killed him

692
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,160
for you?

693
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,925
I don't murder people for others.

694
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,260
I only gave what

695
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,223
that wife-beating, drunk bastard deserved,

696
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,185
and made him pay for being rude to me.

697
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,187
It's just that

698
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,315
the bastard happened to be your father.

699
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,490
It doesn't matter why you did it.

700
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,494
I killed him hundreds of times in my head,
but was unable to carry it out,

701
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,870
but you did it for me.

702
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,832
When that bastard died, I was thankful.

703
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:16,833
That's all.

704
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,963
Please call me if you ever need me.

705
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,381
I'll do anything for you.

706
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,927
If that's how you feel,

707
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,597
I guess I could use your help...

708
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,602
one last time.

709
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,938
As you asked,

710
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,024
I got you a place
where no one will find you,

711
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,904
but I couldn't really understand
what you said.

712
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,824
What do you mean you'll be "reborn"?

713
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:53,120
There's something I must do
before I'm reborn.

714
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,458
Please take me to Seoul.

715
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,719
Are we home? I'm so tired.

716
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,639
Aren't you getting out?
Come in and have dinner.

717
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,975
- No, I'm too tired.
- Okay.

718
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,188
- Hey, give us a minute.
- What? Why?

719
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,902
Why are you whispering in front of me?

720
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,572
- Aren't you coming?
- Go inside.

721
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,074
- You want me to go?
- Yes, go ahead.

722
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,202
- I'm really going, okay?
- Sure, I'll be right there.

723
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,749
How annoying! What's that about?

724
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,377
The crime scene reenactment
with Oh Yeong-cheol

725
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,378
was on the news today.

726
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,007
I thought she might take it hard
if she finds out.

727
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,802
Make sure she doesn't see
the news or papers today.

728
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,471
I took care of it all day.

729
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,931
It's your turn now, okay?

730
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,266
Thank you.

731
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,352
See you.

732
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,519
Get home safely.

733
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,072
Wait up, Se-yeon!

734
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,240
Why is he calling for me?

735
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,160
It looked like they could spend all day
whispering to each other.

736
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,373
Oh my gosh!

737
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,958
You're ugly.

738
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,960
Me?

739
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,962
- I said, wait up.
- You're ugly.

740
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,423
Why are you out here?

741
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,300
A present for my princess.

742
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,469
But...

743
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,596
Here.

744
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,431
For me?

745
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,725
Didn't you make this for Hee-jin?

746
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,228
This guy is handsome.

747
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,941
- This girl is...
- Pretty, right?

748
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,152
She's uglier than my princess.

749
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,449
My prince, you should meet my princess--

750
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,202
Ma'am.

751
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,871
He's mine.

752
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,417
No! He belongs to my princess!

753
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,551
Mom? Mom!

754
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,885
Princess!

755
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,056
Hey.

756
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,809
Am I yours?

757
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,896
You know what I meant.
You should go to the princess.

758
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,857
- Really?
- Sure.

759
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,942
- I'm really going, okay?
- Go ahead.

760
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,360
I'm not going anywhere.

761
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,658
What's wrong with you?

762
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,536
- Why are you acting so strange these days?
- Am I yours?

763
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,705
- What's wrong with you?
- Wait up!

764
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,752
Why didn't you pick up?
I was worried sick.

765
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,211
My phone died.

766
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,883
I was so exhausted,
following her around all day.

767
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,470
She always wore the same, boring clothes

768
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,805
regardless of the season,

769
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,099
and now she suddenly
wants to shop all day?

770
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,976
Don't get me started.

771
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,354
You know the money you gave her?
I bet she'll spend it all within a month.

772
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,190
I guarantee it.

773
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,275
Hey... Aren't you going to take a shower?

774
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,403
I will, later on.
What's the matter with you?

775
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,405
Why are you hiding the remote
in your pocket?

776
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,866
Give it back.
I didn't see the news all day.

777
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,118
It won't kill you to skip it for a day.
It's okay.

778
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,411
It's not okay.

779
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,538
Besides, I don't have a TV in my room.

780
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,248
You have plenty of fun things
to do though.

781
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,708
Like what?

782
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,502
Let's do something fun in your room.

783
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,086
I don't have a TV in there.

784
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,256
I want to watch TV. I like watching TV.

785
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,467
TV's no fun. Let's go inside.

786
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,184
"Then who did this to you?"

787
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,395
Hey, hand me the next one. Hurry!

788
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,064
- I'm not finished yet.
- Come on...

789
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,359
You read the whole series already.
Just skim through it.

790
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,986
It's not your first time, either
Be patient.

791
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,448
You have a long way to go.

792
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,246
Hey...

793
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,374
What's this? This is so old!

794
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,167
Does it still work?

795
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,006
It still works!

796
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,801
Even the song's from back in the days!

797
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:21,304
Of course, it works.
I still charge it weekly to listen to it.

798
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,765
I think the songs back then
were much better.

799
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,142
Hey, do you want to listen with me?

800
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,546
- Hey, get out.
- What?

801
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,298
Get out.

802
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,091
- Let me finish this one.
- I said, get out!

803
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,759
The sun is down

804
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,511
and we're in an enclosed area.

805
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,763
I don't think we should be alone in here.

806
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,224
Our relationship isn't the same
as it used to be.

807
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,937
- Isn't that why we should stay together?
- Hey, wait a minute!

808
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,106
- I'm not leaving.
- What's wrong with you?

809
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:16,568
When did you get so bold and stuff?

810
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,361
Get out, it's my room!

811
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,279
Min?

812
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,407
Cha Min?

813
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,036
Min?

814
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,668
Cha Min?

815
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,546
Min?

816
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,548
IT'S MY MOM

817
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,675
YOUR MOM?

818
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,679
SHOULDN'T YOU GO OUT?
SHE'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

819
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,598
NO WAY.
MY MOM DOESN'T KNOW THIS ROOM EXISTS.

820
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,811
THEN WHAT DO WE DO, JUST STAY HERE?

821
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,980
BESIDES, I NEED TO PEE

822
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,317
I'M SURE SHE'LL LEAVE SOON

823
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,986
Where did he go? He was right here...

824
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,696
- She's leaving.
- Is she?

825
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,576
Hello?

826
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,454
Hi, Ms. Lee. What's up?

827
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,081
What?

828
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,042
Ms. Choe said that nonsense to you?

829
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,463
And you believe her?

830
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:25,804
You know how she likes to gossip.

831
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,309
Don't mind her.

832
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,687
That's exactly why I keep away from her.

833
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,356
You should be careful, too.

834
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,568
I don't think that's necessary.

835
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,862
I think it's best to stay away from her.

836
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,490
Oh my gosh, really?

837
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,243
That's why you should be careful, okay?

838
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,411
She's a real bigmouth.

839
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,621
All right, try to sort things out.

840
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,959
No, actually,
there's just no need to even respond.

841
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:59,045
Don't worry. I'll give it to you
once I can get my hands on it.

842
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,714
Oh, that?

843
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,051
Did you like that?

844
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,561
What choice do I have?

845
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,730
They're all acquaintances from work.

846
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,488
You're all successful in your own field.

847
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,122
You really do have a good eye.

848
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,667
That dress? I ordered it online.

849
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,755
I can't hold it in any longer.

850
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,382
I really need to go. I'm serious.

851
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,552
I kept this place a secret
for more than 20 years!

852
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,095
I'm going to die.

853
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,599
Yes, that's right.

854
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,853
- Yes?
- We should be on our way, ma'am.

855
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,938
Is it that late already?

856
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,941
Ms. Lee, I'm going to Japan today.

857
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,527
Let's continue where we left off
the next time we meet.

858
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,738
Okay, bye.

859
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,411
She left!

860
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,794
Damn it. I need some water.

861
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,064
Who talks on the phone for that long?

862
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,108
Your mother's unbelievable.

863
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:45,443
Aren't you hungry? Should we grab a bite?

864
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:51,074
Not at all.
I almost developed claustrophobia.

865
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,034
I couldn't care less for food.

866
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,829
I just want some fresh air right now.

867
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,123
I'm going for a walk.

868
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,583
All right, but don't be long.
I'll make some pasta.

869
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,960
Will you? Okay.

870
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,630
I'm going to listen to this
during my walk.

871
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,891
- Hello?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

872
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,268
I'm at home.

873
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,145
Are you with Prosecutor Go?

874
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,604
Yes, she's here.

875
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,023
Make sure she doesn't leave the house,
okay?

876
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,776
What's going on?

877
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,779
Oh Yeong-cheol has escaped.

878
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,289
I didn't tell him to do this!

879
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,381
<i>You won't be able to take care of it
on your own.</i>

880
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,925
<i>Your dad will take care of it</i>

881
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,677
<i>like I did last time.</i>

882
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,933
All right, don't worry about it.

883
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,143
I'll stay by her side.

884
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,118
Se-yeon! Go Se-yeon!

885
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,122
Right, she's listening to music.

886
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,998
That bastard, Oh Yeong-cheol,
will try to kill us again.

887
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,250
- I can't take it. Sleep with me.
- What?

888
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,209
If we stay apart,

889
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,295
it'll double the danger, right?

890
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,754
Protect me, my ass.

891
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,673
He wouldn't even know
if Oh Yeong-cheol took me.

892
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,174
So what's your plan?

893
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,676
<i>My mom is missing.</i>

894
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,052
<i>I'm going to lure that bitch in</i>

895
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,138
<i>and die with her.</i>

896
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,849
Please do it well like last time.

897
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,226
<i>I promise I won't put Se-yeon in danger,</i>

898
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,144
<i>so don't worry.</i>

899
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,437
<i>You keep showing up</i>

900
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,440
<i>in the most unexpected places,
Prosecutor Seo.</i>

901
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,487
