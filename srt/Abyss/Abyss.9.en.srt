1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,091
- Here comes Se-yeon on the bus!
- It's Se-yeon!

2
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,635
- Se-yeon!
- Se-yeon!

3
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,721
Move back, you jerk!

4
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,098
Hey, she's Go Se-yeon,
the goddess of Sangmok High School.

5
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,684
I'm not handsome enough for her.
Do you think you are?

6
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,561
You ugly moron. Know your place!

7
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,104
- Se-yeon!
- Se-yeon!

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,981
Go Se-yeon!

9
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,776
- Come on.
- Seriously?

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,236
- There she is!
- There's Go Se-yeon!

11
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,948
GO SE-YEON

12
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,627
Let me carry your bag.

13
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,296
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

14
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,090
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

15
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,676
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

16
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,138
- Go Se-yeon!
- I love you, Go Se-yeon!

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,973
Let's go.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,019
What a long line.

19
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,355
- It's Se-yeon!
- Gosh, it's her!

20
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,234
- It's Se-yeon!
- Could you make way?

21
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,610
Hello.

22
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,530
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

23
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,866
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

24
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,577
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

25
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,287
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

26
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,747
- You're here.
- Hey.

27
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,041
I didn't know what you'd like.

28
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,836
Today...

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,256
- I'm craving a red bean bun.
- Okay.

30
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,341
Se-yeon, we have P.E. next period.
We have to hurry.

31
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,552
Really? Okay. Thanks.

32
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,595
Okay. Enjoy your bun.

33
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,640
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

34
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,183
- Go Se-yeon!
- Go Se-yeon!

35
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,608
- You're out.
- She gets good grades.

36
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,402
And she's pretty as hell.

37
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,822
Seriously. How annoying.

38
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,615
I know.

39
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,327
Look at her body. Is that for real?
What doesn't she have?

40
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm with you on that.

41
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,789
I'm so jealous.

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,805
You're dead meat.

43
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,606
Step back!

44
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,539
You're all out. Out of the box.

45
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,054
Se-yeon, watch out!

46
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,694
You animal! You pervert!

47
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,156
I was just trying to protect you
from getting hurt. It was an accident.

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,866
What? Accident, my foot!

49
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,493
Hey, Cha Min.

50
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,120
You must have forgotten your place
because I've been nice to you.

51
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,249
You're Cha Min and I'm Go Se-yeon.

52
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,543
I'm Go Se-yeon,
the goddess of Sangmok High School.

53
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,754
I'm smart. I'm beautiful.
And I have a hot body.

54
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,547
I'm Go Se-yeon, the perfect ten. Got that?

55
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,383
Yes, I know that. But I was...

56
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,302
If you know that, how dare you kiss...

57
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,513
You kissed...

58
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,558
This is ridiculous. It seriously is.
I can't believe this is happening.

59
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,519
You know what? I've had enough.

60
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,104
You made the first move on me.

61
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,648
- What?
- You said,

62
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,651
"It was more of a suggestion.
Can I kiss you?"

63
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,486
You looked at me with those doe eyes

64
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,364
and shoved your lips on mine.

65
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,826
- No, I didn't do that.
- Besides, Se-yeon,

66
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,788
take a good look at you and me right now.

67
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,506
Do I still look like
that ugly Cha Min from before?

68
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,429
Min!

69
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:06,931
Out of my way!

70
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,476
You're so handsome!

71
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,813
You're so handsome!

72
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,487
Go Se-yeon!

73
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,906
- You have a crush on me now! Got that?
- What?

74
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,242
You've humiliated me
for the last 30 years!

75
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,494
Get a taste of your own medicine!

76
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,421
This can't be.

77
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,590
This doesn't make sense.

78
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,342
This can't be right. There's no way!
This can't be!

79
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,136
This can't be right!

80
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,596
This can't be right!

81
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,309
Hey, Se-yeon. Are you all right?

82
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,894
What?

83
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,612
What's happening?

84
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,238
Am I still dreaming?

85
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,948
Did you have a nightmare?

86
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,911
Hey, move aside. Out of my way.

87
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,539
Damn it!

88
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,710
- Gosh, look at you sweating.
- Stop it. Stop touching me like that!

89
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,547
Why did you have to come back
to life with a... Damn it!

90
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,258
- What are you talking about?
- Whatever!

91
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,177
You came back
to life with a handsome face.

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,514
You totally ruined my life! I'm so doomed!

93
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,848
Get out!

94
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,101
Come out and eat.

95
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,229
Get out!

96
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,315
What a stupid dream.

97
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,318
EPISODE 9

98
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,658
Thank you.

99
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,952
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal, Min.

100
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,541
What about Hee-jin?

101
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,127
My mom called her to the main house.
She'll probably eat there.

102
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,297
Why did I have
to have such a stupid dream?

103
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,191
No, not now.

104
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,943
What are you thinking?

105
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,781
Do I still look like
that ugly Cha Min from before?

106
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,244
Min!

107
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,496
Out of my way!

108
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,998
You're so handsome!

109
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,291
You're so handsome!

110
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,792
Go Se-yeon!

111
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,545
- You have a crush on me now! Got that?
- What?

112
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,338
You've humiliated me
for the last 30 years!

113
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,591
Get a taste of your own medicine!

114
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,346
<i>Get a taste of your own medicine!</i>

115
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,223
I can't let that happen!

116
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,267
You startled me.

117
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,811
What on earth has gotten into you?

118
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,771
Are you sick or something?

119
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,942
Hey, Min. There's something
I must go over with you at this point.

120
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,110
Listen.

121
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,281
Don't assume that I like you or something

122
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,826
because of what happened yesterday...

123
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,872
What was that? Don't smile like that.

124
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,334
No. What we did yesterday
was more like a peck. A peck.

125
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,420
It was a simple kiss on the lips
to say goodnight or something.

126
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,422
Don't get the idea

127
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,925
that I like you more than a friend

128
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,761
or that I have romantic feelings for you.
Got that?

129
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,222
Okay, I got it. I don't think that way.

130
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,766
Right. You know me, don't you?

131
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,268
I used to be the goddess
of Sangmok High School--

132
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,063
The goddess, Go Se-yeon.
Of course, I know that.

133
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,274
That's right. As you know very well,

134
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,527
I'm not that kind of woman

135
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,862
who can love just one guy.

136
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,490
I'm an object of everyone's love.

137
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,909
That's who I am. Did you get that?

138
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,328
Yes, I understand. Eat some food now.

139
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,413
You should help yourself.

140
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,082
I am not hungry.

141
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,220
<i>My first kiss with Se-yeon.</i>

142
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,721
<i>Adding a heart.</i>

143
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,723
SAVE

144
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,894
This is so delicious.

145
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,234
What? You haven't left yet?

146
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,487
No. I'll drop you off
since it's close to my company.

147
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,031
And your mom was discharged
from the hospital.

148
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,366
I should go say hello, at least.

149
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,369
Get in.

150
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,288
Okay.

151
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,710
<i>Why is he so dressed up?</i>

152
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,479
<i>Crap.</i>

153
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,232
<i> Why am I getting so thirsty today?</i>

154
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,527
<i>Get a grip, Go Se-yeon.</i>

155
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,572
<i>Since when did you get nervous
about being alone with Min?</i>

156
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:20,161
<i>I love you</i>

157
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,374
<i>Seriously?</i>

158
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,794
<i>It was just one kiss.
Why is he setting the mood?</i>

159
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,880
<i>Heart, stop pounding.</i>

160
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,718
Should I turn on the AC? Your face is--

161
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,136
No! That's okay.

162
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,263
I'm fine. Don't mind me.

163
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,223
I'm okay.

164
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,310
By the way, why did you dress up today?

165
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,690
I want to make a good impression today.

166
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,111
Hey, if you keep this up,
you're going to make this awkward--

167
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,946
I have a meeting with stockholders.

168
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,366
What?

169
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,202
Everyone is dying to destroy me.

170
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,163
So I dressed up to show who the boss is.

171
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,250
I see.

172
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,504
You dressed to kill today.

173
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:15,466
Even your arms are ready
to crush them today.

174
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,597
Hey, change the song. Damn it.

175
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,522
PERSONAL INFORMATION
LEE MI-DO

176
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,860
Surely, she's lacking in many ways,

177
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,114
but if Min is happy with her,
she seems adequate.

178
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,116
But there's one more thing.

179
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,077
She had been in a very long relationship.

180
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,996
They broke up before going abroad,
but they dated for a decade.

181
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,457
That's not important. It's in the past.

182
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,668
A lawyer is much better
than a gold digger.

183
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,921
As long as I can get rid of Jang Hee-jin,

184
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,715
her long-term relationship in the past
won't be a problem.

185
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,055
Mother, may I come in?

186
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,724
You may leave.

187
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,644
Come in.

188
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,864
I heard you never went to
the clinic appointments I booked for you.

189
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,367
Well, there's a clinic I go to.

190
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,829
Until when will you deceive Min and me?

191
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,833
Do you think

192
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,378
I'm making a wild guess here?

193
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,799
I've already looked into the clinic
you go to.

194
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,971
I won't speak any longer.
Get out of the house now.

195
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,558
Mother, I have my reasons--

196
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,645
Stop calling me Mother.

197
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,106
How did you seduce my son--

198
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,442
- I can't.
- What?

199
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,654
I can't leave just yet.

200
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,994
Do you think I'll let you stay
if you say no?

201
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,704
Must I make this difficult--

202
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,414
Do you think I've been
just lounging around

203
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,166
for the time I've been here?

204
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,420
I know one or two stories that will hurt

205
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,214
Lan Cosmetics.

206
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,593
Instead of having a ticking bomb like me
roam around the streets,

207
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,470
wouldn't you feel more at ease

208
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,931
if I stayed under your shadow?

209
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,975
What kind of--

210
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,018
Oh, right.

211
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,064
Min already knows that I'm not pregnant.

212
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,149
Despite that, he loves me.

213
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,944
Don't waste your energy on me.

214
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,322
Hey!

215
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,332
<i>I can't leave yet.</i>

216
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,376
<i>Whatever it takes,</i>

217
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,797
<i>I must stay here until I find Mom.</i>

218
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,569
Tae-jin.

219
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,071
What did you say?

220
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,116
Tae-jin.

221
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,326
Please call Tae-jin.

222
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,914
My gosh, you poor thing.

223
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,001
What should I do with you?

224
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,253
You should let him go now.

225
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,965
You can't keep asking for your dead child.
That's no way to live.

226
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,425
He's not dead.

227
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,094
Tae-jin is not dead.

228
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,348
Please call Tae-jin.

229
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,850
- What am I going to do?
- Please.

230
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,685
Get a grip, would you?

231
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,854
Poor thing. What should I do?

232
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,398
- Please call Tae-jin.
- Oh, dear.

233
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,649
Goodness.

234
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,159
- Prosecutor Seo.
- Detective Lee. What brings you here?

235
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,036
I was in the area, so I dropped by.

236
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,370
You've been well, right?

237
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,915
Look at you. You look much better now.

238
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,084
We should grab soju
with Detective Park some other day.

239
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,879
- I'd love to. Please call me.
- Sure.

240
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,422
See you.

241
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,677
Detective Lee.

242
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,638
Yes?

243
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,098
About the Dogeon-dong
Golden Palace Murder Case.

244
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,017
Isn't Jongno Station
in charge of that case?

245
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,852
Yes. Why do you...

246
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,775
Did Detective Park tell you, too?

247
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,490
<i>I don't know what he's up to these days,</i>

248
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,743
<i>but he came to the station a few days ago
and asked for a ridiculous favor.</i>

249
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,120
- Hey, Dong-gyu.
- Hey, Dong-cheol.

250
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,789
- Are you busy?
- Yes. What is it?

251
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,791
You don't seem busy. Grab coffee with me.

252
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,501
- No, I can't.
- It will only take a minute.

253
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,919
- Let's go.
- Come on.

254
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,837
What is this about?

255
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,384
So what?

256
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,679
Are you telling me there was
a murder at Golden Palace or not?

257
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,931
If so, that's our station's case.
Why are you butting in?

258
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,850
You're so dense.
I said, there was no murder.

259
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,853
This is my case,
but I'm asking your station to take over.

260
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,064
Why do I have to pretend

261
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,400
that there was murder when there wasn't?

262
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,486
- We set up the scene...
- Go on.

263
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,489
It's a sting operation.

264
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,661
- Don't laugh. Stop.
- Okay.

265
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,997
You just need to keep this in mind.

266
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,625
If someone calls and asks
about the Golden Palace Case,

267
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,753
and if this person gives you another tip
regarding the case

268
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,463
or asks to identify the deceased,

269
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,173
then you should call me right away.

270
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,883
- Got it.
- Got it?

271
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,886
Forget about having someone
come forward to identify the deceased.

272
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,681
There hasn't been a single person
asking about the case.

273
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,019
So I thought that Dong-cheol
got a bad lead or something.

274
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,527
LEE MI-DO

275
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,409
She fooled me.

276
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,831
That's typical of Go Se-yeon.

277
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,379
I wonder where she's hiding now.

278
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,930
WE'RE CLOSING DOWN
SE-YEON FRIED CHICKEN

279
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,017
I can't close down our diner.

280
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,063
If you want to close it down,
you'll have to divorce me first.

281
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,774
I told you to rest at home.
Why are you causing a fuss?

282
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,525
You know what this diner means to us.

283
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,360
We can't close it down.

284
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,820
Our dear Se-yeon...

285
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,407
Se-yeon got a loan for this diner
after she became a prosecutor.

286
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,618
So how can I close it down?

287
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,578
We must go on with our lives.

288
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,455
Until when will we mourn for her?

289
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,998
Please...

290
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,500
Jeong-hee.

291
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,419
The living must go on living.

292
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,964
I can't do that.

293
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,510
If you want to leave, you can leave alone.

294
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,015
SE-YEON FRIED CHICKEN

295
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,942
I don't think

296
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,862
it will be a good idea for you
to say hello today.

297
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,031
Okay.

298
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,033
Thanks for the ride. Bye.

299
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,007
SE-YEON FRIED CHICKEN

300
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,260
We're not open yet.

301
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,054
Miss!

302
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,098
Hello.

303
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,017
I came to see if you were okay.

304
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,497
I broke the window, so I should fix it.

305
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,004
Mr. Choe. Can you hire
a good interior design agency?

306
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,715
I'll text you the address.

307
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,592
Okay.

308
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,303
Mr. Choe.

309
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,471
You haven't eaten yet, right?

310
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,142
I'd like to treat our employees to lunch.

311
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,977
How many employees are there?

312
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,981
I told the detective
that I really wanted to meet you again.

313
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,609
You got hurt that day, too.

314
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,611
Are you all right?

315
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,946
Yes, I'm okay.

316
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,200
But

317
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,578
how did you know Se-yeon?

318
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,500
We were very close
when I worked at the prosecutor's office.

319
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,586
- I see. You're a prosecutor.
- Well...

320
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,464
That's why that jerk
was trying to harm you.

321
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,508
Please let me help you. Give that to me.

322
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,470
- No, it's all right.
- No, I can help.

323
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,557
I don't think you're fully recovered yet.

324
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,725
You should rest.

325
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,020
The diner should open again soon.

326
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,399
My husband wants to close it down.

327
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,486
But I can't let him do that.

328
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,738
This diner means so much to me.

329
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,408
I should get it running again.

330
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,244
Mom...

331
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,083
Since you're Se-yeon's mother,

332
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,046
may I call you Mom?

333
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,757
Sure.

334
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,429
Mom.

335
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,808
You should just listen to Dad.

336
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,937
If you stay here,
you'll only think about Se-yeon.

337
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,857
Besides, the diner isn't doing well
because of what happened here.

338
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,734
And the rent for this place is expensive.

339
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,071
I think you should just sell it
and take a break.

340
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,327
Hello, this is Se-yeon Fried Chicken.

341
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,455
Yes. We're open.

342
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,624
Around what time?

343
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,044
For how many people?

344
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,798
- Twenty people? Sure. Yes.
- Wait.

345
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,883
I'm working by myself today.
I can't serve groups.

346
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,093
You can just fry the chicken.

347
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,970
I'll take care of the hall and serve them.

348
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,346
Yes, you can.

349
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,349
Okay, I'll see you later. Thank you.

350
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,229
Should we clean up first?

351
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,239
So are you done dating him?

352
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,578
Lucky you. You must be so happy.

353
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,372
- I am.
- How did he propose? Tell me.

354
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,082
Well...

355
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,294
I knew he was going to propose
when he came to see me at my house.

356
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,420
Hello, Director Cha.

357
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,797
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

358
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,853
If I may ask,

359
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,440
do girls want
the relationship to be official?

360
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,775
Pardon?

361
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,612
Usually, yes.

362
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,655
"Usually"...

363
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,659
What kind of proposal do they want?

364
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,286
Usually?

365
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,540
I'm not sure.

366
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,006
- Are you all done?
- Yes.

367
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,091
Let's go.

368
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,343
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

369
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,469
Bye.

370
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,846
- Thank you.
- I'm ready for my bill.

371
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,642
Okay. The total bill
comes out to 364,000 won.

372
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,478
But the soda was on the house,
so that will be 340,000 won.

373
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,271
You'll pay with your card.

374
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,526
Can I make a reservation for 15 people
around the same time tomorrow?

375
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,028
Sure, of course. Hold on.

376
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,281
Could you write down your name
and your phone number, please?

377
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,199
Sure.

378
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,452
Here are your card and the receipt.

379
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,746
Thank you.

380
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,289
Bye.

381
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,208
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

382
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,880
You forgot your company ID here.

383
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,841
- Right, yes.
- Here.

384
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,800
LAN COSMETICS

385
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,593
Bye.

386
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,098
Gosh, Min.

387
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:54,975
Seriously.

388
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,605
You can stop helping me now.

389
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,732
I feel so sorry

390
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,734
I made you work
when you're Se-yeon's senior.

391
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,863
It's okay. Let me just help you
clean up here.

392
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,239
- No, come here.
- But this...

393
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,740
Come here and sit down.

394
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,450
Hold on.

395
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,787
You didn't have lunch
because you were helping me. Sit tight.

396
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,789
I'll go and fry chicken for you
right away.

397
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,958
All right. Thank you.

398
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,596
This looks good.

399
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,184
Thank you for the food.

400
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,352
There you go.

401
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,691
You eat just like Se-yeon.

402
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,068
Se-yeon ate fried chicken just like that.

403
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,532
You know,

404
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,493
I've been meaning to ask you a question.

405
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,037
Yes?

406
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,581
The culprit kept calling you Se-yeon
that night.

407
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,168
The detective told me
that he was pretending

408
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,254
to be mentally ill
in case he got arrested, but I--

409
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,925
The detective is right.
I heard that he's crazy.

410
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,260
He even says that dead people are alive.

411
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,221
After seeing one of his victims is alive,

412
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,723
he said he didn't kill her. He's gone mad.

413
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,685
Is that so?

414
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,562
Yes.

415
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,610
It'd be rude to ask you to visit often
when you're busy, right?

416
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,364
Maybe it's because
you were close with Se-yeon...

417
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,992
Appearance-wise,
you look nothing like her,

418
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,663
but strangely,
I feel like you're my daughter.

419
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,003
Mom.

420
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,005
Well...

421
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm sorry.

422
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,721
Hello?

423
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,308
Go on. Did you catch him?

424
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,228
<i>Well, we did, but...</i>

425
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,774
Are you sure it was suicide?

426
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,444
We'll know more
when we receive the autopsy results,

427
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,988
but there was no sign of a struggle

428
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,365
or anything that indicates foul play.

429
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,702
You saw how he came at me with a knife.
He's quite bold.

430
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:22,247
He's not the type to commit suicide
after suddenly being overwhelmed by guilt.

431
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,873
So for him to take his own life--

432
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,752
He's been in a pile of debt
after investing in virtual money.

433
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,629
He was under police investigation

434
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,257
and loan sharks pressured him.
He must've wanted to die.

435
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,926
He wrote in his will that he was hired

436
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,803
- to murder you at Golden Palace.
- What?

437
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,139
After doing the deed,
his life felt insignificant, so...

438
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,433
Hold on. He was a hired gun?

439
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,644
That means Oh Yeong-cheol
called the shots,

440
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,063
but he's in prison, so how--

441
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,107
The hit is actually more plausible

442
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,818
because it's easier
to make connections in prison.

443
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,071
Also, Oh Yeong-cheol knows
that you're not dead.

444
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,241
Is this the guy
who abducted Hee-jin's mother, then?

445
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,161
The phone used to contact Hee-jin
was found in his car.

446
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,164
It's him, Mi-do. I mean, Ms. Go.

447
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,798
Hee-jin.

448
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:19,054
Is it true that my mom's abductor
committed suicide?

449
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,390
That's what they say, but I don't think--

450
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,725
That's not what's important!

451
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,645
He's the only one who
knows Mom's whereabouts. If he dies,

452
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,148
how are we supposed to find her?

453
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,649
Where the hell is she?

454
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,985
Hold on.

455
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,738
We're tracking his past whereabouts

456
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,741
and working nonstop
to locate your mother--

457
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,535
I'm sure this was a murder.
The real culprits are tying up loose ends.

458
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,662
If he committed suicide over guilt,

459
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,831
then why didn't he tell her
where her mother is?

460
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,708
It doesn't add up.

461
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,919
Choe Gi-hun was used

462
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,921
and then killed
by Oh Yeong-cheol's accomplice.

463
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,716
That's not the case.
Why do you keep insisting?

464
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,857
I did as you instructed.

465
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,276
So you'll help me to not
be found guilty in return, right?

466
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,029
Are you sure you told me everything?

467
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,741
I told you everything.
I did everything you told me to.

468
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,161
If I had known about your mistake sooner,

469
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,789
I would've kept you alive longer.

470
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,765
Yes, Prosecutor Seo.

471
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,436
I met Detective Lee
who works at Jongno Police Station.

472
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,648
<i>He told me about your sting operation,
but I don't see a report on my desk.</i>

473
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,525
Oh, that.

474
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,112
I'm chasing a lead of my own, you see.

475
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,488
Is that Ji-uk?

476
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,865
<i>Prosecutor Seo?</i>

477
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,619
<i>If it's okay with you, can I explain it
to you tomorrow in person?</i>

478
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,873
All right.

479
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,918
We haven't gotten together in a while,
so let's have lunch.

480
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,420
Sure thing.

481
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,965
What was that? What did he want?

482
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,260
He asked about the sting operation
we're carrying out.

483
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,180
Working with the idiot Dong-gyu
gets you nowhere.

484
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,931
Why did he tell Prosecutor Seo?

485
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,517
We should go together.
I'll help explain things.

486
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,895
No, it's all right. I can take care of it.

487
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,021
There's no need to worry.

488
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,984
Dong-gyu, that useless prick.

489
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,252
I hope Se-yeon will like this.

490
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,139
Were you three out together?

491
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,561
Why don't you come inside for some tea?

492
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,898
It's all right.
I should get back to the station.

493
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,192
- I'll call you.
- Thanks. Good job, today.

494
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,318
Good night.

495
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,113
What's up with Hee-jin?

496
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,116
- Where were you three?
- At the NFS.

497
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,370
Remember the man we assumed
as the accomplice with Oh Yeong-cheol?

498
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,996
The one who abducted Hee-jin's mom.

499
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,123
The guy who stabbed you and ran away?

500
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,458
What happened? Was he caught?

501
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,795
Yes, but he committed suicide.

502
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,089
- Suicide?
- Yes.

503
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,676
It doesn't seem likely, though.

504
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,177
He's not the type to kill himself.

505
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,138
Besides, if he had killed himself
over guilt,

506
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,558
he could've told us
where we could find Hee-jin's mom.

507
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,767
It doesn't make any sense.

508
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,894
I think he was just a loose end

509
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,523
and Oh Yeong-cheol's accomplice
who called the shots is still out there.

510
00:30:59,107 --> 00:30:59,983
You're right.

511
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,609
It definitely doesn't add up.

512
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,655
No wonder she's upset.

513
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,075
Yes, I think we should keep her company.

514
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,535
Okay.

515
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,499
Seriously? Have you no manners?

516
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,669
You can't park your car like this
just because this is your house.

517
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,589
- Well...
- Unbelievable.

518
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,675
<i>This isn't the right time
to tell her how I feel.</i>

519
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,304
- Hey!
- Right, I was just about to move it.

520
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,893
Yes, Mr. Park.

521
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,147
Oh, that? Just authorize
what the Business Planning Team suggested.

522
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,149
Sure thing.

523
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,360
Didn't you receive the file?

524
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,031
I'll send it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

525
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,576
No, I'll take care of that.

526
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,369
Sure.

527
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,705
I'll...

528
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,468
Mr. Park, I'm afraid
something just came up.

529
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,345
I'll call you back later.

530
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,394
My baby...

531
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,812
Look what happened to you.

532
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,323
It's not a big deal.
I'm sure you can rub it off...

533
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,658
I guess not.

534
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,868
You have car polish, right?

535
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,120
Apply some of that

536
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,873
and rub it with a cloth.
It'll be long gone.

537
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,959
You have some in your trunk, right?

538
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,461
- No, not the trunk! Wait!
- Where's is it?

539
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,380
- What's all this?
- It's nothing.

540
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,133
What do you mean?
It looks like something to me.

541
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,552
Hey, do you need my help?

542
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,305
Are you good? Excuse me. Hold on.

543
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,599
This isn't how I want to do it,

544
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,353
- so let's head inside.
- You have balloons in your car.

545
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,897
How can I pretend not to have seen them?
Let me see.

546
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,482
- Let me see. That hurts!
- Hold on. Move!

547
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,694
- I want my keys back.
- Sure. Let's go.

548
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,445
Let's head inside.

549
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,324
- Look!
- Seriously! Se-yeon, stop it.

550
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,617
- Hold on!
- Hey.

551
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,620
I won't ask nicely again.

552
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,789
All right, fine.

553
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,751
How can I hand over the keys
when you're grabbing my hands? Let go.

554
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,295
If I let go,
you'll jet open the trunk again.

555
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,672
- Fine, I won't.
- I'm exhausted.

556
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,008
There. I'll let go of them.

557
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,138
Wait, the rear-view camera!

558
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,269
Do you really think
my mother was caught on tape?

559
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,731
If she weren't, then her abductor

560
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,066
would truly be an expert
on making things disappear.

561
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,986
Damn it. Where did they go?

562
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,617
Hey, look. Isn't that the car?

563
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,752
They looked everywhere,
but there's no body.

564
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,381
He vanished from right under our noses,

565
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,259
which means that
he escaped through a path...

566
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,137
we couldn't see or think of.

567
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,765
Then the car explosion

568
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,769
might have been staged
so that it could distract us.

569
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,687
That's possible.

570
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,239
Hold on.

571
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,825
Right before the tunnel exit...

572
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,789
Here. Look at this white thing.

573
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,540
What could it be?

574
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,876
Is it a glimmer of light?

575
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,503
What could it be?

576
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,964
Aren't the patient clothes
at the nursing home white?

577
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,592
Yes, they are.

578
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,891
Now that you mention it,
it does seem like a person.

579
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,645
So the answer is inside that tunnel.

580
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,898
Where did they go

581
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,567
and how did they leave the tunnel?

582
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,992
Please enjoy.

583
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,748
Have you always been left-handed?

584
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,169
I taught myself to use my right hand,
but not when it comes to eating.

585
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,839
How did you hurt your hand?
It looks uncomfortable.

586
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,724
The lights are so pretty.

587
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,697
Get out.

588
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,094
The car...

589
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,853
The car is rolling away.

590
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,104
Come back here.

591
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,737
Let go of me!

592
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,738
Come this way.

593
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,864
Let go!

594
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,500
If you don't listen to me,

595
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,087
you won't be going to a nice place.

596
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,090
Now, come with me.

597
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,648
- It's really nothing.
- I see.

598
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,737
Anyway, didn't you say
we should grab something nice to eat?

599
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,114
What's with the hangover soup?

600
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,284
We're both busy people, aren't we?

601
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,578
Besides, the food is quite nice here.
Try it.

602
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,997
I have time for delicious meals, you know.

603
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,458
So Prosecutor Seo,

604
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,587
the Golden Palace Case is something I'm--

605
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,089
I'm sure you'll take care of it.

606
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,424
You probably didn't tell me

607
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,218
because there was nothing to report.

608
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,847
Oh, right. I'm grateful
that you see it in such a way.

609
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,601
I'll write up a detailed report
once I wrap up the case.

610
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,894
Sure thing.

611
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,481
That's one hell of a hangover soup.

612
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,777
It's really good.

613
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,197
- About Mi-do...
- Yes?

614
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,202
She said she was representing Park Gi-man
for Oh Yeong-cheol's case.

615
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,163
What does he mean? What old man?

616
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,166
The old man who Park Gi-man assaulted?

617
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,086
- No, it's--
- Mi-do used to work with us,

618
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,338
but she left our office
quite some time ago.

619
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,509
It's not appropriate to tell her
sensitive details about the case.

620
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,885
I'm not a bystander in this case.

621
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,722
I'm representing Mr. Park now.

622
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,348
I'LL TELL EVERYTHING
PLEASE HELP ME

623
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,518
Yes, she did mention that.

624
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,146
I have questions regarding the case,

625
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,065
but I forgot to get her number.

626
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,900
Do you perhaps have it?

627
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,528
Yes, I do. Do you want it?

628
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,572
Yes, please.

629
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,907
All right. I'll text you the number.

630
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,409
You can go back to your meal.

631
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,260
We'll slowly
walk through the tunnel from here.

632
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,636
Sure.

633
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,651
Where on earth could they have
disappeared to from here?

634
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,743
Maybe they walked out to the exit.

635
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,371
I think they went this way.

636
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,974
Where did they go to from here?

637
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,769
They must have gone out to that road
in order to run.

638
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,687
Let's go that way, then.

639
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,525
Water for coffee!

640
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,779
No, let me.

641
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,747
Here you go.

642
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,125
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

643
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,840
Why are you doing this?

644
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,883
Someone tells me

645
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,220
you can help me get my hands on anything.

646
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,557
What is it that you need?

647
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,059
Powdered soap.

648
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,855
Get me some bleach.

649
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,732
Like a laundry detergent?

650
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,901
Hey, what's going on over there
in Room 236?

651
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,323
I can live with everything else,

652
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,534
but I just can't stand

653
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,579
to be in dirty clothes.

654
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,414
What's going on?

655
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,335
Inmate 3851, do not cause trouble.

656
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,880
You just came out of solitary confinement,
remember?

657
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,758
- Hey.
- Yes?

658
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,718
Here.

659
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,473
Inmate 3851,

660
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,641
you have a visitor. Come out.

661
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,028
Come in.

662
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,951
Prosecutor Seo, it's about the additional
investigation on Oh Yeong-cheol's case.

663
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,329
I informed the lead detective, but he said

664
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,914
inspecting the scene is not necessary.

665
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,418
I'll call him myself, then.

666
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,254
By the way,
what did you find on that number?

667
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,881
Here you go.

668
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,674
The phone's registered owner,

669
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,384
the call log for the past month,

670
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,386
and the cell tower locations.

671
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,057
- Thank you.
- Sure.

672
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,483
REGISTERED PHONE OWNER INFORMATION
NAME: WOO MAN-SU

673
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,276
Of course.

674
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,695
She's supposed to be dead,

675
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,697
so of course she's using a burner phone.

676
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,825
Let's see where you've been hiding.

677
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,162
CELL TOWER INFORMATION

678
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,290
PARK MIN-GYU'S MOTHER

679
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,963
Hello?

680
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,298
<i>Prosecutor Seo, what do I do?</i>

681
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,592
What's going on?

682
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,973
While I was busy cooking our meal,

683
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,184
she knocked over the stew
and I think she burned herself.

684
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,395
I can't help her in any way.

685
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,025
Is the injury severe?

686
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,987
I can't tell because
she won't let me touch her.

687
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,323
- I called 911--
- No!

688
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,325
No, I...

689
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,704
I'll be right there. Call them back
and say you don't need them.

690
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,542
Where does it hurt?

691
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,795
Prosecutor Seo is on his way,

692
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,047
so hang in there, okay?

693
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,925
- Take me to the hospital!
- Okay.

694
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,344
The hospital I was in!

695
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,513
Okay, all right. We'll take you there.

696
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,057
I want to go back to the hospital!

697
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,767
All right. My goodness.

698
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,811
Just wait a little bit.

699
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,778
Hey, I don't think this is going to work.

700
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,240
Can't we find a more effective way?

701
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,160
Se-yeon.

702
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,164
Would you be able to say that
if your mom were abducted?

703
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,291
Hey.

704
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,752
I didn't say
I wasn't going to look for her.

705
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,587
I want to find her too.

706
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,381
I want to find her
and bring you guys together.

707
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,301
Besides, how many times have I told you
that I need to find your mom

708
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,261
in order to find out
who killed me as well?

709
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,514
Your mom must have seen
who the accomplice is.

710
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,643
She's right.
She's just as desperate as you are.

711
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,603
That's why we're all here.

712
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,521
Fine.

713
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,066
But we can't go back
when we've come this far.

714
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,109
Let's search a bit more.

715
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,528
How about

716
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,281
we go in there and take a short break?

717
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,408
We can ask them if anyone came by.

718
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,456
Let's go, Se-yeon.

719
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,344
Are you still open?

720
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:44,306
Sure, come on in.
You can take that table over there.

721
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,190
Be careful, it's hot.

722
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,068
Excuse me,

723
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,363
but have you seen anyone
that looks like this recently?

724
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,409
No, I haven't.

725
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,954
She must have been with some guy
and wearing a hospital gown.

726
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,956
Could you take a closer look?

727
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,462
I haven't seen her.
This is a very quiet neighborhood

728
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,923
and not many people come by here.

729
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,844
I would have remembered someone
wearing a hospital gown.

730
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,518
Honey! Come over here for a minute.

731
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,395
What is it?

732
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,314
Is there any chance you recognize her?

733
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,774
Here.

734
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,321
I don't think so. I have no idea.

735
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,324
- We don't recognize her.
- Enjoy.

736
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,784
- Thank you.
- Sorry to bother you.

737
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,119
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

738
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,875
Eat up.

739
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,960
You didn't eat anything all day.

740
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,171
Eat up before you collapse.

741
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,800
It's getting late.
Let's go home after we finish this

742
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,760
and we can come back tomorrow. Okay?

743
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,638
You should eat up first.

744
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,184
Excuse me, sir.

745
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,854
Where can we go grab a taxi?

746
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:14,855
A taxi?

747
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,356
It's too far out,

748
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,775
so you'll have to call for one.

749
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,778
Would you like me to call one for you?

750
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,156
Yes, please.

751
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,574
All right.

752
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,075
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

753
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,706
Let's eat.

754
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,005
- The taxi's here.
- Okay.

755
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,216
Give me 9,000 won.
It's 3,000 won for each person.

756
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,260
Nine thousand won, my ass.
They'll be moving in a group, anyway.

757
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,889
- Here.
- Come on!

758
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,517
You went long-distance
with a sick passenger the other day.

759
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,851
Stop talking bullshit.

760
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,938
Excuse me,
was that long-distance passenger...

761
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,648
- Was it...
- Here.

762
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,815
Was it this person?

763
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,776
She was wearing a hospital gown.

764
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,113
I think it may have been her.

765
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,752
<i>I used GPS to get to their destination,
so I still have the address.</i>

766
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:28,971
Is anyone home?

767
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,098
Anyone there?

768
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,225
- Is it empty?
- Is anyone home?

769
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,561
Excuse me...

770
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,027
Is it empty?

771
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,331
I think they just left for a while.
Let's wait for them.

772
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,835
Where in the world are you, Mom?

773
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:02,879
Hee-jin...

774
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,842
Damn it.

775
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,597
Please make sure

776
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,975
it doesn't leave a scar, Doctor.

777
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,061
Yes, ma'am.
It'll be fine if it's taken good care of.

778
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,480
It hurts.

779
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,858
He's almost finished.

780
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,277
Hang in there.

781
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,821
It hurts.

782
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,657
- Be gentle.
- I'll be gentle.

783
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:40,375
What if he sensed us coming
and took her somewhere else...

784
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:44,630
No, that can't be it.
How would he have known?

785
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:48,216
I can't just stay here like this.
I'll take a look around the area.

786
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,385
It's all mountains out there.
It's too dangerous.

787
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,763
Besides, it's too dark
so you won't be able to see anything.

788
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,222
I'll be fine. I can go on my own.

789
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,475
Let us come with you, then.
You can't go alone.

790
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,518
Wait. They might return while we're out.

791
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,646
You stay here. I'll go with her.

792
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,147
- All right.
- Let's go.

793
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,192
Be careful.

794
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,865
- Mom.
- Ms. Jang!

795
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,451
- Mom!
- Ms. Jang!

796
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,912
- Mom.
- Ms. Jang!

797
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,414
Are you okay, Hee-jin?

798
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,709
Can you get up?

799
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,300
I don't think I can, Min.

800
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,105
Hey! What happened?

801
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,524
- She slipped and sprained her ankle.
- What?

802
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:46,900
Hey...

803
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,151
Be careful.

804
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,446
Let me take a look.

805
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,951
I think we should take you to a hospital.

806
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:59,121
I'm all right. We came all the way here.
Let's wait a little longer.

807
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,330
No, let's go to the hospital.

808
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,916
We have her location,
so we can come back later.

809
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,292
Yes, let's do that.

810
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,503
- Wait here. I'll bring the car closer.
- Okay.

811
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,383
The doctor said that

812
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,385
she won't need to be hospitalized.

813
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:17,723
He said it'd be better if the wound
can be treated often for a few days.

814
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,934
It'll be hard for you to take her
to the hospital every day.

815
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,186
Staying here will be easier for you.

816
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:26,898
Prosecutor Seo.

817
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,776
I'm so sorry.

818
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,321
I don't know what to say.

819
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,448
It's all right.

820
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,909
I was the one who put you
through all this trouble.

821
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,244
I'm the one who should be sorry.

822
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,707
No, don't say that.

823
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,042
I'm sorry.

824
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:51,882
Don't be sorry.

825
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,510
- I apologize.
- You have nothing to apologize for.

826
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,014
Get well soon
if you really want to repay me.

827
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,058
Yes, sir.

828
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,354
I'll be right back
with some necessities from the store.

829
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,814
Okay.

830
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,035
Her ankle ligament is torn.

831
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,453
It's not that serious,

832
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,288
but we'll have to see
if she needs surgery.

833
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,709
She'll need a cast for now
to prevent it from getting worse

834
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,669
and also some shots.

835
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,879
All right.

836
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,256
Get her a prolotherapy shot
and shock wave therapy.

837
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,883
- Yes, Doctor.
- Thank you.

838
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:35,967
No problem.

839
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,638
I guess you'll have to suffer for a while.

840
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,640
Where's Min?

841
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,600
I think he's on the phone.

842
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:49,731
I'm sorry I lost my temper at you.

843
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,859
I don't even deserve to act that way.

844
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,947
Why are you acting weird again?

845
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,490
Just act like your normal self.

846
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,325
I'm already immune
to your temper, you know.

847
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,829
I appreciate
what you've been doing for me.

848
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,498
I'll be sure to return the favor

849
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,917
when we find my mom.

850
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,754
It's nothing!
Just focus on getting better.

851
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,590
Why did you have to get hurt
when I just got better?

852
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,884
We're taking turns
to take care of each other.

853
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,264
Are you finished?

854
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,224
Yes, I just had to rearrange
tomorrow's schedule.

855
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,394
Then you should get back home.
I'll stay overnight with Hee-jin.

856
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,812
No, I can't leave you guys.

857
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,064
I arranged for her to stay
in a private room

858
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,650
so that we can all spend the night
and go back in the morning.

859
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,026
They might be there tomorrow.

860
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,611
All right.

861
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,996
You should get some rest
when we get upstairs.

862
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,414
I'm fine.

863
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,711
I think I need some coffee.
Do you want any?

864
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,546
- No, I'm good.
- How about you?

865
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:55,755
I'm good too.

866
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,466
Really? Then take her to the ward.

867
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,219
I'll go get some coffee
and anything else we might need.

868
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,929
- You guys go ahead.
- See you.

869
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,014
Okay.

870
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,063
I'm so tired.

871
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,152
Goodness.

872
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,531
What?

873
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,452
Yes, I'd appreciate that.

874
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,581
What?

875
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,791
- It really is you.
- Mi-do!

876
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,503
I didn't think I'd run into you here.

877
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,213
What brings you here?

878
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,841
I just had some business nearby.

879
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,010
What about you?

880
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,556
I also had some business,
but my friend got hurt.

881
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:48,892
A friend?

882
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,269
Would you like some water?

883
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,229
No, I'm good.

884
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:56,232
I only bought one can of coffee.
I have to stay up all night.

885
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,528
Was your friend hospitalized?

886
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,198
Yes. How about you? Are you headed home?

887
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,450
Yes.

888
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,660
Actually,

889
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,579
someone wanted to give information
about the Oh Yeong-cheol Case,

890
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,122
so I was here to investigate.

891
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,291
Oh Yeong-cheol?

892
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,961
Someone reported that they saw
Oh Yeong-cheol's ex-wife...

893
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,254
who had been presumed to be dead
after going missing.

894
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,923
Is that so?

895
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,349
Do you think the tip is reliable?

896
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,142
Yes, it seems like so for now.

897
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,770
But I don't know if we'll be able
to communicate with her.

898
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:34,813
Why not?

899
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:38,149
According to the informant,
she's not mentally stable.

900
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,027
I think her name was Jang Sun-young.

901
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,323
- Are you coming with me?
- Yes, I'm coming with you.

902
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:03,967
I think it's that way.

903
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,766
<i>I think I found Hee-jin's mother.</i>

904
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,185
<i>I'm on my way to meet Ms. Jang
with Prosecutor Seo.</i>

905
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,520
What is she talking about?

906
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,689
Is she talking about Seo Ji-uk?

907
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,278
Se-yeon says she'll be late.

908
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,071
Let's wait for her in the ward.

909
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,960
- Princess...
- What's wrong?

910
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,420
Princess.

911
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,130
- Princess.
- What's wrong?

912
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,007
- Princess.
- It's all right.

913
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,760
- Let's go back inside.
- Princess.

914
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,845
- Let's go back inside!
- Princess!

915
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,139
- Come to your senses!
- Princess!

916
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,724
- Let's go back inside!
- Mom...

917
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:53,975
- Ms. Jang?
- Princess!

918
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,561
- What's wrong with you?
- My princess!

919
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,440
Mom!

920
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,700
Princess!

921
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,328
Princess!

922
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,376
Princess.

923
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,546
Where have you been?

924
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,970
Princess.

925
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,227
Princess.

926
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,188
"Princess"?

927
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,024
What's going on?

928
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,444
Princess.

929
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,532
I don't understand what's going on.

930
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,451
That young lady is her daughter.

931
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,371
That can't be true.

932
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,208
I heard all her children passed away.

933
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,668
No. I'm certain of it.

934
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,671
I think it's best to take her with us.

935
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,633
I'm not her guardian.

936
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:13,096
I think I'd better let the prosecutor
know about this.

937
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,974
What do I do?

938
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,559
"Prosecutor"?

939
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,729
He was the one who brought her to me,

940
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,773
so why don't you talk to him?

941
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,275
PROSECUTOR SEO JI-UK

942
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,001
Do we have to go in further?

943
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,254
I don't think there are any houses
around here.

944
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,047
We're almost there.

945
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,496
Please pick up. Please.

946
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,793
Please, Se-yeon...

947
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,673
Are you sure Ji-uk was the one
who abducted Ms. Jang?

948
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,840
Detective Park.

949
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,843
Why did you hide Ms. Jang?

950
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,929
<i>This is my secret hideout.</i>

951
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,347
<i>It's the safest place.</i>

952
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,974
For me, you're the gift.

953
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,934
Wait... Oh, gosh!

954
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,145
The weather is quite nice today.

955
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,565
Oh Yeong-cheol, let's go!

956
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,191
Oh Yeong-cheol!

957
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,401
I didn't tell him to do this!

958
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:34,529
- Hello?
<i>- Oh Yeong-cheol has escaped.</i>
