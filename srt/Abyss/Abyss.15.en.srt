1
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,800
- Good night.
- You, too.

2
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,766
Go to bed.

3
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,115
We've been using the same bed all along,

4
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,326
why is he suddenly acting like that?

5
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,289
What is it?

6
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,446
I said I'll protect you,

7
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,782
but I can't help myself.

8
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,785
Let me sleep with you.

9
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,875
Dad.

10
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,129
Dad, are you all right?

11
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,173
Yes, I'm fine.

12
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,634
- Gosh.
- I'm all right.

13
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,264
I saw this coming.

14
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,935
Why did you drink
so much when you can't handle it?

15
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,772
I wasn't going to drink this much,
but I got carried away.

16
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,816
Goodness, sit down right here.

17
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,444
Let me make honey tea for you. Okay?

18
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,363
Se-yeon.

19
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,746
Se-yeon...

20
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,082
Dad.

21
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,794
My daughter, Se-yeon.

22
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,173
Do you want some pocket money?

23
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,551
Yes, I should.

24
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,764
He's opening up his wallet
which means he's totally drunk.

25
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,975
Let me give you some pocket money.

26
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,059
I don't need it.

27
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,770
- Do you still think I'm a kid?
- No, no.

28
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,446
I really hated it when you got so drunk.

29
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,242
But I like it today.

30
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,453
I got to become your daughter again.

31
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,710
Oh, my. He's got to be kidding me.

32
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,296
Come on, you're embarrassing yourself.

33
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,630
Let me give Se-yeon some money.

34
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,466
- Sorry. He woke you up, right?
- It's okay.

35
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,218
- It's all right.
- Go back and sleep.

36
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,262
I'll help you carry him to the room.

37
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,556
- It's okay. Get up.
- Okay.

38
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,434
No, no. I need to give her
some pocket money.

39
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,019
Try to walk on your own.

40
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,230
- I must give Se-yeon money.
- For Christ's sake. Stop it.

41
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,690
- No.
- Goodness.

42
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,373
Dad.

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,710
Hang in there a bit longer.

44
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,506
I'll come back in a jiffy.

45
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,899
EPISODE 15

46
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,569
Are you up?

47
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,863
Hey. You weren't in bed.

48
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,073
Where did you go?

49
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,618
I think my dad
had too much to drink today.

50
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,703
He's not feeling well.
He threw up everything.

51
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,371
It was quite a scene.

52
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,498
Gosh.

53
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,501
I'm sleepy.

54
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,844
But you know what? My dad got drunk

55
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,180
and mistook me for Se-yeon.

56
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,100
That actually felt good.

57
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,854
Wait, no. I am Go Se-yeon.

58
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,111
I keep forgetting my old face.

59
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,905
- Are you okay with it?
- What do you mean?

60
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,449
The way I look right now.

61
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,703
It doesn't matter what you look like.
You're still the same Se-yeon to me.

62
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,413
Really?

63
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,959
Even if I get old like Oh Yeong-cheol
and turn into an old lady?

64
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,795
Even if your face changes 1,000 times,
I'll still find you.

65
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,384
You only said that because you know

66
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,262
that I'll always have this face
no matter how many times I change.

67
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,514
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

68
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,497
You're up.

69
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,916
Yes. Why did you wake up so early?

70
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,501
I went out for some fresh air.

71
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,962
Get some more sleep.
I'll wake you up later.

72
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,133
- Wake me up later.
- Go to sleep.

73
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,050
Okay.

74
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,642
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?

75
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,227
Yes. How are you feeling?

76
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,396
- I feel--
- As for breakfast...

77
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,322
Wait.

78
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,457
What about your husband?

79
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,169
He's in a bad mood all of a sudden.
He said he won't eat breakfast.

80
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,088
This is our last day here.

81
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,132
It would've been nice
to show our appreciation

82
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,759
while having a meal with you.

83
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,594
Why don't you stay here a little longer?

84
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,055
No, that's okay.
You've already been so kind to us.

85
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,600
If we stay here, you won't be able
to enjoy your vacation here.

86
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,893
I'm going back today.

87
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,688
I feel like I'm intruding if I stay here.

88
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,818
I'll go and bring him.
Please go ahead and start your meal.

89
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,991
Please go ahead.

90
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,295
Sir, you should eat some food.
You must have a terrible hangover.

91
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,048
No. It's all right.

92
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,763
Well, did I do something wrong
to offend you?

93
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,557
I know

94
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,226
that giving you advice
about your love life

95
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,852
is overstepping my boundary

96
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,646
given the situation I'm in.

97
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,440
I just don't feel good about it.

98
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,986
Seeing how happy you are

99
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,238
reminds me of Se-yeon.

100
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,993
I know.

101
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,870
People must go on with their lives.

102
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,458
That girl seemed very sweet.
She seemed like a nice girl.

103
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,711
Treat her well.

104
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,716
I always thought that
you were the best man for my daughter.

105
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,676
Pardon?

106
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,679
Wait, did you really think so?

107
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,848
But whenever I went over to your house,

108
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,433
you told me not to chase after Se-yeon.

109
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,226
I only said that because

110
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,645
your mother was never keen on Se-yeon.

111
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,524
Are you telling me
that you never disliked me?

112
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,568
What's there to dislike?

113
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,695
There's no one like you.

114
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,661
You loved Se-yeon to bits.

115
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,580
You're good at your job.

116
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,541
You come from a good family.
And you're kindhearted.

117
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,838
Well, you weren't exactly handsome.

118
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,923
But that's only a small part.

119
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,885
Let me tell you this man to man.

120
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,846
You're a decent guy.

121
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,395
- What are you doing?
- You've never complimented me.

122
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,147
I'm so happy that I want to record it.

123
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,982
Hey. Put that away.

124
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,692
Come on. Can you keep going?

125
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,152
How am I as your son-in-law?

126
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,654
You are

127
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,864
the best son-in-law there is.

128
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,061
It's all done.

129
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,240
<i>Let me tell you this man to man.</i>

130
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,325
<i>You're a decent guy.</i>

131
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,703
I should show this to Se-yeon later.

132
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,084
- What are you giggling about?
- What? It's nothing.

133
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,547
Did you put on makeup today?

134
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,466
- What?
- Your face...

135
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,301
What do you mean? Is something on my face?

136
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,470
I think you put more makeup than usual.

137
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,306
No, I didn't.
This is how I look every day.

138
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,642
- Really?
- Yes.

139
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,269
Why do you look so pretty today?

140
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,604
That was so cheesy.

141
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,567
How's my dad? Is he still upset?

142
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,527
No. I comforted him.

143
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,820
Good job.

144
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,906
I'm going to help my mom pack.

145
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,075
Okay. Let me go with you.

146
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,078
DONGBU POLICE STATION

147
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,580
Well,

148
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,000
the reason to dismiss the warrant
makes no sense.

149
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,710
We obtained the statement

150
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,129
from the courier who
delivered parcels to Oh Yeong-cheol.

151
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,007
If this isn't concrete evidence,
then what is?

152
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,801
What? Excuse me, Sir.

153
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,220
Hello? Sir?

154
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,097
Damn it.

155
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,934
It's already a ruckus over there
because of the rumors.

156
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,062
Do you think he'll help you
go after one of his own?

157
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,023
- Hey.
- Yes?

158
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,150
You don't think I know that?

159
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,943
You don't think I know that? Damn it.

160
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,320
I was just trying to say...

161
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,740
I told you I didn't want to tell him.
It's all because of you.

162
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,284
What are you looking at? You ugly jerk.

163
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,371
CHECKPOINT FOR RESTRICTED VEHICLES

164
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,790
Okay. I understand.

165
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,461
I'm on my way back to Seoul now.
Let's talk in person.

166
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,129
Okay.

167
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,342
I'm about to lose it. Seriously.

168
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,469
I'm certain that we'll get a lead

169
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,804
if we raid Ji-uk's house or his office.

170
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,057
You knew that it wouldn't be easy.

171
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,939
That's why I came up with a way
to help you

172
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,774
raid his place.

173
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,362
You're so lucky.

174
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,279
This gentleman here

175
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,950
is paying double the market price
for your studio.

176
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,535
Gosh, I'm so grateful.

177
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,661
REAL ESTATE CONTRACT

178
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,789
Are you sure that this studio
is following the fire safety regulations?

179
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,041
Of course. The city
won't give them the permit

180
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,753
to build these new studios
unless they have firewalls.

181
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,296
And you checked them?

182
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,924
Yes, but I didn't know
since there haven't been any fires.

183
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,510
I had no idea that
my studio had a firewall,

184
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,886
but it turned out that it did.

185
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,682
It ought to have one. If there's a fire,
you must get out through there.

186
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,434
It would be a big problem without that.
It's very important, you know.

187
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,852
Do I just need to sign here?

188
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,979
Yes.

189
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,021
NAME: CHA MIN

190
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,023
When will he pay the balance?

191
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,608
If you move out by tomorrow,

192
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,652
my secretary will check
and wire you the rest.

193
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,530
But are you sure
you don't need to look at the place?

194
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,825
We lived there for a long time.
You might have to renovate the place.

195
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,993
It's all right.

196
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,788
It's already a perfect house
given its location.

197
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,839
Prosecutor Seo?

198
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,842
- Detective Choe.
- What?

199
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,013
Hey, Seo Ji-uk.

200
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,850
I heard you're investigating
if Oh Yeong-cheol had an accomplice.

201
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm here for the questioning.

202
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,234
You impress me with these surprises
from time to time.

203
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,654
I can't believe you came up with an idea
of sneaking into his house from here.

204
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,323
I went over all the possibilities.

205
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,367
But there will be evidence
that we broke into his home.

206
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,994
- Right.
- But if we enter from here,

207
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,205
the security camera will only catch us
going into the unit next to his.

208
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,584
Awesome. You really are a genius
when it comes to using your resources.

209
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,377
But how do you know where that is?

210
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,632
USE THIS WALL IN CASE OF FIRE

211
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,651
Hey, this place looks like a show house.

212
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,819
Hey.

213
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,489
Okay.

214
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,749
They need to score a lead somehow.

215
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,730
Min.

216
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,108
Get that for me.

217
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,734
- This?
- Yes.

218
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,071
This looks very familiar.

219
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,540
This is mine.

220
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,375
What?

221
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,800
Over there.

222
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,162
I tried to catch him, but he was so fast.

223
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,224
Damn it. I can't believe
they made a civil servant break the law.

224
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,024
- Hello?
- What happened?

225
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,151
What do you think? I bolted.

226
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,111
Did they catch you?

227
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,863
I'm talking to you on the phone
because they didn't!

228
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,156
What about you? Are you okay?

229
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,544
Let me see.

230
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,714
He covered his face with the mask
and the hat, so I can't identify the perp.

231
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,635
Can I look at the security footage
of my floor?

232
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,470
- The one in the hallway?
- Yes.

233
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,183
This is it.

234
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,197
Please make a copy
of today's security footage from the hall.

235
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,824
Okay.

236
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,103
No one is tailing us, right?

237
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,897
No, there's no one.

238
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,232
Did you find anything?

239
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,237
That's decisive evidence that he worked
with Oh Yeong-cheol and killed me.

240
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,239
What's this?

241
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,949
What made you think my case wasn't related

242
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,452
to the Eomsan-dong Murder Case?

243
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,288
The victims of the Eomsan-dong Murder Case
had the suture mark.

244
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,540
But there wasn't one on your body.
That's why we--

245
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,834
That's what Seo Ji-uk wanted you to think.

246
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,295
Oh Yeong-cheol followed his usual MO.

247
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,340
But Ji-uk got rid of his signature
to cover up the truth about the case.

248
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,719
I remember hearing that eerie sound
when he was trying to kill me.

249
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,768
It was the sound of him

250
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,812
cutting the suture on my neck
with the thread nippers.

251
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,067
If we find Seo Ji-uk's fingerprints
and Se-yeon's blood on the thread nippers,

252
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,111
- we can prove that it was him.
- Yes.

253
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,005
I sent the thread nippers to the NFS.

254
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,423
We'll get the results by tomorrow.

255
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,051
Gosh, it's so good.
This is my first meal today.

256
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,512
- One more bottle of soju, please.
- Okay.

257
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,389
Thank you for your help.

258
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,808
So what did that jerk say at the station?

259
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,559
- Seo Ji-uk?
- Yes.

260
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,479
He put on quite a show.
He came to the station

261
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,107
pretending to have been hurt
with bandages around his head.

262
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,235
He brought the edited version
of the dash cam footage

263
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,737
where it only shows
Hee-jin running him over.

264
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,699
Seeing that he came to the station
on his own,

265
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,617
he must have had a plan.

266
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,411
And do you know
what he said at the station?

267
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,872
He said he was appalled that
the rumors caused this investigation

268
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,709
and we're responsible
for failing to keep out the reporters.

269
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,002
He went ballistic.

270
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,462
What about the boxes from the courier?

271
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,589
That proves he was working
with Oh Yeong-cheol.

272
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,676
You know there are informants, right?

273
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,178
You know those informants
prosecutors keep around?

274
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,598
And Seo Ji-uk had an informant too.

275
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,351
He said that he had been receiving tips
through the boxes.

276
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,271
But when he opened the last box
and saw a photo,

277
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:58,108
he realized this wasn't the informant
that he had been in contact with.

278
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,069
That bastard. He's a total loach.

279
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,613
Loach?

280
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,782
- He escapes the law like a loach.
- I see.

281
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,285
- I thought you meant cockroach.
- I meant a loach.

282
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,912
Well, anyway,
there's nothing to worry about now.

283
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,082
We baited the trap
and have decisive evidence.

284
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,792
Everything is going to work out well.

285
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,587
I really hope so.

286
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,632
- Didn't you drive here, Detective Park?
- I already called someone.

287
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,885
- Hey.
- Here she is.

288
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,345
- Sit down.
- I want beer.

289
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,971
- You need to drive.
- Try this.

290
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,473
We can call a chauffeur service.

291
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,141
Is that why you called me?

292
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,102
No, well...

293
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,104
Of course not!

294
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,355
I called you because this way,

295
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,942
we get to see each other one more time.

296
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,779
Oh, dear. Goodness.
You're making me blush.

297
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,364
You smooth talker. You're killing me.

298
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,492
It's hot in here. Don't come close.

299
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,410
It's hot in here
because of the grill. Come on.

300
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,706
That's why I get to see you 24-7.

301
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,671
You're killing me. Stop it.

302
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,925
You can't die. I live for you.

303
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,009
Gosh, you...

304
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,598
Shall we all have a drink?

305
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,309
- You brought a car.
- Pour me one too.

306
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,353
Hold on.

307
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,854
- What?
- Hey.

308
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,607
- What's wrong with you?
- What do you mean?

309
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,400
What?

310
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,989
- Mi-do.
- Yes?

311
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,866
Did you know

312
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,702
you broke my heart

313
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,789
when you left me?

314
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,171
Thank you

315
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,842
for coming back to me.

316
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,011
Do you know how much I love you, Mi-do?

317
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,054
Yes.

318
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,140
She's mine!

319
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,228
- Dong-cheol, why are you on the floor?
- He has disappeared.

320
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,312
Dong-cheol.

321
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,566
- Who are you?
- Mi-do.

322
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,984
It's you, Mi-do.

323
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,779
- Mi-do, you know...
- Excuse me.

324
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,323
Hey, you.

325
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,201
How old are you?

326
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,872
What's your name?

327
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,498
Cha Min.

328
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,375
"Cha Min"?

329
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,461
That's my friend's name,

330
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,881
but you look nothing like him.

331
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,467
Do you have a girlfriend?

332
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,095
I do, so don't talk to me.

333
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,096
I like Go Se-yeon.

334
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,224
Are sexy women your type?
I can be sexy, you know.

335
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,648
- I want to throw up.
- You want to throw up?

336
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,027
I guess my face makes you vomit.

337
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,154
You can't recognize me
because I'm too pretty now.

338
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,573
- Change your face back.
- He'll throw up? I doubt it.

339
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,466
The sound of your conscience
is the sound of your destiny.

340
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,344
And humans are to follow that sound.

341
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,895
So you followed the sound of your destiny.

342
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,939
Where did it bring you?

343
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,691
"Sound"?

344
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,195
I hope that you can end up

345
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,531
where you want to be.

346
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,411
Wait.

347
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,418
That... Sir, there is something
in the back of your handcart.

348
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,671
Sir.

349
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,383
Who pushed me?

350
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,926
- Damn it.
- Sir.

351
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,721
That jerk. Min!.

352
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,682
- Someone pushed me.
- What?

353
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,892
- Someone pushed me.
- There's something odd.

354
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,937
- Hey, let's go to karaoke.
- Karaoke?

355
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,439
- Of course we should go.
- Let's go.

356
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,693
- We should go. We should.
- Don't you touch her.

357
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,860
- Their faces...
- Mi-do.

358
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,779
- Let's go. Where are we going?
- Mi-do, let's go.

359
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,240
- Come on.
- What are you doing? Hurry up.

360
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,409
I hit it wrong.

361
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,204
Here he goes.

362
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,140
See? We look exactly the same!

363
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,517
Are we doppelgänger?

364
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,645
- Look.
- Does that mean we'll die?

365
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,979
- We're soulmates.
- Hey.

366
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,149
- I can't die yet, so I'll kill you first.
- We're soulmates.

367
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,443
- No, I'll kill you first.
- Play or die,

368
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,903
rock-paper-scissors.

369
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,322
- What's that? That's paper.
- It's rock.

370
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,657
- Mine is this.
- Take that!

371
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,951
Look at you. Bang!

372
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,495
You're dead.

373
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,414
Se-yeon?

374
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,624
Se-yeon, wake up!

375
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,334
Are you really dead?

376
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,379
- Why are you crying?
- I really thought you were dead!

377
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,339
- Mi-do, why are you crying?
- My gosh!

378
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,715
Mi-do!

379
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,925
Please don't cry.

380
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,177
I thought you were dead.

381
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,139
- We're too pretty to die!
- You can't die.

382
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,391
No.

383
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,478
- Why would I die?
- I don't know.

384
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,569
Shit, my head hurts.

385
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,660
What...

386
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,872
What's going on?

387
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,254
Hey.

388
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,966
Min, wake up. Where are we?

389
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,760
- What?
- My stomach hurts.

390
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,470
Are we at a hotel?

391
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,055
My head's spinning.

392
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,894
My head...

393
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,396
This is my mom's room.

394
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,653
What?

395
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,989
Why the hell are we in here?

396
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,824
I don't know. Why are you here?

397
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,118
Gosh.

398
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,997
What the hell?

399
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,084
Min, your hangover soup...

400
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,296
My gosh!

401
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,882
Ms. Eom, what are you doing here?

402
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,427
I was kicked out of my room.

403
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,763
Where am I?

404
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,599
Mr. Kim, thank you for seeing us out.

405
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,975
- Thank you.
- You should get going.

406
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,061
- Bye.
- Let's go, Se-yeon.

407
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,479
- But...
- Se-yeon.

408
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,106
- What?
- I told you this before,

409
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,359
- but you're my everything.
- Wait.

410
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,237
- Se-yeon!
- Over here.

411
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,655
What? Don't do this to me.

412
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,864
Oh, Min, it's you.

413
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,242
- Actually...
- Where to?

414
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,827
- Who the hell are you?
- Sorry?

415
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,829
- Who are you?
- What?

416
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,497
- Get away from Se-yeon!
- Please...

417
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,541
- Se-yeon.
- Wait.

418
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,877
Let's hurry off to bed.

419
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,963
But I'm Se-yeon.

420
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,172
- Sorry?
- This way.

421
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,133
Home? Can't I have one more drink?

422
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,263
Hey, we're home.

423
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,349
We're home, so let's go to bed.

424
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,646
Bathroom.

425
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,690
I need to go to the bathroom!

426
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,816
Hey!

427
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,820
I need to go to the bathroom. I must.

428
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,448
Didn't I tell you to always
stay by my side? Come here.

429
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,034
Where did the stairs come from?

430
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,077
Here...

431
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,537
Damn it!

432
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,081
Min, you already fell asleep.

433
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,209
- Good night.
- Where did you go?

434
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,212
- I told you to always stay by my side.
- What's wrong with her? Ms. Lee.

435
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,591
- My gosh!
- Stick to me like glue.

436
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,177
- Hey.
- What a familiar scent.

437
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,722
Min, stop moving.

438
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,016
- I could say that same to you.
- Hey! Son!

439
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,101
What's wrong with him?

440
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,353
Seriously? Hey!

441
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,939
- Good night.
- You've got to be kidding me.

442
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,242
Attorney Lee.

443
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,119
Yes.

444
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,957
I don't know if this is
how young couples date these days,

445
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,667
but it wasn't appropriate.

446
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,171
Of course not. I'm sorry.

447
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,089
I'm sorry too.

448
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,426
I'll be blunt with you.

449
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,511
Attorney Lee,

450
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,931
are you going to marry my son?

451
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,351
Mom, we'll talk about that
some other time--

452
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,938
I'm not as irresponsible as you think.

453
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,357
I wouldn't have come this far with Min

454
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,943
without considering a future together.

455
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,615
There's something complicated
going on in my life right now.

456
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,494
Once it's all sorted out,
I'll ask for his hand in marriage.

457
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,664
I hope you'll approve of us then.

458
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,090
I'll cure my hangover. Okay.

459
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,718
Okay, got it. I'll talk to you later.

460
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,225
Weren't we on good terms before?

461
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,936
Am I invisible to you now?

462
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,607
What will you do if I'm not the culprit?

463
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,238
What if you are?

464
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,827
I don't bet on losing games.

465
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,454
You've worked with me long enough
to know that.

466
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,750
You know me well too.

467
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,962
Once I bite, I never let go.

468
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,176
I don't know how you obtained it,

469
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,429
but anything that is illegally obtained

470
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,015
is inadmissible as evidence.

471
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,391
I'm sure you know that.

472
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,072
Gosh.

473
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,533
Why are you cleaning up
when you're the guest?

474
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,784
Just make yourself home.

475
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,327
How are we just guests?

476
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,246
This is like our base of operations.

477
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,291
And we partied hard here last night.
Of course we should help.

478
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,251
Shouldn't you be at work though?

479
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,713
Your mother doesn't seem
so pleased with you.

480
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,590
Shouldn't you show her that you're trying?

481
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:14,135
I took a long vacation
because every second counts.

482
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,223
I don't want to be away from you
for even a second.

483
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,310
Stop being so corny.

484
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,353
I hate that, so stop.

485
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,231
- Darn.
- Now I want to keep going.

486
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,067
- Se-yeon, you know...
- Gosh, no.

487
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,278
Even blinking is a waste of time for me.

488
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,571
It prevents me from seeing you.

489
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,823
Is Detective Park teaching you this?

490
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,492
Look at my bloodshot eyes.

491
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,577
Is this your first time dating?

492
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,788
What's with those cheesy comments?

493
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,498
It is my first time.

494
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,833
Why don't you put out an ad on the subway

495
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,544
- saying that you're dating her?
- Stop, he might really do it.

496
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,046
I like that idea.

497
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,381
Don't do it. Don't you dare do it.

498
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,258
Darn it.

499
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,551
Hi, how did it go?

500
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,679
What?

501
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,307
How the hell can the law work like that?

502
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,770
Unbelievable.

503
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,314
We have your blood and his fingerprints.

504
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,316
It's as I suspected.

505
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,569
I found it odd that
Ji-uk heard about the thread nippers

506
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,364
and that we met him
multiple times at the NFS,

507
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,282
so I checked my case report.

508
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,578
The cause of death
is written as exsanguination.

509
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,456
CAUSE OF DEATH: EXSANGUINATION

510
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,792
That's understandable
considering the stab wounds.

511
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,752
Oh Yeong-cheol was the one who stabbed me,

512
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,922
but Ji-uk strangling me to death
was the final blow.

513
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,550
That's why I remember the thread nippers.

514
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,012
Also, take a look
at the medical examiner's notes.

515
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,516
There's nothing in regard
to the wounds on my neck.

516
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,976
And there are no photos of it.

517
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,980
I'm sure there was evidence
of the suture mark being removed.

518
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,900
That means Seo Ji-uk
altered the autopsy report.

519
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,155
Do you remember the corpse
that underwent an autopsy?

520
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,031
The one that the police mistook
for Min's body.

521
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,201
Wasn't Kim Dae-ung
the medical examiner on that case too?

522
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,621
Prosecutor Seo asked me
to compare the DNA to Cha Min's,

523
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,625
so I used his hair, which we had obtained
from his belongings seized from his place.

524
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,169
Sure enough, it was a match.

525
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,463
Should we perform the autopsy?

526
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,341
I'll inform you
after I've talked to the daughter.

527
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,177
Okay.

528
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,469
- Detective Lee!
- Yes?

529
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,888
I need you to check something.

530
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,474
I told you that the guy we caught
at the scene has type AB blood.

531
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,768
But Prosecutor Seo Ji-uk
just said it should be type B.

532
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,146
He said you should double-check.

533
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,026
He was also in charge
of Jang Sun-young's autopsy.

534
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,074
<i>Doctor Kim?</i>

535
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,911
<i>He urgently took a leave of absence
a few days back.</i>

536
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,751
Hurry!

537
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,964
- You guys go that way.
- Follow me.

538
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,534
Dae-ung?

539
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,496
- Dae-ung, it really is you.
- Dae-ung.

540
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,081
- It's you, right?
- Get over here.

541
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,290
- Hey.
- Where are you off to?

542
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,583
We've found Dae-ung.

543
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,461
- Shit.
- Kim Dae-ung!

544
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,048
Damn it.

545
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,175
Move!

546
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,388
Move! Out of the way!

547
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,265
- What the hell?
- Move!

548
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,558
Excuse me. Coming through.

549
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,394
Move out of the way. Shit.

550
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,479
- Make way!
- What?

551
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,484
Shit, go that way.

552
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,875
Excuse me.

553
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,963
My gosh.

554
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,589
Excuse us.

555
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,262
Yes, Detective Park.

556
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,723
I'll meet you on the first floor.

557
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,686
It's been a while, Mr. Kim.

558
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,036
You must pay for your crime.

559
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,995
Don't you think?

560
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,297
He confessed to being bought off

561
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,132
by Seo Ji-uk
to fabricate the autopsy results.

562
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,846
We requested a warrant,
so he's done for now.

563
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,348
Good.

564
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,099
This is great.

565
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,728
Okay.

566
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,813
I understand.

567
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,696
Things have come down to this.

568
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,099
Sugyeong?

569
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,436
A coincidence?

570
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,734
What the hell was he trying to say?

571
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,627
Who is it?

572
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,171
My goodness,
are we interrupting your evening?

573
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,174
- You live in a mansion!
- Nice!

574
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,968
- What is this about?
- We'll look around.

575
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,052
- Guys!
- Yes?

576
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,346
- Take a good look around.
- Sure thing.

577
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,391
Look how nice this house is.

578
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,726
Could I get a refreshing beverage?

579
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,646
Do you really think you'll find anything?

580
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,065
You already took what you needed.

581
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,235
Detective Park, I found the evidence.

582
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,863
- It was in his cupboard.
- I knew it.

583
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,782
I told you they hide important pieces
in the cupboard. Keep it safe.

584
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,659
- Sure thing.
- Good job.

585
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,565
- Good job.
- We got it right away.

586
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,358
- Great job on finding that.
- Good work.

587
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,196
This wasn't illegally obtained.

588
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,823
We have the warrant to prove it.

589
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,200
It'll be sent to the NFS,

590
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,952
but I feel like I already know the result.

591
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,705
Is this a burn? Gosh, it must hurt.

592
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,333
Let's take a rain check on the coffee.

593
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,978
- How did it go?
- It went well as planned.

594
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,190
I'm sure that Seo Ji-uk
is now completely confused.

595
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,359
He still has no idea
how we entered his pace.

596
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:12,238
I'm glad. I was so worried
because you were running late.

597
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,073
What's there to worry about?

598
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,784
As long as I have Abyss, I'm untouchable.

599
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,078
Of course I know that,

600
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,580
but please don't use it anymore.

601
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,584
This has always been
in the colors of a rainbow,

602
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,671
but since it's purple now.
That means it only has one use left in it.

603
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,131
Who knows what'll happen
when it's depleted?

604
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,638
Could everyone who this marble revived
suddenly drop dead?

605
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,769
Who knows? It could also be recharged.

606
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,771
Unlimited use?

607
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,940
That's highly unlikely.

608
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,946
Don't worry.

609
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,657
What you're imagining won't happen.

610
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,244
Got it?

611
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,487
<i>The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...</i>

612
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,249
So you'll abandon me?

613
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,423
Dong-cheol!

614
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,342
It's as you predicted.

615
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,053
The bloodstain on the bandage
from the first-aid kit

616
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,888
belongs to Oh Yeong-cheol.

617
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,723
See?

618
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,601
Did I not say that I'd catch him?

619
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,228
When I'm confident,
there's always a reason.

620
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,482
Here. It's enough for an arrest, isn't it?

621
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,401
TEST RESULTS

622
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:15,944
Okay.

623
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,530
You did a good job.
Go request the warrant.

624
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,824
Let's go.

625
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,173
My gosh. Prosecutor Seo!

626
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,634
I need a burner phone
I can use right away.

627
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:39,718
Also,

628
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,097
I want you to get me something.

629
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,976
What job requires this much?

630
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,152
- Min.
- Yes?

631
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,654
I'm thirsty.

632
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,910
Here.

633
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:14,420
It's been a while
since I relaxed like this.

634
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,255
This is nice.

635
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,465
The warrant for Seo Ji-uk's arrest
has been issued,

636
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,802
so it'll be over once he's behind bars.

637
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:22,928
That's right.

638
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,098
When this is all over,

639
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,308
what would you like to do first?

640
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,352
- Me?
- Yes.

641
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,732
I want to tell my parents

642
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,651
that I'm alive.

643
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,988
It won't be easy, of course.

644
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,200
They'll need some time to accept it.

645
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,828
It's been a while since you died.

646
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,706
That's why I sometimes regret

647
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,376
not letting you tell your parents

648
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,546
that you were Se-yeon

649
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,259
on the day we met at your funeral.

650
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,928
If people find out that I'm alive,

651
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,931
the culprit won't be considered
a murderer.

652
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,393
I wanted those two to pay

653
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,312
for what they did no matter what.

654
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,730
So I had to hide that I'm Se-yeon.

655
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,773
And it was my choice.

656
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,070
I'm not afraid of anything

657
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,157
as long as I have you, my mom and dad.

658
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,869
Let's get back my mom and dad first

659
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,080
and then we can sort out other things.

660
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,918
You know how
strong and persistent I am, right?

661
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,842
I'll help you.

662
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,845
Let's work it all out together.

663
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,973
All right. Thank you.

- But before that,
- What?

665
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,312
there's something you need to do with me.

666
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:56,813
What is it?

667
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,774
Wait here.

668
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,609
Where are you going?

669
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,487
Let's see.

670
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,000
Do you remember this? It's my bucket list.

BUCKET LIST

672
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,095
Hey, I gave you only one wish coupon.

673
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,348
I'm only asking for one thing.
"Doing the things on this list with me."

674
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,142
That is one, but...

675
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,230
If you ask a genie in a bottle

676
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:41,400
to grant wishes all your life,
do you think he'll listen?

677
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,028
You're the one who said
you'd grant me a wish.

678
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,823
- Still, I can't do this.
- Why not?

679
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,158
These are the things
you do with your girlfriend.

680
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,953
I'm not your girlfriend.

681
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:56,873
Fine.

682
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,128
Tell me another wish.
I'll grant you the wish.

683
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,464
Forget it. I'll think of something later.

684
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,467
Fine.

685
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,223
BUCKET LIST

686
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,603
Do you remember?

687
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,439
You said you wouldn't do it
because you weren't my girlfriend.

688
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,569
Here. I'll use my wish coupon now.

689

804
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,142

Ji-uk's safety,</i>

808
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,790
<i>I'm going to confess
and pay for everything I did.</i>

809
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:28,046
Is there a patient named Seo Ji-uk here?

810
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,672
Just a moment.

811
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,223
Judge Seo?

812
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,683
I'm at the nursing home,
but Seo Ji-uk already--

813
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,976
<i>I need to ask you a favor.</i>

814
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,687
<i>Don't do anything yet.</i>

815
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,482
Could you just follow him

816
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:52,195
and check where Seo Ji-uk,
I mean, Oh Tae-jin,

817
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,364
is taking my son?

818
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,223
<i>Also,</i>

819
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,643
in order to conceal my sin,

820
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,525
I joined hands with the devil

821
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,363
and have kept Oh Yeong-cheol's son

822
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:41,035
<i>as my own all these years.</i>

823
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,706
Does that even make sense?

824
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,808
Sitting out here,

825
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,604
it feels like we're just like
any ordinary people

826
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,649
who are enjoying the small things in life,

827
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,567
doesn't it?

828
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,821
We are just ordinary people.

829
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,991
Come on, you were revived twice.

830
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,784
How is that ordinary?

831
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,454
You're right.

832
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,790
Everything's messed up
because of this thing.

833
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,754
Still, it feels so nice
to be with you here.

834
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,678
If it's purple,

835
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,973
does it mean I have only one last chance?

836
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,643
What will happen if I use the last chance?

837
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,984
IF ABYSS' LIGHT DISAPPEARS,

838
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:59,489
THE OWNER DISAPPEARS AS WELL

839
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,874
- You're up?
- Yes, where were you?

840
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,050
From now on,
let's enjoy the small things in life

841
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,637
and live happily

842
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,639
like those people.

843
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,058
Okay.

844
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,143
But you know what?

845
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:33,147
My cheek keeps hurting.

846
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,607
- I think I got a sunburn.
- Where?

847
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,401
- Right over here. My left cheek.
- Let me see.

848
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,985
- Over here.
- Let me see.

849
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,612
- No, here.
- Move your hand so I can see.

850
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,780
I said, here.

851
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,534
Hey, this ring...

852
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,954
It was my type, so I just...

853
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,123
Also,

854
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,459
now that I've accepted it,

855
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,045
I want to ask you something as well.

856
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,715
Cha Min.

857
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:02,593
Will you marry me?

858
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:09,934
Well...

859
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,520
the ring is not really my type.

860
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:14,814
What?

861
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,650
Are you turning me down
because of this ring?

862
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,068
No.

863
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,156
I'm going to be yours forever.

864
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,617
Come here.

865
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,578
I love you, Go Se-yeon.

866
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,497
Me, too.

867
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,986
<i>- I love you so much, Se-yeon.
- Me, too.</i>

868
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,238
<i>If you come any closer,</i>

869
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,824
- I'll shoot her.
- You can never hide your crime.

870
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:51,661
<i>I'll make sure to revive everyone you kill
and make them point you as their murderer.</i>

871
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,079
Over there.

872
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,290
- There were no traces of Director Cha.
- What?

873
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,543
<i>Just believing in him
and living your life to the fullest</i>

874
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,378
<i>is the best thing you can do
at the moment.</i>

875
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,465
<i>I miss Min so much.</i>

876
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,218
I can't live without him.

877
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:10,513
<i>I don't think I can do it.
What should I do?</i>
