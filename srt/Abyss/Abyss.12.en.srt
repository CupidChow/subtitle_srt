1
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,719
I'll get going
since I've got better things to do.

2
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,303
Mi-do?

3
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,522
You're Oh Tae-jin, aren't you?

4
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,869
What's the matter with you?

5
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,205
It's me.

6
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,624
Seo Ji-uk.

7
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,466
Who would believe you?

8
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,846
You don't even exist in this world.

9
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,059
Just like you're Lee Mi-do,

10
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,603
I'm Seo Ji-uk.

11
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,983
What the hell are you doing?

12
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,961
Se-yeon. Hey, Se-yeon!

13
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,546
Hey, what's wrong?

14
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,632
Ji-uk... He...

15
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,093
Ji-uk was the accomplice.

16
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,097
She's not dead yet.

17
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,482
EPISODE 12

18
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,697
You should get some sleep
like Prosecutor Go said.

19
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,034
Can't you just go tomorrow morning?

20
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,077
It's getting late, so it's not safe.

21
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,746
You need to get some rest.

22
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,830
No, it's okay.

23
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,375
I'm going to wash up,
pack up my stuff, and get going.

24
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,753
Don't worry about me
and just get back to the station.

25
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,214
Well, I'm not really worried about you.

26
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,552
Anyway, all right.
Then give me a call when you're leaving.

27
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,304
I don't want you to go alone.

28
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,473
I'll call my guys
and tell them to give you a ride.

29
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,768
- Thank you.
- Go on in.

30
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,686
You have to call me, okay?

31
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,689
Don't go there alone!

32
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,692
Why must she worry me like this?

33
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,412
SE-YEON, 3 MISSED CALLS

34
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,170
Who is it?

35
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>Prosecutor Seo Ji-uk...</i>

36
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,718
<i>I'm from the Prosecutors' Office.</i>

37
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,388
Just a second, please.

38
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,101
How can I help you?

39
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,362
It's me.

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,572
It's me, Oh Tae-jin.

41
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,535
Tae-jin?

42
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,832
Please... Please save me, Su-jin.

43
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,792
Tae-jin!

44
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,981
Father, please forgive me.

45
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,191
- Father, I'm sorry.
- You should pay

46
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,445
- Father, I'm sorry.
- for your mistakes

47
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,242
Actually, I'm the one who broke it.

48
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,662
Tae-jin didn't do anything wrong.

49
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,879
Does that mean you lied to me,
my little princess?

50
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,967
And you agreed to aid her
in telling this lie.

51
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,016
Wait quietly.

52
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,061
You're next.

53
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,487
What is it? Are you angry?

54
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,750
Give up.

55
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,169
You have

56
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,046
already lost.

57
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,407
Are you all right?

58
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,243
Su-jin.

59
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,462
Why show up after all these years?

60
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,803
I'm not sure where to begin
and how I can explain what happened, but--

61
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,721
You didn't show up
when we were looking for you.

62
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,433
Do you know what Mom and I went through...

63
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,271
after you left?

64
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,942
I shouldn't have run away like that.

65
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,945
I'm sorry, Su-jin.

66
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,198
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,370
Where the hell have you been?

68
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,499
And what's up with that wound?
How did you get it?

69
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,086
Oh Yeong-cheol.

70
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,882
That bastard managed to find me.

71
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,602
I think I should go check on Hee-jin.

72
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,771
If Ji-uk handed Jang Sun-young over
to Oh Yeong-cheol,

73
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,858
then that means he knows
where she is now. It's too dangerous.

74
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,651
- Se-yeon, please.
- What?

75
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,071
Can you please
only think about yourself now?

76
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,450
- I'm okay.
- I'm not okay with this.

77
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,912
You can't sleep or eat.

78
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,331
You're so stressed out
and anxious every day.

79
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,003
Have you ever thought about
how I must feel, having to watch that?

80
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,761
If Seo Ji-uk really is the one
who killed you,

81
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,264
then I'd want to punish him
more than anybody else does.

82
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,476
And if you want,

83
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,395
I can certainly go ahead
and do that with what I have.

84
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,981
I know. I know all of that,

85
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,652
but if we punish him that easily,
it'll be meaningless.

86
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,613
Exactly. I know that's how you feel.

87
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:55,117
I know you will feel like that because
I know you better than anyone else.

88
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,787
And that's why I've been helping you
catch him

89
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,122
the way you want to do it.

90
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,918
But you see, Se-yeon,

91
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,257
I had to see you throw yourself

92
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,593
into dangerous situations
and getting yourself hurt.

93
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,138
Think about how it must've made me feel.

94
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:24,772
Min.

95
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:30,152
Since I was young, I've always done
the things that I wanted to do

96
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,029
even when people tried

97
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,575
to dissuade me by saying
that they're dangerous

98
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,204
and that I'd likely end up failing
and getting hurt.

99
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,999
Do you know

100
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,418
where I got the courage from?

101
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,006
You.

102
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,762
A black knight who does everything for me
so that I don't have to lift a finger?

103
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,890
Sure, that would be nice too.

104
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,853
But perhaps it's because
I'm a bit of a warrior myself.

105
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,105
I don't really need a knight
who'd brandish his sword

106
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,232
right by my side.

107
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,444
Then what am I? A field medic?

108
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,654
No. You're my shelter.

109
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,407
- Your shelter?
- Yes, like a home.

110
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,284
- I'm an inanimate object? A home?
- Yes.

111
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,788
On battlefields, nothing boosts soldiers'
fighting efficiency more than this does.

112
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,125
"We will win no matter what
and return home."

113
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,631
The place where I feel the safest
and most comfortable in my life,

114
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,592
which has been a constant battle.

115
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,596
The person who makes me smile,
gives me the strength I need,

116
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,432
and therefore makes me invincible.

117
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,934
To me, you're that person.

118
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,482
And you've always been on my side

119
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,901
no matter what.

120
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,865
Thank you.

121
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,166
But still,

122
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,044
I'm so worried about you every second.

123
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,923
I can't stop you though.
So, think about how I'd feel

124
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,343
and please take it easy, okay?

125
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,054
Okay.

126
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,918
You can't be here.

127
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,295
This is the safest place, don't you think?

128
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,550
A serial killer on the run
at a prosecutor's place?

129
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,593
Who would dare

130
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,930
to imagine that this may be possible?

131
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,435
Go Se-yeon found out about us.

132
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,065
How?

133
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,818
Has Jang Sun-young regained
her consciousness already--

134
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,404
Because of the bloodstain
left at the scene.

135
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,572
Why did you let

136
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,283
your emotions get the better of you?

137
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,162
Jang Sun-young won't wake up
for quite a while,

138
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,663
but Su-jin is the problem.

139
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,584
She won't help Go Se-yeon
as long as Jang Sun-young is alive.

140
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,085
I've warned her.

141
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,797
She'll come to you soon,

142
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,383
so just wait quietly for the time being.

143
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,640
Sit back down.

144
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,061
I'm not here to talk to you
about such things.

145
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,712
Disinfect the wound yourself, twice a day.

146
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,855
DONGBU POLICE STATION

147
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,442
Well, how did it go?

148
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,071
It was a burner phone,
just as we expected.

149
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,031
And the number is no longer in service.

150
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,701
Then there's no firm evidence
to pin Seo Ji-uk down as a suspect.

151
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,622
If we can prove that he is
Oh Yeong-cheol's biological son,

152
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,583
we should be able to use the media
to open a reinvestigation.

153
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,546
But do you think Seo Ji-uk will agree
to a DNA test?

154
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,130
A DNA test?

155
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,299
Can't we just...

156
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,677
Will this be hard? It only takes a second.

157
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,222
It certainly won't be easy. How are we
going to pluck his hair for no reason...

158
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,141
- Dong-cheol, someone's here for you.
- Who?

159
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,103
It's a woman. She seems very angry though.

160
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,272
- Why?
- I don't know.

161
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,649
She looks a little bit like Mr. Bogus.

162
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,858
- Mr. Bogus?
- Yes.

163
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,362
- It must be Mi-do.
- Why is Mr. Bogus angry?

164
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,036
The chicken sandwich. Right?

165
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,037
Yes.

166
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,915
All of this happened
because you haven't proposed to me yet.

167
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,002
Why are you taking it out on me?

168
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,421
Why is it my fault
that Mr. Cha's mother went there?

169
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,548
You're such a loser. Don't act all tough.

170
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,467
You act like a real man only when
you catch culprits. You're useless.

171
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,930
Why did you have to come back to life
with that face and cause all this trouble?

172
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:50,973
That's what I'm saying.

173
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,895
Well, I've been told that you're given
an appearance that resembles your soul.

174
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,857
Maybe we were soul mates, don't you think?

175
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,402
Come to think of it,
we're both ill-tempered.

176
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,738
I'm thinking that may have been
why we never got along.

177
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,239
I'm even more upset now.

178
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:14,163
You see, I feel really bad
that I keep causing all this trouble

179
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,582
while using your identity.

180
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,001
What can I do though?

181
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,086
The world thinks that I'm already dead.

182
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,755
Gosh, you...

183
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,799
I can't even be mean to you because
you look like me before plastic surgery.

184
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,343
This situation is driving me nuts.

185
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,889
So? Did Mr. Cha say that
he can take care of this for sure?

186
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,770
Hey, I'm saying this
because you're like a little sister to me.

187
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,857
I suggest you reconsider
your relationship with Mr. Cha.

188
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,109
The chairman of Lan Cosmetics

189
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,155
will be such an overbearing mother-in-law.

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,409
Why are you nodding
when you don't even know anything?

191
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,245
Are you prepared
to sue the plastic surgeon?

192
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,540
- How could he make you
- My, this is delicious.

193
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,042
look like a cartoon character?

194
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,628
I'm not being like this for no reason.

195
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,254
I'm just worried about you. That's all.

196
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,048
I did nothing wrong,
so don't fuss over it.

197
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,258
What you did is certainly wrong.

198
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,928
Did you harass every single girl
I've dated like that?

199
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,346
"Every single girl"?

200
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:17,267
Hey, don't talk like
you've dated a lot of girls.

201
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,686
Se-yeon dumped you,

202
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,437
so it leaves just two, Hee-jin and Mi-do.

203
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,190
Whether it's one or two,
the number isn't important.

204
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,442
How could you go to her place

205
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,612
without even telling me
and throw money at her?

206
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,491
Do you want the whole country
to know about it?

207
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,368
I'm doing this for a reason.

208
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,287
I'm not fond of any of the girls
you end up getting involved with,

209
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,498
so I'm trying to come up with a plan here.

210
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,709
What else did you do?

211
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,007
What do you mean?
I didn't do anything else.

212
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,299
You'd better tell me now.

213
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,636
Tell me!

214
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,638
I really didn't do much.

215
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,850
I vetted her family,
did a background check on her,

216
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,686
- and put a tracker on her.
- A tracker?

217
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,939
Mom, that is a crime.

218
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,108
I'm doing it for a legitimate reason.

219
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,444
She sold the house you bought
and ran away.

220
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,279
How can I trust her?
What if it happens again?

221
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,699
Are you saying
you've been tracking Hee-jin until now?

222
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,118
That's not what I'm saying.

223
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,203
I just put the device on her phone
just in case--

224
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,873
- Mom.
- Okay, I heard you!

225
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll tell them to disable the device.

226
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,421
Even your personality changed
along with your appearance.

227
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,717
You never used to talk back to me,
but you yell at me all the time now.

228
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,889
- Tell Mr. Kim to come to my office.
- <i>Sure, ma'am.</i>

229
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,782
<i>So, what is Oh Yeong-cheol
trying to achieve?</i>

230
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,410
You said he gave permission
for you to be adopted.

231
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,830
He got arrested,
and his life has hit rock bottom.

232
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,874
I bet he thinks he has nothing to lose.

233
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,753
He didn't seem to be in his right mind.
He kept talking nonsense.

234
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,297
Nonsense?

235
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,717
He said he has some kind of... A marble?

236
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,678
He mentioned that he can use it
to be reborn.

237
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,099
He said it'll enable him
to live a completely new life.

238
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,267
I have no idea what that means.

239
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,854
So, that's his goal?

240
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,067
Yes.

241
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,862
He said he really needs you
to make that happen.

242
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,324
It's just crazy talk.

243
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,081
I think I now know what he's after.

244
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,335
And I finally know

245
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,546
what I should do.

246
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,471
Mom.

247
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,099
Mom, are you all right?

248
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,684
Look at me, Mom.

249
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,228
Do you see me?

250
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,943
Hello, Doctor. This is VIP Room One.

251
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,821
My mom has regained her consciousness.

252
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,157
Yes, she just woke up.

253
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,999
Detective Park, Prosecutor Seo is taking
another sick day.

254
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,792
He must be quite ill.

255
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,919
Oh, yes. I just spoke to him on the phone.

256
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,546
I have to pick up something from him,

257
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,381
so I called,
and he said he's feeling sick.

258
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,050
He said he left it on his desk.
I'll go in and grab it.

259
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,760
- Oh, I see. Sure.
- Thank you.

260
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,806
I feel bad that he's sick.

261
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,352
I hope he feels better soon. Oh, dear.

262
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,316
There has to be some on the floor.

263
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,569
Nothing?

264
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,820
No hair around here? Oh!

265
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,365
Found one!

266
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,451
This isn't hair.

267
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,244
It's a metal wire. Jeez!

268
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,873
He must keep a toothbrush in his office.

269
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,713
What are you doing here?

270
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,131
Oh, Prosecutor Seo...

271
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,218
I was just... This orchid...

272
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,889
Well...

273
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,975
We received a report

274
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,728
about you.

275
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,108
- What is the report about?
- Well, it's...

276
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,655
I mean, it's...

277
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,992
You know what?
I'll be straightforward with you.

278
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,578
We found blood
that belongs to Oh Yeong-cheol's son

279
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,665
at the place
where Jang Sun-young was abducted.

280
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,293
His biological son, Oh Tae-jin,
who was believed to be dead.

281
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,218
I have a feeling that you may be

282
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,472
his son, Oh Tae-jin.

283
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,105
I know.

284
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,357
It sounds absurd, right?

285
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,442
I, too, think that it's an absurd idea,

286
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,530
but we have to work together,
so I don't want any misunderstandings.

287
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,909
Why don't you just take a DNA test
so that there are no misunderstandings?

288
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,963
I'm not sure
how to make sense of this situation.

289
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,883
You're investigating the allegation
on your own, off the record.

290
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,512
There's no evidence,
but you're targeting me

291
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,681
based on your instincts?

292
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,516
Is that how I should
interpret the situation?

293
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,979
Who's in charge of the investigation?

294
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,108
Well, it's...

295
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,028
If you have nothing to hide,

296
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,573
there's no reason for you
to not take a DNA test.

297
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,039
A DNA test?

298
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,790
What are you talking about?

299
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,334
Hello, sir.

300
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,587
So basically, some are speculating
that my son

301
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,380
might actually be someone else's son.

302
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:26,094
A serial killer's biological child,
to be exact. Am I right?

303
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,306
Am I right, Detective Park?

304
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,101
We did receive a tip regarding it, sir.

305
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,478
Give him what he needs.

306
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,816
We don't need to cooperate
with this ridiculous investigation.

307
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,151
Don't worry about it, Father.

308
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,111
Just give him what he needs,
so he can leave.

309
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,699
I'll give you mine too.
Take the samples and compare them.

310
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,493
Then you'll know for sure.

311
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,787
Yes, sir.

312
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,677
SEO JI-UK, SEO CHEON-SIK

313
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,640
A police officer

314
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,228
is asking us to cooperate to verify
a few things regarding an investigation.

315
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,438
We should cooperate, of course.

316
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,985
But if it turns out
that you were wrong about this,

317
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,613
then you'll definitely have to

318
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,449
take responsibility for it.

319
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,869
If Prosecutor Go is right,

320
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,832
it makes no sense
that Judge Seo is this confident.

321
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,293
SEO JI-UK, SEO CHEON-SIK

322
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,922
Whatever. The test results
will tell us the truth.

323
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,263
Yes, Prosecutor Go.

324
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,640
I got Prosecutor Seo and Judge Seo's
hair samples.

325
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,394
Are you giving up on everything?

326
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,273
Even if we don't cooperate,

327
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,150
they'll find a sample
of your hair somewhere.

328
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,613
Why did you let things get this messy?

329
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,286
I guess it's karma getting back at me.

330
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,079
I shouldn't blame anyone else.

331
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,978
At this critical time,

332
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,899
I'm here working as your secretary.

333
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:44,816
Unbelievable.

334
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,195
I understand how upsetting this can be,
but I couldn't cancel this.

335
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,405
Think about my social status.

336
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,823
And officially, you're jobless.

337
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,244
Now, you don't even hesitate
to call me "jobless" to my face.

338
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,622
As soon as I get my identity back,

339
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,081
- I'll--
- Hello, Mr. Choi.

340
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,084
How are things with Se-yeon's parents?

341
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,503
They're doing great

342
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,215
enjoying the clean air and water
as if they're on vacation?

343
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,426
I'm so glad to hear that.
Yes, please take good care of them.

344
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,554
Oh, please pay close attention
to their safety at all times.

345
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,556
Okay, thank you.

346
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,643
I'm sorry. Where were we?

347
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,437
What did you say you'll do
when you get your identity back?

348
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,900
I said I'll repay your kindness
and generosity.

349
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,111
Everyone at work knows
that you're my secretary,

350
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,821
so it won't look good if you aren't here.

351
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,908
They said it'll take some time
before the DNA test results come out,

352
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,701
so let's quickly check customer feedback

353
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,453
and go see Detective Park. Okay?

354
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,537
Fine.

355
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,087
Were there any complaints
about reactions or irritations?

356
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,171
No.

357
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,548
He's obviously doing this on purpose.

358
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,302
He knows that I like men
who are professional.

359
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,554
That's why he made me tag along.

360
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,682
But I must say,

361
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,227
he does look pretty hot when he's working.

362
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,481
Hey, look. Is he a model?

363
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,983
He's so handsome.

364
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,694
- That must be a new product.
- Let's go.

365
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,446
Please move the old products
over to that section.

366
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,573
- Hello, welcome.
- Hello.

367
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,493
This is our new limited-edition lip gloss
that came out today.

368
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,453
The color is vivid,
and it smells very good too.

369
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,373
Would you like to try it on?
It'll go well with your makeup.

370
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,293
- You think so?
- Jeez, he doesn't have to apply it...

371
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,128
Gosh, what is that?
What's up with that pout?

372
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,173
Look at that.
She'll eat up the whole product.

373
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,050
Do you want to take a look?

374
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,469
- Do you like it?
- It's really pretty.

375
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,346
- I'll take one.
- He's so handsome.

376
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,015
- May I try it on too?
- Sure.

377
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,349
- Apply it on me as well.
- Hello.

378
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,685
I mean, it's selling like hotcakes,

379
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,105
but they're here to buy makeup...

380
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,317
Why do they have to go on
about how handsome he is?

381
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,776
We'd like to try it on too.

382
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,361
- Then please wait in line.
- Really?

383
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,988
- Okay.
- Hey, I got here before you did.

384
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,032
What? They're lining up for that now?

385
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,327
Unbelievable. I'm impressed.

386
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,169
This is what it feels like to wait
for a girlfriend with her purse

387
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,420
in front of the ladies' room.

388
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,714
I'm totally enjoying it.

389
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,636
HEE-JIN

390
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,805
Hey, what's up?

391
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,560
Abyss? What about it?

392
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,315
Did you see that guy?
Doesn't he look like a model?

393
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,484
Yes, I saw him. He's very tall.

394
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,985
Isn't he so handsome?

395
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,115
Why are you asking about it...

396
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,658
Hello? Hee-jin...

397
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,494
What was that about?

398
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,458
I kept you waiting long, didn't I?
Let's go.

399
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,593
- Se-yeon.
- Yes?

400
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,595
Wait here. I have to run to a shop.

401
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,180
Why? What do you need?

402
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,642
Well, I just need ten...

403
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,186
No, five minutes should be enough.
I'll be right back.

404
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,397
Hey, you didn't even let me go
to the restroom alone.

405
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,315
- Why are you being like this now?
- It's--

406
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,067
I'll come too.
I want to check out the shop.

407
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,735
No, I'll be quick. Just wait a moment--

408
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,446
Let's go together.
Come on. Where is this shop?

409
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,156
I want to check it out too.

410
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,574
You want to come? Okay.

411
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,663
This one? This jewelry store?

412
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,206
What do you need to get?

413
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,167
Do what you need to do.
I'll just browse around.

414
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,839
My gosh, this is so pretty.
This is totally my style.

415
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,924
Won't this look great on me?

416
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,176
Yes, it's nice.

417
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,472
Here's the one we repaired for you.

418
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,100
Thank you.
How much do I owe you for the repairs?

419
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,601
Nothing. It's still under warranty.

420
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,646
I see, thank you. Let's go. I'm done.

421
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,189
- You're done?
- Yes.

422
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,858
They repaired my mom's necklace.

423
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,276
She asked me to pick it up.

424
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,613
So, you're really done?
You didn't forget anything? All done?

425
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,575
Yes. I told you I'd be right back.

426
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,993
- Let's go.
- Okay.

427
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:10,039
Doesn't your mother have a secretary?
Why did you have to...

428
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,625
Why did you have to pick it up?

429
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,961
Hello, Detective Park.

430
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,008
Sorry? She's gone?

431
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,802
<i>I don't want to inconvenience</i>

432
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,846
<i>or rely on anyone anymore.</i>

433
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,266
<i>I'll contact you
after things get sorted out.</i>

434
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,602
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

435
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,105
Since regaining
her consciousness in the morning,

436
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,149
she kept saying that
it was too stuffy in here.

437
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,194
She left to get some fresh air,

438
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,528
but I haven't seen her since.

439
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,449
I told her to stay put, but...
I'm really sorry.

440
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,410
I should've checked on her sooner.

441
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,287
Right.

442
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,832
I checked the security cameras
in the hospital,

443
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,751
but no one forced her anywhere.

444
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,504
Hee-jin pushed the wheelchair herself

445
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,214
and hailed a cab.

446
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,008
She's not even picking up.

447
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,260
Where in the world did she go?

448
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,763
She must've felt like
her life was in danger.

449
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,641
This time and the time before,

450
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,644
he keeps on finding her
no matter where she is.

451
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,647
It's hard for her
to trust those around her.

452
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,983
I doubt she has anywhere to go.

453
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,454
Su-jin?

454
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,749
Can you find out

455
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,710
where Oh Yeong-cheol is right now?

456
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,674
<i>Oh Yeong-cheol who evaded the police</i>

457
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,676
<i>while inspecting the crime scene</i>

458
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,302
<i>has been at large for five days.</i>

459
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,139
<i>The police is conducting
a nationwide search</i>

460
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,599
<i>and has distributed his photo,</i>

461
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,853
<i>but lack of tips and reports
are hampering the investigation.</i>

462
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,771
<i>Hwang Chi-heon brings us the story.</i>

463
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,526
<i>The police is yet to have
Oh Yeong-cheol in custody</i>

464
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,653
<i>even five days after
the unprecedented escape he made.</i>

465
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,614
<i>The public continues to criticize</i>

466
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,576
<i>the clumsy and poor police escort.</i>

467
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,078
<i>I am Hwang Chi-heon for</i> KBN News.

468
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,331
Maybe Oh Yeong-cheol is dead.

469
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,709
How can there be no sightings of him?

470
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,335
Tell me about it.

471
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,631
Where the hell is this rat hiding?

472
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,174
Go find him.

473
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,470
Be patient, guys.
I have a feeling we'll catch him soon.

474
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,972
Him and his pawn too.

475
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,687
- Hello, sir.
- Sir, what brings you by at this hour?

476
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,190
You crazy bastard!

477
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,152
Are you out of your mind?

478
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,740
How dare you call Seo Ji-uk
Oh Yeong-cheol's biological son?

479
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,867
You idiot.

480
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,120
Absurd claims should
at least sound believable.

481
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,957
Must I have received that
from Judge Seo himself?

482
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,376
The same judge who'll be
Chief Justice soon?

483
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,755
We're already in the doghouse
for letting Oh Yeong-cheol escape.

484
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,382
Are you trying to bury us all completely?

485
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,053
Is it your intention
to make us all look incompetent?

486
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,014
Unbelievable!

487
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,018
I can't even look at you right now,
so turn in your gun and leave.

488
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,271
Don't come back to work
until you're told to.

489
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,949
What now?

490
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,619
- Dong-cheol?
- Dong-cheol.

491
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,579
Shit.

492
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,584
EVIDENCE
SEO JI-UK

493
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,803
Prosecutor Seo is here.

494
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,312
JUDGE SEO CHEON-SIK

495
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,526
You took care of it, didn't you?

496
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,949
Thank you.

497
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,326
I didn't do it for you.

498
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,500
Anyway, I have an appointment.

499
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:34,887
<i>The test revealed
a DNA match of 99 percent.</i>

500
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,390
<i>How did he collect DNA
from the real Seo Ji-uk</i>

501
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,018
<i>and switch the samples?</i>

502
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,203
SUGYEONG NURSING HOME

503
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,626
Se-yeon.

504
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,170
Detective Park is calling you.

505
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,838
Okay.

506
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,926
Detective Park, what's up?

507
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,972
Sorry?

508
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:23,019
Could there have been
a mix-up with the samples?

509
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,063
<i>I'm afraid not. Also, Prosecutor Seo's DNA</i>

510
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,524
<i>doesn't match the blood sample's
from the abandoned factory.</i>

511
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,445
Okay, I get it for now.

512
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,533
Was that about Seo Ji-uk's DNA test?

513
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,036
Yes.

514
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,584
His DNA is a 99 percent match
to Judge Seo's.

515
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,211
They're father and son.

516
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,423
That can't be true.

517
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:54,926
Could...

518
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,844
my memory be faulty?

519
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,640
It's hard to trust
Ms. Jang's memory either,

520
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,060
- so maybe I rushed to a conclusion--
- No.

521
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,105
A number of things point to Seo Ji-uk.

522
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,859
Se-yeon, this is your murder case,
so how could you be wrong?

523
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,863
Let's be rational about this.

524
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,200
Seo Ji-uk is the office's top prosecutor

525
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,702
and Judge Seo is his legal family.

526
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,833
They could have easily
fabricated the test result.

527
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,754
Oh Yeong-cheol is still at large.

528
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,465
So getting Seo Ji-uk
to answer to his crimes

529
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,259
could take a while.

530
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,761
Let's stay strong, okay?

531
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,407
I know it's hard,
but try and get some sleep.

532
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,742
Gosh, I'm sorry.

533
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,453
My tossing and turning
must've woken you up.

534
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,251
I'm fine.
You're the one I'm worried about.

535
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,339
I just can't.
You should go to sleep without me.

536
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:30,521
OH YEONG-CHEOL
SEO CHEON-SIK

537
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,899
SEO JI-UK = OH TAE-JIN

538
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,868
Are you going somewhere?

539
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,204
- You can't sleep, can you?
- No.

540
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,998
Then come with me.

541
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,335
- I have something to show you.
- What?

542
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,674
What is this place?

543
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,553
It's so pretty. My gosh!

544
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,764
This isn't even the best part.

545
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,018
Ta-da.

546
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,479
Now that's what I call considerate.

547
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,901
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

548
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,285
It sure is refreshing.

549
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,330
It's beautiful.

550
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,416
It truly is.

551
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,628
- Are you glad you came?
- Yes.

552
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,973
I was reborn into a smaller figure
with an average face,

553
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,309
but I'm glad to be alive and by your side.

554
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,895
What do you mean small and average?

555
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,983
To me, you're the most
special and outstanding person.

556
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,861
These past few weeks
must have been difficult for you,

557
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,572
and I know it'll sound selfish,

558
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,160
but I'm happy these days.

559
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,830
That's why sometimes I feel sorry

560
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,541
and also guilty.

561
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,547
Still, I'm also grateful
that I can help you out.

562
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,717
That's how it's been for me.

563
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,386
I'm selfish, aren't I?

564
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,766
No, not really. But you do sound cheesy.

565
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,185
I'm only joking.

566
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,479
That's how I've been too.

567
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,316
This entire situation is absurd,

568
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,694
but I've been enjoying my life
with gratitude as well.

569
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,573
If I hadn't died
and been brought back to life,

570
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,035
I may have never lived
so passionately and honestly like this.

571
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,788
Especially when it comes to love.

572
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,419
I've never told you this before,

573
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,588
but I liked you a few times.

574
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,761
Don't be ridiculous.

575
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,471
When?

576
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,057
Freshman year in high school.

577
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,309
Why do you think I gave you chocolate
on Valentine's Day?

578
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,895
Anyway, that wasn't the last time

579
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,565
I was wavered by my feelings for you.

580
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,903
You really shouldn't lie
about these things.

581
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:29,492
Why do you think I stayed friends with you
for over 20 years then?

582
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,870
Then why did you turn me down
all those times?

583
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,955
I told you numerous times
that I liked you.

584
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,250
I was going to
after turning you down a few times,

585
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,835
but you'd soon give up

586
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:44,090
and tell me that
another man would suit me better.

587
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,217
You'd sound like a complete loser.

588
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,929
Then when I'm finally ready
to forget about you and move on,

589
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,597
you ask me out again.

590
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,141
You're the one who kept confusing me.

591
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,061
Come to think of it,
you played with my heart.

592
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,687
It's only because you kept rejecting me.

593
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,441
I liked you, but then I had to give up.

594
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,235
I mean...

595
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,779
Your rejections were so harsh.

596
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,240
What about now?
I haven't rejected you recently.

597
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,576
- What?
- Why aren't you asking me out?

598
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,620
We kissed,
and now we're sleeping together.

599
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,205
When are you going to ask me out?

600
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,333
I was just waiting for the right time.

601
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,420
And I'm telling you that this is the time.
Right this moment.

602
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,090
You never know when the timing is right.

603
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,299
Timing?

604
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,094
Okay, fine. Since we're being
honest with each other,

605
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,054
starting today...

606
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,561
Wait, isn't this...

607
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,354
You're so quick-witted

608
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,231
and naturally impatient.

609
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,819
It sure is hard to surprise
my prosecutor girlfriend.

610
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:33,115
You should've given me a hint
that you had this prepared.

611
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,576
I'm good at turning a blind eye, you know.

612
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,124
- Se-yeon.
- Yes?

613
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,337
We should...

614
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,048
stop being friends now.

615
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,511
Let's go steady instead.

616
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,058
If only you stopped
after giving me the necklace...

617
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,769
- Was that awful?
- Yes.

618
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,022
Wait. Hold on a second.

619
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,443
NOTES

620
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,196
You should enjoy your alone time
while you can.

621
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,405
- What?
- Before we get married.

622
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,119
Was that awful too?

623
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,289
That was truly horrendous.

624
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,334
Hold on. I wrote about 25 of these.

625
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,502
- Min.
- Yes?

626
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,090
Thank you.

627
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,301
I really...

628
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,014
I really like you, Se-yeon.

629
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,354
Will you be my girlfriend?

630
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,856
Yes, of course. I'll gladly be yours.

631
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,149
I won't reject you anymore.

632
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,068
Wasn't that a bit too fast?

633
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,611
In what way?

634
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,739
We've been pulling away
from each other for 20 years.

635
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,449
It's time we pulled each other in.

636
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,911
So can I have your beer?
I already finished mine.

637
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,746
Here.

638
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,171
A huge weight has been
lifted off my chest.

639
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,258
Hey, Min.

640
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,304
Do you think that alien
is watching us right now?

641
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,723
Wouldn't he?

642
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,100
He'd feel responsible
since he gave it to me.

643
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,937
I wish we could get another Abyss.

644
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,939
To do what?

645
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,444
With it, we'll revive
Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein

646
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,362
and get rich.

647
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,157
That is so like you.

648
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,868
Wouldn't it be nice to be millionaires?

649
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,202
Nothing trumps money.

650
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,788
A millionaire?
Money isn't everything, you know.

651
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,415
Then what is? Money is the best.

652
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,625
You.

653
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,877
Gosh, I hate this.

654
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,963
- You're my everything, Se-yeon!
- I hate it.

655
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,883
- Stop it.
- Se-yeon, you're my everything!

656
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,969
- Come back.
- Go away!

657
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,640
No, don't come any closer. Stop it.

658
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,433
Stop.

659
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,935
- You should put those on.
- These are too big.

660
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,679
Hello?

661
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,847
<i>Hello, this is Park Gi-man.</i>

662
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,308
How can I help you?

663
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,394
<i>I'd like to meet.</i>

664
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,690
Good, I'll see you this evening.

665
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,899
Bye.

666
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:09,081
- Mom...
- Gosh, are you all right?

667
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,291
Are you hurt in any way?

668
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,087
It's all right. I'm fine.
It was only a little bump.

669
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,588
- Mom...
- I'm not hurt at all.

670
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,465
I'm so sorry.

671
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,427
I didn't think of my daughter's speed,
and I was in a rush.

672
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,886
It's really all right. I'm sorry.

673
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,974
No, I'm the one who
should've paid better attention.

674
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,600
Just to be sure,

675
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,812
why don't you get checked out by a doctor?

676
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,938
Let me give you a ride.

677
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,691
No, it's fine.
I have to get home. It's urgent.

678
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,609
I'm really fine, so you can go your way.

679
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,610
Hold on though.

680
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,696
- Here's my business card.
- Right.

681
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,407
Please give me a call
if you develop any soreness.

682
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,826
Sure, thank you.
Again, I'm sorry about this.

683
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:46,827
Let's go.

684
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,911
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay!

685
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,955
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

686
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,918
Yes, it's me.

687
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,963
I think there's an easy way
to corner Park Gi-man.

688
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,856
Mr. Park Gi-man!

689
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,445
Yes? Just a second.

690
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,116
- Mr. Park Gi-man!
- Coming!

691
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,079
How can I help you?

692
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,664
Are you Park Gi-man?

693
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,459
Yes, that's me.

694
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,544
We're the police.

695
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,005
Your car was reported in
a hit-and-run accident.

696
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,382
- You need to come with us.
- A hit-and-run?

697
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,551
You have the right to an attorney

698
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,304
and you may appeal
to the terms of your arrest.

699
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,639
Please come with us.

700
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,433
I'm sorry, but there must be
a misunderstanding.

701
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,894
If so, it'll be cleared up
at the precinct.

702
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,771
But that's...

703
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,233
Just hear me out, all right?

704
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,275
You changed lanes

705
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,818
- without signaling first!
- I did.

706
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,196
- You didn't. I didn't see it.
- I did.

707
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,323
What do you mean I should've let you pass?

708
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,784
TRAFFIC CRIME INVESTIGATION

709
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,202
- Mr. Park.
- Yes?

710
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,662
Today around noon,

711
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,206
you ran down a woman with your car.

712
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,793
It wasn't anything serious.
There was barely any contact--

713
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,586
A little girl and her mother.

714
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,838
You were behind the wheel

715
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,884
when you drove into them with your car
that has the license plate of 56B7767.

716
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,177
Do you admit to that?

717
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,055
I only slightly bumped into the mother

718
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,223
and not the kid.

719
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:35,102
Also, I insisted that
she go to the hospital,

720
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,479
but she kept saying
that she was all right.

721
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,732
The lady said that
you didn't even give her a business card.

722
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,318
Whether you gave her one or not
doesn't matter.

723
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,946
You should've reported the accident
or took her to the hospital.

724
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,615
You have a lot of driving experience.

725
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,994
Didn't you know that
not reporting the accident

726
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,954
is considered a hit-and-run too?

727
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,207
That's why you took the black box
as evidence.

728
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,751
The footage will show that
I gave her my business card.

729
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,670
Yes, that black box.

730
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:05,007
There's no memory card in yours.

731
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,925
It's mandatory for taxi drivers.

732
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,093
That's another violation.

733
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,470
There's no memory card?

734
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,473
That's impossible. I check every morning.

735
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,726
So you admit to the charges?

736
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,812
First,

737
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,774
could I talk to the lady
before saying anything more?

738
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,776
She's been admitted to a hospital.

739
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,487
Since she's pregnant
and there may be secondary damage,

740
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,114
she refused any sort of contact.

741
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,992
Also, her family is pissed off that

742
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,286
you hit a pregnant woman and just left.

743
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,247
What

744
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,249
can I do then?

745
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,085
If you wish to hire an attorney,

746
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,211
I suggest you do that.

747
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,839
You can discuss it with your lawyer.

748
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,477
<i>The person you have reached
is unavailable.</i>

749
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,228
He won't pick up.

750
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,814
Don't you think it's a bit weird
that he's not showing up

751
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,691
when he was the one who asked to see us?

752
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,235
Do you think he's in trouble?

753
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,904
Maybe Oh Yeong-cheol--

754
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,366
He's wanted all over the country,
so he won't be getting around much.

755
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,620
- Where's Park Gi-man?
- We can't reach him.

756
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,789
Could you ask the nearby station

757
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,707
to go check on his house, just in case?

758
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,708
All right.

759
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,836
Oh, and I checked the call history log

760
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,630
on Prosecutor Seo's burner phone again

761
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,799
and the last call was to the hospital.

762
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,259
The place where Ms. Jang Sun-young
was hospitalized.

763
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,513
Does that mean...
the sudden change of hospitals...

764
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,892
NEW MESSAGE: HEE-JIN

765
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,936
<i>I need to tell you something.</i>

766
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,896
<i>Could we meet up?</i>

767
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,067
SE-YEON

768
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,985
Is this enough?

769
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,613
Yes.

770
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,366
Now you're acting like my daughter.

771
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,328
And the time and location
is the same as you promised?

772
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,248
Sure.
Do you think she's suspecting anything?

773
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,209
We spent too much time together for that.

774
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:09,589
You're going to keep your promise
when we're done with this, right?

775
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,092
Yes, of course.

776
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:16,430
I despise anyone who can't keep a promise.

777
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,563
If we can just get through today,

778
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,900
you, your mother, and I...

779
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,820
We can all start a new life.

780
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,406
You can do this, right?

781
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:37,951
Of course.

782
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,252
It's so weird that he just disappeared,

783
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,838
and I'm worried about
Hee-jin and her mother, too.

784
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,548
We can't be too hasty.

785
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,675
Hee-jin might be setting us up again.

786
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,511
He's right.
I've sent the patrols over there.

787
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,473
Are you headed there?

788
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,683
Okay, we'll be on our way.

789
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,894
Let's go.

790
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,193
It's this way!

791
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,237
Where are you? Have you guys arrived?

792
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,409
This is the police.

793
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,244
Someone reported that a suspect is here.

794
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,964
Where is Go Se-yeon?

795
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,807
Who...

796
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,686
Is there a long-stay patient here
who goes by the name Jang Sun-young?

797
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,604
No.

798
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,611
- You.
- Wait up, Se-yeon...

799
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,571
Let go of me!

800
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,907
Get back up. Go on.

801
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,243
Damn it...

802
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,288
Where are my handcuffs? Wait here.

803
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,165
- Here you go, sir.
- Give them to me. Hurry!

804
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:34,210
Ms. Kim Mi-ja. You are under arrest.

805
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,763
Se-yeon.

806
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,974
<i>He knew that I could see Abyss,</i>

807
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,101
<i>so he kidnapped my mom
to take advantage of me.</i>

808
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:54,314
<i>Fortunately enough,
he doesn't really know how to use it.</i>

809
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,484
<i>I'm going to take advantage of that
and use it against him.</i>

810
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,947
<i>Please tell Min
that I'm sorry for everything.</i>

811
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,115
<i>I also want to thank you
for all you've done.</i>

812
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,284
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

813
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,746
Se-yeon

814
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,123
isn't coming.

815
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,211
What did you say?

816
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,673
And I won't be saving you with Abyss,

817
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,591
either.

818
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,145
Didn't I tell you?

819
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:39,693
I despise anyone who can't keep a promise.

820
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,948
How dare you, you bitch...

821
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,122
You didn't know that
I used to be a pickpocket, did you?

822
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,585
I heard that this thing
can kill you within minutes.

823
00:54:58,712 --> 00:54:59,879
Is that true?

824
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,091
How dare you, you bitch...

825
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:09,639
- Give that back.
- Step away from me!

826
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,100
I'd rather die,

827
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,395
than ever help you again.

828
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:29,576
Do you really think
you're capable of that?

829
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,961
She won't pick up.

830
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,672
That crazy brat!

831
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,090
How could she use herself as bait?

832
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,676
Do you have any idea
about where she might be?

833
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,847
Damn it, why did I have to be
put on probation now?

834
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,599
Wait.

835
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,768
I think I know how we can track her.

836
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:55,894
What?

837
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,785
Hello?

838
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,203
<i>Mom.</i>

839
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,705
<i>Can you still track where Hee-jin is?</i>

840
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,750
No, it's just that...

841
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,504
I did tell them to stop tracking her,

842
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,339
but...

843
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,884
They said the application
can't be deleted like...

844
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,638
Hey, I'm not like that!

845
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,264
I won't ever do it again!

846
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,599
Could you do it one more time?

847
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,726
What?

848
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,815
Damn it!

849
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,237
I got it. It's not far from here.

850
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,198
- Hey!
- Did your mom tell you?

851
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,235
Your mother is locked up

852
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,363
somewhere in this building.

853
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,408
I'm the only one

854
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,452
who knows the password.

855
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,248
Why is my mom...

856
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,336
Tae-jin is my only son, you know.

857
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,256
Did you really trust him?

858
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:57,056
If you don't want your mother to suffer,

859
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,643
you better think fast.

860
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,240
What's going on?

861
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,618
Someone reported that
this was Oh Yeong-cheol's hideout,

862
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,287
but we lost contact of the person
who reported it.

863
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,501
Oh Yeong-cheol! I'm going to kill you

864
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,085
if you lay a finger on Hee-jin!

865
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,297
Hee-jin! Jang Hee-jin!

866
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,091
No!

867
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,517
If I can be revived
to look like someone else

868
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,144
before the police get to us,

869
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,314
I'll be able to escape.

870
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,110
Now...

871
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,613
You'll just have to

872
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,992
revive me with this thing.

873
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,541
Your plan was wrong
from the very beginning.

874
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,753
That's what your soul looks like.

875
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:55,133
You're not going to look any different,
no matter how many times you're revived.

876
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,470
Oh, and one more thing.

877
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:04,017
Cha Min is the only one
who can bring you back to life.

878
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,694
IF THE TEMPORARY OWNER OF ABYSS DIES

879
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:18,906
ABYSS RETURNS TO ITS ORIGINAL OWNER

880
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,496
Jang Hee-jin!

881
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,123
Follow me. Come on.

882
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,548
No, don't!

883
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,724
Why don't we

884
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,477
both just die here?

885
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,813
For everyone's sake.

886
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,661
Hey, you guys, go that way.

887
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,704
- The rest of you, follow me.
- Yes, sir.

888
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,520
Dong-cheol!

889
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,231
Dong-cheol!

890
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,823
Call in the ambulance
and the rest of the squad.

891
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:42,824
Yes, sir.

892
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,830
- Hee-jin!
- Hee-jin!

893
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,873
- Jang Hee-jin! Hee-jin!
- Hee-jin!

894
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,502
She's breathing. Hee-jin!

895
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,548
- Oh no...
- Hee-jin...

896
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,641
Hee-jin?

897
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,405
What about my mom?

898
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,995
She wasn't anywhere...

899
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,457
in the building.

900
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,086
Why did you come out here?

901
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,547
Let's go. You need to rest.

902
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,218
Come on.

903
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,111
Careful.

904
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,786
Could I talk to you for a minute,
Prosecutor Go?

905
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,373
Sure.

906
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,841
- What's going on?
- Is she dead?

907
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,676
- What is it?
- Oh my gosh...

908
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,010
What is it?

909
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,639
- Excuse me, sorry.
- Excuse us.

910
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,057
I'm the...

911
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,518
- I'm...
- Move over. Let them in.

912
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:16,644
I...

913
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,410
- Please keep your hands off.
- It's all right.

914
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,695
What's wrong with Oh Yeong-cheol?
Didn't you check on him?

915
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,655
- We just did, sir!
- Damn it!

916
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,368
<i>Please save my mom.</i>

917
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,496
You saved Se-yeon and me, too.
Why can't you save my mom?

918
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,414
<i>Please save her...</i>

919
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:26,625
Do you know how many people
witnessed her body?

920
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,128
Step down from everything and leave.

921
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,505
Do you know how much I struggled

922
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,841
<i>to live up to your expectations?</i>

923
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:37,136
<i>It won't be the end for just me.</i>

924
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,304
Bear that in mind.

925
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,638
<i>You think I'm not capable?</i>

926
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,307
You think you'll get the best of me?

927
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,225
How did this end up with Go Se-yeon?

928
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,518
- Se-yeon...
- Let go!

929
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,561
<i>Just you wait.</i>

930
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:49,273
I'm going to reveal your disgusting self
whatever it takes.

931
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,278
