1
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,211
Cha Min.

2
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,965
Will you marry me?

3
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,264
Well...

4
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,850
the ring is not really my type.

5
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,019
What?

6
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,022
Are you turning me down
because of this ring?

7
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,398
No.

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,402
I'm going to be yours forever.

9
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,989
Come here.

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,033
I love you, Go Se-yeon.

11
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,744
Me, too.

12
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,312
What?

13
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,857
Here.

14
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,110
- What's this?
- You lost your phone last time.

15
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,863
My gosh.

16
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,366
Thanks. I'll put this to good use.

17
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,494
Hey, stay here for a second.

18
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,787
What?

19
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,425
- It's done.
- What did you do?

20
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,888
I just took a few photos of you
to save on my phone.

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,891
Why don't we take a photo together
since we're wearing matching sweatshirts?

22
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,809
- Us together?
- Yes.

23
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:23,810
Sure.

24
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,231
One, two, three!

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,858
Hey, gosh.

26
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,406
Look at you. You're getting
so good at these corny things.

27
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,074
See? I got your whole face in the frame.

28
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,576
This one looks good.

29
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,161
Shall we take one more?

30
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,704
All right.

31
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,208
One, two, three.

32
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,379
EPISODE 16

33
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,933
I told you that you can't look.
Just focus on yours.

34
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,810
- I'm done.
- Already?

35
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,103
- Yes.
- Why is yours so short?

36
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,774
By the way, who buries
time capsules these days?

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,278
Right, you were a huge fan of Jun Ji-hyun
back in middle school.

38
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,698
"Gyeon-u, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,658
I guess I'm a typical woman after all."

40
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,784
Identical, right? Remember?

41
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,827
- Back then,
- "Gyeon-u--"

42
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,829
burying time capsules
was the biggest trend.

43
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,873
I know. I jumped on the bandwagon too.

44
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,167
I wonder how many I buried.

45
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,210
Probably about five.

46
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,922
But I don't even remember
where I buried them.

47
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,298
I bet so many people are like me.

48
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:41,137
But don't you think even a year
is too long for this day and age?

49
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,015
Would a month be too short?

50
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,268
Then how about 100 days? Let's open them
on our 100th-day anniversary.

51
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,605
Waiting is the best and the most
meaningful part of this whole experience.

52
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,732
If a decade is too long,

53
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,984
let's just do five years.

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,985
- Five years?
- Yes.

55
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,029
Right. Whether it's five or ten years,

56
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,449
it doesn't matter because we'll be
together for the rest of our lives.

57
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,284
I guess we can make it longer this time.

58
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,332
By the way, what's going on here?

59
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,292
How come mine is smaller than yours?

60
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,962
I have a lot of stuff to put in.

61
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,798
You probably don't have a lot of stuff,
so I got you a small one.

62
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,300
Shall I go bring a bigger one?

63
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,261
No, this is all I have.

64
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,012
I knew it.

65
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,975
What do you have in yours?
Why is it so big?

66
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,226
Hey, don't.

67
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,727
It's nothing.

68
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,023
I know a good spot
where we can bury these.

69
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,987
There.

70
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,532
My dad and I planted this tree together
when I was little.

71
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,617
- Let's bury them here.
- Sure.

72
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,541
My dad will be watching from heaven,

73
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,835
so don't you even think
of digging them up alone.

74
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,087
All right.

75
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,006
- I'll bury them, then.
- Okay.

76
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,549
Wait! Just a second.

77
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,176
What is it?

78
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,512
Well...

79
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,681
There.

80
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,933
- Now, I'm ready.
- Jeez.

81
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,643
You called me childish and old-fashioned.

82
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,812
Well, it looked like you put
some objects in yours,

83
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,439
so I wanted to put in something too.

84
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,150
- I'll really bury them now.
- Okay.

85
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,658
Are you going to be finished
before the end of the day?

86
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,036
- Yes, just a minute.
- A minute?

87
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,329
Yes.

88
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,496
Gosh, hang on.

89
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,999
- Hey, look.
- What?

90
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,375
With the soil...

91
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,212
Why don't you do this?
Isn't your method exhausting?

92
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,424
This is all you have to do.
You'll be done in no time. It's done.

93
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,885
- Well...
- Use your brain, Min.

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,104
Did you get it?

95
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,948
And take this too.

96
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,622
Thanks.

97
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,838
GPS TRACKER

98
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,383
The amusement park is closed for the day,
so we should come back another time.

99
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,929
But I must say, it's a little spooky here
with all the lights out.

100
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,263
Let's get out of here.

101
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,252
This is so beautiful.

102
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,171
I didn't want to put off
the number one thing on my bucket list.

103
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,423
My goodness.

104
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,057
No, please. No!

105
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,195
Look at you.

106
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,660
- Come at me.
- Go away.

107
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,663
Gosh, what's happening now?

108
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,044
Catch me if you can!

109
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,095
Amusement parks are so much fun
when you don't have to wait in line!

110
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,265
It's now time to enjoy the highlight
of this experience.

111
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,434
- What is it?
- Ta-da!

112
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,229
Hey, did you rent that thing?

113
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,149
I totally screwed up the surprise event
I prepared for you last time.

114
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,735
- So this time, I did my very best.
- Seriously?

115
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,820
- Hello!
- Hello!

116
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,946
Hello.

117
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,784
- It looks so good!
- Here you go.

118
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,119
- Thank you.
- No problem.

119
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,749
- Is it good?
- Here you go.

120
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,791
- Thank you.
- No problem.

121
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,335
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

122
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,545
- Bye.
- Bye.

123
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:34,347
Amusement parks
always reminded me of my dad,

124
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,975
but it'll make me think of one more person
from now on.

125
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,605
It's nice.

126
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,565
- What's nice?
- What?

127
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,860
To know that you're thinking of me
each time you take a step.

128
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,449
I'm going to make you think of me
everywhere you go.

129
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,745
Then we should travel around the globe
for our honeymoon.

130
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,663
Right?

131
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,749
I'll be jobless when I get back though.

132
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,752
Hey, I can support both of us financially.

133
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,504
I'm competent... My gosh!

134
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,382
- Oh, no.
- What a waste!

135
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,176
The ice cream isn't important.
You ruined this sweatshirt.

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,803
I can just wipe it off.

137
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,015
Hey, go back there and ask them
to make a new one for me.

138
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,684
I'll go wash this off in the restroom.

139
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,018
- All right, be quick.
- Okay!

140
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,108
Hey, are you sure he's here?

141
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:31,028
Yes, they confirmed
that the motorcycle entered this place.

142
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,155
- Let's go.
- Guys, stay alert.

143
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,115
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,503
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

145
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,547
- You guys can wrap up.
- Okay.

146
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,798
Thanks again.

147
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,052
I'm so clumsy.

148
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,889
- Se-yeon!
- Min!

149
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,191
If you come any closer, I'll shoot her.

150
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,620
- Wear it.
- Do I have to wear this?

151
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,749
My gosh, I'm really sorry.

152
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,375
- I apologize.
- Please be careful.

153
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,378
- Yes, I will. I apologize again.
- It's okay.

154
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,296
Are you all right?

155
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,015
Seo Ji-uk.

156
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,184
This won't change anything.

157
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,810
Drop the gun.

158
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,231
What do you want?

159
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,401
- If you tell me what you want--
- Why must you keep causing trouble?

160
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,825
- You guys brought this upon yourselves.
- Isn't this...

161
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,330
what you're after?

162
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,792
You can never hide your crime
as long as this exists.

163
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,670
I'm going to revive everyone
that you've killed

164
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,296
and make them testify against you.

165
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,173
Really?

166
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,634
You won't be able to if I kill you.

167
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,849
All right.

168
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,435
Kill me, then.

169
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,563
But I won't die

170
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,609
because I own this marble.

171
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,947
Didn't Oh Yeong-cheol tell you?

172
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,874
Go ahead and try if you don't believe me.

173
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,059
- What was that?
- Over there. That way.

174
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,755
Se-yeon.

175
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,220
Min...

176
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,097
Don't talk. Don't say anything.

177
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,932
Mr. Cha!

178
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,975
Mr. Cha!

179
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,727
What happened?

180
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,652
My car is parked right by the entrance.
Take her to the hospital now.

181
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,101
I'm not doing this
because I care about you.

182
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,770
I'm only doing it
to take you down for good.

183
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,023
Over here.

184
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,485
- This man here.
- He's been shot.

185
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,814
Se-yeon.

186
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,817
Yes.

187
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,153
Min.

188
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,325
Thank God. I'm so relieved.

189
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,579
- You're okay, right?
- Yes.

190
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,624
I was so scared.

191
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,168
I thought I might never see you again,

192
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,295
and it terrified me so much.

193
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,473
Hey.

194
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,017
Did you use Abyss on me?

195
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,604
Does it mean you can't use it again?

196
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,732
Then what's going to happen now?

197
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,986
No matter what happens,

198
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,365
it's not your fault, okay?

199
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:52,868
What?

200
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,412
What do you mean?

201
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,915
Why are you saying that?

202
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,000
What's going on?

203
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,016
What... What is happening?

204
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,400
This was my decision

205
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,402
and my choice.

206
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,821
What... What choice?

207
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,699
- What are you talking about?
- Even if I'm not around,

208
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,786
stay strong and brave
just like you've always been, okay?

209
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,373
Don't be sad for too long.

210
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,876
Because I could revive you,

211
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,630
I'm very happy even at this very moment.

212
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,966
So please...

213
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,096
Live your life to the fullest
and be happier for my sake.

214
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,973
Okay?

215
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,100
No, I don't want to.

216
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,854
You said you'd always be by my side.

217
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,398
You promised me that you'd keep me safe!

218
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,319
I'm sorry I'm leaving you behind.

219
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,574
I love you so much, Se-yeon.

220
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,325
Min.

221
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,077
Min, I love you too.

222
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,204
Don't go. Why are you being like this?

223
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,957
Min! Don't go. Don't leave me.

224
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,208
Min!

225
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,005
Min.

226
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,015
Prosecutor Go.

227
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,685
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay, Se-yeon?

228
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,064
Where's Min?

229
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,982
Where is he?

230
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,160
It seems like he knew.

231
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,704
I think

232
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,415
he was prepared for a situation like this.

233
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,548
VOICE MAIL

234
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,882
<i>Detective Park.</i>

235
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,677
<i>I'm taking Se-yeon to my vacation home.</i>

236
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,180
If you can't get a hold of me,

237
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,891
move her to somewhere safe immediately.

238
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,103
I'll probably be gone

239
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,814
by the time you arrive.

240
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,402
<i>If I must pay for using Abyss,</i>

241
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,780
<i>it is something that I'll have to endure.</i>

242
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,119
<i>But it hasn't happened yet,
so I'm staying hopeful.</i>

243
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,079
I'll save Se-yeon

244
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,208
and find another way to be with her again.

245
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,253
I'll make sure to come back.

246
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,925
I went to his vacation home
after hearing this message.

247
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,428
When I arrived, you were passed out.

248
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,556
There were no traces...

249
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,350
of Director Cha.

250
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,228
I have no idea what happened.

251
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,698
Gosh, it's so hot in here.

252
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,575
What do you think? It's nice, right?

253
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,285
Yes, ma'am. It's so nice.

254
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,078
I have a good eye, you know.

255
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,290
You sure do. The color is so lovely.

256
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,210
Anyone would know
that this room belongs to newlyweds.

257
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,339
This isn't for Ms. Lee.

258
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,674
I had to get a new comforter for Min.

259
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,968
Gosh, what are you thinking?

260
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,265
Ma'am.

261
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,518
Mr. Cha has gone missing.

262
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,856
What?

263
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,192
Ma'am.

264
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,417
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes, ma'am.

265
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,295
Tell everyone at the company

266
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,591
that I sent Min
on a long-term business trip abroad.

267
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,509
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,387
Keep an eye on the shareholders
and make sure they don't revolt.

269
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,346
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,515
Min...

271
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,102
went through something
even worse than this.

272
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,061
- Totally.
- Yes, ma'am.

273
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,896
He was pinned as a murder suspect.

274
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,817
People talked about his corpse turning up

275
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,319
and spewed utter nonsense,
but he came back unscathed.

276
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,612
That's right.

277
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,072
He'll return safely again.

278
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,909
Just like that time,
he'll come back unscathed once again.

279
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,119
Yes, absolutely.

280
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,912
So... Ms. Park.

281
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,498
Yes, ma'am. What can I do?
I'll do anything.

282
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,458
Go fix a meal, please.

283
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,460
- Pardon?
- Pardon me?

284
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,004
I won't go down like this.

285
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,548
As his mother, I must stay strong.

286
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,467
- You need to pull yourself together too.
- Yes, ma'am!

287
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,054
At times like this,
we have to stay strong and focused.

288
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,723
Bring me some food!

289
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,182
- Yes, ma'am!
- Right away, ma'am!

290
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,859
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

291
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,655
Will you be all right?

292
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,866
Yes, I'll be fine.

293
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,828
I must witness Seo Ji-uk going down
with my own two eyes.

294
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,580
All right.

295
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,889
DEFENSE ATTORNEY, DEFENDANT

296
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,974
The judge is entering.

297
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,983
JUDGE

298
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,444
Please be seated.

299
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,160
Case number 2019-646.

300
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,454
We will now begin the sentencing hearing.

301
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,372
Prosecution, you may begin.

302
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,417
On May 7, the defendant, Seo Ji-uk,

303
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,170
aided and abetted the murder
of Go Se-yeon committed

304
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,631
by the Eomsan-dong serial killer,
Oh Yeong-cheol,

305
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,258
at the victim's residence
located in Chungdang-dong, Seodo-gu.

306
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,637
He inflicted a fatal blow on the victim,
who was still alive,

307
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,639
and concealed evidence of his crime.

308
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,934
Then he abused his authority
as a prosecutor and manipulated

309
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,602
evidence and witnesses

310
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,104
to sidetrack the investigation.

311
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,523
He also instigated Choe Gi-hun
to commit murder.

312
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,025
After that, he killed him
and staged his death as a suicide.

313
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,236
I'd like to bring in Park Dong-cheol,

314
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,530
the detective in charge of the case,
as a witness.

315
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,085
We found a suicide note
in Choe Gi-hun's car,

316
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,878
and the initial analysis

317
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,214
concluded
that it was the victim's handwriting.

318
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,094
But after that, we caught onto
a few things that arouse suspicion.

319
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,679
Then during further investigations,

320
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,433
we found evidence that showed even
the victim's journals were tampered with.

321
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,811
Such circumstantial evidence

322
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,605
can't be used to prove
that the defendant murdered the victim.

323
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,524
He hasn't finished
answering the question yet.

324
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,610
Sustained. Witness, please continue.

325
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,072
It's all right. I understand.

326
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,909
On the day Mr. Seo got arrested,

327
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,329
we also arrested a crime syndicate that
provided him with the illegal firearm.

328
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,331
And in the ledger that we seized
from them,

329
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,334
we found paperwork
for the burner phone, which was found

330
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,587
at the scene of Choe Gi-hun's murder.

331
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,341
Prosecution, do you have
any additional questions?

332
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,885
No, Your Honor.

333
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,345
Defense, do you have any questions
for the witness?

334
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,265
No, Your Honor.

335
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,018
Prosecution,
request a sentence for the defendant.

336
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,272
The defendant committed a heinous crime,

337
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,858
where he colluded with a serial killer
and killed his colleague

338
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,735
in a brutal manner.

339
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,821
And he continued to deny
his involvement in the crime

340
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,365
and killed another victim
without any remorse

341
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,075
just to conceal his past crimes.

342
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,662
I believe we should isolate him
from society

343
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,582
as a preventive measure and deterrent
for all judicial officers.

344
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,920
Hence, according to Article 250,
155, and 147 of the Criminal Act,

345
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,547
he is guilty of murder,
destruction of evidence, helping escape,

346
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,175
abandonment of corpse,
and abandonment of duties.

347
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,010
Ergo, I ask you to impose on the defendant

348
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,386
a death sentence.

349
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,395
Cut the crap.

350
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,273
This is bullshit!

351
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,901
Go Se-yeon isn't dead.

352
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,445
Let go! Go Se-yeon is not dead.

353
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,947
She was revived.

354
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,324
Look, right there. Let go!

355
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,493
She's right there.

356
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,745
Go Se-yeon isn't dead.
She's alive right here!

357
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,497
She's alive, so I didn't kill her.

358
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,332
Go Se-yeon is not dead!

359
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,181
- When did you start planning this?
- Make a comment!

360
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,641
Say a few words!

361
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,935
Do you admit killing her?

362
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,115
Father... Father!

363
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,533
Father, I'm innocent!

364
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,243
You know that. Father!

365
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,008
Well...

366
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,094
I completely understand
how devastated you must be.

367
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,514
But Mr. Cha promised that he'll return,

368
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,809
so you should stay strong
and wait for him.

369
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,686
Dong-cheol is right.

370
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,397
We all know that he's not an ordinary man.

371
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,317
I mean, he brought you back
from the dead twice

372
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,652
using Abyss or whatever it's called.

373
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,821
He'll find a way to return.

374
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,116
Let's believe in him
and wait for him together.

375
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,911
And when he's back,

376
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,581
you two can live happily together

377
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:09,127
like any other normal couple
just as you wished.

378
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,422
For now, just focus on
how you'll make that happen.

379
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,217
Just believing in him
and living your life to the fullest

380
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,596
is the best thing you can do
at the moment.

381
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,978
I've been doing some thinking.

382
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,064
I think

383
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,317
there's something you need to do first.

384
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,863
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT

385
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,158
CONCLUSION: 99.99% MATCH

386
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,330
Is this true?

387
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,503
Does this mean that my daughter, Se-yeon,

388
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,631
actually came back to life?

389
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,096
- Se-yeon...
- I shrouded her

390
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,265
and held her funeral myself.

391
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,478
Do you actually expect us to believe this?

392
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,564
I know that it'll be hard for you
to believe me, Dad.

393
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,735
But I can prove it to you.

394
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,613
I look like a completely different person,

395
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,784
but I am your daughter, Go Se-yeon.

396
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,079
We checked and confirmed everything.

397
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,125
She is Prosecutor Go Se-yeon.

398
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,128
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

399
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,130
Why...

400
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,341
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

401
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:41,845
Se-yeon...

402
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,638
Mom...

403
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,934
I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner.

404
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,606
How have you been?
What have you been up to?

405
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,568
Mom, I'm sorry...

406
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,864
I'm so sorry, Mom. I really am.

407
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,070
She said she'd be okay
because she had been through this before.

408
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,408
She even ate a huge meal,
saying she must stay strong as his mother,

409
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,661
but she ended up fainting.

410
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,749
Can you...

411
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,668
Can you really not get a hold of Min?

412
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,837
Last time he went missing,

413
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,507
you were able to get a hold of him.

414
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,557
There was that whole debacle last time,

415
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,227
but he came back unscathed.

416
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,812
I'm sure it'll be the same.

417
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,273
You know, no news is good news, right?

418
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,319
Right.

419
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,200
Please let me know when Ms. Eom wakes up.

420
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,619
- I'd like to come by and check up on her.
- Sure.

421
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,162
Also,

422
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,041
could I stop by Min's room on my way out?

423
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,418
Yes, of course. Let's go.

424
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,795
Thanks.

425
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,590
It doesn't suit this room at all.

426
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,175
Don't you remember?

427
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,552
- What?
- You gave it to me.

428
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,972
On Valentine's Day,
junior year of high school.

429
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,184
You said you got too many chocolates
and gave me one.

430
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,549
No, don't cry.

431
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,389
Se-yeon, don't you cry.

432
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,766
You promised to believe
with all your heart.

433
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,896
Don't cry.

434
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,860
Are you in there?

435
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,666
This...

436
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,420
It's Min's phone.

437
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,840
The police looked into it,

438
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,428
but they couldn't find anything
that'll indicate where he is.

439
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,888
Right.

440
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,640
But Se-yeon...

441
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,810
I mean...

442
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,356
Ms. Lee, I think you should hold onto it.

443
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,701
Right.

444
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,623
All right, I get it.
I won't skip my meals.

445
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,543
<i>Don't you cry all day and skip your meals.</i>

446
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,254
<i>Do you remember what I said last time?</i>

447
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,506
I said I got it.

448
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,551
Don't worry about me and take your time.

449
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,095
Sure.

450
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,402
Didn't I leave this in Min's room?

451
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,949
Maybe it follows its owner.

452
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,710
PHOTOS

453
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,727
Seriously?

454
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,521
When did he take this?

455
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,191
Gosh, Min.

456
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,780
<i>What's there to dislike?</i>

457
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,990
<i>There's no one like you.</i>

458
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,036
<i>You loved Se-yeon to bits.</i>

459
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,748
<i>You're good at your job.
You come from a good family.</i>

460
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,458
<i>And you're kindhearted.</i>

461
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,295
<i>Well, you weren't exactly handsome.</i>

462
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,923
<i>But that's only a small part.</i>

463
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:40,346
<i>Let me tell you this man to man.
You're a decent guy.</i>

464
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,143
<i>What are you doing?</i>

465
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,770
<i>You've never complimented me.</i>

466
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,438
<i>I'm so happy that I want to record it.</i>

467
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,441
<i>- Put that away.
- Come on. Can you keep going?</i>

468
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,407
<i>Se-yeon, did you hear that?
Your father approves of me.</i>

469
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,411
<i>Our wedding's good to go if you say yes.</i>

470
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,914
<i>So don't think about making me wait</i>

471
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,625
<i>and just put on that ring, got it?</i>

472
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,961
- Min.
- Yes?

473
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,588
Over here.

474
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,756
If your father suddenly changes his mind,

475
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,425
I'll show him this.

476
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,511
I love you so much, Se-yeon.

477
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,649
<i>I love you so much, Se-yeon.</i>

478
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,323
We're so worried about you that...

479
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,164
What's wrong?

480
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,419
I miss Min so much.

481
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,049
I can't live without him.

482
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,433
I really can't. What should I do?

483
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,686
I don't think I can do it.

484
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,026
What should I do?

485
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,862
What now?

486
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,909
I miss him so much.

487
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:56,941
THREE YEARS LATER

488
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,412
I told you that it should've been
Go and Do's Law Firm.

489
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,914
It has syllables from both our names,

490
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,749
and it can mean more than one thing.

491
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,919
"Lee Mi-do's Law Firm"? How silly.

492
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,799
If you want your name on the door,
pay for the rent.

493
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,928
You're the one
who asked me to work with you.

494
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,847
The commute is exhausting,

495
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,682
but I still accepted your offer.

496
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,559
But then again,

497
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,603
you were fired twice already
because of your temper.

498
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,398
Besides,
I went out of the city on purpose.

499
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,066
What's good about working in Seoul?

500
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,152
How are you going to explain

501
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,404
that you look different
to people you know?

502
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,614
It wasn't that ideal.

503
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,744
Please come on in. Excuse me!

504
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,704
Guys, it's this way.

505
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,582
This law firm is run by the best lawyers.

506
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,500
They win almost all of their cases.

507
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,337
Do you know Korea's
best law firm Park & Jang?

508
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,505
- Yes.
- She was one of its attorneys.

509
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,550
- Why don't you head inside?
- Come on in.

510
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,178
You can all consult them one at a time.

511
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,221
Please head on inside.

512
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,598
Make yourselves comfortable.

513
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,309
- Who are these people?
- I brought some people

514
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,227
from the station who needed lawyers.

515
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,483
What kind of a husband would I be
if I didn't help out my wife?

516
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,028
My goodness!
Whose husband is this competent?

517
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,112
Mi-do's husband!

518
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,073
Guys.

519
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,451
Technically speaking,
you're not her husband until tomorrow.

520
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,579
Exactly. I'll be a married woman tomorrow.

521
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,664
Wouldn't it be all right
to take the day off?

522
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,042
Since that's the case,

523
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,837
you should start with the consultations.

524
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,672
But there are so many of them--

525
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,007
- Wish you luck.
- Hold on.

526
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,468
- Keep up the good work.
- Are you hungry? Do you need anything?

527
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,345
- Let's go for pigs' feet.
- Sounds good!

528
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,181
Just today? You're always like that.

529
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,017
Just a second!

530
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,903
DONGBU POLICE STATION

531
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,824
My gosh. Look at you.

532
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,076
- Stop taking pictures.
- It's not me, you know.

533
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,787
The phone's taking photos by itself
since you're so beautiful.

534
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,039
- Stop it.
- My gosh.

535
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,543
Se-yeon!

536
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,546
I'm glad you're here, Prosecutor Go.

537
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,258
I'm not a prosecutor anymore.
You should address me casually.

538
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,301
How should I call you? Sister-in-law?

539
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,388
Or Ms. Se-yeon?

540
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,765
- Se-yeon's good.
- Sure, Se-yeon.

541
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,600
That's much better.

542
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,936
Can the groom come with me?

543
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,647
Sure. I'll get going then.
See you later, Se-yeon.

544
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,982
- Sure.
- I'm nervous.

545
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,191
See you later!

546
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:50,656
My gosh.
You look exceptionally beautiful today.

547
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,158
- Really?
- Yes.

548
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,579
Will you be okay living on your own again?

549
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,289
Yes, I'm fine.

550
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:02,084
I was sick and tired of Detective Park
coming over after drinking anyway.

551
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm happy to never see that again.

552
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,256
Still, you should just move closer to us.

553
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,010
I don't get why you're
going back to that house after all that.

554
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,429
I wouldn't even live there for free.

555
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,140
He should know where to find me.

556
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,392
What?

557
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,729
I changed the locks to the house though.

558
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,064
I have second and third
security measures now.

559
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,234
I'll come by often then instead.

560
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,611
Sure. That reminds me.

561
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,947
Hee-jin asked me to give you this.

562
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,158
My gosh!

563
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,369
I forgot to send her an invitation.

564
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,038
She's in the countryside, remember?

565
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,333
- Why didn't you bring her with you?
- And drive five hours?

566
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,252
I hope she's doing all right.

567
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,504
She is.

568
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,592
Gosh, I'm so full. I can't eat anymore.

569
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,513
I picked these
since you were coming today.

570
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,390
- Stop bringing me food!
- Try one.

571
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,433
But I'm too full.

572
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,644
- Fine, but still try one.
- I'm completely full.

573
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,728
Just this one.

574
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,610
My gosh. It's so tasty!

575
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,779
Did you grow these yourself?

576
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,823
No way.

577
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,118
You must have a knack for farming.

578
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,873
I thought I couldn't eat anymore,
but it's too tasty.

579
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,879
I'm done now. I can't eat anymore.

580
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,881
I'm so full.

581
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,055
Se-yeon.

582
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,432
What?

583
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,519
I heard that Ms. Lee was getting married.

584
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,354
Aren't you going to come?

585
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,192
I don't think it's appropriate.

586
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,070
Besides, Seoul will only remind me

587
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,947
of the bad memories.

588
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,786
All right. I'll make sure
she receives this, so don't worry.

589
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,918
Seriously. Do you have invisible feet?

590
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,170
When did you get here?

591
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,464
Jeez.

592
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,802
If I wish upon the stars like this,

593
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,888
would I get a new one?

594
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,727
What will you do with a new one anyway?

595
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,397
Maybe the new Abyss

596
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:32,026
will bring Min back to me again.

597
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,241
Se-yeon,

598
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:43,871
I'm only telling you this
because I feel bad for you today.

599
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,415
- Want to know a secret?
- A secret?

600
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,668
What's that?

601
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,008
I already knew that. Min does too.

602
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,510
What? How do you know that?

603
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,929
What do you mean?

604
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,182
I just found out some way.

605
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,601
Min wouldn't have told...

606
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,146
- What are you doing?
- No way.

607
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,689
- Before marriage?
- What?

608
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,108
- Why are you staring?
- I'm right, aren't I?

609
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,526
- What do you mean?
- I'm right.

610
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,653
- Stop it.
- Right?

611
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,737
Shut it.

612
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,740
- Unbelievable.
- Stop.

613
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,159
- You were a couple. It's not bad.
- Stop it!

614
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,328
Hold on. Let me bring some rice cakes.

615
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,621
What? No, I'm fine.

616
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,498
- It's all right.
- Hold on.

617
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,583
- I'm totally full.
- I'll be right back. I forgot.

618
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,626
Hee-jin!

619
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,966
Mom.

620
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,593
- You're home.
- Right.

621
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,220
I told you to get home early.

622
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,680
I know,

623
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,392
but the wedding reception
went on for longer than I expected.

624
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:47,976
More side dishes?

625
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,146
I haven't even finished everything
you brought last time.

626
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,690
This wasn't necessary.

627
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,317
- But you wanted leaf mustard kimchi.
- I do.

628
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,361
I made some other side dishes too.

629
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,029
You must be tired as it is.

630
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,281
What's tiresome about
making my daughter food?

631
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,660
I'm just grateful
that I can still cook for you.

632
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,788
That being said,

633
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,582
why don't you just move back home?

634
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,209
This again?

635
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,587
I'm still worried about you living alone.

636
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,507
If it's because of your dad, I'll--

637
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,676
That's not it, Mom.

638
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,680
I just want to spend some time alone here.

639
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,349
It's really fine.

640
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,601
Besides,
Detective Park's word carries weight.

641
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,771
Officers patrol around
the neighborhood quite often.

642
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,691
I bumped into them so many times
that I recognize them all.

643
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,112
I'll call you every day like I'm doing now

644
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,990
and let you know that I'm safe.

645
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,617
All right.

646
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,582
Yes?

647
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,668
All right, I'm on my way.

648
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,172
Your dad is already calling me home.

649
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,340
He can't let you out of his sight.

650
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,676
He can't do anything without me.

651
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,261
Of course not.

652
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,263
Mom, have a safe trip home.

653
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,099
- Okay, bye.
- Good night.

654
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:12,478
<i>June 25, 2022.</i>

655
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,565
<i>Min,</i>

656
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,818
<i>I was at Mi-do's wedding today.</i>

657
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,030
<i>She went on a strict diet
in order to fit in her dress</i>

658
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,032
<i>and the hard work paid off.</i>

659
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,075
<i>She looked stunning.</i>

660
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,246
<i>Maybe it's because
I went to a wedding today,</i>

661
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,123
<i>but I even miss you more.</i>

662
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,751
<i>I love you, Min.</i>

663
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,468
MESSAGES

664
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,803
<i>Did you go to Ms. Lee's wedding?</i>

665
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,098
Of course.

666
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,019
I should send her a photo.

667
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,191
My gosh.

668
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,236
I'm exhausted today.

669
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,302
Help me go to sleep.

670
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,644
Recite some math formulas.

671
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,012
<i>I'll save Se-yeon</i>

672
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,932
<i>and find another way to be with her again.</i>

673
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,060
<i>I'll make sure to come back.</i>

674
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:37,664
I LOVE YOU, MIN

675
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,583
I MISS YOU... I LOVE YOU, MIN

676
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:44,796
I LOVE YOU, MIN

677
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,758
<i>Objection!</i>

678
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,260
The defendant's attorney
is baiting the witness

679
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,262
by speculating instead of stating facts.

680
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,264
Sustained. That's a warning.

681
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,605
Attorney Go,
what if the witness lies on the stand--

682
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,106
Don't you worry.

683
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,443
Didn't I tell you
that I was one of the top prosecutors

684
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,446
at the Public Prosecutor's Office?

685
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,991
I have a Plan B and even a Plan C

686
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,535
- for these situations.
- I see.

687
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,412
Attorney for the plaintiff, you're up.

688
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:22,000
I'd like to submit a photo as evidence.

689
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,838
This wasn't disclosed to us in advance.

690
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,215
We couldn't

691
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,050
because this is evidence of a crime

692
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,220
committed by the defendant this morning.

693
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,306
Attorney for the defendant,
please come up.

694
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,729
Do you accept
to have the evidence submitted?

695
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,565
As you may have already seen,
the defendant is obviously trying

696
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,943
to either win over or threaten
the witness in this picture.

697
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,111
"Win over"?

698
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,987
If he does not accept,

699
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,157
I will think of it as an acknowledgment
to the charges on the defendant.

700
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,703
I accept.

701
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,413
All right.

702
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,790
Thank you.

703
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,626
Please project the picture for us.

704
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:11,717
Your Honor,
please take a look at this picture.

705
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,301
It was taken this morning

706
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,096
when the witness over here
met up with the attorney for the defendant

707
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,890
and the defendant himself.

708
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:23,061
What would they have to share
with each other so urgently

709
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,313
that they had to meet up this morning?

710
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,608
What did you guys talk about?

711
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,652
Well, I...

712
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,155
If you're in a tough spot, you may pass.

713
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,867
Next picture, please.

714
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,123
I would like to question
the meaning to this suitcase of money

715
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,876
and whether the testimony from a witness

716
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,172
who received such a thing
may be considered admissible evidence.

717
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,465
That is all.

718
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,592
I will consider
the evidence and testimonies

719
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,095
from both parties
to reach a final verdict.

720
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,931
The final announcement will be on July 1.

721
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,402
You were perfect today, Prosecutor Go...

722
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,528
I mean, Attorney Go.

723
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,905
You know I'm always perfect.

724
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,949
Here. I'm getting off of work from here.

725
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,367
Where are you going?

726
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,745
The weather's so nice today,
so I'm going on a date.

727
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,567
One strawberry ice cream, please.

728
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,782
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

729
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,545
I'm sorry.

730
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:17,968
Darn it... Why do I keep dropping
my ice cream when I'm here?

731
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,178
What a waste.

732
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,389
That's not important right now.

733
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,725
Go Se-yeon.

734
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:53,837
I'm sorry.

735
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,965
I took too long, didn't I?

736
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,509
Stop talking.

737
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,764
Stop talking, Min.

738
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,227
I don't want to wake up
from this illusion.

739
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,502
It's really me, Cha Min.

740
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,422
It's me.

741
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,368
I really missed you, Se-yeon.

742
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,936
<i>I love you, Min.</i>

743
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:40,026
I really do. I love you so much.

744
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,238
You told me that

745
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,033
almost a thousand times now.

746
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,787
Why are you flooding me with love?

747
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,916
Let's see how much you changed
in three years.

748
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,130
Do you know what I regretted the most

749
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,757
after losing you?

750
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,012
I regretted saving those words for later

751
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,099
and not showing
all the love I had for you.

752
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,187
You've grown up.

753
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,611
I won't ask you where you've been
or blame you

754
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,905
for returning so late.

755
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,241
I know very well

756
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,453
that you would've done anything

757
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,581
to come back to me

758
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,708
like this.

759
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,379
Thank you.

760
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,298
But

761
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,136
it hurts me just to think
about how hard it must've been

762
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,556
to get all the way here.

763
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,187
Did you have a hard time?

764
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,523
You look a bit skinnier.

765
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,486
I did have a hard time,

766
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,574
but I forgot all about it
the moment I saw you.

767
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,207
It isn't that important,

768
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,376
but I am a bit curious.

769
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,046
What were you doing?

770
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,180
A lot happened.

771
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:19,853
<i>After I vanished, I opened my eyes...</i>

772
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:22,272
<i>and saw them again.</i>

773
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,697
I told you not to use it
unless it's necessary.

774
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,660
You won't be able to stay on this planet

775
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,538
in your condition.

776
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,296
You'll feel even more pain.

777
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,630
<i>You couldn't see me,</i>

778
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,509
<i>and there was nothing I could do for you.</i>

779
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,971
<i>But there was no way...</i>

780
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,059
<i>I could get myself to leave you.</i>

781
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,584
Poor thing.

782
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,717
You...

783
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:18,429
What a pitiful yet beautiful soul.

784
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,016
Can you see me?

785
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,937
If you left, you wouldn't be in pain.

786
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,439
Why are you still wandering around
so foolishly?

787
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,567
Follow me.

788
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,249
Abyss?

789
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,509
There's one more thing you don't know.

790
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,304
Abyss...

791
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,266
It keeps following me around

792
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,810
even after it's all used up.

793
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,355
Do you know what that means?

794
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,567
Whenever you saw that thing,

795
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,029
I was right there with you.

796
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,283
Isn't that amazing?

797
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,255
Thank you...

798
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,009
for waiting and believing in me.

799
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,197
Let's see...

800
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,829
It should come up anytime soon.

801
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,378
There, I found it!

802
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,922
It really has been here all along!

803
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,051
I was so scared about
having to open it on my own, you know.

804
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,973
Should we have a glass of wine
while we open it?

805
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,141
Sure.

806
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,145
Mine was somewhere here, too.

807
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,939
Wasn't yours a bit deeper?

808
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,315
- I found it!
- It's here!

809
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:40,822
Go and wash up.

810
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,824
I'll ask Auntie
to prepare a snack for the wine.

811
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,952
It's really late. She must be sleeping.

812
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,246
I'll just fix something up quickly.

813
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,915
You don't even know how to cook.
Never mind, I'll do it.

814
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:55,002
My darling husband,
please leave it up to me for today.

815
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,004
Go on and get washed up.

816
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,299
Why are you so sweet today?

817
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,053
It's a special day today.
Go on and wash up.

818
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:08,266
- But just let me do the cooking--
- All right, all right.

819
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,984
Se-yeon did you see my...

820
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,903
What are you doing there?

821
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,947
Nothing.

822
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,701
What are you doing behind the...

823
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,995
Hey! We were supposed to
open that together!

824
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,830
I didn't think we'd open it,

825
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,582
so I put in something really dangerous.

826
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,709
I was only trying to get it out.

827
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,002
Is it the one you put in last?

828
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,339
- No, that's not it.
- Come on, let me see.

829
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,424
- No way.
- What is it?

830
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,092
- No, it's too embarrassing!
- Let me see!

831
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,428
- No, don't!
- Give it!

832
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,388
Come on, please!

833
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:53,853
"Wish Coupon"?

834
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,230
WISH COUPON
GOOD FOR 1 WISH

835
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,024
Damn it!

836
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,652
- This is what you put in?
- Give it back.

837
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,071
No way. I'll be invincible with this.

838
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,448
No, you won't. Give it back.

839
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,700
- Give it back!
- No way. You can't take it back.

840
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,202
- Yes, I can!
- No, I won't let you.

841
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,829
- I can! Come on!
- No way!

842
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,414
Come on, please!

843
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,504
Do you want to wash up?

844
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,049
- Sure. I'll do that.
- Okay.

845
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,017
Min, you've been married for a year.

846
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,895
Why can't you control yourself?

847
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,439
Get used to it, already.

848
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,413
<i>You can take it.</i>

849
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,375
I don't need Abyss anymore.

850
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,711
That's not how it works.

851
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,339
Remember what you said?

852
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,258
You said you resented having it,

853
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,511
but that it was still a present to you.

854
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:14,934
I was able to save

855
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,021
Se-yeon twice because of Abyss.

856
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:25,069
It brought you
the biggest present in your life,

857
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,822
that Abyss.

858
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:30,950
Does that mean

859
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,412
it will follow me until I die?

860
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,791
If there happens to be a present
that can bring you a greater miracle,

861
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,128
then it will disappear.

862
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,312
Se-yeon is good enough for me.

863
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,315
What could be better than her?

864
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:09,322
What? What's going on?

865
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:15,786
What? Where is it...

866
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:19,540
Min!

867
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,750
What is it? What's wrong?

868
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:21,876
- What do I do?
- What is it?

869
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,504
- It happened.
- What happened?

870
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,890
What do you mean, "What do I do?"
We have to celebrate!

871
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,813
That's so great.

872
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,776
Se-yeon, thank you so much.

873
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:47,735
What?

874
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,907
I'll keep you
and Se-yeon Jr. safe forever.

875
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:55,952
- Okay.
- I love you, Se-yeon.

876
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,912
I love you too, Min.

877
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,210
- You know...
- What?

878
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,463
- I predicted all this.
- How?

879
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:12,134
- Do you know what's in the time capsule?
- What?

880
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,850
Look!

881
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,020
I calculated everything,

882
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,648
and I thought we'd be married
and having a baby in five years.

883
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,567
Isn't it adorable?

884
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:32,154
It's out of style, though.

885
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,156
Do you think so?

886
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,702
I was just kidding.

887
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:40,287
It's just a basic design. It's so pretty.

888
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,872
- How adorable!
- It's cute.

889
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,040
What's this?

890
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,334
Why isn't there one for a girl?
You want a son?

891
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,336
- Sure. A son who looks like me.
- No way.

892
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:51,882
- Then a daughter that looks like me.
- That's worse. No way.

893
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,051
Do you even want the baby or not?

894
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,928
That's not what I'm talking about.

895
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,097
Just think about it. Your old...

896
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,560
You were about to mention
my old face, weren't you?

897
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,062
No, I...

898
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:07,606
Well, I'm not wrong, right?

899
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,820
Come on, what's going on?

900
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,448
- Why do you look so pissed?
- It's nothing.

901
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,075
Why are you getting upset?

902
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,910
I'm not upset. Why would I be?

903
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,579
Come on, don't be upset.

904
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,666
What's up with that face?

905
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,001
Are you getting mad at me?

906
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,628
- No, I'm just--
- What's with that face?

907
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,796
And that glare?

908
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,339
- I'm just--
- You look so cold.

909
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,924
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

910
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,176
What are you sorry about?

911
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,594
Should we open up the windows?

912
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,429
I need some fresh air.

913
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,139
- You can't breathe?
- Yes.

914
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,057
Am I suffocating you?

915
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,933
Am I the one suffocating you right now?

916
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,687
- Se-yeon!
- What's wrong?

917
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,523
You've blinded me.

918
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,610
Why are you so pretty today?

919
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,071
Se-yeon, I'm sorry.

920
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,657
- Are you sorry or not?
- I'm sorry.

921
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,660
- Are you not sorry or are you?
- I am sorry!

922
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,871
I can't stay mad at you. Come here.
