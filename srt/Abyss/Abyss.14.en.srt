1
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,799
God damn it.

2
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,052
What the hell was that about?

3
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,181
What's he doing?

4
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,685
Move your car!

5
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,021
Is he out of his mind?

6
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,574
Excuse me. I said, move your car.

7
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,287
Jeez. This world is full of weirdos.

8
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,538
Damn it.

9
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,710
What?

10
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,753
What's your problem?

11
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,324
Is it ready?

12
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,160
Yes. Wasn't someone else coming?
When will she be here?

13
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,496
She won't be coming.

14
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,623
- All right, then. After you.
- Sure.

15
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,044
They're having a private funeral,

16
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,922
so please have it transferred
to this address, not to the hospital.

17
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,800
- Detective Lee!
- Yes?

18
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,177
- I need you to check something.
- What is it?

19
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,682
Did you get the address?

20
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,559
We're headed toward Gyeonggi Province.

21
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,150
Detective Lee is still outside.
Isn't he supposed to come...

22
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,445
Sir! Excuse me!

23
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,584
Seo Ji-uk?

24
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,626
Hey!

25
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,943
<i>Min, something's come up.</i>
<i>Can you come to this address?</i>

26
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,199
CRIME SCENE REPORT

27
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,580
This is right.

28
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,791
I told you that the guy we caught
at the scene has type AB blood.

29
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,085
But Prosecutor Seo Ji-uk
just said it should be type B.

30
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,338
He said you should double-check.

31
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,257
No, he's wrong.
I'm sure that it's type AB.

32
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,551
Prosecutor Seo must be mistaken.

33
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,262
- Everything else is good, right?
- Yes.

34
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,764
All right, then. Take it easy.

35
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,395
Did they leave already?

36
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,862
He's not picking up.

37
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,201
Hi, Dong-cheol.

38
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,120
I checked Jang Sun-young's body
and handed it over,

39
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,748
but the address wasn't a hospital.
Where was it again?

40
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,334
I wanted to attend the funeral,

41
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,712
<i>but Ms. Lee left without me.</i>

42
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,050
Actually, they're not holding a funeral.

43
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,387
Didn't they rush the autopsy
because of the funeral?

44
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,347
Well, the thing is...

45
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,727
The bereaved have a bit of a situation,
so they can't really do it now.

46
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,939
When they do, it won't be open
to the public, so you don't need to go.

47
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,857
When will the results be out?

48
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,694
We can expect them
by the day after tomorrow at the latest.

49
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,905
All right, thanks.
You should get back to the station.

50
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,782
Bye.

51
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,458
You should never park your car like this
even if you're in a terrible rush.

52
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,757
Excuse me.

53
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,384
Hello!

54
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:49,974
Hey, can you hear me? Wake up! Hey!

55
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,775
Yes, Detective Park.

56
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,778
Se-yeon asked me
to come to the Port of Incheon,

57
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,905
- <i>so I'm on my way there now.</i>
- Did you talk to her?

58
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,740
No, she just texted...

59
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,201
What's the matter?

60
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,703
I think something happened to her.

61
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,086
<i>The driver was found unconscious,</i>

62
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,296
and I heard that Seo Ji-uk was at the NFS.

63
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,674
I'll forward you the text message
from her.

64
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,389
MIN, SOMETHING'S UP.
CAN YOU COME TO THIS ADDRESS?

65
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,272
<i>The person you have reached</i>
<i>is unavailable. Please leave...</i>

66
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,440
Shit.

67
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,823
Hey, Se-yeon. Where are you now?
You're okay, right?

68
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,578
Seo Ji-uk?

69
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,747
Where are you now?

70
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,502
Listen. If you lay a finger on her,

71
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,796
I won't let it slide.

72
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,423
You don't have time for this chitchat.

73
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,718
She is dying as we speak.

74
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,095
You piece of...

75
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,806
<i>Get yourself here quietly</i>
<i>if you want her to live.</i>

76
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,308
You know what I mean by that, right?

77
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,166
Where am I?

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,251
What is this place?

79
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,307
Hello.

80
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,767
Anybody outside?

81
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,937
Hello. Someone's inside!

82
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,690
<i>Hello.</i>

83
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,609
<i>Anybody outside?</i>

84
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,694
<i>Help!</i>

85
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,696
<i>Hello.</i>

86
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,538
EPISODE 14

87
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,105
Let me out!

88
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,380
You woke up faster than I expected.

89
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,258
I wanted you to die an easy death,

90
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,051
but it'll be quite painful.

91
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,637
Tae-jin, open this door.

92
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,138
Let me out!

93
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,481
See?

94
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,610
I told you to stay still
if you don't want to suffer.

95
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,489
What are you scheming now?
You've made Mom and me suffer enough.

96
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,949
Why? Why are you doing all this?

97
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,909
"Enough"?

98
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,705
You don't get to say that.
It's up to me to decide.

99
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,208
I'm trying to live my life.
Why do you keep provoking me?

100
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,588
Why do you constantly make me
get blood on my hands? Why?

101
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,548
I told you to live quietly.

102
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,468
I clearly told you to stay silent
and just breathe quietly to stay alive.

103
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,471
I'm doing this
because you people keep wreaking havoc!

104
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,764
So you're going to kill me too?

105
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,267
Fine, go ahead. Kill me!

106
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,311
Kill me! Go ahead!

107
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,146
- Be quiet.
- Just kill me!

108
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,522
Shut up!

109
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,484
Shut the hell up.

110
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,528
You're just like Oh Yeong-cheol.

111
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,115
No. If anything, you're worse than him.

112
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,451
You're a total lunatic.

113
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,207
The real lunatics are you guys.

114
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,964
No way. That won't happen.

115
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,717
Hee-jin was revived to her own self.

116
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,470
Besides, when you were revived,
didn't they say

117
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,848
that most people have
the same soul as their own self?

118
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,226
I think the two of us were
rare exceptions.

119
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,064
Also, Oh Yeong-cheol only got much older.
That's why we didn't recognize him.

120
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,815
He didn't turn into another person.

121
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:55,363
Do you really think we should
be using Abyss like this, though?

122
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,782
It's kind of getting me worried.

123
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,700
You're right.

124
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,162
Let's just discuss it again
after we revive Ms. Jang.

125
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,705
All right.

126
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,214
If you guys hadn't talked such bullshit

127
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,633
about reviving dead people,

128
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,389
you could have
at least held a funeral for your mom.

129
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,563
I jumped through hoops to kill her.
If you guys revive her, all my hard work

130
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,482
will go down the drain.

131
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,275
Mom...

132
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,361
Mom.

133
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,114
Mom!

134
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,867
No! Don't!

135
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,249
Mom!

136
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,376
No, Mom!

137
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,049
Mom!

138
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,224
Untie me!

139
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,771
Mom! Mom, no...

140
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,540
You can't die yet.
Give me just a little bit of time.

141
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,753
I'll get rid of you guys soon.

142
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,178
Send backup to the Port of Incheon.

143
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,180
I'm not sure yet, but Prosecutor Go...

144
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,682
I mean, I think he abducted a woman.

145
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,060
Who do you think?
There's only one prick that I'm after.

146
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,270
Seo Ji-uk!

147
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,305
Seo Ji-uk!

148
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,724
You made it.

149
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
Where is Se-yeon?

150
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,486
Fuck off.

151
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,575
Before I hand her over to you,
I want that marble.

152
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,621
Well, you know.

153
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,874
The marble that can supposedly
revive dead people.

154
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,585
I still can't quite believe it,

155
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,005
but I'm starting to think
that I may be the one

156
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,591
who really needs that marble.

157
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,975
Take it from me if you can.

158
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,833
Se-yeon. Se-yeon...

159
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,005
Se-yeon!

160
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,518
Se-yeon... Where is Se-yeon?

161
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,104
She'll die anyway.

162
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,023
Tell me! Where is she?

163
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,694
Se-yeon will...

164
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,529
She'll die, too...

165
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,869
Hey.

166
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,788
Hey, Seo Ji-uk.

167
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,833
Hey! You're not dead, right?

168
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,462
Seo Ji-uk. Open your eyes, you bastard!

169
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,756
Seo Ji-uk! Where is Se-yeon?

170
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,591
Where is she...

171
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,484
Anybody...

172
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,195
outside?

173
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,617
Min.

174
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,370
Min.

175
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,300
Se-yeon, wake up.

176
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,553
Se-yeon! Open your eyes, please.

177
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,431
Se-yeon.

178
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,891
Wake up, please! Se-yeon!

179
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,476
Wake up, Se-yeon.

180
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,479
Se-yeon!

181
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,406
- Dong-cheol.
- Where is he?

182
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,784
Hey, how come it's just the two of you?

183
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,495
Well, everyone threw such a fit,
saying that Prosecutor Seo

184
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,247
would never abduct anyone.

185
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,167
What can we do? We figured
we should come even without any backup.

186
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,501
God damn it.

187
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,795
- He's holding
- Yes.

188
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,963
Go Se-yeon...

189
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,549
- I mean, he's holding Lee Mi-do hostage,
- Okay.

190
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,218
- so move as quietly as possible.
- Got it.

191
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,261
Let's go.

192
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,936
- Hee-jin!
- Hee-jin!

193
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,270
Hee-jin.

194
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,272
Are you all right? What happened here?

195
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,943
I hit someone with the car.

196
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,986
What? Who?

197
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,074
Hey, find the victim. Go!

198
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,119
Wait here, okay?

199
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,268
Let's have a look.

200
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,938
Doctor, why is it taking this long
for her to regain consciousness?

201
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,481
She is really okay, isn't she?

202
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,191
We've cut down on the sedatives

203
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,110
as her temperature is back
to the normal range,

204
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,820
so she'll wake up soon.

205
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,614
The test results aren't bad.

206
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,283
We'll keep monitoring her temperature

207
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,077
for two to three days after
she wakes up and see how she recovers.

208
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,662
Okay, thank you.

209
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,455
When she wakes up, check her motion

210
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,332
and see if she needs acetaminophen.

211
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,250
Yes, sir.

212
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,344
Se-yeon.

213
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,389
Min.

214
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,642
- Min.
- Se-yeon.

215
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,813
What happened?

216
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,565
Where is Seo Ji-uk?

217
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,818
Did we manage to rescue Ms. Jang?

218
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,615
What's wrong? What happened?

219
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,160
Everything went well, right?

220
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,787
Right?

221
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,708
She'll die anyway.

222
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,627
Tell me! Where is she?

223
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,340
Se-yeon will...

224
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,717
She'll die, too...

225
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,597
Hey.

226
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,642
Hey, Seo Ji-uk.

227
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,561
Hey! You're not dead, right?

228
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,106
Seo Ji-uk. Open your eyes, you bastard!

229
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,400
Seo Ji-uk! Where is Se-yeon?

230
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,277
Where is she...

231
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,529
<i>You don't have time for this chitchat.</i>

232
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,450
<i>She is dying as we speak.</i>

233
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,274
Where is Se-yeon?

234
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,194
You actually revived me...

235
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,447
I asked you where Se-yeon was!

236
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,075
Did you...

237
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,621
revive me thinking that I'd tell you
where she is this easily?

238
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,666
Why would I tell you?

239
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,761
Is that so?

240
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,638
All right, then. Don't tell me.

241
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,736
If Se-yeon dies,

242
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,322
I will kill you.

243
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,330
Sure, kill me.

244
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,665
I'm not dying alone,

245
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,251
so I at least won't be lonely.

246
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,379
I never said

247
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,507
I'd only kill you once.

248
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,676
For as long as I'm alive,

249
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,806
I'll continue to kill and revive you

250
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,558
over and over again.

251
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,481
I'll make you feel
endless and excruciating fear

252
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,359
each and every time.

253
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,411
Wait.

254
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,331
You don't...

255
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,125
You don't have time for this.

256
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,378
Really? Okay, then I'll kill you quickly.

257
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:42,963
Wait!

258
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,257
Look inside my pocket.

259
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,805
REFRIGERATED CONTAINER

260
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,224
Where is this? Where is Se-yeon?

261
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,184
She's at the cargo loading area.

262
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,354
In a refrigerated container.

263
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,910
<i>I know I shouldn't have revived him,</i>

264
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,414
but I just...

265
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,834
I just couldn't let him die.

266
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,505
I thought

267
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,551
that I would never find you
if I let him die.

268
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,138
That thought terrified me so much.

269
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,683
It's not your fault.

270
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,935
You didn't do anything wrong, Min.

271
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,148
It's all my fault.

272
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,067
You only did it to save me.

273
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,237
It's not your fault. It's okay.

274
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm sorry.

275
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,617
I'm really sorry, Min.

276
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,077
I'm sorry about everything.

277
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,293
DONGBU POLICE STATION

278
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,670
See? I was right.

279
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,005
You little...

280
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,634
Chief told you to stay put. You shouldn't
have gone there to begin with.

281
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,221
I'm a cop. How could I sit back and do
nothing after hearing about an abduction?

282
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,097
You should've just reported it.

283
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,807
I did! I reported it.

284
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,643
But apparently,
you totally disregarded it,

285
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,686
saying Prosecutor Seo
would never do such a thing.

286
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,231
Anyway, not yet.

287
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,734
If Forensics confirms that the blood
from the scene is his,

288
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,778
then I'll consider bringing you back.

289
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,405
I'm telling you. It's Seo Ji-uk's blood.

290
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,742
She said she hit him with the car.
It's definitely his blood.

291
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,287
It is! Believe me!

292
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,793
That buffoon.

293
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,172
I told you to leave
before Chief gets here.

294
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,551
Jeez, chill.

295
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,636
I said I'd wait
until we hear from Forensics.

296
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,804
Hello.

297
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,473
Yes, okay.

298
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,395
Dong-cheol, that was Forensics.

299
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,021
What did they say?

300
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,525
The blood from the scene is mixed
with a sodium hydroxide solution,

301
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,068
so they can't extract DNA from it.

302
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,403
What?

303
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,364
- Move back, please.
- Keep people out.

304
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,829
Keep people out!

305
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,832
- What on earth happened here?
- Guys, keep people out.

306
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,500
Move back, please!

307
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,335
- Move back!
- You can't come in here.

308
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,436
Did you find anything over there?

309
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,252
Hee-jin.

310
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,671
I killed him.

311
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,549
I think he's dead.

312
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,766
That's what you claim,

313
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,521
but Seo Ji-uk's body
wasn't found anywhere near the scene.

314
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,731
There's no body

315
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,900
and no black box footage.

316
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,277
The blood found at the scene

317
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,321
was too contaminated
to test for a DNA match.

318
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:25,036
Even if Seo Ji-uk
was able to flee the scene,

319
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,747
he wouldn't have gone far in his state.

320
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,419
Isn't there anything else you remember?

321
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,887
Could Min have used the marble to...

322
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,189
Se-yeon, shouldn't you
have rested one more day?

323
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,943
I wouldn't have been able to rest
until he's in custody.

324
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,529
What about Detective Park?
Have you called him?

325
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,072
He's almost here.

326
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,996
Prosecutor Go, how are you feeling?

327
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,622
I'm okay.

328
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,002
What about Hee-jin? How is she doing?

329
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,296
She's barely holding it together.

330
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,716
She claims to have killed Seo Ji-uk,
but no body was found.

331
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,219
We can't even prove
that he was there that night.

332
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,598
If the blood at the scene is his,

333
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,725
he can't have disappeared
so fast like that.

334
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:29,976
Maybe it's someone else's.

335
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,728
It is his blood.

336
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,189
What?

337
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,610
If that's the case,
he'd have been in no state to run.

338
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,944
I...

339
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,491
used Abyss.

340
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,998
If Min hadn't revived him,

341
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,125
then I would've died once more.

342
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,590
What was he like
the last time you saw him?

343
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,302
He seemed slightly different,
but his face was the same.

344
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,847
I bet he'll be found soon
once an open manhunt begins.

345
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,893
Right now, Seo Ji-uk is still a victim, so
carrying out a manhunt will be difficult.

346
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,478
What?

347
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,105
What about the abduction
and the body disposal?

348
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,483
There isn't any evidence
that links them to Seo Ji-uk.

349
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,236
Only Hee-jin's fingerprints
were found in the car.

350
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,571
There's no evidence that he abducted her.

351
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,325
The maritime police are searching
for Jang Sun-young's body,

352
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,701
but there's no news.

353
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,504
This won't get us anywhere.
We need to do something.

354
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,593
There's a move that my mom often uses.

355
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,308
<i>You're unbelievable.</i>
<i>Is that what you think of me?</i>

356
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,937
The fact that I once followed
someone using a location tracking device

357
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,147
doesn't make me a criminal mastermind.

358
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,027
I'm not the kind
to make a dirty move such as

359
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,905
manipulating the public with fake news.

360
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,367
Watch what you say
in front of attorney Lee.

361
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,495
What about the drug scandal
with JT Cosmetics' model Bae Su-jin?

362
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,581
Who started that rumor?

363
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,708
How should I know who started it?

364
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,419
Besides, it's not like it was false.

365
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,422
She was summoned and questioned
by the police.

366
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,882
Her test came back positive.

367
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,717
That's not a rumor. It's a fact.

368
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,636
Mom, I'm a part of your empire, remember?

369
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,308
You talk to the ladies on the phone
three to four hours a day.

370
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,727
I pick up a few things
whether I want to or not.

371
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,814
Distributing false information
is punishable by law--

372
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,982
I never did such a thing.

373
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,692
Right.

374
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:50,033
All right then. I'll have my people
look into the source of the rumor.

375
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,535
I'll be suing on Ms. Bae's behalf.

376
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,538
Why do you bother
with such unnecessary things?

377
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,293
Fine.

378
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,130
You're right. I had my people
spread the rumors.

379
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,131
You're unbelievable!

380
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:09,218
Why do you make it your mission
to embarrass your mother?

381
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,471
- Are you satisfied now?
- We need your help, Mom.

382
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,146
PROSECUTOR AND SON OF JUDGE A
IS THE BIOLOGICAL SON OF A SERIAL KILLER

383
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,943
We set the bait,

384
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,612
so all we need is for him to bite.

385
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,576
I had no idea that
this was what you had in mind.

386
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,080
Hey. Are you sure about this?

387
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,042
It's like I said.

388
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,044
Once the rumors start spreading,

389
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,964
tip-offs will come flying in
before you know it.

390
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,507
The prosecution will look into it.

391
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,300
Then we will be criticized by the people.

392
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,052
Your boss will be pissed off at you,

393
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,346
you'll yell at me, I'll yell at him,

394
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,555
and he'll yell at him.

395
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,015
Some will have their pay cut,

396
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,393
- and some will get fired--
- That's enough.

397
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,562
It looks like we'll have to do something
before things blow up.

398
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,940
Doesn't that seem like
the best course of action?

399
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,818
Should I set something in motion then?

400
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:07,902
Yes.

401
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,990
Judge Seo, please take a look at this.

402
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,329
PROSECUTOR AND SON OF JUDGE A
IS THE BIOLOGICAL SON OF A SERIAL KILLER

403
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,293
Did you hear about the rumor?

404
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,713
Is Prosecutor Seo
in league with Oh Yeong-cheol?

405
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,214
Are you in contact with your son?

406
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,966
- Is the rumor true?
- What now?

407
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,259
How do you feel right now?

408
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,720
- Please say a few words.
- Any comments?

409
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,483
Of course not.

410
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,777
Yes, it's a baseless rumor.

411
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,612
You're wrong!

412
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,285
How can they say such things
about the kind Prosecutor Seo?

413
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,912
Shit.

414
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,503
Did they break up?

415
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,724
Hello.

416
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,853
Yes, hello. How have you been?

417
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,439
- Who is it?
- It's the paralegal from Ji-uk's office.

418
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,365
Why the hell did you even come with me?

419
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,743
I was a prosecutor once.
It's in the job description.

420
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,370
Also, she looks like me, remember?

421
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,165
I should know what she says
with my face on hers.

422
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,587
Hello.

423
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,926
Would you like something to drink?

424
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,011
No, I'm good.

425
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,349
So why did you want to see me?

426
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,188
I didn't know what to do with these.

427
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,401
You heard the rumor, too, right?

428
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:21,369
Well, when you threw a fit
at the office the other day,

429
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,289
I saw the photo you left behind.

430
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,625
Look forward to it.

431
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,007
Prosecutor Seo, are you all right?

432
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,312
Here.

433
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,315
I found these
in Prosecutor Seo's wastebasket.

434
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,736
<i>His girlfriend used to send him</i>
<i>a lot of gifts through a courier service,</i>

435
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,446
<i>but he threw them all away.</i>

436
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,614
Gosh, look at all this.

437
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,957
<i>I came across this photo</i>

438
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,002
<i>while I was throwing them out.</i>

439
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:17,133
There was a boy in the photo you threw
at Prosecutor Seo that day.

440
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,594
It's the same boy, isn't it?

441
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,975
When people whispered about
Prosecutor Seo the other time

442
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,060
and even when this rumor spread,

443
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,646
I thought they were all lies.

444
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,065
But that photo made me think

445
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,444
that there might be something more.

446
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,365
I called to see if you knew
something that I don't.

447
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,619
I'm glad you called.

448
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,874
Please tell me that
Prosecutor Seo isn't behind all this.

449
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,044
You know him just as well as I do.

450
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,505
He may not be the most heartwarming type,

451
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,798
but him and Oh Yeong-cheol?

452
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,761
It can't be true.

453
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,353
Hello.

454
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,146
Sure thing.

455
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,651
I'm afraid I'm needed back at the office.

456
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,070
Of course.
Thank you for taking the time to see me.

457
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,738
It was my pleasure.

458
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,336
What is it? What did she bring you?

459
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,130
I think it's a photo
of Seo Ji-uk as a boy,

460
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,924
but I knew about this already.

461
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,387
And here I was, thinking
we would find something new.

462
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,653
You...

463
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,242
You shouldn't be so startled
to see your son.

464
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,997
What do you plan to do?

465
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,667
It's not too late to admit
to all of your crimes and--

466
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,876
I can't do that.

467
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,427
I'll call you on this phone from now on.

468
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,773
You'd better pick up when I call.

469
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,195
If you don't want to get hurt, I mean.

470
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,883
<i>I came across this photo</i>

471
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,178
<i>while I was throwing them out.</i>

472
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:11,474
A photo of him as a boy in a gift box?

473
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,727
It's just an old photo of him.

474
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,188
It's not just a photo.

475
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,649
- The gift box!
- What about it?

476
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,488
Ji-uk's girlfriend
would send him these unique gift boxes.

477
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,617
He always promised to show us,
but never did.

478
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,911
So we even made fun of him

479
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,538
by saying he was sending them to himself.

480
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,708
Can you send his paralegal a text?

481
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,056
<i>This gift box was sent</i>
<i>to Seo Ji-uk numerous times.</i>

482
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,724
<i>Could you contact the courier service</i>

483
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,103
<i>and find out the time and date</i>
<i>of the deliveries,</i>

484
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,605
<i>where they were sent from,</i>
<i>and anything else they can remember?</i>

485
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,274
<i>I think this is how</i>
<i>he and Oh Yeong-cheol communicated.</i>

486
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,694
Guys, get over here.

487
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,785
Look into the courier service
that delivered this gift box.

488
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,911
Get to it.

489
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,260
Min...

490
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,263
Did I wake you?

491
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,098
I wanted you to sleep comfortably.

492
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,224
Min...

493
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,685
Min...

494
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,777
Gosh, what's all this?

495
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,612
What are you doing up already?

496
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,281
They look amazing. Can I try one?

497
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,117
Thank you.

498
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,873
- It's delicious.
- Do you like it?

499
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,584
It's perfect. Absolutely amazing.

500
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,129
Auntie, could you perhaps

501
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,632
show me how to make these sometime?

502
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,051
Cooking is my only weakness.

503
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,970
How is they be so delicious?

504
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,848
I don't know how to make these, either.

505
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,142
It's not my recipe.

506
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,854
Auntie, can you taste this for me?

507
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,025
You're up.

508
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,446
He's the chef.

509
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,700
You made all this?

510
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,417
Don't be a prosecutor just for today.

511
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,837
How can I when
Seo Ji-uk is still on the loose?

512
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,464
Just for today.
Let's go together somewhere.

513
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,216
Where are you off to?

514
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:17,469
You're not at work.

515
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,806
What about you?
Why aren't you at the office?

516
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,142
- I'm taking the day off.
- Me too.

517
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,687
My troublemaker of a son

518
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,065
has been giving me a terrible migraine.
So I'm off to rest.

519
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,238
This place you're going to...

520
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,574
Will you be spending the night there?

521
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,960
Attorney Lee, your parents
must be quite open-minded.

522
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,253
They didn't act like it.

523
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,713
- Well, that--
- Let's go.

524
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,215
That's not it. I...

525
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,928
Mom, don't be so old-fashioned.

526
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,180
Besides, I'm an adult.

527
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,264
"Old fashioned"?

528
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,183
Who said you weren't?

529
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,601
Have a good time then.

530
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,937
- All right. You have a nice day, too.
- Sure.

531
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,483
You too, Mr. Kim.

532
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:21,533
If they want to be together so much,
why not just get married?

533
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,744
When is he planning to do so?

534
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,956
That's how it is with his generation.
They date but don't get married.

535
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,043
I must be too old-fashioned
to understand that.

536
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,589
Does he not care about the company?

537
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,884
How can I hand it over to him
if he doesn't get married?

538
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,848
This had better be good,
or you're going to pay.

539
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,642
All right.

540
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,192
- How far away is it?
- We're almost there.

541
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,427
What do you think?
Isn't it so refreshing out here?

542
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,263
I told you, I don't have time for this.

543
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,473
If you wanted to get some air, you--

544
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,143
Goodness! What brings you here?

545
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,397
Mom?

546
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,782
I've thought about you
ever since that day.

547
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,784
I never thought I'd see you here.

548
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,162
- What brings you here?
- Do we have guests?

549
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,998
Do you remember how I told you

550
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,875
about Se-yeon's colleagues?

551
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,006
- Remember?
- It's...

552
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,341
the lady we met at the funeral.

553
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,845
Hello, how have you been?

554
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,638
Fine.

555
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,155
Director Cha! Welcome!

556
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,657
- How have you been?
- Great.

557
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,412
You're really Min?

558
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,415
How in the world

559
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,501
did you turn out like this?

560
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,504
You've gotten so tall.
Is that even possible?

561
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,758
Our country's plastic surgery techniques
really are amazing, aren't they?

562
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,345
Anyway, it's such a relief.

563
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,389
We found the actual culprit
who killed Se-yeon,

564
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,141
and you cleared your name.

565
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,560
It's all such a relief.

566
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,688
It really is,

567
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,067
but I guess we won't get Se-yeon back.

568
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,069
Stop that, already.

569
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,279
How many times do I have to tell you

570
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,699
that Se-yeon won't be able
to rest in peace if you keep crying?

571
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,451
I'm not crying.

572
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,956
We didn't know you were the one
who got us this house.

573
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:18,085
I thought it was some kind of
compensation for the victims.

574
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,003
You shouldn't have.

575
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,130
You wouldn't have come
if I had told you the truth.

576
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:26,552
Well,
we were planning on returning anyway.

577
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,221
The bastard's dead, isn't he?

578
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:35,519
We should get back.
We can't keep troubling you like this.

579
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,187
Not at all, sir.

580
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,731
You can stay here as long as you want.

581
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,693
We can't do that.

582
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,903
But what brings you here today?

583
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,656
Oh, well...

584
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,742
Come on in.

585
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,327
I'm coming!

586
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,459
- It's Dad's birthday.
- It's your birthday, sir.

587
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,129
Goodness, I forgot about that!

588
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,008
Now...

589
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,303
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

590
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,931
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

591
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,810
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Dad</i>
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Se-yeon's dad</i>

592
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,397
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

593
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,109
You really shouldn't have.

594
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,736
Of course, I should. Go on, sir.

595
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:31,992
Happy birthday.

596
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,793
See? I told you you wouldn't regret it.

597
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,091
They both look like
they're doing much better.

598
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,260
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

599
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,723
- Is that it?
- Then what else?

600
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,934
You know what you always say,

601
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,685
"You have to learn to give and take."

602
00:48:58,977 --> 00:48:59,811
So what?

603
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,234
Hey!

604
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,528
- What?
- Stop it.

605
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,286
You're unbelievable.

606
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:21,249
You know,
you have a lot of nerve these days.

607
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,169
You must've lost your sense of shame
along with your old body.

608
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,921
This is nothing.

609
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,465
I've been up since six a.m. for this.

610
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,926
Why didn't you wake me up?
I would've helped.

611
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,387
Do you want to get him sick
on his birthday?

612
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,263
You're a terrible cook.

613
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,308
I love you very much,

614
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,352
but when it comes to your cooking...

615
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,063
Love isn't enough.

616
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,566
That's right.

617
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,819
I even got sick from the ramen
you made me.

618
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,071
How is it even possible to make
ramen taste that bad--

619
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,864
- That's enough.
- Okay.

620
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,036
Who cares if you suck at cooking.
I'm good at it, anyway.

621
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,080
One good cook is enough, right?

622
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,040
I said that's enough.

623
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,710
- I'm going to rip your mouth out.
- All right, all right.

624
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,754
Sir? I think you should
come out here for a minute.

625
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:15,887
Mom?

626
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,311
I thought you were going on vacation.

627
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,813
I'm here on vacation.

628
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,858
Do you think I'd come here to work?

629
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,025
It's been such a long time.

630
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,277
It has.

631
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,197
We met back when
the kids were in high school.

632
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,949
It's been a while.

633
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,581
Se-yeon, it's me.

634
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,126
Yes, I was just passing by.

635
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,670
I bought you some ice cream.

636
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,631
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

637
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,591
All right.

638
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,385
Okay, see you.

639
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,516
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

640
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,353
Mr. Go?

641
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,191
- Who are you?
- I'm Min's mother.

642
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,819
Cha Min, the top student in this school.

643
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,613
Oh, hello.

644
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:01,284
I heard that Se-yeon keeps
chasing after Min.

645
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,664
I think they should be focusing
on their studies, not dating.

646
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,791
It's actually Min who's chasing Se-yeon.

647
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,501
Excuse me.

648
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,338
Min is the one who won't leave her alone.

649
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,758
I actually was going to
call you about that.

650
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,178
I was hoping you could
calm him down a bit.

651
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:26,184
I understand that the boy can't help it
since our Se-yeon is so pretty.

652
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,063
But what will he grow up to be

653
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,857
if he's already busy running after girls?

654
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,235
"Busy running after girls"?

655
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,244
You must be so devastated
about your daughter.

656
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,247
I appreciate your consolation.

657
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:51,001
You must have been so worried
about your son.

658
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,423
I appreciate your concern.

659
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,686
We're here to celebrate,

660
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,522
since it's his birthday.
So why don't we open a bottle?

661
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,648
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

662
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,109
Could you get us the 20-year-old
wild ginseng wine?

663
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,194
Yes, sir.

664
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,154
- Hey.
- Yes?

665
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,990
It's not even my birthday.
Why would you...

666
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,617
Hey!

667
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,286
That little brat...

668
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,665
Now, since it's your special day,
here you go, sir.

669
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:39,257
Next is my beautiful mother.

670
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,675
Here you go.

671
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,931
There you go.

672
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,647
Here you go, ma'am.

673
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:04,991
That was quick.

674
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,745
Yes, but it's not a yellow box.
It's light blue.

675
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,331
- Yes.
- No, it's fine.

676
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,959
Yes, that's right.
From the public prosecutor's office.

677
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,795
Yes, that's right. Where?

678
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,423
- I think we found them, sir.
- You found them?

679
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,758
Where is it?

680
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,885
- It's in Gangnam.
- Let's go.

681
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,016
He never goes easy on the alcohol,

682
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,393
that old man.

683
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,230
You must be exhausted.

684
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,191
Why don't we go inside? Is that okay?

685
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,156
Mom, I think you've had enough to drink.
Why don't we stop here?

686
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,868
Hey, we're only just getting started!

687
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,496
Of course! We were only warming up.

688
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,498
- Right?
- Should we toast on it?

689
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,624
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

690
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,003
- You too, my darling.
- Sure. Cheers.

691
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,504
Cheers.

692
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,968
- Min.
- Yes, sir.

693
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,052
This is perfect.

694
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,722
- We should toast, too.
- Yes, sir.

695
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,432
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

696
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:16,104
You know my son
always came in first, right?

697
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,320
Where's your mother?

698
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,115
My mom can barely take a shot,
but she had two today.

699
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,867
It gave her a headache so she went to bed.

700
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,786
How about your mother and my dad?

701
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,747
Are they done talking?

702
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,874
I think they'll be up all night.

703
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,337
How do they get along so well?

704
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,756
They could be best friends.

705
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,383
- Why not?
- Cheers.

706
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,218
Now, let's...

707
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,387
Shall we go for a walk?

708
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,348
Sure.

709
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,103
I got a call from Detective Park earlier.

710
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,065
Remember when Oh Yeong-cheol
sent packages to Seo Ji-uk?

711
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,026
They tracked down the deliveryman
and got the testimony.

712
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,111
Really? That's good to hear.

713
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,489
Now that it's confirmed that

714
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,824
Oh Yeong-cheol and Seo Ji-uk
were in it together,

715
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,994
I guess we only need to find proof
of how they committed the crime.

716
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,037
Right.

717
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,210
I hope this all ends,

718
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,047
so that you can tell your parents
who you really are.

719
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,385
And I hope

720
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,513
everything goes back to its place.

721
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,265
It will.

722
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,477
And I hope that I can

723
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,605
always be by your side

724
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,149
for the rest of my life.

725
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,416
You don't have to answer now.

726
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,879
I know this isn't important
to you right now.

727
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,258
So just hold onto it for now.

728
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,095
But when you eventually want to
and when you eventually have the time,

729
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,223
you can wear the ring.

730
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,567
Min.

731
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,241
I love you so much.

732
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,083
I said, I love you.

733
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:47,589
You don't have to say it.
I already know...

734
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,049
- I love--
- Whatever.

735
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,303
If you won't say it,
I'll say it more for you.

736
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,518
I'd risk my whole life

737
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,354
and do whatever it takes

738
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,566
to keep you happy.

739
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,862
I'll keep you safe

740
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,073
no matter what happens.

741
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,580
- Really?
- Of course.

742
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,272
Dad!

743
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,650
Goodness, sir...

744
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,027
- Dad, wake up!
- Mom!

745
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,904
- I'm fine.
- Min!

746
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,739
- Dad...
- Let me help you, sir.

747
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,201
- One, two, three!
- Three!

748
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,787
- Let's have some more.
- Ma'am?

749
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,790
Ma'am, you should sleep in your room.

750
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,999
Where am I?

751
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,669
- When did I...
- One, two, three!

752
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,713
- Oh!
- Oh, gosh!

753
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,508
Wait! Come on, please get up!

754
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,885
We need another round!

755
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,054
How about tomorrow?

756
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,430
- Come on...
- Tomorrow.

757
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,984
She's going to have
quite a headache tomorrow.

758
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,322
You must be exhausted.

759
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,658
- Let's go to bed.
- Okay.

760
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,538
I... I didn't mean together.

761
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,624
You should go to bed since you're tired.
That's what I meant.

762
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,168
Yes, I know.

763
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,338
So, where should I sleep?

764
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,716
You can use this room or the one upstairs.

765
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,843
Oh, but Mom is using that room...

766
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:59,804
I'll just sleep out here.
I love sleeping on the couch.

767
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,264
No, I'll sleep out here.

768
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:04,309
You said you can't sleep
if it's not one of those hybrid things.

769
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,854
No, it's fine.
I won't be able to sleep tonight, anyway.

770
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,290
- Good night.
- You, too.

771
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,255
Go to bed.

772
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,938
We've been using the same bed all along,

773
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,066
why is he suddenly acting like that?

774
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,321
What is it?

775
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,603
I said I'd protect you,

776
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,814
but I can't help myself.

777
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,192
Let me sleep with you.

778
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,614
- Are you okay with it?
- What do you mean?

779
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,574
The way I look right now.

780
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:09,827
<i>It doesn't matter what you look like.</i>
<i>You're still the same Se-yeon to me.</i>

781
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,997
I heard you were investigating
Oh Yeong-cheol's criminal conspiracy.

782
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,666
He admitted to instigating fabrications
for the autopsy results.

783
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,878
If it's purple,
it means I have one last chance left.

784
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,004
<i>What happens after that?</i>

785
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,465
<i>I hope that you can end up</i>

786
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:25,009
<i>where you want to be.</i>

787
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,677
<i>Are you going to marry my son?</i>

788
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,179
I'd like to take your son.

789
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:30,431
I'm going to be yours forever.

790
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,433
I love you.
