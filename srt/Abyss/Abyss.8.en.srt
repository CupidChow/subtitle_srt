1
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,841
SUGYEONG NURSING HOME

2
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,218
I can't believe
she's in a place like this.

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,221
- Let's go in and check first.
- Okay.

4
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,605
Is there a long-stay patient here
who goes by the name Jang Sun-young?

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,691
- No.
- You didn't even look it up!

6
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,359
It's a tiny place.

7
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,904
I don't have to look it up
to know if it's our patient or not.

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,323
How about this person? Is she here?

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,242
No, she's not.

10
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,953
Are you sure?

11
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,539
Look me straight in the eye.
You're lying, aren't you?

12
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,707
- Excuse me?
- You--

13
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,210
We're from the prosecutor's office.
Please cooperate with us.

14
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,281
Mom.

15
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,908
Mom!

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,548
Hee-jin!

17
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,219
Mom?

18
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,640
Where's my mom?

19
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,268
I think we just missed her.

20
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,025
I'm going out!

21
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,319
Get in the car! Hurry!

22
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:45,957
Hey, mister.

23
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,252
Where are we going?

24
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,670
What?

25
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,631
We're going somewhere nice, aren't we?

26
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,926
Sure. We're going somewhere nice.

27
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,895
It's that one over there, isn't it?

28
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,229
- It is.
- Step on it! Catch up!

29
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,983
Somewhere nice...

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,694
Somewhere nice...

31
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,446
This is so nice.

32
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,073
Mom.

33
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,035
We're almost there, so hold on tight.

34
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,912
All right.

35
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,834
Min, we must not lose her, okay?

36
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,717
Come on. Hurry!

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,765
Damn it.

38
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,978
Can't you go faster?

39
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,702
Mom...

40
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,833
Crap.

41
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,547
- That crazy bastard.
- Mom.

42
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,591
- Hold on tight.
- Okay.

43
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,773
The lights are so pretty.

44
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,614
Damn it. Where did they go?

45
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,791
They were in front of us a minute ago.
Where did they go?

46
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,543
Can't you go faster? Come on.

47
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,549
Hee-jin, hold on tight.

48
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,557
Hey, look. Isn't that the car?

49
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,977
- Yes.
- Hey, stay on the right lane.

50
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,753
Mom!

51
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,549
- Mom.
- No, Hee-jin.

52
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,800
Let go of me!

53
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,304
Se-yeon, it's dangerous!

54
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,831
EPISODE 8

55
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,249
Hey, be careful there.

56
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,178
Hey, Mi-do.

57
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,056
They looked everywhere,
but there's no body.

58
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,140
No.

59
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,975
That can't be right.

60
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,603
Or they could have gotten out of the car
before it exploded.

61
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,647
The car was destroyed
before the explosion.

62
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,109
The car is totally wrecked.
There's no way they could've survived.

63
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,529
They're in no condition to run away
this fast. That makes no sense.

64
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,615
Then, where the heck did they go?

65
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,536
I'm certain that there were two people.
We saw them before chasing after them.

66
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,996
Mi-do, I understand.

67
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,499
But calm down first.

68
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,919
I told them to keep searching the area.

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,020
I would have prepared
something more appropriate

70
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,442
if I had known you were coming.

71
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,526
Please don't say that.

72
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,652
This is more than enough.

73
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,907
It's delicious.

74
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,202
I'm glad that you like the food.

75
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,996
You too, Prosecutor.

76
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,457
- Dig in, please.
- Okay.

77
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,177
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
This must be an inconvenience for you.

78
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,220
Gosh, please don't say that.

79
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,390
Don't say that.
You're always welcome here.

80
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,729
I bet it's hard to stay sane
after going through that.

81
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,314
I'm sure it's tough.

82
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,608
The tragic experience we both went through

83
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,277
of having our children die
in an accident...

84
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,990
No one knows how it feels
unless they've experienced it.

85
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,994
I ought to look after her as we share
the same misfortune. Who else would do so?

86
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,208
I'm glad you brought her here.
You did the right thing. I mean it.

87
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,587
Please look after her for a few days
until I find a hospital for her.

88
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,881
Take your time.

89
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,301
You can take all the time you need.

90
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,011
Okay.

91
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,806
It's delicious.

92
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,017
- Dig in.
- Okay.

93
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,610
Like you said,

94
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,029
there's someone in the car.

95
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,739
I'm telling you. I saw them.

96
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,952
But how did they disappear

97
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,913
from a car that was completely
destroyed from the explosion?

98
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,914
That's my point.

99
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,999
What about the car?
Did you look up the plate number?

100
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,336
- It's an unregistered vehicle.
- You've got to be kidding me.

101
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,797
There must be security cameras.

102
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,217
Come on. What is it?

103
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,718
Hold on, Mi-do.

104
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,639
Right now, what's important to me

105
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,725
isn't this case.

106
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,562
Why do you keep meddling in this case?

107
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,480
What?

108
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,482
Right now,

109
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,319
you're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

110
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,159
I feel refreshed.

111
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,286
Who the hell are you?

112
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,339
3851, stop it right now!

113
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,757
Let go of him!

114
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,091
Damn it!

115
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,720
Requesting backup in the locker room.

116
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,140
Hey, are you all right?

117
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,400
Are you crazy?

118
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,654
Take him.

119
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,886
Do you think you people can stop me?

120
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,972
You cannot stop me.

121
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,183
I,

122
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,229
Oh Yeong-cheol, am a god.

123
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,858
It doesn't matter how distinguished
you were outside these four walls.

124
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,860
The only thing you can do now

125
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,030
is just wait for the day
you die in that cell.

126
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,490
Got that?

127
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,076
Shut up and repent for your crimes.

128
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,954
We'll see if that's true.

129
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,874
Look at this.

130
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,295
Take a look at this bright marble.

131
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,591
Keep your crazy thoughts to yourself.

132
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,104
I can revive people with this,

133
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,983
and the only people
who can use and see this

134
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,694
are the ones that came back to life.

135
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,532
And when they come back to life,

136
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,870
they look completely different.

137
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,630
Order a stay of prosecution for now.

138
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,841
Okay.

139
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,385
Oh, right. I heard that Oh Yeong-cheol

140
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,262
caused trouble again in prison.

141
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,765
Get this. He tried to kill another inmate.

142
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,018
And he said that he was a god.

143
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,271
It sounded like he was mentally unstable.

144
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,899
What if he commits suicide?

145
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,861
He's a smart man. I'm sure he's just
trying everything he can do in his power.

146
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,864
I doubt that
he'll kill himself that easily.

147
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:04,992
But

148
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,828
since he keeps denying the charges

149
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,538
and changing his testimony,

150
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,957
we might have to do
a follow-up investigation.

151
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,167
A follow-up investigation?

152
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,879
I think we should inspect the crime scene
to check the evidence.

153
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,881
Tell the precinct in charge
to do a follow-up.

154
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,424
- Okay.
- Thanks.

155
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,821
<i>Judging by the look on your face,</i>

156
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,241
I guess you've received my present.

157
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,701
But why the long face?

158
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,205
I'm sure it brought back
some old memories. Wasn't it nice?

159
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,040
What do you want from me?

160
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,334
I want a deal.

161
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,213
You think I'd make a deal with you?

162
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,383
You're being delusional.

163
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,009
If you want to maintain

164
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,221
your social status and continue
to live as Seo Cheon-sik's son,

165
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,974
you'd better listen to me.

166
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,477
You saw Su-jin, right?

167
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,688
She's grown into a beautiful young lady.

168
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,481
Just like her mother.

169
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,485
That bitch, Jang Sun-young,

170
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,697
brings bad luck,

171
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,200
but she used to be quite good-looking.

172
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,828
- Am I wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

173
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,246
She's still alive.

174
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,248
I'm talking about Jang Sun-young.

175
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,585
I'm hiding her in a place
where no one knows about.

176
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,714
I need you to look after her.

177
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,507
Just for the time being.

178
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,552
I need Su-jin
for what I'm trying to accomplish.

179
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,264
And to get that girl on board,

180
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,141
I need Jang Sun-young alive.

181
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,560
What is it
that you're trying to accomplish?

182
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,353
This won't change anything.

183
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,773
You're looking at a life sentence
at the least or even the death penalty...

184
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,319
I will never die.

185
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,197
I've discovered a way to escape death
even when someone kills me.

186
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,283
And one more thing.

187
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,870
That little bitch who didn't die
even though I killed her.

188
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,581
I have to get rid of her.

189
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,502
That bitch, Go Se-yeon, also knows.

190
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,883
This marble.

191
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,680
She knows about
the astonishing power of this marble.

192
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,602
So, you should

193
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,396
help me for your own sake.

194
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,816
No one in the world

195
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,736
can stop us now.

196
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,243
If she really is alive, it's not good.

197
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,713
Well...

198
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,801
It's not like I bought it out of concern
for you or because I care for you.

199
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,637
I just happened to see a place
that sells porridge on my way here.

200
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,017
Have some, please.

201
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,228
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

202
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,771
I don't even know

203
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,732
whether my mom is alive or not.

204
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,113
That's why you need to eat.
You have to get your strength back

205
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,824
so that we can find your mom
as well as the bastard who killed me.

206
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,742
Are you just going to sit here
and keep crying?

207
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,162
What if that bastard...

208
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,582
What if he kills my mom as well?

209
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,212
No, he won't.

210
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,589
He can't kill her.

211
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,969
He would have killed her already
if that was what he wanted.

212
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,514
He moved her elsewhere
because he knew we'd be coming.

213
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,100
I'm sure he won't be able to kill her
until he achieves his goal.

214
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,186
So please don't cry, Hee-jin.

215
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,271
Pull yourself together

216
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,440
so that we can find her
before he gets to her, okay?

217
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,651
You should have some water.

218
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,703
<i>If you want to find your mom,</i>

219
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,955
<i>you'd better do as I say.</i>

220
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,000
<i>My mom is okay, right?</i>

221
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,836
<i>That depends on what you decide to do.</i>

222
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,715
<i>I'll do anything.
Please don't kill my mom.</i>

223
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,258
<i>Are you with Go Se-yeon now?</i>

224
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,263
By the way, when will Min be here?

225
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,141
I'm not sure.

226
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,143
He just said he'll be here soon.

227
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,271
Have some porridge, please.
It won't be good when it gets cold.

228
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,356
Okay.

229
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,442
Hello?

230
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,444
<i>Ms. Lee, where are you?</i>

231
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,864
I'm in a meeting
with one of my clients at the moment.

232
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,825
- What's going on?
- <i>You should get back to the office now.</i>

233
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,745
<i>There's a woman here,
and she's insisting that she is Lee Mi-do.</i>

234
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,413
Sorry? What...

235
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,249
You must not let her in.
She is a weird woman.

236
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,459
I'll...

237
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,170
Please kick her out.
I'll be there shortly. Okay.

238
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,798
- What's going on?
- It's an emergency.

239
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,842
You have to eat this whole thing, okay?
I'm off.

240
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,723
ARE YOU WITH GO SE-YEON NOW?

241
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,731
<i>I know where she lives.</i>

242
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,323
What are you talking about?
Let go of me, please.

243
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,783
I'm telling you. I am Lee Mi-do.

244
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,410
Forging documents like this
is also considered a crime.

245
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,497
Look, do you really not recognize me?

246
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,457
I really am Lee Mi-do!

247
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,126
Enough with this crazy talk!

248
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,877
I know what Ms. Lee looks like.

249
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,047
Jeez, this is so frustrating.
Hold on a second.

250
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,092
I'll call a cop I know

251
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,427
and prove to you right here
that I am Lee Mi-do.

252
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,311
Hey, Dong-cheol. Someone is calling you.

253
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,232
Gosh.

254
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,986
- Hello?
- Hey, Dong-cheol. It's me.

255
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,070
<i>Who?</i>

256
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,322
It's me, Mi-do. Lee Mi-do.

257
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,159
The biggest party animal in Hoenggye-ri,
Nampyeong-eup. Lee Mi-do!

258
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,873
Dong-cheol,
I have a super urgent matter here.

259
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,168
Come to the law firm now
with your fingerprint scanner.

260
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,586
Excuse me.

261
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,505
Stop prank calling me.
And stop this nonsense.

262
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,132
or you'll be arrested.

263
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,510
Hello? Dong-cheol. Hey!

264
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,347
Give me a second. I can call another cop--

265
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,600
Just drag her out.
What are you waiting for?

266
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,311
Let go. Let go of me, please.

267
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,479
I will leave of my own accord.

268
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,065
But before I leave,

269
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,652
let me make a quick phone call in there.

270
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,411
Let's see if you can still say no
when you get this.

271
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,374
Damn you!

272
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,501
Not you.

273
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,462
Jeez, this woman.

274
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,381
<i>You still have that birthmark
on your butt, right?</i>

275
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,511
<i>Get yourself here in 30 minutes
with your fingerprint scanner.</i>

276
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,473
<i>If you don't, I'll disseminate
photos of that birthmark. Got it?</i>

277
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,351
What's wrong?

278
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,770
- Nothing. Don't mind me.
- Something must be going on.

279
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,564
No, don't worry.
What the hell did I do when I was drunk?

280
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,652
Hey, the fingerprint scanner. Go bring it.

281
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,155
Hey, can you have a look
and see if I have a birthmark here?

282
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,865
Is this a bruise? What is it?

283
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,783
Well...

284
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,743
- Is it not there?
- Hold on.

285
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,371
- You still have this?
- It's there?

286
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,749
- I'm here!
- Ms. Lee, you're here.

287
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,919
Yes. Did you manage to kick out the person
who was impersonating me?

288
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,754
- No, she's still here.
- What?

289
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,755
She's really weird.

290
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,091
Right? How weird.
She looks just like me, doesn't she?

291
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,385
But the thing is,
I have a bit of a situation now--

292
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,553
Over there. She's sitting in that room.

293
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,638
Sorry?

294
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,183
So, she's still here.

295
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,066
I have to check something.

296
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,734
I mean, my face didn't change that much.

297
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,571
I just got my eyes and nose done.
That's all.

298
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,117
I still look like the old Lee Mi-do.
Why doesn't anyone recognize me?

299
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,455
Hello.

300
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,001
I heard you keep insisting
that you're Lawyer Lee Mi-do.

301
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,379
Yes, I'm Lee Mi-do. Who are you?

302
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,549
You don't look like somebody
that would do something like this.

303
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,883
Why are you impersonating me?

304
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,177
And if you want to con people,

305
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,596
at least pick someone
whom you actually look like.

306
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,932
Impersonation is considered a misdemeanor,

307
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,810
so people tend to not take it seriously.

308
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,521
But if you obtain profit
through impersonating someone, at least--

309
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,481
Who is impersonating whom here?

310
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,068
Is it you? Are you the skank
who's been impersonating me?

311
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,862
What? "Skank"? You little--

312
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,156
I am the real Lee Mi-do.

313
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,657
Look at this!

314
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,535
I got some work done on my face,
but still...

315
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,412
Have a good look!

316
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,873
What? How did you get your hands
on her ID card?

317
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,669
Right, forging ID cards
is a piece of cake these days.

318
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,005
Where is this place?
Where did you go to get this done?

319
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:25,218
That cow has so much to say.

320
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,055
That cow has so much to say.

321
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,806
- That what?
- Hey.

322
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,975
Why don't you shut
that rude ass pie hole of yours

323
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,895
before I give you a good ass-whooping?

324
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,650
Mi-do.

325
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,611
Come on. Escort her out.

326
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,406
Listen, this woman is impersonating me.
I'm the real Lee Mi-do.

327
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,616
Gosh, wait!

328
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,577
You stupid cow! Tell them the truth!

329
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,496
Do you want a good ass-whooping?

330
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,165
Let go of me. I said, let go!

331
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,958
Let go, please.

332
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,720
- I can't solve that problem for you.
- Hey, then who else will?

333
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,848
I have no money or identity. I have
nothing because you revived me like this!

334
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,184
You said she'd be away for three years.
Why is she back?

335
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,394
I have no idea. How would I know?

336
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,271
What do I do? I'm so screwed.

337
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,524
Jeez, you impersonated her
without even checking that?

338
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,527
- Hey, you aided in it.
- Me? When?

339
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,403
When you were a murder suspect.

340
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,657
You had food to eat and a place to sleep
because I impersonated her.

341
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,535
- Shit.
- Gosh, I'm really screwed now.

342
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,537
So, I just need to persuade her

343
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,413
so that she doesn't get you locked up

344
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,832
- for impersonation?
- That's it.

345
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,584
- I have no choice, then.
- What?

346
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,086
I only have one thing.

347
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,171
I'll have to use it.

348
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,424
What? The only thing you have?

349
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,051
What is it? What?

350
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,848
And that's why I prepared...

351
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,392
this.

352
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,566
So, you really needed me,

353
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,694
but you couldn't get a hold of me,
the real Lee Mi-do.

354
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,114
Then you happened to find someone
that looks just like me?

355
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,449
That's right.
That's exactly what happened.

356
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,826
How can such a thing happen?

357
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,663
All this already happened,
so let's say I believe you.

358
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,959
Then what do you want me to do now?
Why are you offering so much money?

359
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,253
It's just a small compensation
to show you how sorry I am.

360
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,172
If you agree to keep this matter
to yourself,

361
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,091
I can give you anything you'd like.

362
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,469
For example,
I can double Park & Jang's initial offer.

363
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,889
Actually,
I can even add the terms that you want

364
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,599
and make a place for you
in our legal team.

365
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,436
Well, it's not like
I'd do anything for money.

366
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,813
You love money.

367
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,733
Forget it.

368
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,235
I'm insulted. I refuse to engage
in conversation with her.

369
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,738
No, don't. I apologize on behalf of her.
Please sit down.

370
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,455
What's the matter with you?
You're the desperate one.

371
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,540
By the way, what does she do?

372
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,959
She used the word, "misdemeanor,"

373
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,170
when we talked earlier.

374
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,880
Are you a lawyer as well?

375
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,341
Never mind. Let me see your ID.

376
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,884
What?

377
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,552
Well...

378
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,930
Why are you asking
to see my ID out of the blue?

379
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,264
What's your name?

380
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,849
What is your real name?

381
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,060
Why do you need my name--

382
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,604
You don't even need to know who she is.

383
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,773
I urgently needed someone to play you,

384
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,484
so I picked her up
from one of the streets in Noryangjin.

385
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,153
How did you find someone

386
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,322
who looks exactly like me?

387
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,324
- Right?
- Could she be my doppelgänger...

388
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,162
But personality-wise,
she's nothing like me. She's so rude.

389
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,080
Right? I know.

390
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,122
You know what?

391
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,416
Actually, you see girls that look like her

392
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,001
- all over Noryangjin.
- You're right.

393
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,463
Anyway, I understand your point.

394
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,507
I'll think about it and contact you.

395
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,883
Sure, I hope to hear

396
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,344
a positive response.

397
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,472
I'm off.

398
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,556
Wait.

399
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,645
I changed the passcode
for your place at Golden Palace.

400
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,854
It's 1666 now.

401
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,855
What?

402
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,651
Just a second.

403
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,990
I left my things at your place.

404
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,035
I'll pick them up later.

405
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,456
Get home safely.

406
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,626
Hey, did you have to say that?

407
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,129
I really hate Lee Mi-do.

You're off to my burial site, right?

413
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,778
I'll drive.

414
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,654
Mi-do, aren't you supposed
to be in New York?

415
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,156
It's me, Go Se-yeon.

416
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,619
Others may not recognize me,
but you of all people should.

417
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,662
Se-yeon!

418
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,498
Se-yeon, wake up.

419
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,541
Se-yeon!

420
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,257
Mom.

421
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,344

00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,767
was actually Go Se-yeon?

425
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,369
For God's sake.

426
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,455
<i>The number you have dialed
is unavailable now.</i>

427
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,333
She went all crazy and told me
to rush here. Why isn't she picking up?

428
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,751
Jeez.

429
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,839
MI-DO

430
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,633
Which one is the real Mi-do?

431
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,303
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Dong-cheol.</i>

432
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,180
What's up?

433
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,599
Have you found out anything
about the nursing home?

434
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,561
Hey, that's not important now.

435
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,563
Some girl has been impersonating you.

436
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,231
What? Someone is impersonating me?

437
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,192
Yes. She keeps calling me,
insisting that she is Lee Mi-do.

438
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,403
So? What did you say to her?

439
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,906
- What do you think? I called her crazy.
- Good! That's great.

440
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,993
I'll explain everything later.

441
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,202
For now, hang up

442
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,455
if she calls you again.
Just hang up on her.

443
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,040
Actually, don't even pick up
if she calls again.

444
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,917
Why? I'll catch her. She impersonated you.

445
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,711
<i>No, don't.</i>

446
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,505
Don't do anything rash. I'll sort it out.

447
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,884
Well, all right.

448
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,260

I'll call you back.

451
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,642
Okay, you must be busy.
I'll let you get back to work. All right.

452
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,645
Has she gone mad?

453
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,275
Why the hell is she calling
her ex-boyfriend?

454
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,741
MESSAGES

455
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,576
<i>Checked and confirmed.</i>

456
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,203
<i>Continue to do as I say,</i>

457
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,330
<i>and Jang Sun-young will be safe.</i>

458
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,474
Hey, why are you crying again?

459
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,267
Se-yeon.

460
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,522
Well, I figured you probably
haven't eaten anything all day.

461
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,440
I got you lunch earlier,

462
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,943
so I picked up dinner as well.

463
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,112
Didn't you say you were headed home?

464
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,948
Hey, don't even get me started.

465
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,035
It's a bit too complicated to explain.

466
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,622
I don't even know anymore.

467
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,001
Can I sleep here tonight?

468
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,962
What?

469
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,296
Well...

470
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,174
I don't think I can live
in that apartment anymore.

471
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,802
But why...

472
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,095
She's back.

473
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,513
The real Lee Mi-do.

474
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,140
I really hate Lee Mi-do.

475
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,187
What's with that look?

476
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,191
Do you hate the idea of me
sleeping here tonight that much?

477
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,860
No, it's not that.

478
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,196
I have to make a quick phone call.

479
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,367
Hey.

480
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,494
What's going on?

481
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,416
<i>The door is closing.</i>

482
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,427
<i>The door has been opened.</i>

483
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,157
Take care of it now.

484
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,078
Do the job well
if you want to have a future.

485
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,875
This is nuts.

486
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,336
- <i>Go Se-yeon won't be there today.</i>
- Seriously!

487
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,340
- Se-yeon.
- Hey, how could you--

488
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,466
Let me explain.

489
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,574
I thought I heard something.

490
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,896
What?

491
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,108
I thought I left the lights on
before taking a shower.

492
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,028
My gosh!

493
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,240
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Are you okay?

494
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,450
This is considered breaking and entering.

495
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,327
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, that's not it.

496
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,870
That's not it, I...

497
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,458
Can we talk outside?

498
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,085
- What?
- Let's go out for...

499
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,087
Hold on.

500
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,755
- What's going on?
- Shit.

501
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,008
Mi-do!

502
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,993
Se-yeon?

503
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,580
Se-yeon, what happened?

504
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,123
Se-yeon, open your eyes.

505
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,250
Se-yeon!

506
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,210
Se-yeon, wake up!

507
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,930
Se-yeon.

508
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,143
I'm sorry I'm always late, Se-yeon.

509
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,563
I...

510
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,066
really am.

511
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,491
Doctor, how is she?

512
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,744
Fortunately, no major organs were damaged,

513
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,163
but it could've been critical
since she lost a lot of blood.

514
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,998
Will she make a full recovery? How is she?

515
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,169
The surgery went well,
and she'll wake up soon.

516
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,799
What about Ms. Lee Mi-do?

517
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,634
Her tests aren't done yet,

518
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,553
but she only seems to have a minor injury.

519
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,349
What should I tell the chairman?

520
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,061
I'd appreciate it
if you kept this a secret.

521
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,230
Sure.

522
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,542
Min.

523
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,586
How's Se-yeon?

524
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,635
- I didn't think he'd go this far.
- Leave.

525
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,099
I had no choice.
I couldn't risk my mom's life...

526
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,482
Take this and leave.

527
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,360
If you need more, just call.
I'll send you more.

528
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,532
- Min--
- You were after my money anyway.

529
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,784
You can have all the money you want,

530
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,287
so just get lost.

531
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,584
Don't ever approach me or Se-yeon again.

532
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,794
Got it?

533
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,922
Because of you...

534
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,549
Actually, no.

535
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,262
Because of me who was stupid enough
to let you near us again,

536
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,598
Se-yeon almost died twice.

537
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,850
So please...

538
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,021
Please get out of my sight.

539
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,274
Get out.

540
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,819
Get out of here!

541
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,073
She's not going anywhere.

542
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,409
Not without my permission.

543
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,077
Se-yeon, are you all right?

544
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,829
Se-yeon...

545
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,372
I'm...

546
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,918
the type of person who needs to see one

547
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,921
get punished for their sins.

548
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,798
Se-yeon, I'm truly sorry.

549
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,344
I'm sorry.

550
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,720
So, Hee-jin.

551
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,391
You must stay near me
until you make up for what you did.

552
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,439
How's Mi-do?

553
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,153
The fake Mi-do called me over to her firm

554
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,280
while the real Mi-do
wants me to come to the hospital.

555
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,200
Do they think I'm their personal
fingerprint scanner courier?

556
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,868
Which room was it again?

557
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,079
Dong-cheol?

558
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,830
How did you know I was here?

559
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,874
Who are you?

560
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,127
It's me, Dong-cheol.

561
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,506
- Who...
- You really don't recognize me?

562
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,008
It's me, Mi-do.

563
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,763
- You're the psycho pretending to be--
- What?

564
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,850
- Detective Park.
- I'll be right there.

565
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,437
You texted me
pretending to be Mi-do, didn't you?

566
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,940
I even went to Mi-do's law firm.
I'll arrest you

567
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,400
- if you keep doing this.
- But...

568
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,154
It's about time you told everyone.

569
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,199
What the hell is going on?

570
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,663
Well...

571
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,875
This crazy thing happened to me

572
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,879
and I don't know how to explain any of it.

573
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,799
To be honest,

574
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,552
coming back to life is easier
than explaining this.

575
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,762
But now I realize

576
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,975
that I shouldn't have tried to make it
sound logical in the first place.

577
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,020
Enough with the gibberish

578
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,688
and just get to the point.

579
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,606
Dong-cheol.

580
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,525
Right. I shouldn't call you that anymore.

581
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,903
Detective Park,
the fingerprint scanner you brought.

582
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,072
Can you hand it over?

583
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,574
"Detective Park"?

584
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,785
Mi-do, you should scan yours first.

585
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,747
You keep talking to me
as if we know each other.

586
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,377
Look.

587
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,262
Scan it again.

588
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,561
I told you that I'm the real Mi-do.

589
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,398
- Is this a trick?
- I'll scan mine now.

590
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,691
What the...

591
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,073
ID CARD
GO SE-YEON

592
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,081
It's not broken.

593
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,167
It's me.

594
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,294
You're Go Se-yeon?

595
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,379
With that face?

596
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,340
Why did you get plastic surgery?
You look uglier than before.

597
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,508
Ma'am.

598
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,510
Prosecutor Go was murdered.

599
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,637
She's dead?

600
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,806
- How--
- Guys, hold on.

601
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,059
You're both wrong.
I didn't go under the knife,

602
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,685
and I'm not dead.

603
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,523
What kind of nonsense are you spewing?

604
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,691
I know it's hard to believe.
What she's saying is true.

605
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,278
You already witnessed
how I came back alive after being dead.

606
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,656
But that...

607
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,242
You over there.

608
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,201
Don't tell me

609
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:16,372
you believe all this rubbish
they're talking about.

610
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,417
Why are you nodding
like you know what's going on?

611
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,504
Well, I was brought back to life as well.

612
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,426
- But...
- No way.

613
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,511
I mean...

614
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,389
Are you saying you're zombies?

615
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,933
Is being revived a trend?

616
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,686
I know that this is hard to believe.

617
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,438
How could you believe this?

618
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,983
If you need more proof,
we can always provide that.

619
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,818
Our appearances might change,

620
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,197
but fingerprints, DNA, and blood vessels
in the iris remain the same.

621
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,741
- But, then--
- If that wasn't the case,

622
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,744
how would Lan Cosmetics
have acknowledged me as Cha Min?

623
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,956
I already went through the tests.
Do you want to see the results?

624
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,299
PATERNITY TEST AND STR DNA PROFILE

625
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,009
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT

626
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,844
MATCH

627
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,730
Then Mi-do...

628
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,273
I'm Go Se-yeon.

629
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,197
So let's say that you're Prosecutor Go

630
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:36,118
and that you truly
came back from the dead.

631
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,245
Why didn't you

632
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,080
tell me this sooner?

633
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,541
Just like him,

634
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,084
you could've

635
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,422
told me that you're really Prosecutor Go.

636
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,009
Instead of telling me the truth,

637
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,929
you strung me along
and let me fall for you.

638
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,265
About that...

639
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,685
Well, I truly apologize for everything.

640
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,563
The man that killed me

641
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,357
is still at large.

642
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,775
That's...

643
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,487
- It was Oh Yeong-cheol.
- He has an accomplice.

644
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,324
In this case, he's the real culprit

645
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,245
since that son of a bitch
is the one who killed me.

646
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,874
I can tell you this for sure

647
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,086
because I'm the only one who got murdered
and was then revived.

648
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,004
- Unbelievable.
- Just hold it right there.

649
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,799
What the hell is going on?

650
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,719
What happened to you
while I was out of the country?

651
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,429
Se-yeon...

652
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,099
was murdered?

653
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,726
Yes.

654
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,021
No way. Why would anyone kill her?

655
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,357
My gosh. Who would kill Se-yeon?

656
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,733
Mi-do, please.

657
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,612
I'm still alive and kicking,

658
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,989
so please don't cry.

659
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,658
I know she was a brat and a snob,

660
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,910
- but she didn't deserve to die.
- Mi-do, please.

661
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,245
- But--
- I'm here.

662
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,998
I'm Se-yeon. I'm right here.

663
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,291
- I'm still alive. So--
- Hold on.

664
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,251
All right, fine.

665
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,545
You all died
but were brought back to life.

666
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,798
Of course. It can happen, I guess.

667
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,385
You were revived, so were you,

668
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,971
and you too.

669
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,181
So why

670
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:26,061
are you telling us the truth now?

671
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,647
The man who came after Mi-do
thought it was me.

672
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,151
He's Oh Yeong-cheol's accomplice
and the culprit who killed me.

673
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,320
We must catch the bastard.

674
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,871
You heard
how you have to act today, right?

675
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,039
- Yes.
- Sure.

676
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,291
All right. I'll give you these.
Pass these around then.

677
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,794
What I want is quality acting.
I'll be watching you all.

678
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,422
- You all know I studied acting, right?
- Yes.

679
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,590
Let's go then.

680
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,136
<i>To catch him, we need to set up a trap.</i>

681
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,387
What's with all these people?

682
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,807
<i>Stage the scene
and make it look like I was killed.</i>

683
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,602
- Don't let them get through.
- What happened in there?

684
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,354
Why do you want to know?

685
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,315
- Someone was murdered.
- Murdered?

686
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,401
- My gosh!
- Keep it down, people!

687
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,028
No photos are allowed.

688
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,364
Well, the young lady
who lived in this unit

689
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,407
was attacked by a robber.

690
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,912
- Someone in the building died?
- She was murdered.

691
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,581
<i>The culprit will come back to the scene.</i>

692
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,833
<i>He won't make his next move</i>

693
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,044
<i>until he verifies that I'm truly gone.</i>

694
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,506
<i>Also, making him believe that I died</i>

695
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,841
<i>will ensure Jang Sun-young's safety too.</i>

696
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,551
<i>Go Se-yeon is dead now.</i>

697
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,595
<i>When can I see my mom?</i>

698
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,767
<i>Be patient.</i>

699
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,270
<i>Hee-jin, keep pretending
to be on his side.</i>

700
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,690
<i>I'm sure that he'll contact you again.</i>

701
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,442
<i>In other words, you'll be a double agent.</i>

702
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,777
I'm supposed to wait?

703
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,741
<i>You sent a text, right?
Tell me who you sent it to.</i>

704
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,787
<i>You're on a tight leash now</i>

705
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,831
<i>because you betrayed us the last time.</i>

706
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,340
I should check
if my mom is all right or not.

707
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,801
You should cooperate
if you want her back safe and sound.

708
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,094
Unbelievable.

709
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,513
When on earth did you take this?

710
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,931
Hee-jin.

711
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,516
Get me a glass of water.

712
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,813
Gosh, the pain is back again.

713
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,191
- Wait, why did I get stabbed again?
- All right, fine.

714
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,111
That little brat.

715
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,737
So who did she text?

716
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,745
You'll probably need to stay here
for a while. Is that all right?

717
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,414
This is nice.

718
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,251
<i>Mi-do, I'm sorry, but until we catch him,</i>

719
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,754
<i>you need to stay invisible
like you have been so far.</i>

720
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,299
<i>Your life could be in danger</i>

721
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,843
<i>if he finds out
that the real Mi-do is back.</i>

722
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,760
LEE MI-DO

723
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,013
<i>So, we should make it look
like Go Se-yeon,</i>

724
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,098
<i>who has been impersonating Lee Mi-do,</i>

725
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,142
<i>is dead.</i>

726
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,959
<i>When he is sure that I am dead
and reveals himself,</i>

727
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,212
<i>we will catch him.</i>

728
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,589
ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON
CHOE GI-HUN

729
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,424
MURDER CASE REPORT

730
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,475
<i>She's gone for sure, sir.</i>

731
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,268
LEE MI-DO

732
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,822
I was so busy today
that I haven't had anything to eat.

733
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,242
You fool.

734
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,245
Thanks. Here, have a bite.

735
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,582
Is this...

736
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,711
Is this what you brought
for someone who's just recovering?

737
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,922
You said you're much better now.
You can't eat this?

738
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,757
No, I can eat.

739
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,426
- I can even have this now.
- No, you can't.

740
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,095
Come on, I'm fine now.

741
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:32,057
Just one drink won't be a problem.

742
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,892
Give it here. You're still recovering.

743
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,061
Why are you taking mine?

744
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,190
It's mine.

745
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,903
Does she still look like Mi-do to you?

746
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,406
What was that all about?
Why do you even care?

747
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,199
What are you talking about?

748
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,328
I was only concerned about Prosecutor Go.

749
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,333
When he thought I was you, Mi-do,
he treated me so well.

750
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,585
You have no idea.

751
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,546
I only did that
because I thought she was you.

752
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,423
Look at her.

753
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,341
She kept calling me "my dear"
with that face.

754
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,218
How could I not fall for it?

755
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,762
Besides, which face do you think
is more familiar to me?

756
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,847
Her face, of course.

757
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,892
Why did you have to get surgery
on your pretty face?

758
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,895
You look like Mr. Bogus now!
Did those American doctors do this to you?

759
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,522
- We should file a lawsuit.
- Shut up!

760
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,481
Is that so, my dear?

761
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,610
Did your heart flutter for this face?

762
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,403
- Stop it, already.
- Stop.

763
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,197
What was that?

764
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,575
Where did she go?

765
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,076
Hey.

766
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,244
Hee-jin!

767
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,330
What are you doing back there?

768
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,875
I shouldn't be here with you, you know.

769
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:43,587
You two were put in danger because of me.

770
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,257
I do feel guilty, you know.

771
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,635
Hey, you know what?

772
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,638
I hate it even more when you act all nice
than when you're scamming people.

773
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,307
Do you think I like having you here?

774
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,934
I'm only letting you stay here

775
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,520
because we need you to help lure him in.

776
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,230
And...

777
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,068
your mother is taken as hostage.

778
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,362
Still...

779
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,786
Don't you think it would
be better if I left?

780
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,455
Hey, the bastard still has your mother.

781
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,123
It'll be safer for both of you

782
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,626
if you just wait here
until we figure out the situation.

783
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,919
Exactly.

784
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,463
And I need someone to care for me
until I make a full recovery.

785
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,340
You'll do that, so come here
and eat something.

786
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,843
By the way, have you found anything
from the surveillance footage?

787
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,220
- Oh, yes.
- This looks good.

788
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,014
As you instructed,
we looked for someone who

789
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,141
- showed up multiple times near the scene.
- Okay.

790
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,726
Hold on.

791
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,144
It's him. Look.

792
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,313
He's the one we were able to single out.

793
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,235
I know his address,

794
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,861
so we'll be able to get him in no time.

795
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,310
Did you see the picture I sent you?

796
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,272
I did as you instructed.

797
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,816
So you'll help me to not
be found guilty in return, right?

798
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,571
Prosecutor Seo?

799
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,408
Are you sure you told me everything?

800
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,989
<i>- Did you take care of it?</i>
- Yes.

801
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,909
<i>Without any problems?</i>

802
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,660
Are you okay?

803
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,580
This is considered breaking and entering.
Have you lost your mind?

804
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,915
No, that's not it.

805
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,293
Can we talk outside?

806
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,128
- What?
- Let's go out for...

807
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,047
<i>No, sir.</i>

808
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,301
She was alone, just like you said,
so I could do it without any problems.

809
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,348
I told you everything.

810
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,058
I did everything you told me to.

811
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,060
All right.

812
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:49,439
This case will not be indicted
for lack of evidence.

813
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,358
Don't worry about it.

814
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,026
Yes, sir.

815
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,495
Now you should take good care
of your grandmother.

816
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:55,380
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
FOR MAKING THIS CHOICE

817
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,016
<i>Prove to me that my mom is safe.</i>

818
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,304
Come in!

819
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,183
- Are you going to bed?
- Yes.

820
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,476
Then I'll turn the lights off.

821
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,186
Okay.

822
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,480
Min?

823
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,232
If you are

824
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,527
being hard on Hee-jin because
you feel bad about what happened to me,

825
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,071
you don't have to do that.

826
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,823
You can follow your heart.

827
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,952
She may be an ungrateful bitch to me,
but not to you.

828
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,788
I'm sure you still have feelings for her.

829
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,373
I don't.

830
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,377
After all the things we've gone through,

831
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,629
I asked myself if I really did love her

832
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,674
and whether the feelings
I once had for her were love.

833
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,011
I've realized
that I didn't really love her.

834
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:30,266
You were single your whole life
before you met her.

835
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,727
Look at you,
talking like you know what love is.

836
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,814
Although I was single my whole life,
I know what being in love is like

837
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,941
though it wasn't mutual.

838
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,445
That's why I know
that I've been completely over her

839
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,739
for quite some time now.

840
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,534
Are you happy now? I'm going to bed.

841
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,952
Does that mean

842
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,996
I can treat you like I did before?

843
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,417
I mean, the way I had treated you
before you met Hee-jin.

844
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,503
- Were you treating me any differently?
- Of course!

845
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,257
Fine, do whatever you want.
Since when did you ask for my permission?

846
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,633
Then, don't go.

847
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,928
Don't leave me.

848
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,264
Stay by my side until I fall asleep.

849
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,940
Should I repeat math formulas?

850
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:22,819
No, I need to go to sleep now.
I have to get up early tomorrow.

851
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,951
Something's been on my mind
all day, though.

852
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,287
On the day I was killed,
the culprit planned everything

853
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,581
so meticulously that he even knew
the security cameras

854
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,500
would be turned off
for the maintenance work.

855
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,752
After that,

856
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,504
he showed up at the crime scenes
without any preparation.

857
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,174
I just don't get it.
How can anyone so careless

858
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,467
- plot the murder--
- Go to sleep.

859
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,926
- Fine.
- Good.

860
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,219
I'll go to bed.

861
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,639
I'll just sit here and read over these,
so go to sleep.

862
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,682
All right.

863
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,702
- We can kiss.
- What?

864
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,539
No! That's not what I was thinking!

865
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,750
I'm not that kind of guy.

866
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,752
- It was more of a suggestion.
- What?

867
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,922
Can I kiss you?

868
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,467
Hey, what are you talking about?

869
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,761
Since when did you
ask my opinion before...

870
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,314
Good night.

871
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,979
<i>Do girls want
the relationship to be official?</i>

872
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,940
<i>Why is he so dressed up?</i>

873
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,358
Are you sure it was suicide?

874
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,860
I can't find any signs of a murder.

875
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,613
He's the only one who knows
Mom's whereabouts. If he's dead,

876
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,198
<i>how are we supposed to find her?</i>

877
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,202
Someone tells me you can help me
get my hands on anything.

878
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:02,539
Did Detective Park ask you, too?

879
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,332
<i>I don't know what he's up to,</i>

880
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,418
<i>but he came to the station a few days ago
and asked for a ridiculous favor.</i>

881
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,420
<i>You fooled me.</i>

882
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,839
<i>I wonder where you're hiding now.</i>

883
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,971
