1
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,802
This looks like bleach.

2
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,180
What? Bleach?

3
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,850
Well, I'd have to take it back
and examine it to know for sure.

4
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,810
But it smells like it.

5
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,521
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

6
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,740
- Detective Choe!
- Hey.

7
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,993
I asked the division about the female cop,
but they said there's no such cop.

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,161
What?

9
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,042
DONGBU POLICE STATION

10
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,168
What? Bleach?

11
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,545
This guy must be a total nut job!

12
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,799
No, I'll call you back.

13
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,386
Damn it. How can they lose him?

14
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,307
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Where are you?

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,600
I'm at home.

16
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,685
<i>Are you with Prosecutor Go?</i>

17
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,978
Yes, she's here.

18
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,397
Make sure she doesn't leave the house,
okay?

19
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,150
What's going on?

20
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,153
Oh Yeong-cheol escaped.

21
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,575
All right, don't worry about it.

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,119
I'll stay by her side.

23
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,425
Se-yeon!

24
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,635
Go Se-yeon!

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,639
Right, she's listening to music.

26
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,315
What are you doing there?

27
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,989
I'm here to finish up weeding some parts.

28
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,325
I was told to finish them by today.

29
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,410
I wasn't informed about that.

30
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,663
Is that so?

31
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,093
It's getting late.
You should just wrap up and go home.

32
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,848
Okay.

33
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,523
You...

34
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,860
You were here too?

35
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,956
Oh my gosh!

36
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,792
What was that? Why are you out here?

37
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,918
Oh Yeong-cheol...

38
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,754
- What?
- It's Oh Yeong-cheol.

39
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,507
Oh Yeong-cheol?

40
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,803
EPISODE 11

41
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,807
There wasn't anyone suspicious
in the footage.

42
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,017
Are you sure?

43
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,601
Yes, you know how it is.

44
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,105
Only people with a visitor's pass
can enter the main gate.

45
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,149
Are you sure you saw Oh Yeong-cheol?

46
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
I didn't see him.

47
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,069
I saw the glow from Abyss.

48
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,240
But the glow seemed different
from what I had seen before.

49
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,159
How different?

50
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,494
It glowed in green when we had it.

51
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,204
But earlier,

52
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,420
it was dark blue. It was more like navy.

53
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,005
Really?

54
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,383
Can its color change like that?

55
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,844
You're right.

56
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,764
When I first saw it, it was yellow.

57
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,516
But after we brought Hee-jin back to life,
it wasn't yellow anymore.

58
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,436
Right. That means
I might have really seen its glow.

59
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,937
Hee-jin!

60
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,106
If Oh Yeong-cheol knows where she is,

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,108
she's in as much danger as I am.

62
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,904
Search the garden to make sure
no one suspicious is on the premises.

63
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,614
- Strengthen the security too.
- Yes, sir.

64
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,033
- I have to run away.
- Mom. Hold on.

65
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,161
Your clothes. It's your clothes, Princess.
I have to run away.

66
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,121
Mom, what's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

67
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,373
- What's wrong, Mom?
- I have to go!

68
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,292
Mom! You can't go anywhere at this hour.

69
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,419
But I have to go.

70
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,380
Who is it?

71
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,387
Hee-jin, are you all right?

72
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,933
Se-yeon.

73
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,950
How is she? Has she calmed down?

74
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,245
She calmed down and fell asleep.

75
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,456
She threw a fit
after watching the news this morning.

76
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,543
That might've been the trigger.

77
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,504
I'll tell my doctor to come
check on her tomorrow morning.

78
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,509
But what brings you guys here
at this hour?

79
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,095
Well...

80
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,891
Oh Yeong-cheol got loose.

81
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,186
Oh Yeong-cheol

82
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,856
is loose?

83
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,576
Did he come find you by any chance?

84
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,288
Or did you happen to see
the glow from Abyss?

85
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,956
No, not at all.

86
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,375
Maybe, you might've been mistaken.

87
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,627
This isn't just some ordinary house.

88
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,255
Even if he escaped,
there's no way he could've come here.

89
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,465
Hee-jin.

90
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,801
If you're lying to us again

91
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,430
or hiding things from us,
you must tell us now.

92
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,431
Min.

93
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,559
I've changed now.

94
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,354
I understand that you can't trust me,

95
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,397
but...

96
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,691
I found my mom.

97
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,236
Which means I wouldn't have to
put Se-yeon in danger,

98
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,321
so...

99
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,448
don't worry.

100
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,133
Whether I saw the glow or not,

101
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,596
doesn't change the fact that the bastard
is loose and that your safety is at stake.

102
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,223
Just to be safe,

103
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,476
don't go anywhere by yourself
until he's apprehended again.

104
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,770
You should always be careful, okay?

105
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,814
Okay. I'll be careful. Don't worry.

106
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,192
Good. Go get some rest.

107
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,402
Okay.

108
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,870
- Goodnight.
- Okay. Goodnight.

109
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,955
Okay.

110
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,074
What the heck! Jeez.

111
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,869
- Where are you going?
- Why are you here?

112
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,788
I told you not to go anywhere alone.

113
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,290
Why are you out?

114
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,585
Water. I want water.

115
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,129
I woke up because I got thirsty.
I wanted some water.

116
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,338
Wait here.

117
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,679
I needed water...

118
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,807
Thanks.

119
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,856
- Goodnight.
- Okay.

120
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,190
Goodnight.

121
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,248
Jeez. Come on.

122
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,333
What is it this time?

123
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,668
Until when will you be guarding the door?

124
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,670
I was just about to get up. My back hurts.

125
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,213
Gosh, my back.

126
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,424
Seriously.

127
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,510
I only lie on
hybrid power spring mattresses, you know.

128
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,012
I didn't ask you to sleep here.

129
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,639
You can sleep on your own bed.

130
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,932
There's nothing else we can do.

131
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,934
Sleep with me.

132
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,229
What? Hey, we're not even married.

133
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,773
- We can't sleep together.
- Look.

134
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,358
See how tall I am?

135
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,069
Considering that, which body part
should be the strongest?

136
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,989
- Your legs?
- No, it's my back. My back.

137
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,658
Men must have a strong back.

138
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,451
Especially for a tall man like me,

139
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,371
fourth and fifth vertebrae must be strong.

140
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,624
And to keep them strong, I must sleep
on a quality bed. Don't you agree?

141
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,795
I guess so. Your back is important too.

142
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,171
Right.

143
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,798
But think about the situation we're in.

144
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,800
We're in danger
because Oh Yeong-cheol is loose.

145
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,386
In a nutshell, it's like we're in wartime.

146
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,222
But if we stay apart,
it'll double the danger, right?

147
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,641
I guess it makes sense.

148
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,850
- Right?
- Yes.

149
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,976
So let's sleep together.

150
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,314
I don't have an ulterior motive.
This is a perfectly rational decision.

151
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,942
You like making rational decisions,
don't you?

152
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,904
Yes, I do like making rational decisions.

153
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,572
Right. Let's go.

154
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,703
A rational decision...
Something's strange about this.

155
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,631
<i>Darn it. I thought he said
this was some high-end mattress.</i>

156
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,384
<i>This darned bed is seriously too big
for no good reason.</i>

157
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,471
<i>Is Min asleep?</i>

158
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,649
<i>Seriously? He's really sleeping right now?</i>

159
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,700
<i>How could he fall asleep?
I mean in this situation.</i>

160
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,995
<i>I'm in the same bed with him now.</i>

161
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,580
<i>How could he be sleeping so sound?</i>

162
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,086
Protect me, my ass.

163
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,715
He wouldn't even notice
if Oh Yeong-cheol took me.

164
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,052
Se-yeon,

165
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,054
just go to sleep.

166
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,056
Stop thinking.

167
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,113
Go to sleep now.

168
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,325
You said you were tired
after having a busy day.

169
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,828
Right.

170
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,915
I was just about to.
I'm going to sleep now.

171
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,085
<i>How can I possibly sleep
when you're this close to me?</i>

172
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,974
To be honest,

173
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,813
I can't get to sleep.

174
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,253
- Director Cha! Director Cha!
- Oh my gosh.

175
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,046
My clothes. I'm wearing clothes, right?

176
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,464
Hey, go take care of that.

177
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,675
It's the crack of dawn. Who was that?

178
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,594
I don't know who he is,
but I'll make sure I fire him.

179
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,640
What is this about?

180
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,685
We found this in the garden.

181
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,606
Look, Mom.

182
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,949
This is my phone number.

183
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,870
If something happens, you have
to call this number right away. Okay?

184
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,371
Try writing it down.

185
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,041
Zero, one, zero...

186
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,336
Zero, eight, five, six...

187
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,011
Mom, no. That's not my number.

188
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,056
Tae-jin.

189
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,394
Tae-jin?

190
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,938
Tae-jin. Let's go see Tae-jin.

191
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,192
You know that
Tae-jin passed away a long time ago.

192
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,404
Mom, why don't you focus and try again?

193
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,448
This is really important. Please?

194
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,574
Let's try again.

195
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,784
Zero, one, zero, zero, eight, five, six...

196
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,164
Okay, fine.

197
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,334
We can memorize this later,

198
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,921
but wear this.

199
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,797
Here.

200
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,093
Look right here.
Press number one nice and long like this.

201
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,512
When you press this button,
you can reach me.

202
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,514
If something happens,
you have to call me. Okay?

203
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,600
- Okay.
- Don't lose it.

204
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,402
We found both Oh Yeong-cheol's

205
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,781
and your mother's blood
on the rock from the garden.

206
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,533
Are you telling me that Oh Yeong-cheol

207
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,078
really came here yesterday?

208
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,039
- Well, yes.
- Yes.

209
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,796
And my mother faced Oh Yeong-cheol?

210
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,050
Seeing how much the blood spread,

211
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,970
it looks like your mother
attacked Oh Yeong-cheol.

212
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,888
We'll find out more once we investigate...

213
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,056
That's why Mom was...

214
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,312
- I'm leaving.
- Hee-jin.

215
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,398
Mom, let's go. Hurry!

216
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,691
Hey.

217
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,567
Wait, wait. Hold on a second.

218
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,152
We strengthened the patrol in the area

219
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,406
and police officers will be on guard
around the clock. He won't come near here.

220
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,740
Besides, where will you go?

221
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,077
He's right, Hee-jin. Calm down.

222
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,662
Let's be rational about this, okay?

223
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,707
Oh Yeong-cheol already knows
that we're here.

224
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,084
Besides, my mom attacked him.

225
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,671
No. We won't stay here a second longer.

226
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,381
You'll be in danger wherever you go.

227
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,759
We tightened the security.
You'll be much safer here.

228
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,386
Let's observe for now.

229
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,680
You'll be busy protecting Se-yeon anyway.

230
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,725
Do you even think about us?

231
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,185
You guys don't know how he is.

232
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,397
Oh Yeong-cheol is not a human.
He's a devil.

233
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,982
I'm sure he'll come to kill us.

234
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,276
He'll come to kill us.

235
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,781
Hey, hey.

236
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,535
If you're that worried,
why don't you stay with me?

237
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,330
Well, my house is small,

238
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,498
but it will be big enough

239
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,417
for you two to stay.

240
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,629
I probably can't go home
until I catch Oh Yeong-cheol.

241
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,673
It's close to the police station too.

242
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,425
- You can stay there.
- Still,

243
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,720
you can't let women stay at a man's house.

244
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,600
The door wasn't locked and I was curious
what you were discussing.

245
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,060
What's going on?

246
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,861
Please take good care of them.

247
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,529
Don't worry.

248
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,865
Actually, Director Cha

249
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,034
hired me to defend Jang Sun-young's case.

250
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,244
I came here for that.
Well, I guess it all worked out.

251
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,372
I need to find out what happened

252
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,291
after she was separated from her mother.

253
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,085
It will also be easier to prepare my case

254
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,669
if I stay with my client.

255
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,755
I'll stop by often too.

256
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,717
You can just move in with me, you know.
It's safer that way too.

257
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,845
Gosh, you've become so open-minded
after studying in the States.

258
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,139
- Tone it down, will you?
- I know you like it.

259
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,309
Ms. Jang.

260
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,979
That bastard won't be able
to find you at the new place,

261
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,564
so don't worry.

262
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,235
Try to do as Hee-jin says

263
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,113
and you have to eat a lot too. Okay?

264
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,990
Yes.

265
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,727
<i>Tae-jin.</i>

266
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,062
<i>Tae-jin.</i>

267
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,773
<i>Hee-jin. Your mother called someone.</i>

268
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,323
She remembered this number?

269
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,496
NAME

270
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,457
SAVE NEW CONTACT

271
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,214
Mom, you can't call
random people like that.

272
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,175
- No prank calls, okay?
- Okay.

273
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,678
Number one, here.
I told you to press just this button.

274
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,929
Number one!

275
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,931
- Okay. Give me that.
- Good job.

276
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,144
SECOND DAUGHTER

277
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,395
ASSIGN SPEED DIAL NUMBER

278
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,521
SAVED

279
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,232
This is my number.

280
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,694
If you don't feel like pressing
number one, you can press two, okay?

281
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,404
Number two.

282
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,448
By the way, who's Tae-jin?

283
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,075
It's my brother.

284
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,077
You had a brother?

285
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,039
Is your mother slowly
getting her memories back?

286
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,542
He's dead.

287
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,296
It's been over 20 years
since he passed away.

288
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,925
I guess he's buried in her heart.
She asks for him from time to time.

289
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,595
When Oh Yeong-cheol was giving us hell,

290
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,971
he was helpful...

291
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,724
to both of us.

292
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,268
Get in now.

293
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,355
I'll get going, Se-yeon.

294
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,440
Don't worry, Hee-jin.

295
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,400
The police put out an APB
on Oh Yeong-cheol.

296
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,735
I'm sure they'll catch him soon.

297
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,571
Ms. Jang, why don't you
go on a picnic with Hee-jin?

298
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,658
- Let's go.
- Picnic!

299
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,538
Sir.

300
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,708
I bought what you asked for.

301
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,502
Thanks.

302
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,170
WANTED: EOMSAN-DONG SERIAL KILLER

303
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,673
The posters are up all over
this neighborhood too.

304
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,883
I took it down whenever I saw one.

305
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,551
You don't have to do that.

306
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,264
Because this guy

307
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,809
won't exist in this world anymore.

308
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,450
You're still here.

309
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,828
I should get going now.
Let's go if you're ready.

310
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,122
- Go where?
- Where do you think? My company.

311
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,916
I told you that I will stay with you 24-7.

312
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,460
If you're going to stay with me,

313
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,212
you should accommodate to my schedule.

314
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,547
Why should I follow you?

315
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,840
You're unemployed.

316
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,592
Until when are you going to mooch off me?

317
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,386
What? Did you just say "mooch off"?

318
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,096
You think you're wasting money on me?

319
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,056
As soon as I get my identity back, I can--

320
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,643
That's my point. Until you do, come with
me so you can at least pay for your food.

321
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,480
I've got nothing. Damn it.

322
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,860
<i>Attention, all customers...</i>

323
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,695
- Welcome back, ma'am.
- Hey.

324
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,989
Why are you all here?

325
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,410
Did anything happen while I was away?

326
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,455
Director Cha instated more guards
at the main house.

327
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,706
Why all of a sudden?

328
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,001
According to the security manager,
he spotted a suspicious individual.

329
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,961
I'm looking into this for more details.

330
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,881
- And the problem isn't the house.
- What is then?

331
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:25,177
Director Cha hired Ms. Lee Mi-do
to join Lan Cosmetics' legal team

332
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,512
at a premium annual salary.

333
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,849
Is that so?

334
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,520
Well, she used to be a prosecutor
and worked at a big law firm.

335
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,147
He hired a good one.

336
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,941
The thing is that she's hired
under the legal team on paper,

337
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,360
but she's more like
his personal assistant.

338
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,197
- Personal assistant?
- Yes. From what I've heard,

339
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,908
he told the employees to put a desk
for Ms. Lee in his office

340
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,368
and spends his whole day with Ms. Lee.

341
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,870
What's more is that

342
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,084
they even go to the restroom together.

343
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,129
Look at this brat.

344
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,008
He's using the company's resources
for his love life.

345
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,303
I should get things rolling now.

346
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,513
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes.

347
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,932
Where was the place you mentioned before?
Was it Nampyeong?

348
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,266
- Yes.
- There.

349
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,894
Let's head over there first
before I go back to the office.

350
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,978
Yes, Ms. Eom.

351
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,029
Here is your coffee, Director Cha.

352
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,489
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Go.

353
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,784
I don't drink instant coffee.

354
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,285
Get me ground coffee or drip coffee.

355
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,997
"Drip coffee," my ass.
I'll crush you if you keep this going.

356
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,585
Just drink what I gave you.

357
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,090
Fine. I guess I can do it myself.

358
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,884
I can make my own coffee.

359
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,556
- Do you want one too?
- Yes, I want mine with ice.

360
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,974
Okay. More or less ice?

361
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,309
- Do we have ice?
- No.

362
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,395
Are you kidding me?

363
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,274
My gosh!

364
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,833
I thought it was a coffee commercial.

365
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,626
He's a masterpiece.

366
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,337
Who is that girl with connections?

367
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,549
Who on earth is she?
Why is she glued to Director Cha?

368
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,301
Do you remember the girl he kissed

369
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,887
when he fell at the lobby the other day?
Isn't that her?

370
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,722
Do you think she's his girlfriend?

371
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,098
No way.

372
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,058
- Right?
- Right.

373
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,768
- There's no way.
- Right?

374
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,939
He's the reason that I come to work.

375
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:45,942
Here.

376
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,612
Thank you.

377
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,870
By the way, when do you get off work?

378
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,371
You're the director of this company.

379
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,956
In dramas, people like you

380
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,500
go home really early.

381
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,419
Gosh, you don't know anything.

382
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,088
I have to work even more than
other employees as a director.

383
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,508
Min, in that case, can I step out
for a moment? It'll be really quick.

384
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,261
Where are you going?
I'll come with you after I finish.

385
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,388
I'm worried about my parents.

386
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,434
My parents must be in
as much danger as I am in.

387
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,229
What if Oh Yeong-cheol went to my parents?

388
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,565
You should just sit tight then.

389
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,525
I have a lot of work today.
I'll be working late.

390
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,277
Hey.

391
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,032
But I'm really worried.

392
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,162
Is anyone home?

393
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,165
I knew that her family wasn't well-off,

394
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,542
but it's worse than I thought.

395
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,713
What's this smell? Gosh, it stinks.

396
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,466
- It stinks.
- Who is she?

397
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,219
Why is she standing in front of our house?
What is she doing?

398
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,345
That's our house.

399
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,014
What is this about?

400
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,394
What?

401
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,278
- This is green plum tea.
- Okay.

402
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,404
Have some tea.

403
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,115
Well,

404
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,160
there's no need to drag this out.
I'll cut to the chase.

405
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,246
To sum it up,

406
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,041
we are happy with Ms. Lee.

407
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,460
Let's go ahead with the wedding.

408
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,004
Pardon?

409
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:34,134
You came here unannounced
and say strange things.

410
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,469
Wedding? You mean my daughter?

411
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,889
Are you talking about Mi-do's wedding?

412
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,391
Well, Director Cha...

413
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,726
Did you not know

414
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,563
that she's dating my son?

415
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,772
What?

416
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,359
My gosh, Mi-do is dating Dong-cheol.

417
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,112
I'm very well aware of your circumstances.

418
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,866
Nonetheless, we should still have
a proper wedding,

419
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,826
so I brought this.

420
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,037
This will come in handy
when you prepare the trousseau.

421
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,456
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes, ma'am.

422
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,172
Oh, my. I still don't understand
what's going on here.

423
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,090
Excuse me.

424
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,678
Mi-do didn't tell us anything about this.

425
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,514
She didn't.

426
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,602
- What's wrong?
- Take a look.

427
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,145
What is it?

428
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,022
Let me see.

429
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:38,114
How dare you? Who do you think we are?
How dare you give us money?

430
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,910
Being rich doesn't give you
the right to be rude to people.

431
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:46,039
You can't just barge in here
and hand us an envelope full of money.

432
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,832
This is outrageous!

433
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,210
- Honey...
- You need to leave.

434
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,337
- Get out.
- Sir, please.

435
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,422
There's no need to get emotional.

436
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,674
I don't want to hear anymore.
I want you out of my house.

437
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,885
- Hey, let go of me.
- Sir, please...

438
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,554
- Leave!
- All right, fine.

439
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,640
- I hear you, okay? I'm leaving.
- She's leaving.

440
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,143
Get out of my house. Now! Both of you!

441
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,104
Leave!

442
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,773
Unbelievable.

443
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,570
Can we really make him pay for everything

444
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,407
he did to my mom?

445
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,994
Yes, once her status as a citizen
is recovered.

446
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,999
We have enough evidence
that he abducted and confined her,

447
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,794
but the victim still needs
an identity first.

448
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,261
- Right.
- It will take some time,

449
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,180
and there is a lot to do before

450
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,807
we can bring him to justice.

451
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,308
You must stay strong.

452
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,148
We'll file the report first

453
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,859
and track down your mother's friends

454
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,819
from before she was abducted.

455
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,821
Sure.

456
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,615
Excuse me.

457
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,034
Hi, Mom.

458
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,328
<i>How have you been
conducting yourself these days?</i>

459
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,038
You almost took my ears off.

460
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,541
What's with the yelling?

461
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,834
What's going on?

462
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,295
Did you break up with Dong-cheol?

463
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,299
It's not like that. We're just on a break.

464
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,050
<i>A break, my ass!</i>

465
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,887
Today, someone from Lan...

466
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:28,641
The chairman of the cosmetics company
came and offered us money.

467
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,144
<i>Are you marrying her son?</i>

468
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,646
Marry her son? Mom, that's not it.

469
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,984
Your father collapsed with shock.

470
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,281
I hear that you're already
going in and out of his house!

471
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,658
Is that how I taught you?

472
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,619
Mom, hear me out.

473
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,663
It's not me. It's someone who looks...

474
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,624
Let's just hang up.

475
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,293
I'll come and explain it to you in person.

476
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,669
Mom?

477
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,215
Gosh. I'm sorry,

478
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,801
but I have to go see my parents.

479
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,303
- Is something wrong?
- Ms. Eom...

480
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,764
I mean, Cha Min's mother

481
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,350
went to see my parents today.

482
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,935
She thinks that Prosecutor Go is me.

483
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,814
She must've done what she did to me.

484
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,941
Your mother must be in shock.

485
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,694
If I leave now,
I won't be back until tomorrow.

486
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,571
Will the two of you be all right?

487
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,448
We're good. You should get going.

488
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,243
Okay, thanks. I'll let Dong-cheol know.

489
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,828
Make sure to lock the doors!

490
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,265
You can't make a move like this

491
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,141
without discussing it with me first.

492
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,811
I told you to stay there and lay low.

493
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,937
Jang Sun-young.

494
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:00,441
How the hell did you lose her?

495
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,570
Things just got out of hand.

496
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,198
I'll take care of it, so don't fret.

497
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,410
I told you many times

498
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,621
that I need her for what I'm planning.

499
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,457
If you had wanted to make a move
without discussing it,

500
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,293
you should have tied up the loose ends.

501
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,754
You couldn't even do one simple thing?

502
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,843
This is why I don't think you're ready.

503
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,224
If you wish to continue
living your life as Seo Ji-uk,

504
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:37,312
put your trust in me
and watch from the sidelines.

505
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:41,149
You'll never be able
to solve the mess you're in.

506
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,651
Just what exactly do you have planned?

507
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,570
I told you before

508
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,283
that I have a marble which
brings people back

509
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,368
from the dead.

510
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,954
This again?

511
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,416
Do you still not believe me?

512
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,543
You saw Go Se-yeon walking around

513
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,379
even though you killed her.

514
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,386
It was you, wasn't it?

515
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,724
You're the one who finished her off.

516
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,775
I'm not a woman to you, so it's all good.

517
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,333
<i>I took care of the ignorant fool.</i>

518
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,757
I'm sorry, but could you go
to Chungdang-dong, please?

519
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,442
Hey, Se-yeon!

520
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,619
Se-yeon!

521
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,972
I'll leave the drinks here.
Drink it before you go to bed.

522
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,608
Min.

523
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,610
Min...

524
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,001
You're not dead yet?

525
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,631
You made a mistake in the first place.

526
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,676
I'm sorry.

527
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,720
I never made a mistake before,

528
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,808
but that was my first kill
after becoming an old man.

529
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,062
This is probably why

530
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,189
the elderly constantly say

531
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,566
that they should just die.

532
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,488
Anyway,

533
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,116
do you believe me now?

534
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,909
I don't,

535
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,746
but I'll play along
since I can't prove it.

536
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,541
So what do you have planned?

537
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,504
I will

538
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,549
lure Go Se-yeon out...

539
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,345
and commit a murder-suicide.

540
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,474
Once everyone is sure that I am dead,

541
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,768
I will come back to life...

542
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,190
with this marble.

543
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,943
To do so,

544
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,738
I need someone else
who can also see this marble.

545
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,034
Su-jin.

546
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,412
My dear daughter

547
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,502
will bring her dad back to life.

548
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,145
I want to pee.

549
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,109
Where am I?

550
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,989
Princess!

551
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,624
Ma'am?

552
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,669
Ma'am!

553
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,089
What the hell? She's barefoot.

554
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,970
Ma'am, are you all right?

555
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,138
Princess.

556
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,892
Tae-jin.

557
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,986
INCOMING CALL

558
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,739
CALL ENGAGED

559
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,533
<i>Tae-jin?</i>

560
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,412
<i>Tae-jin, help!</i>

561
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,706
<i>- Is this your son?
- Tae-jin!</i>

562
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,833
Hello, are you her guardian?

563
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,834
Tae-jin!

564
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,671
I found her wandering the streets

565
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,214
without any shoes on.

566
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,174
- Tae-jin!
- Hold on a second.

567
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,593
<i>I think you should get over here.</i>

568
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,804
<i>Please hurry.</i>

569
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,139
Where can I find you?

570
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,265
<i>We're at...</i>

571
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,792
Mr. Cha!

572
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,462
Here. Let me do this.

573
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,297
It's fine. You must be exhausted too.

574
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,216
Why would I be when you did all the work?

575
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,177
This isn't like you.

576
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,181
As your assistant, I can do this much.

577
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,892
When I asked for some coffee earlier,

578
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,894
you said you'd crush me, right?

579
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,313
My gosh. Did I really say that?

580
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,899
I don't know why I'm so rash all the time.

581
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,651
I should apologize. I'm sorry.

582
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,946
From now on, I'll be a good assistant.

583
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,074
Had I known you'd change this much,

584
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,743
I would've sent your parents
to the vacation home sooner.

585
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,663
It's not all because of that though.

586
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,001
It's really fine. You should go and rest.

587
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,090
Mr. Cha, you're so generous.

588
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,552
I'm using the bathroom if you're done.

589
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,929
Sure, go ahead.

590
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,356
Flattery is harder than I thought.

591
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,244
- Mother.
- Tae-jin!

592
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,581
She was crying until a second ago,
but now she's smiling.

593
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,292
Thank you so much. How can I repay you?

594
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,295
Please don't mention it.
I only did what was right.

595
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,715
Make sure you don't let go of your son.

596
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,927
You shouldn't
wander the streets like that, okay?

597
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,845
Yes, sir.

598
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,264
Thank you.

599
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,196
No, it's mine!

600
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,408
Won't you even let Tae-jin see it?

601
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,666
I'll only look at it briefly.

602
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,001
Okay.

603
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,387
Here.

604
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,851
I'm giving you this because
you did as I said.

605
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,604
Thank you!

606
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,831
She must've been exhausted.

607
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,542
She barely slept last night either.

608
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:14,949
What the hell?

609
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,743
- You're up.
- Why aren't you answering your phone?

610
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,953
Oh, right.

611
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,579
Hello?

612
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,791
<i>Min, my mom's gone.</i>

613
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,334
What?

614
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,711
What is it?

615
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,564
Number one...

616
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,858
Number one...

617
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,444
Number one...

618
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,334
Mom!

619
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:10,963
Mom!

620
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,344
Hee-jin, what happened?

621
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,097
She disappeared while I was sleeping.

622
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,266
What? What about her phone?

623
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,434
She always has it on her.

624
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,978
She's not answering. It's been turned off.

625
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,313
- Prosecutor Go.
- Hello.

626
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,189
Did you check the security cameras?

627
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,317
I did, and she was alone.

628
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,068
I don't think she was abducted.

629
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,071
She must've left the building
and got lost.

630
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,035
Hee-jin.

631
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,578
It's all right.

632
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,998
I'm getting a signal.
Can you have it traced?

633
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,374
Sure.

634
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,376
Hee-jin, it's all right.

635
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,379
- It'll be all right.
- What do I do?

636
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,591
Where could she have gone? It's all right.

637
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:54,942
Goodness me.

638
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,861
Look who it is.

639
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:03,409
I've been thinking of the best way
to have Su-jin come to me,

640
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,287
but my son solved the problem.

641
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,206
You exceeded my expectations.

642
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,545
Good job.

643
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,047
You did great.

644
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,386
Make sure that you take control of her

645
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,181
just like you did in the old days.

646
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,477
What's the rush?

647
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,063
You should have a seat.

648
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,403
Come to think of it,

649
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,030
we've never had a moment like this before.

650
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,033
The face you see right now

651
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,244
will soon be gone,

652
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:52,166
so it wouldn't be a bad idea
to have a drink with your old man.

653
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,754
Here.

654
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,514
No, don't!

655
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,643
Run. Run, Tae-jin!

656
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,646
Why won't you listen?

657
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,108
Is this how your mom taught you?

658
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,782
No, don't!

659
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,536
Run. Get away from here!

660
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,835
Run. Run, Tae-jin!

661
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,676
Crazy bitch!

662
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,762
How dare you...

663
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,266
Let go.

664
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,812
Those who don't behave
must be taught discipline--

665
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,397
You said you needed her.

666
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,361
This is why things
keep getting out of hand.

667
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,279
You're always acting on your emotions.

668
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,830
Because you behave like that
to your husband,

669
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,132
this son of a bitch
won't look up to his father.

670
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,137
How dare you...

671
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,068
Stop it!

672
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,704
You...

673
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,539
How could...

674
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,708
How...

675
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,920
The devil can create...

676
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,257
something worse than himself.

677
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,343
I may not have been strong enough
back then,

678
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:10,887
but not anymore.

679
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,080
Sir! We're in trouble!

680
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,875
The police are here.

681
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,722
Hey, wait!

682
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,932
Where do you think you're going?

683
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,062
Damn it. Keep your distance
if you're going to follow us in, okay?

684
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,050
Ms. Jang?

685
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,426
Ms. Jang!

686
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,136
Ms. Jang!

687
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,640
Mom...

688
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,100
Mom!

689
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,268
He just left. Search the area!

690
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,479
Mom, wake up!

691
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,147
Mom.

692
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,899
Wake up, Mom!

693
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,110
Mom!

694
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,330
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

695
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,387
- Prosecutor Go.
- Wait.

696
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,473
We haven't checked in here yet, have we?

697
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,225
No, ma'am.

698
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,062
I don't think these footprints
belong to one person.

699
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,648
Well, it could be the woman
who helped him get away.

700
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,108
A woman?

701
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,445
Don't you think they're too big
to be a woman's?

702
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,718
JI-UK INVITES YOU TO HIS HOUSE
OCTOBER 17, BLOSSOM APARTMENT

703
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,197
Ji-uk!

704
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,740
Wake up!

705
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:17,949
Ji-uk!

706
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,117
Ji-uk!

707
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,452
- Mister.
- Hey...

708
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,374
Do you want me to cover this up for you?

709
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,408
Your guest has arrived, sir.

710
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,801
I was expecting your call.

711
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,388
I'll get straight to the point.

712
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,306
How much do you know?

713
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,475
Actually,

714
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,477
that's not important.

715
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,354
The real question is,

716
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,649
what is your purpose to this?

717
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,486
I don't have one.

718
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,239
I just want to make things right.

719
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,702
That monster, Seo Ji-uk...

720
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,831
You were the one who raised him.

721
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,958
If only

722
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,670
you hadn't put him where he is today,

723
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,591
Oh Yeong-cheol's murders

724
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,719
might not have come this far.

725
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,847
What are you talking about?

726
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,526
You need to reveal the truth
about Seo Ji-uk.

727
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,447
It's your last chance to earn forgiveness

728
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,575
from your real son.

729
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,294
Detective Park.

730
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,839
This is the stuff Mi-do asked me
to bring to you.

731
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,674
- Thank you.
- She went to see her parents,

732
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,718
but I'm not sure why.

733
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,097
How is Ms. Jang doing?

734
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:48,808
Not any better.

735
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,436
I hope she recovers soon.

736
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,147
We got the forensic results.

737
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,733
- Do you want to go check with me?
- Yes. Take this.

738
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,859
I'll stay here.

739
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,069
- Let's go.
- All right.

740
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,365
<i>Like you said, sir,</i>

741
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:06,534
Oh Yeong-cheol and the nurse must've been
hiding there since he escaped.

742
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,412
We only found their fingerprints there.

743
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,790
Just the two of them? Anybody else?

744
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,295
But like you said,

745
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,838
they must've had an accomplice.

746
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,257
Did you find anything?

747
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,012
We analyzed the bloodstains,

748
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,306
and the bloodstains belonged
to three different people.

749
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,601
Oh Yeong-cheol, Jang Sun-young, and--

750
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,687
The last one was the DNA

751
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,147
of an unknown XY chromosome
with the blood type A.

752
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,776
Meaning, three people
fought and bled that night.

753
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,737
An unknown XY chromosome?

754
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,116
Is there any way to find out who he is?

755
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,994
He has no criminal records,
so his DNA is not registered here.

756
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,580
There's no way it could have been
a first-time offender.

757
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,542
We did discover something odd, though.

758
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,712
I compared the DNA of the three people,
just in case.

759
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,172
And there was a significant match

760
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,092
between the DNA of the unknown person
and Oh Yeong-cheol, which means

761
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,387
the unknown guy
is Oh Yeong-cheol's biological child.

762
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,347
His son?

763
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,900
So Oh Yeong-cheol had a son
and didn't register his son's birth.

764
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,446
And Oh Yeong-cheol made his son
assist him in killing people, right?

765
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,574
That's all we can assume.

766
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,827
- What kind of bastard--
- Wait.

767
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,372
What if Oh Yeong-cheol
registered his son's birth?

768
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,375
- By the way, who's Tae-jin?
- He's dead.

769
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,461
Oh Yeong-cheol might've
falsely reported his son dead

770
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:43,214
after he registered his son's birth.
He did the same thing to Ms. Jang.

771
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,052
You mean, Oh Yeong-cheol reported him dead
and made him assist the murders?

772
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,263
Well, there's no difference either way,
but...

773
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,600
What a lunatic!

774
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,852
Hee-jin knows who he is.
Let's get back to the hospital.

775
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,653
DESTINATION: HYEONSEONG MEDICAL CENTER

776
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,229
He's my step-brother.

777
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,482
Tae-jin was Oh Yeong-cheol's son.

778
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:47,112
He was Oh Yeong-cheol's biological son,

779
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,698
but it was hard to believe that
he was raised by that monster.

780
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,284
Because he was such a good brother.

781
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,496
Until when was he living with you?

782
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,207
I don't really remember.

783
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,670
It was a long time ago.
Maybe when I was seven or eight?

784
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,464
I think that's the last time I saw him.

785
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,175
Did he just disappear?

786
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,553
Yes.

787
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:16,599
But he wasn't supposed to tell anyone
that he was Oh Yeong-cheol's son.

788
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,061
He couldn't even
call Oh Yeong-cheol "Dad."

789
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,816
Only a few people know
that Tae-jin is Oh Yeong-cheol's son.

790
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,693
But why?

791
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,779
I'm not really sure.

792
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,824
It all happened when I was little.

793
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,995
Mom would probably have known
more about him.

794
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,252
Let me know if anything else comes up.

795
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,546
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

796
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,383
- It's all right.
- Go on. I'll look after her.

797
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,845
You need to sleep at least
for one or two hours.

798
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,763
You barely slept last night.

799
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,808
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

800
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,102
- Go on ahead.
- Well...

801
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,437
- Let's go.
- Come on.

802
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,654
Go get some rest.

803
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,312
Ji-uk? What brings you here?

804
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,233
I heard that Ms. Jang
has been admitted to this hospital.

805
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,321
I thought I should come and visit her.

806
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:54,864
Oh...

807
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,869
We're all good about
what happened last time, right?

808
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,665
Sure.
I heard Choe Gi-hun fooled you as well.

809
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,417
That's right.

810
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,546
She's still unconscious,

811
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,673
but would you like to see how she's doing?

812
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,968
- I'd like that.
- Okay.

813
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,603
We should

814
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,939
find Oh Yeong-cheol as soon as possible.

815
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,233
Yes.

816
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,777
The prosecution must be busy
because of him.

817
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:34,988
Right.

818
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,032
Who is it?

819
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,702
- Is Jang Sun-young's guardian present?
- Yes?

820
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,079
Could you fill in some papers?

821
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,581
Sure.

822
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:56,843
I told you...

823
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,056
to forget about Tae-jin, didn't I?

824
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,727
To be honest,

825
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,024
I've always hated you for provoking him

826
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,943
when you couldn't even protect me, Mother.

827
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,414
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

828
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,917
You must be having a hard time.
You look so tired.

829
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,879
- I'm fine.
- Let's go. I'll see you off--

830
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,172
No need for that.

831
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,133
Are you sure? Okay, bye.

832
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,406
I'll text you the address.

833
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,200
You can take her if you want.

834
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,334
What brings you here?

835
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,462
I've met her before,
so I thought I should pay her a visit.

836
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,675
You keep showing up

837
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:23,304
in unexpected places, Prosecutor Seo.

838
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,157
Why did she pack this?

839
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,254
Get well soon, Ms. Jang,

840
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:00,508
if you want to go to see flowers
with Hee-jin just like in the drawings.

841
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,562
This number looks familiar...

842
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,151
HEE-JIN

843
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,445
It's Hee-jin's number.

844
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,414
The other one is not in my contacts.

845
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,378
But why does it look so familiar?

846
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:42,341
Try to do as Hee-jin says

847
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,219
and you have to eat a lot too. Okay?

848
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:51,684
Tae-jin.

849
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,561
Tae-jin!

850
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,608
Oh Tae-jin.

851
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,153
She still remembers Oh Tae-jin's number!

852
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,877
Aren't you going to get that?

853
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,632
Why should I let you decide
whether to pick up my phone or not?

854
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:29,096
I don't know what it is
that you have against me.

855
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,850
Why don't you go in
if you're here to visit?

856
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,230
Pick up, Oh Tae-jin.

857
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,671
I'll get going
since I've got better things to do.

858
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,088
Mi-do?

859
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:54,724
<i>I saw a young man walk out of her place.</i>

860
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,686
<i>Prosecutor Seo is the kidnapper.</i>

861
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,190
She's not dead yet.

862
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,945
You're Oh Tae-jin, aren't you?

863
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,944
<i>Who would believe you?</i>

864
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,904
<i>You don't even exist in this world.</i>

865
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,156
<i>Ji-uk was the accomplice.</i>

866
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,908
<i>Go Se-yeon found out about us.</i>

867
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:57,578
<i>I got Prosecutor Seo and Judge Seo's
hair samples.</i>

868
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,038
Are you out of your mind?

869
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,208
<i>How dare you call Seo Ji-uk
Oh Yeong-cheol's biological son?</i>

870
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,543
<i>Please... Please save me, Su-jin.</i>

871
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,545
<i>Tae-jin?</i>

872
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,381
<i>She's not even picking up.</i>

873
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,216
<i>Where in the world did she go?</i>

874
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,969
Oh Yeong-cheol! I'm going to kill you

875
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,971
if you lay a finger on Hee-jin!
