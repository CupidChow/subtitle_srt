1
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,380
What's all this?

2
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,608
Then he's still been on this case
all this time?

3
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,320
I guess Park Gi-man is still after him...

4
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,404
Oh Yeong-cheol.

5
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,953
I know this person.

6
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,206
Who? Oh Yeong-cheol?

7
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,708
He's a famous surgeon.

8
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,751
No.

9
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,170
Not like that.

10
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,841
The day you were killed...

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,426
I met him.

12
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,055
You met Oh Yeong-cheol? Where?

13
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,020
Hey. Are you okay?

14
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,355
Hey.

15
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,319
You haven't left yet?

16
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,446
I don't think this man is breathing!

17
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,576
Who knows? This might be able
to save this guy, too.

18
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,374
Before I revived you...

19
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,336
I revived him with this.

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,797
I revived Oh Yeong-cheol.

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,799
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

22
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,593
I didn't think Abyss would work.

23
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,304
He was bleeding so much
and not breathing that I...

24
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,933
He was dying,
so I could only think about saving him.

25
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,567
Does that mean...

26
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,444
I revived a serial killer...

27
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,781
with this marble?

28
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,752
Don't just stand there. Have a seat.

29
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,045
Okay.

30
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,486
I told you to sit.

31
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,325
You're my guest, so let me treat you.

32
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,124
Here.

33
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,627
Have some tea first.

34
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,504
Thank you.

35
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,691
Step on it, Detective Choe.

36
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,109
All right, sir.

37
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,659
<i>Sir, we got the identity of the suspect</i>
<i>for the Eomsan-dong murder case.</i>

38
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,870
<i>Before Prosecutor Go died, she told us</i>
<i>to check on Oh Yeong-cheol's days off.</i>

39
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,539
<i>They are similar</i>
<i>to the dates of the murders.</i>

40
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,210
<i>We looked into him further,</i>
<i>and that's not the only suspicious thing.</i>

41
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,837
<i>We're leaving immediately</i>

42
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,090
<i>so please come directly</i>
<i>with the arrest warrant.</i>

43
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,511
NAME: OH YEONG-CHEOL
ADDRESS: 34, EOMSAN-RO

44
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,562
Turn off the sirens.

45
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,317
We'll move silently from here on out.

46
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,112
I'll head towards 63-gil.

47
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,447
Min-uk, head right
and block the escape route.

48
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,032
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,784
Let's go.

50
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,911
Prosecutor Seo hasn't called back yet.

51
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,081
Let's not mess things up
and wait for the warrant.

52
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,250
What's taking that jerk so long?

53
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,629
So this Oh Yeong-cheol...

54
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,883
He's a serial killer, right?

55
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,595
That's what it seems like.

56
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,809
Then...

57
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,312
- Then he's the one who killed you?
- No.

58
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,774
He may be a suspect
in the Eomsan-dong murder case,

59
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,736
but there is no guarantee
that he's the one who killed me.

60
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,121
WHAT HAVE THE AUTHORITIES BEEN DOING
FOR OVER A YEAR?

61
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,594
I WILL PUNISH WITH MY OWN HANDS

62
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,137
May 7th?

63
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,806
That's right. It's the day I died.

64
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,066
<i>The number you have dialed is</i>
<i>unavailable now. Please--</i>

65
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,692
Prosecutor Seo isn't answering.

66
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,322
Forget it. We're going in.

67
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,332
Did he run away already?

68
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,336
Hello.

69
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,797
Is anyone home?

70
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,259
Car number 7767, please move your car.

71
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,304
Darn it.

72
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,265
Wait, 7767?

73
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,851
Why does it sound familiar?

74
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,339
Detective Park.

75
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,386
What were you going to do
after barging in without a warrant?

76
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,973
I thought I told you to wait.

77
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,856
Se-yeon, wait.

78
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,065
Se-yeon!

79
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,777
Se-yeon, you should wait here.

80
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,363
No, I want to confirm it myself.

81
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,700
We know for sure it's either
Oh Yeong-cheol or Park Gi-man.

82
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,744
We might get an answer
if we catch one of them.

83
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,957
I need to see the culprit
who killed me with my own two eyes.

84
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,083
Se-yeon, please!

85
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,670
Please just wait here.

86
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,257
Oh Yeong-cheol is a serial killer.

87
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,593
He might be the one who killed you, too,

88
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,803
so you won't be okay after seeing him.

89
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,100
Moreover,

90
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,769
there's a chance...

91
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,609
that I was the one to revive him.

92
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,279
That worthless piece of scum...

93
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,492
He might be the one who killed you,

94
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,454
but I revived him with Abyss...

95
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,170
So let me be the first to find out.

96
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,471
Is anyone home?

97
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,607
Here. Over here.

98
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,484
Please...

99
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,277
help...

100
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,530
Hey. Call an ambulance.

101
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,073
Yes, sir.

102
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:02,083
EPISODE 3

103
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,549
Fine. You go first.

104
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,974
What's going on?

105
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,142
- Did someone die?
- My gosh!

106
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,728
- They're coming out.
- My goodness.

107
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,273
- This town is not safe!
- This isn't a circus, people! Leave!

108
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,109
- Stop making such a ruckus.
- What's going on?

109
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,069
- Stop being nosy!
- Isn't this the abuse of power?

110
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,822
What? How is this abusing my power?

111
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,448
- Is he dead?
- I'll arrest you

112
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,741
for obstruction of justice.

113
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,536
Don't yell at me. Hey, cuff this lady!

114
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,955
- He's dead.
- He is.

115
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,165
- I'll seriously...
- Detective Park! We're leaving.

116
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,417
- Go ahead.
- Hold on.

117
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,712
- Go home, everyone.
- This is obstruction of justice.

118
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,464
Go home!

119
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,053
Isn't Oh Yeong Cheol's house around here?

120
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,681
I think so.

121
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,932
I wonder what's going on.

122
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,560
- Please go home now.
- What's going on?

123
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,770
Damn it.

124
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,024
- Mi-do!
- What do I do?

125
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,491
Mi-do!

126
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,204
Mi-do!

127
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,380
My angel, it's you.

128
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,092
I told you to lay off
fatty foods in the States.

129
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,219
Have you gotten even shorter?

130
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,846
Your neck seems shorter.

131
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,849
- Hold on.
- My Mi-do.

132
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,649
Jeez.

133
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,447
Can you please stop looking at me?

134
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,074
You're embarrassing me.

135
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,369
That's why I told you to sit in the back.

136
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,787
You're a distraction.

137
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,123
How can I look straight ahead
when you're next to me?

138
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,795
Still, you should focus on driving safely.

139
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,797
I got this, Mi-do.

140
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,131
So when did you get back?

141
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,926
A few days ago.
I had business to attend to.

142
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,812
By the way, who's the guy in the back?

143
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,690
I should at least know who's in my car.

144
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,441
He's a paralegal at my law firm.

145
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,151
I wasn't asking you.

146
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,320
Anyway, what happened at that place?

147
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,905
Who was in the gurney?

148
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,202
I'm not sure why I should answer that.

149
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,831
Can't you tell us, Detective--

150
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,127
I mean, Dong-cheol.

151
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,631
- I can't.
- Why not?

152
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
When you left me to study abroad,

153
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,433
my heart ached every day for you.

154
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,562
There was one fact
that comforted me, though.

155
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,565
You gave up the dangerous career
as a prosecutor

156
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,235
and found a safer one as a lawyer.

157
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,821
You weren't in constant danger anymore,

158
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,115
and that was enough for me.

159
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,743
So why are you showing interest
in a crime scene again?

160
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,038
If you don't want
to rip my heart open again,

161
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,583
don't ask any more questions.

162
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,500
Still...

163
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,336
I'm only asking
because I have a good reason,

164
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,213
so can't you tell what is going on--

165
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,673
Why don't you ever listen?

166
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,597
Did he seriously flick me?

167
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,400
BUGYEONG MEDICAL CENTER

168
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,493
What if he finds out you're not Lee Mi-do?

169
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,204
What choice do I have? We need his help.

170
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,583
You may be a paralegal at her firm,

171
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,046
but two people who aren't a couple
shouldn't be this close.

172
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,382
You wait here.

173
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,760
I'll quickly check on the victim
and come out

174
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,637
- so we can grab some dinner.
- Actually,

175
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,138
I'd rather know where the victim is.

176
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,431
Which ward is it?

177
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,392
Let me come with you.
There's something I must check.

178
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,021
Why would you check on him?

179
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,315
Well...

180
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,406
Sweetie, please do this for me.

181
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,242
Please?

182
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,995
You little brat.

183
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,580
Let's go then.

184
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,043
I almost barfed.

185
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,005
How is he?

186
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,218
His thigh and shoulder were wounded,
but none were fatal.

187
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:08,806
I think he probably hasn't
regained consciousness due to his old age.

188
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,100
How is he related to Oh Yeong-cheol?

189
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,772
He's his father.

190
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,859
Based on what the neighbors said,

191
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,528
Oh Yeong-cheol couldn't be reached
for a while.

192
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,823
So his father came to check up on him
and was attacked.

193
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,616
Have you found the assailant?

194
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,245
We won't know
until we start an investigation,

195
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,163
but I think it's the man
you're looking for.

196
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:34,957
Who?

197
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,917
Park Gi-man.

198
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,094
What is it? Is there anyone?

199
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,139
No, sir. We'll check the other side.

200
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,018
<i>I told you to sit.</i>

201
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,146
You're my guest, so let me treat you.

202
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,528
Here.

203
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,114
Have some tea first.

204
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,950
Thank you.

205
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,130
This...

206
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
Why do you have it?

207
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,643
I said it's not over yet.

208
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,979
I told you it's my turn to kill you.

209
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,440
How was...

210
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,817
my invitation?

211
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,279
You...

212
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,366
Your bratty daughter deserved to die.

213
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,078
She was a little thief, you see.

214
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,849
This is pretty.

215
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,369
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is unavailable now.</i>

216
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,293
<i>That brat had a cop for a father.</i>

217
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,047
<i>She should've known better</i>
<i>than to steal and trespass.</i>

218
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,549
No...

219
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,342
Mi-jin!

220
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,012
Mi-jin!

221
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,773
RESTRICTED AREA

222
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,526
Doctor, how's my daughter?

223
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,946
I did all I could, but unfortunately...

224
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,825
No... Mi-jin...

225
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,535
Please...

226
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,538
Please save my daughter. Please!

227
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:23,709
<i>There's also something else</i>
<i>you aren't aware of.</i>

228
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,586
Your daughter

229
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,297
died twice in my hands.

230
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,720
I guess you don't remember,

231
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,848
but the ER doctor on call

232
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,684
on the day your daughter died

233
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,604
was me.

234
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,441
You?

235
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,776
It was you?

236
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,741
Yes, it was me.

237
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,243
I'm Oh Yeong-cheol.

238
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,330
That night,

239
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,500
I killed you myself.

240
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,127
- How...
- Right.

241
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,506
I look different, don't I?

242
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,634
I don't know how this happened,

243
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,011
but one thing for sure

244
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,431
is that the gods are on my side, too.

245
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,185
They don't want me to stop killing.

246
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,728
Right?

247
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,740
Okay. Let's go.

248
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,785
Let's go and ask the gods what they think.

249
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,788
Whose sin would they consider to be worse?

250
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,138
<i>I let the taxi driver in</i>

251
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,516
<i>because he needed</i>
<i>to use the bathroom urgently.</i>

252
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,019
<i>But he suddenly stabbed me out of nowhere.</i>

253
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,982
By any chance,

254
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,901
have you seen him before

255
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,157
or did he say anything when stabbing you?

256
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,243
Actually,

257
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,289
I heard him say something,

258
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,292
but I wasn't in any shape to register it

259
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,460
with me being old and all.

260
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,379
Anyway,

261
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,048
did you catch the man?

262
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,468
Not yet, but we'll catch him soon.

263
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,513
So how are you feeling?

264
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,683
Well,

265
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,437
I'm old enough not to regret
dropping dead the next day.

266
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,563
My goodness.

267
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,900
Still, you're lucky that
the injuries weren't severe.

268
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,568
I heard the wound is shallow.

269
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,487
By the way,

270
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,074
how long has it been
since he didn't come home?

271
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,205
About...

272
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,041
ten days.

273
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,418
- I see.
- Still,

274
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,254
he's so busy that

275
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,424
he often doesn't come home for a few days.

276
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,515
Damn it.

277
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,476
What?

278
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,311
Yes.

279
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,608
What room is he in again?

280
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,403
All right. I'll be right there.

281
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,532
It's so hard to find the way
in this hospital.

282
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,827
What?

283
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,954
OUT OF ORDER

284
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,747
Which way should I take then?

285
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,628
Shit, that burns!

286
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,133
Seriously? What now?

287
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,514
Is this a corpse alarm?

288
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,267
Forget about it.
I'm not reviving anyone else.

289
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,395
Shit, it's hot!

290
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,147
- Why you--
- Who's there?

291
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,691
Pardon?

292
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,073
Are you all right?

293
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,493
Yes, I just got lost
looking for a hospital room.

294
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,246
- Hold on.
- Yes.

295
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,206
Haven't we met before?

296
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,918
- Well...
- Hey!

297
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,837
What are you doing here?

298
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,880
Mi-do?

299
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,882
What?

300
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,053
You're off to my burial site, right?

301
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,930
- I'll drive.
- Mi-do...

302
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,808
- Are you all right?
- What?

303
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,312
Of course.

304
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,398
You suddenly fainted that day.

305
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,357
What?

306
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,235
Right, that I did.

307
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,530
I experience vertigo sometimes,
and I get dizzy.

308
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,200
- Is he from your firm, too?
- Yes, he's a paralegal.

309
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,120
- Mr. Cha, over here!
- Oh, right.

310
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,498
We came to visit a client.

311
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,500
I sent you to get some beverages.

312
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,044
What took you so long?

313
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,797
Ji-uk, we'll get going then.
They're waiting for us.

314
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,299
See you around.

315
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:38,065
Seriously? What were you doing with him?

316
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,816
Listen to me.

317
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,694
This suddenly started to glow
and acted up.

318
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,238
I was trying hard to stop myself
from reviving anyone else,

319
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,406
but he came out of nowhere.

320
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,575
Did he see this marble then?

321
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,286
- I don't think so.
- Really?

322
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,998
Why is it acting up though?
It's been dormant until now.

323
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,625
It acted up as I passed the morgue.

324
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,794
What? What does it mean then?

325
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,339
Does it automatically become active
in front of dead bodies then?

326
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,132
Didn't it come with a manual?

327
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,133
It did,

328
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,469
but it's in an alien language.

329
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,428
Hey, this is perfect.

330
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,222
- What is?
- This place!

331
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,434
It's the perfect place
to test this marble called Abyss.

332
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,982
Honey!

333
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,573
Hey, get in there.

334
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,075
I don't know them, though.

335
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,619
- Just get in there!
- No, you do it.

336
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,703
Go on!

337
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,583
My friend!

338
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,337
Wait.

339
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,717
How dare you bother
those grieving parents?

340
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,137
He's a total lunatic.
Hurry up and call security.

341
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,806
I didn't mean
any disrespect to the family.

342
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,851
Se-yeon, tell them what's going on.

343
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,477
- Hello?
- Se-yeon?

344
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,687
- Hello?
- Hey!

345
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,188
- Hello?
- Go Se-yeon!

346
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,440
Damn it.

347
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,953
Where did he go?

348
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,413
Detective Choe, are you okay?

349
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,541
- Park Gi-man, you jerk!
- Park Gi-man!

350
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,425
Get him!

351
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,551
- Park Gi-man!
- Park Gi-man!

352
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,097
Park Gi-man!

353
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,516
That jerk.

354
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,393
Hey, call the CCTV Control Center.

355
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,478
Yes, sir.

356
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,146
Damn it.

357
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,733
You just showed me
why I shouldn't be nice to people.

358
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,027
I saved your life,
but all you do is use me.

359
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,988
When you don't need me, you abandon me.
And now you pretend not to know me?

360
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,490
Unbelievable.

361
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,283
Come on, don't be mad.

362
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,203
But why isn't Abyss working
when there are so many corpses here?

363
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,413
Hey, do you think

364
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,333
it only works on those who were murdered
or died a wrongful death?

365
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,376
You're not answering me.

366
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,752
Why is that? Am I invisible?

367
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,878
Can you not see me?

368
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,007
I don't know who you are.
Stop bothering me and go on your way.

369
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,970
Hey, come on.
You can't really be upset over this, Min.

370
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,012
Gosh, you startled me.

371
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:00,976
What are you doing here?

372
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,522
- What about the victim? Why are you here?
- He got discharged.

373
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,399
His injuries weren't life-threatening,

374
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,775
and he'd rather stay at home.

375
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,069
Even so, how could you
just let him go home like that?

376
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,614
What if he secretly calls and tells
Oh Yeong-cheol not to come home?

377
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,449
Are you that stupid?

378
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,579
Do you really think we told the father
that we went there to arrest his son?

379
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,330
I told him it was for Park Gi-man.

380
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,374
Besides, his father must be home

381
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,751
for Oh Yeong-cheol to come home
without feeling suspicious.

382
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,877
Come on.

383
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,130
Use your brain.

384
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,383
Yes, Prosecutor Seo.

385
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,176
I'm on my way out.

386
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,886
Where are you now?

387
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,471
Meet me on the first floor then.

388
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,099
- Prosecutor? Who?
- It's Prosecutor Seo Ji-uk.

389
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,645
- We'll get going now.
- Okay.

390
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,105
Why? Hold on a second.

391
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,942
- Say hi to him. You know him, too.
- Miss Lee is a very busy lawyer.

392
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,485
- She has a lot of work.
- Yes.

393
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,445
- We should go.
- Bye.

394
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,738
My gosh.

395
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,158
If that's the case, I'll drop her off.

396
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,327
Dropping her off
is more important than working.

397
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,168
That's okay. You should go back to work.
I know you're busy.

398
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,836
I'm not busy.

399
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,173
- I'm not busy.
- Dong-cheol.

400
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:17,052
Let me know if you get any new leads
on Oh Yeong-cheol. Okay?

401
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,595
I'll wait for your call. Let me know!

402
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,597
- Or I'll call you!
- You didn't drive here.

403
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,184
Did the victim get discharged?

404
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,268
Yes, sir.

405
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,772
He's an old man.
I'm glad his injuries were minor.

406
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,652
I looked into Oh Yeong-cheol,
but something didn't match.

407
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,696
When I read his file,
it said he was an orphan.

408
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,825
Remember Oh Yeong-cheol's third wife?

409
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,620
On Miss Jang Sun-young's
missing person's report,

410
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,455
it said he didn't have a father.

411
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,415
If he had three failed marriages,

412
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,876
I doubt he'd be on good terms
with his father,

413
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,337
so he could have said
he didn't have a father back then.

414
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,714
I guess that's possible too.

415
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,677
Are you going back to your office?
I can drop you off.

416
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,262
No, I have to stop somewhere.

417
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,932
- Good night.
- Why don't I drop you off there then?

418
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,561
JEONGSE ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BBQ BUFFET

419
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,693
This looks so good.

420
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,074
You're so clumsy.

421
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,536
Here.

422
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,290
You said you're going to treat me
to a nice meal.

423
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,084
But you're feeding me imported beef?

424
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,128
I only eat Korean premium beef, you know.

425
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,464
Just enjoy it while you have it.
I'm being generous here.

426
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,467
Thanks to you, I'm experiencing
so many new things.

427
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,845
My first love and my first broken heart...

428
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,930
Becoming a murder suspect.

429
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,682
What else? My first store-bought meal box.

430
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,517
Hey, I bet this is a first, too.

431
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,436
Go. You have to get
your own side dishes here.

432
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,187
Hurry.

433
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,204
Hey, how am I supposed to get the food?

434
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,622
One side dish for one plate?

435
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,752
You can't get anything done without me.

436
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:15,962
Follow me.

437
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,839
Seriously.

438
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,384
Hey, get some radish. That was tasty.

439
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,553
The radish? I just put it on the plate?

440
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,346
Yes, you just put it on the plate.
How else?

441
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,890
Ma'am, I'd like more side dishes.

442
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,392
Okay. Hey, get that too.
We're almost done with that.

443
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:32,979
Get a lot of that.

444
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,565
Ma'am, I'd like more side dishes
for my table.

445
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,317
I'm a customer here.

446
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,944
I'm sorry.

447
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,071
What did he say?

448
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,323
He thought I worked here?

449
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,617
How could he think I...

450
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,994
Are you laughing? Is this funny?

451
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,455
You were reborn looking older than I am.

452
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,375
It's because of this. This apron.

453
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,504
You told me to put this on
to make fun of me, didn't you?

454
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,714
- No.
- You wear it. I'm not wearing it.

455
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,966
- No, I didn't.
- You're so annoying.

456
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,135
Ma'am, a bottle of Sprite, please.

457
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,387
I'm a customer here. A customer!

458
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,342
<i>Please select your destination.</i>

459
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,885
<i>Jecheon.</i>

00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,098
<i>Please check your ticket.</i>

461
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,520
<i>Thank you for using our service.</i>

462
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,499
Next.

463
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,335
The next ticket to Chuncheon.

464
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,880
Here.

465
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,140
FAMILY REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE
NAME: OH YEONG CHEOL

466
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,309
FATHER: OH SEONG-CHEOL

467
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,644
<i>The expressway is 300 meters ahead.</i>

468
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,192
Why is it so dark here? Darn it.

469
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,029
I love my new body.

470
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,697
This stomach is twice my old stomach.

471
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,240
The old me could eat only this much,

472
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,784
so I wondered why people go
to those all-you-can-eat buffets.

473
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,453
But this new body

474
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,539
is perfect for those places.

475
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,958
I love it. I totally love it.

476
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,251
You sure love weird stuff.

477
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,881
I won't ever go on a diet now.
Forget about losing weight.

478
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,217
I'm going to eat everything I want
and live a happy life!

479
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,179
I'm not the old Go Se-yeon anymore.

480
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,555
You got that right.

481
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,641
You're heavy now, so try to walk...

482
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,478
I'm dizzy. Totally dizzy.

483
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,271
I told you not to drink a lot.

484
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,774
Wait.

485
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,443
- Seriously.
- I'm dizzy.

486
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,195
Wait here. I'll bring you water.

487
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,698
What's happening to me?

488
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,078
Why did I do my cute and sexy move on him
and touch him like that?

489
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,163
I can't believe this. Get a grip.

490
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,499
No matter how hot he became,
he's still Min.

491
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,335
My head is spinning a lot.

492
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,753
Hey, get up and drink this.

493
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,046
But I feel dizzy.

494
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,050
I feel dizzy. I feel so dizzy.

495
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,969
- Drink this.
- Is it water?

496
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,389
I'm so dizzy. My gosh.

497
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,557
- Get some sleep for now.
- I said I'm very dizzy.

498
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,601
I'll get you some hangover soup
on my way back.

499
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,187
What? You know what time it is?
Where are you going?

500
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,065
Are you going to her house again?

501
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,858
Don't wait up. Go to sleep.

502
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,820
Hey. Hey, Min.

503
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,453
Damn it.

504
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,707
He knows that I was alone
when I was murdered.

505
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,750
Yet, he leaves me all alone every night.

506
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,003
Why did he save me then?

507
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:27,964
What a douche bag.

508
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,300
That jerk is so inconsiderate.

509
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:33,970
Damn it.

510
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,471
It's not scary.

511
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,432
You're fine.

512
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,268
You're okay, Se-yeon. You're fine.
You're not scared.

513
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,588
What's this?

514
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,757
These are so beautiful.

515
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,134
Thank you.

516
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,954
Are you up, Min?

517
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,457
Hee-jin.

518
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,001
Well...

519
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,504
Last night, did we...

520
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,507
It was great last night.

521
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,935
Can we move in together
before the wedding?

522
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,103
I don't want us to be apart.

523
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,690
It's just around the corner.

524
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,984
- I'll go in now.
- Okay.

525
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,409
- Go. Bye.
- Okay, go on in.

526
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,423
Did you

527
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,136
really just use me?

528
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,189
If she comes back, that'd be a problem.

529
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,942
Right now, you're a murder suspect
for killing a beautiful prosecutor.

530
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,111
The whole nation is vilifying you.

531
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,321
Even if she changes her mind
and comes back,

532
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,282
do you think she can call you that easily?

533
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,045
I WILL PUNISH WITH MY OWN HANDS

534
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,716
Where on earth did Park Gi-man go?

535
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:26,225
THREE O'CLOCK, CHUNCHEON SKY MEMORIAL PARK
ON MY WAY TO MEET MI-JIN

536
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,207
<i>An old man in his 70s</i>
<i>who was admitted to the ER?</i>

537
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,333
<i>Hold on, please.</i>

538
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,087
It says he was dead
before he arrived at our hospital.

539
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,384
What was that?

540
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,929
There were two patients.
Which one was he talking about?

541
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,017
Everything is over now.

542
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,983
Gosh, I'm thirsty.

543
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,028
What?

544
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,072
Where is he?

545
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,783
Hey, Min.

546
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,410
Min.

547
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,207
Really?

548
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,959
He hasn't come home yet?

549
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:34,919
Damn it.

550
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,643
CHUNCHEON SKY MEMORIAL PARK

551
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,862
That's right. I've practiced kendo
for over ten years now. I'm a master.

552
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,698
I don't care who comes at me. I'll--

553
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,621
Gosh, that startled me.

554
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,459
Cha Min, get a grip. Head, head.

555
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,546
Park Mi-jin.

556
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,507
Park Mi-jin.

557
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,092
But why is this place so huge?

558
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,344
It's like I'm looking
for a needle in a haystack.

559
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,356
PARK MI-JIN

560
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,357
On your behalf,

561
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,192
I punished that bad man

562
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,237
who is responsible for putting you here

563
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,034
with my own hands.

564
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,205
Now I deserve to see

565
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,751
my beautiful daughter, right?

566
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,796
Hang in there.

567
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,549
I will protect you

568
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,593
when I go there.

569
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,181
Wait for me.

570
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,648
Park Gi-man. This is cheating.

571
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,026
Are you the police?

572
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,528
It's too late.

573
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:34,038
I just did what you guys couldn't do.

574
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,250
Mi-jin.

575
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,169
Mi-jin.

576
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,713
Wait for me.

577
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,715
I will...

578
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,933
Everything is over now.

579
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,106
No. I'm not going to let you die
in front of me.

580
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,776
Even if you die, I'll save you again.

581
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,366
<i>If he was a second late,</i>

582
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,700
he wouldn't have been alive now.

583
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,953
We finished pumping his stomach.

584
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,956
But we must keep him on the treatment plan
for hemodiafiltration.

585
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,041
He must stay in the hospital
for a few more days.

586
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,419
Have him admitted

587
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,712
and prepare for CRRT
and methylene blue treatment.

588
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,549
- Yes, sir.
- Excuse me.

589
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,343
When do you think he'll wake up?

590
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,387
He'll wake up soon.

591
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,739
Don't even think
of doing something stupid.

592
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,537
Why did you save...

593
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,665
It will be hard for you to talk for now.

594
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,792
But I don't need you to talk for long.

595
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,836
I only have one question for you.

596
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,676
Prosecutor Go Se-yeon.

597
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,846
Did you kill her?

598
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,686
How is that your business?

599
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,104
It's more than my business.

600
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,523
I need to catch that bastard
who killed Se-yeon

601
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,861
to return to my old self
and bring back my fiancée.

602
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,794
Let me see.

603
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,551
I told you that you'd get hurt
if you keep moving.

604
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,844
That must hurt.

605
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,180
You crazy jerk.
Get that away from me. Get it away!

606
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,810
I'm sure you know that I hate it

607
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,437
when it gets loud.

608
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,663
This is going to sting a little.

609
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,415
Let me see.

610
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,923
<i>He bragged about how his son</i>
<i>became a doctor.</i>

611
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,426
<i>But I heard</i>
<i>that Yeong-cheol killed a woman.</i>

612
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,053
He killed none other than his wife!

613
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:22,516
But I heard that the police concluded
that it wasn't him.

614
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,561
Don't you remember how furious
Mr. Oh was because of that?

615
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,354
Do you believe that?

616
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,023
Gosh.

617
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,192
That kid, Yeong-cheol,
always gave off an eerie vibe

618
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,319
ever since he was young.

619
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,528
I never liked him.

620
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,280
So where is Mr. Oh Seong-cheol now?

621
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,074
He passed away a long time ago.

622
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,535
Has it been five years now?

623
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,497
Yeong-cheol didn't even show up
when his father died.

624
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,292
Things are different nowadays, you know.

625
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,339
Hey.

626
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,137
Yes?

627
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,514
Sir.

628
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,352
My gosh, that's what
you've been doing all night long?

629
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,895
- Yes.
- That can't be your meal.

630
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,064
You've been cooped up in your car.

631
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,360
Here you go.
I brewed some warm tea for you.

632
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,278
Why don't you have some?

633
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,447
My gosh, you didn't have to.

634
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,077
By the way,
that man who ran away after stabbing me

635
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,037
would never come back here.

636
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,790
You're not

637
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:33,420
waiting here for my son, are you?

638
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,551
I'm not sure if you know,

639
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,762
but my son

640
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,848
was wrongfully accused
of a crime and got arrested in the past.

641
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,850
He had a tough time with that.

642
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,062
Of course, the judge ruled
that my son was innocent,

643
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,816
but I'm afraid if that's going to--

644
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,109
That's not it.

645
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,486
If Park Gi-man shows up here,

646
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,114
you'll be in danger,
so we're here for your safety.

647
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,575
There's this system called
Witness Protection Program.

648
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,370
- So you don't need to worry.
- Okay.

649
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,996
Are you going somewhere?

650
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,417
Yes, I have to get
my wound dressed at the hospital.

651
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,919
On my way back, I'm planning

652
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,338
to go for a quick hike
while listening to some music.

653
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,427
There are so many cool things like this
in Seoul, you know.

654
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,513
I can store more than 100 songs
in this device.

655
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,769
Don't skip your meals and have a good day.

656
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,688
- Okay. Thank you for the tea.
- Okay.

657
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,314
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

658
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,034
- Please take my seat.
- My gosh.

659
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,786
Thank you.

660
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,393
<i>Mr. Park, it's time for your hemodialysis.</i>

661
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,645
Okay. Let's go.

662
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,775
Let's go and ask the gods what they think.

663
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,527
Whose sin would they consider to be worse?

664
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,795
<i>Hello.</i>

665
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,798
<i>Car number 7767, please move your car.</i>

666
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,595
<i>Is anyone home?</i>

667
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,424
All right.

668
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:31,223
Shall I<i> </i>start the real hunting now?

669
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,811
You can't get anything done by yourself.
Why did you act up?

670
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,438
Look who's talking.
You're not that good, either.

671
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,023
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

672
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,318
I'm Go Se-yeon, the best prosecutor
at the Public Prosecutor's Office.

673
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,573
If I tell you what I've done,
you wouldn't dare nag me right now.

674
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,160
<i>Here's your iced Americano</i>
<i>and hot chocolate.</i>

675
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,078
<i>Thank you.</i>

676
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,413
Wait, are you out right now?

677
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,583
Yes. Here you go, my dear.

678
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,002
Are you with Detective Park right now?

679
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,003
<i>Yes.</i>

680
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,130
If you keep seeing him, he'll find out.

681
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,173
<i>Why do you keep seeing him? What do you--</i>

682
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,509
I have way more stuff to talk about
with him than with you.

683
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,888
Anyway, stop wasting your time.
You'd better come here this instant.

684
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,933
Dong-cheol, drink this.

685
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,102
Okay. You go ahead first. Go on.

686
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,274
By the way,

687
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,235
the plate you wanted me to run
was Park Gi-man's taxi, right?

688
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,614
- Yes.
- What are you up to these days?

689
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,284
Why are you chasing after
Park Gi-man and Oh Yeong-cheol?

690
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:37,664
- I'm taking on a pro bono case.
- A pro bono case?

691
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,793
Yes. There is this civic organization
for bereaved families...

692
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,587
of murder victims.

693
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,506
They're filing a suit against
the government for compensation.

694
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,508
And I'm in charge of the case.

695
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,386
There were bereaved families
of the Eomsan-dong murder case,

696
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,138
so I was...

697
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,684
Come on, think about it.
They hired me at a premium

698
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,520
because I used to be a prosecutor and all.

699
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,148
Don't you think I should show them

700
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,150
that I'm different from other lawyers?

701
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:09,071
I need your help to do that, my dear.

702
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,159
You little brat.
You always called me "dear"

703
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,287
- whenever you needed something.
- Gosh.

704
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,164
- Why do you keep hitting me?
- Hold on.

705
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,916
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

706
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,709
Where did you hurt your hand like that?

707
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,045
- Where was it?
- When did I hurt my hand?

708
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,005
Gosh, you're so clumsy.

709
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,799
Don't move. Put your hand down.

710
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,801
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not. Let me see.

711
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,137
I didn't know you had it in your pocket.

712
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,223
Cops always carry them around.

713
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,561
Goodness. What could you possibly
get done with that tiny hand?

714
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,939
You listen to me. Okay?

715
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,109
I know how much you care
about your career.

716
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,070
But this case is too dangerous
for you to work on alone.

717
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,572
- What?
- If you must insist,

718
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,660
then why don't you work on it by my side?

719
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,956
That Park Gi-man
you're desperately looking for...

720
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,208
is in Jecheon now.

721
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,253
Really? Are you sure?

722
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,089
We checked that he bought a ticket
at the terminal early this morning.

723
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,258
The rest of the team has already left.

724
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,886
If you'd like to go, you can come with me.

725
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,431
Yes, let me come along.

726
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,145
<i>I found Park Gi-man. Come straight</i>
<i>to Chuncheon General Hospital.</i>

727
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,397
I'm going to kill him.

728
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:32,946
<i>Bullshit!</i>

729
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,490
<i>Stop wasting your time and go on home.</i>

730
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:36,992
What? Bullshit?

731
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,660
Man, this brat!

732
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,372
- Sorry?
- Oh, it's nothing.

733
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,041
Don't mind me.

734
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:52,049
Excuse me,
but did you just take my picture?

735
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,552
No, I was just taking the patient's...

736
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,554
Well, I have a bit of a situation...

737
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,688
Let's call it even since I took yours,
too.

738
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,858
Sure.

739
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,861
I mean, I'd be even happier

740
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,654
if you took one with me.

741
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,368
Hey, hey! Let me open it for you.

742
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,578
Okay.

743
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,580
- Thanks.
- No problem.

744
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,337
<i>Do you still think it's bullshit?</i>

745
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,839
CHA MIN

746
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,217
Put your seatbelt on. We're leaving.

747
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,510
Wait a minute.

748
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,137
Park Gi-man isn't in Jecheon.

749
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,766
Chuncheon. He's in Chuncheon.

750
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,437
Are you a model?

751
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,730
Or maybe an actor?

752
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,441
No, I'm not.

753
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,196
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

754
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,617
- Hello?
- Are you sure Park Gi-man is there?

755
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,619
Didn't you see the picture for yourself?

756
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,665
He says he'll explain for himself,
so hurry up and come to get the details.

757
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,500
I'll make sure he doesn't get away.

758
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,044
I'll call you back.

759
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,799
He needs to have another endoscopy today.

760
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,593
How long will it take?

761
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,720
At least two hours.

762
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,516
Excuse me.

763
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:29,020
Could I perhaps get your number?

764
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,692
Since I took your picture earlier,

765
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,820
I'll send it to you.

766
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,948
Okay.

767
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,124
- By the way, Mi-do.
- Yes?

768
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,959
If you're sure that Park Gi-man is there,

769
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,004
- I think I should call the team--
- No, we should go first.

770
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:59,593
There's something I need to figure out
aside from the police investigation.

771
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,928
Let's just go
and check if he's there first.

772
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,847
And then we can call for backup.

773
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,141
Please.

774
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,198
Hey, isn't that Prosecutor Seo's car?

775
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,921
Prosecutor Seo, what are you doing?

776
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:42,802
Isn't anyone home?

777
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,680
No, Mr. Oh went to the hospital
to get his wound dressed.

778
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,297
Excuse me.

779
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,550
Did Mr. Park Gi-man go somewhere?

780
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:26,513
Mr. Park is having his endoscopy.

781
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,598
He'll be back soon. Please wait.

782
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,724
All right.

783
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,525
There's your minion.

784
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,610
Min! Where's Park Gi-man?

785
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,405
He's having an endoscopy.
It'll be over soon.

786
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,489
What happened?

787
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,408
He tried to take poison
at his daughter's grave.

788
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,784
Luckily, I caught him in the act.

789
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,662
He survived, but he'll have to
be hospitalized for a while.

790
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,914
Was he really the one who did it?

791
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,834
Should I tell you here?

792
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,130
What is it?

793
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,174
I should know these things, too.

794
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,344
Why don't you ask him for yourself?

795
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,595
He said he'll confess

796
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,888
- and pay for it all.
- Let's go.

797
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,474
How did you know he was here, though?

798
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,063
Let me tell you the key
to a successful investigation.

799
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,064
It's the heart.

800
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,567
Put your heart into it
and you'll figure it out.

801
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,985
Hey, which room is it?

802
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,445
- What number?
- Let's go.

803
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,613
That jerk.

804
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,499
What happened?

805
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,252
I guess it's taking a bit longer.

806
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,172
Is he still having his endoscopy?

807
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,840
No, he just returned.

808
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,009
Someone came to see him,
so they went out for a walk.

809
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,523
Could you go back just a bit?

810
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,692
That's it.

811
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,780
It's Oh Yeong-cheol.

812
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,698
Oh Yeong-cheol helped him out.

813
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,991
How would you know that?

814
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,494
<i>Prosecutor Go Se-yeon.</i>

815
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,371
Did you kill her?

816
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,832
How is that your business?

817
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,376
It's more than my business.

818
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,753
I need to catch that bastard
who killed Se-yeon

819
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:26,049
to return to my old self
and bring back my fiancée.

820
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,837
<i>I found it along with all the trophies</i>

821
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,755
<i>that he took.</i>

822
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,426
<i>I only killed Oh Yeong-cheol.</i>

823
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,346
<i>Oh Yeong-cheol is the one</i>
<i>who murdered Prosecutor Go.</i>

824
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,855
This is what Park Gi-man got
after murdering Oh Yeong-cheol.

825
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,401
Park Gi-man killed him again
since he didn't die afterward.

826
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,197
"Park Gi-man killed him again
because he didn't die afterward"?

827
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,450
What nonsense is that?

828
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,034
That's all I got from Park Gi-man.

829
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,287
He wasn't in good condition.

830
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,164
I wanted to hear the details
when you got here.

831
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,959
I didn't think Oh Yeong-cheol
would find him this soon.

832
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,471
Is your son feeling okay?

833
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,977
Why are you moving him
to another hospital?

834
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,940
Hey, you.

835
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,735
Do you know

836
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,155
what killed the cat?

837
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,032
Sorry.

838
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,703
It's curiosity.

839
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,664
Those who are stupid

840
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:26,002
get curious about things
they shouldn't be curious about.

841
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,468
Hey!

842
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,386
How in the world
are you going to find him?

843
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,138
That's my car! You're not even insured.

844
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,474
Didn't you see the note
Oh Yeong-cheol sent to Park Gi-man?

845
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,600
It said it's his turn.

846
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,519
Murder is a sort of ritual
to Oh Yeong-cheol!

847
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:43,978
Isn't it obvious?

848
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,231
Think about his obsessiveness
and the way he sutures.

849
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,315
It's obvious where he is.

850
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,567
Then the place
where Oh Yeong-cheol was first found--

851
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,237
- Exactly! Hurry up and get in!
- I won't let you drive my car.

852
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,947
- Stop it!
- Come on!

853
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,740
This is all I have!

854
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,206
Hey! This is my car!

855
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,791
Are you trying to kill us all?

856
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,547
You may think you have more lives,

857
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,965
but there's no use if we both die.

858
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,133
Get ahold of yourself, Se-yeon!

859
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,678
Hey, watch out!

860
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,596
Slow down! I got a call!

861
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,809
Yes, Prosecutor Seo?
I'm on my way to Seoul from Chuncheon.

862
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:23,935
<i>Is there something wrong?</i>

863
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,938
<i>I can't talk to you</i>
<i>on the phone right now.</i>

864
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,690
Oh Yeong-cheol has committed
another murder.

865
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,816
What?

866
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,242
<i>And he's even left a clue this time,</i>
<i>which is unusual for him.</i>

867
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,618
<i>A clue that's concrete evidence.</i>

868
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,830
What? He's never even left behind
a single strand of hair.

869
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,498
He left a fingerprint this time?

870
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,472
Good. You've made a wise decision.

871
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,433
That's a good girl.

872
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:08,855
How nice would it have been
if you listened to me from the beginning?

873
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,417
Darn it.

874
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:14,629
Are you even sure this is the place?

875
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,881
How can you come here
based on Park Gi-man's words only?

876
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,716
What if he went elsewhere?

877
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,260
- That can't be.
- Yes, Prosecutor Seo.

878
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,014
What? Where?

879
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,108
Prosecutor Seo.

880
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,156
I called an ambulance.
He wouldn't have gotten too far.

881
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,200
I'm sure he's still
around this neighborhood.

882
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,996
Park Gi-man. Wake up.

883
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,708
You can't die like this!

884
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,292
What do we do?

885
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,546
- I'll keep to the right.
- I'll go this way.

886
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,976
- Make way, please!
- What's going on?

887
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,353
- Excuse us.
- Hurry up.

888
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,565
- Are you all right, sir?
- Why is he here?

889
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,024
Oh, no.

890
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,068
- Be careful.
- Let's lift him.

891
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,236
Oh...

892
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,614
Yeong-cheol...

893
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,574
What?

894
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:29,036
The father...

895
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,580
Park Gi-man! Hang in there!

896
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:31,789
Park Gi-man!

897
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,924
- Is he dead?
- Is he?

898
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,218
Are you his guardian?

899
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,636
- Are you coming with us?
- Yes, sir.

900
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,054
That's Hee-jin.

901
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,099
Come on, what are you doing?

902
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,977
- Hee-jin.
- What?

903
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,104
- Hee-jin!
- Hee-jin? Your fiancée?

904
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,440
Hey, Min! Hey!

905
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,888
Oh Yeong-cheol.

906
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,642
Give up already.

907
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,624
What are you doing here?

908
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,668
Well, you already knew

909
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,546
that I wasn't Oh Yeong-cheol's father,

910
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,173
didn't you?

911
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:11,430
You'll never be able
to catch Oh Yeong-cheol.

912
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:17,687
What makes you
jump to a conclusion like that?

913
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,106
Because I know you more than anyone else.

914
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,614
My blood...

915
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,536
runs through your veins.

916
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,378
I have information
regarding a murder case.

917
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,089
- Hee-jin...
<i>- I'd like to give information on Cha Min.</i>

918
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,176
A few days after Se-yeon died,
Min came to see me.

919
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,428
Wait, he wouldn't have had the time.

920
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:34,555
<i>He dropped this that day.</i>

921
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,350
<i>That jerk Cha Min's fingerprint</i>
<i>was found in Go Se-yeon's casket.</i>

922
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,226
He must be a real nutjob.

923
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,811
What's wrong with you?

924
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,813
Are you really the Cha Min I know?

925
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,565
I have to go meet Hee-jin first.

926
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,567
Hee-jin. Wake up.

927
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,778
- Hee-jin!
- What's wrong with her?

928
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,113
It was a murder.
A murder disguised as an accident.

929
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,283
