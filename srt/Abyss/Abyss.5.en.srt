1
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,633
<i>What are you doing with Abyss?</i>

2
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,678
<i>I'll just bring him back to life.</i>

3
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,014
Don't human souls

4
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,975
usually look the same on the outside?

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,227
<i>You're the owner of that Abyss now,</i>

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,604
<i>so make good use of it.</i>

7
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>Just this once, please.</i>

8
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,653
<i>I know it seems crazy.</i>

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,905
<i>I'm the one who</i>

10
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,157
brought you back to life.

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,534
AN ABYSS REVIVES THE DEAD
INTO THE FORM OF ITS SOUL

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,995
I'll find whoever murdered you.

13
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,706
<i>I know this person.</i>

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>Who? Oh Yeong-cheol?</i>

15
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,503
He's a famous surgeon.

16
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,712
No.

17
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,547
<i>This might be able to save this guy too.</i>

18
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,466
I revived a serial killer...

19
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,343
AN ABYSS CAN REVIVE ANYTHING THAT HAS DIED

20
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,803
...with this marble?

21
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,846
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

22
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,641
I didn't think Abyss would work.

23
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:44,020
Well, I didn't think
I'd get to kill you either.

24
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,898
What am I supposed to believe?

25
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,401
<i>Please save her this once.</i>

26
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,862
Please save her.
Please wake up, Hee-jin. Please!

27
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,366
<i>It was a murder disguised as an accident.</i>

28
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,161
Do you think I don't know that?

29
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,790
<i>How are we going to get him to talk?
He's in a vegetative state now.</i>

30
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,167
Abyss.

31
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,046
We can kill and revive him again with it.

32
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,306
<i>We can kill...</i>

33
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,393
<i>and revive him again with it.</i>

34
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,055
You're a doctor.

35
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,894
The visiting hours are over.
How did you get in here?

36
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,022
I'm sorry. I had to see him.

37
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,940
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,319
I must check on the patient,
so please step outside.

39
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,529
Okay, then.

40
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,510
Who's there?

41
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,971
Who are you? You can't be in here.

42
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,641
The visiting hours are over.
Please get out.

43
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,602
Okay. I was just leaving.
I'm really sorry.

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,106
What was that about?

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,443
Dr. Choe?

46
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,283
When was the last time
you checked the patient's vitals?

47
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,994
I was just about to get on it.

48
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,330
- But who--
- His guardian walked in here

49
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,666
because you were dozing off.

50
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,961
Check his vitals and report them
to the on-call doctor.

51
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,004
Okay.

52
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,563
Excuse me, Doctor.

53
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,192
It's about Mr. Park Gi-man.

54
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,945
I'd like to ask you about his condition.

55
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,822
When will he wake up?

56
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,491
You should give up.

57
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,410
Pardon?

58
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,539
He'll die soon.

59
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,874
How could you say something like that?

60
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,836
- Doctor.
- Let go of me!

61
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,842
How dare you touch me?

62
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,138
How dare a pest like you
interfere with my work?

63
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,224
What did you just say?

64
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,828
It's mine. Give it back.

65
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,375
What are you, a kid?

66
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,340
Excuse me!

67
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,217
- Here. Now, tell me.
- I guess he can't see it.

68
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,845
What's there?
Why are you doing that with your fingers?

69
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:51,059
ONLY THE ONES WHO WERE REVIVED
BY ABYSS CAN SEE IT

70
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,688
Wait.

71
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,192
Can you see this?

72
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,698
You're him, aren't you?

73
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,825
You're Oh Yeong-cheol.

74
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,708
EPISODE 5

75
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,628
Answer me. Can you see this marble?

76
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,633
Oh Yeong-cheol.

77
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,407
You got the wrong man.

78
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,829
Stop right there. Oh Yeong-cheol!

79
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,041
I'm only letting you check on him

80
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,043
since you're his lawyer.

81
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,213
Of course.
I only need to see if he's dead or alive.

82
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,174
The alarm would have gone crazy
if he had died.

83
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,055
This means his heart is beating, right?

84
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,311
I knew it.

85
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,064
He's way too soft to do that.

86
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,191
Are you good now?

87
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,318
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,571
Thank you so much.

89
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,327
<i>- The number you have dialed--</i>
- Damn it.

90
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,912
Why won't he pick up?

91
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,671
WASTE TREATMENT FACILITY
LINEN STORAGE

92
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,926
Oh Yeong-cheol.
You can't run away from me.

93
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,311
What you just said amuses me.

94
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,279
"Run away"?

95
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,323
I wasn't running away from you.

96
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,201
I brought you here.

97
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,042
I brought you
to the perfect place to kill you.

98
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,005
There aren't any surveillance cameras
or any witnesses here.

99
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,345
There's no point in fighting it.

100
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,681
Your body will slowly become paralyzed.

101
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,935
And your heart will stop beating soon.

102
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,900
All right.

103
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,027
Tell me.

104
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,155
Did Park Gi-man tell you

105
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,907
that I was Oh Yeong-cheol?

106
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,910
How did you recognize me?

107
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,540
Right.

108
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,500
Oh, well.

109
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,712
It doesn't matter how you found out.

110
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,507
The important thing is that

111
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,969
you won't be able to speak a word

112
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,680
of what you found out.

113
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,943
Oh Yeong-cheol, you bastard.

114
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,238
You're the one who killed Se-yeon, right?

115
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,282
Who?

116
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,660
Right.

117
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,539
The nosy lady prosecutor
who didn't mind her own business?

118
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,045
That's right.

119
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,256
I killed her.

120
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,093
That wench came all the way to my hospital

121
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,721
and asked me about my suture techniques.

122
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,225
I got rid of her
before she could cause any trouble.

123
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,728
But she kept fighting

124
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,938
until the very last moment
before she died.

125
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,358
One more thing.

126
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,445
Didn't I already tell you this earlier?

127
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,655
I told you

128
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,366
not to touch me.

129
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,792
You piece of trash.

130
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,338
How dare you touch me?

131
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,715
How dare you?

132
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,550
How dare you!

133
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,096
How dare you touch me? How dare you?

134
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,473
How dare you!

135
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,516
How dare you!

136
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,939
Why won't he pick up?

137
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,929
Min! What happened?

138
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:02,930
Are you all right?

139
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,599
I'm fine.

140
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,644
You're not fine at all, you moron!

141
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,315
Hang in there. I'll call the doctor.

142
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,695
What?

143
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,155
This...

144
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,326
- Abyss.
- What?

145
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,871
Why...

146
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,840
Hey.

147
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,010
Min.

148
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,023
It can't be.

149
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,442
Hey.

150
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,820
Hey.

151
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,364
You're not dead, right?

152
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,202
Hey, wake up, Min!

153
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,912
Hey.

154
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,663
Hey!

155
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,921
Right.

156
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,422
This marble.

157
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,176
I can revive him with this.

158
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,304
How does this work?

159
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,140
How am I supposed to...

160
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,600
Save him...

161
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:38,734
IF THE OWNER OF THE ABYSS DIES
THE NEXT REVIVED IS ITS TEMPORARY OWNER

162
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,576
What...

163
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,579
What...

164
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,374
What should I do?

165
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,667
What's going on?

166
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,046
No!

167
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,744
Min, wake up!

168
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,165
Hello? Is anybody there?

169
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,126
We need help here!

170
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,711
Anybody?

171
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,922
Help!

172
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,800
Please help me.

173
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,844
Help...

174
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,179
- I need help--
- Hey, what's going on?

175
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,473
- What happened?
- What should I do?

176
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,017
Are you all right?

177
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,450
Damn it.

178
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,043
<i>Hello?</i>

179
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,119
Let's go.

180
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,581
Nothing good
will come out of staring at him.

181
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,335
Let's go somewhere else

182
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,671
so that you can calm down.

183
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,715
Gosh, seriously.

184
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,602
<i>You made a mistake,
which is very unusual of you.</i>

185
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,441
So everything is different,

186
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,029
except for my fingerprints.

187
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,457
THE DEVICE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED

188
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,834
THE TARGET DEVICE IS CURRENTLY OFF-LINE

189
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,965
That wench is dead.

190
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,093
Of course there's no way
her phone is turned on.

191
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,355
Crap.

192
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,192
This is totally busted.

193
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,628
But that accident...

194
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,673
It really makes no sense.

195
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,675
How did I walk away without a scratch?

196
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,555
It feels as if it was just a dream.

197
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,982
<i>The door has been unlocked.</i>

198
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,862
Mother.

199
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,782
What brings you here?

200
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,744
How dare you!

201
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,498
Did you think I wouldn't find you
if you changed your number and hid?

202
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,752
This is why I told him not
to associate himself with girls like you.

203
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,672
I can't believe my dear Min
wasted his time with a girl like you...

204
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,425
Go back inside.

205
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,803
Go on! We'll talk inside.

206
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,146
So, is this it?

207
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,983
Is this the place you got
after selling the house that Min bought?

208
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,609
No, Mother. I had a bit of a situation--

209
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,361
Please! Stop calling me like that.

210
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,031
Don't you dare call me "Mother" again.

211
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,827
I'd love to just grab your hair right now,

212
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,121
but I'm refraining from doing so.

213
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,207
I'm sure you're well aware of the reason.

214
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,170
How many weeks has it been?

215
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,008
Eight weeks.

216
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,554
- I'm two months pregnant.
- You little...

217
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,269
Pack up your stuff.

218
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,316
Why are you just standing there?
Go pack up your stuff!

219
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,238
- Jeez! Just a second!
- What's with you?

220
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,618
- Hey!
- Hey, wait. Get off me!

221
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,577
Hold on.

222
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,455
All right. I'm sorry.

223
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,416
I called your law firm. They said
they don't have any information on him.

224
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,710
Who is he?
He's done something wrong, right?

225
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,003
No, I said that's not the case.

226
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,087
What is it, then?

227
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,632
Why aren't you calling his family?

228
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,467
And why won't you let me identify him?

229
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,593
What is the reason?

230
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,094
MORGUE

231
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,095
Please.

232
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,140
Let go of me, and we'll talk.

233
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,100
- Let go.
- You're not in your right mind now.

234
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,853
I completely understand how you feel.

235
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,897
So just go home and get some rest.

236
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,607
After getting enough rest--

237
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,317
- Dong-cheol.
- Hey, great timing.

238
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,693
Hello.

239
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,737
I need you to take her home.

240
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,906
- We should get back to the station now.
- Why?

241
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,741
That guy, Cha Min, is dead.

242
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,118
What? How?

243
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,246
- We should hurry.
- How did he die?

244
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,288
- Come on.
- What happened?

245
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,249
- We have to go.
- But I need to...

246
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,625
- Hurry!
- But this...

247
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,293
Come on!

248
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,850
Doctor, didn't you say that this man
was definitely a vagrant?

249
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,062
The body was skeletonized
to the point that it was unidentifiable,

250
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,232
and no belongings were found.
That's why I assumed so.

251
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,527
But the police managed to find this later.

252
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,114
A man in his 30s who's about 170cm tall.
It's obvious, you know.

253
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,075
That's the only reason you've concluded
that it's Cha Min's body?

254
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,285
Of course not.

255
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,704
Prosecutor Seo asked me
to compare the DNA to Cha Min's,

256
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,791
so I used his hair, which we had obtained
from his belongings seized from his place.

257
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,459
Sure enough, it was a match.

258
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,921
The forensic odontologist
also confirmed it.

259
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,633
I bet he took his own life
when he was named as a suspect

260
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,468
and the police started closing in on him--

261
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,138
But Go Se-yeon died less than a month ago.

262
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,056
Even if he took his life right afterward,

263
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,808
his body couldn't have
skeletonized already.

264
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,978
Two years ago,
we found a body in a bathhouse

265
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,813
that was skeletonized in just five days.

266
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,525
The decomposition rate can vary depending
on the amount of protein and fat.

267
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,777
What about Ji-uk? What did he say?

268
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,157
Let's close the case
and end the investigation.

269
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,492
The main suspect is dead.

270
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,286
Why bother digging more?

271
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,831
We're investigating others who were
holding grudges against Prosecutor Go.

272
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,875
Then the investigation would never end.

273
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,170
Like you've said yourself,

274
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,506
the victim was a prosecutor.

275
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,301
I bet a lot of people held grudges
against her.

276
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,470
If it was going be like this,

277
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:30,390
the police shouldn't have gone public
with the investigation in the first place

278
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,142
after naming Cha Min as the prime suspect.

279
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,894
Yes, sir.

280
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,065
Then how much should we tell the media?

281
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,570
Have the detective in charge
schedule a briefing.

282
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,572
Immediately.

283
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,392
It's mine. Give it back.

284
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,812
Why is this here?

285
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,797
I guess she's still alive.

286
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:35,182
My lack of vigor is the problem.

287
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,173
Darn it.

288
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,469
That is not Cha Min.

289
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,597
The medical examiner confirmed
that it's him. Who are you to refute him?

290
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,934
Seriously, you're unbelievable.

291
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,228
Hey, what's up?

292
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,814
What? We're closing the case?

293
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,236
The prime suspect was found dead,

294
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,071
so I guess it's right to stop digging.

295
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,282
You never know though.
Why is he rushing us to close the case?

296
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,243
- Hey, wait.
- Hold on. Gosh, be quiet.

297
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,410
What? A briefing?

298
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,996
Don't you know that
I don't like being in front of a camera?

299
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,873
- Wait.
- No way. I'm not doing that.

300
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,916
- Hold on.
- Be quiet.

301
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,752
No, not you.
All right, okay. Hang on a second.

302
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,755
I'm heading back to the station now,
so let's talk in person.

303
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,924
- Jeez, what?
- What was that about?

304
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,634
They'll close the case? My case...

305
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,886
I mean, they'll close
Prosecutor Go's case like this?

306
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,056
Well, they think it's unnecessary
to dig deeper now that Cha Min is dead.

307
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,183
Prosecutor Seo wants to close the case.

308
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,353
He said we should focus on searching
the vicinity to find Prosecutor Go's body.

309
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,313
Who is he to close the case?

310
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,232
I said that is not Cha Min!

311
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,442
On what grounds?

312
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,986
Damn it!

313
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,948
Follow me
with your fingerprint scanner now.

314
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,993
Do you think it's some kind of a toy?

315
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,953
Why must I bring it
just because you tell me to?

316
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,289
Gosh.

317
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,333
You went all crazy trying
to stop me earlier. What's with this now?

318
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,712
Don't be surprised
after scanning his fingerprints.

319
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,630
Go ahead and scan him. See who he is.

320
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,716
I bet he's an overseas Korean.

321
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,929
Is he really an overseas Korean?

322
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,726
ID CARD
CHA MIN

323
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,938
What?

324
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,897
SCAN COMPLETED

325
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,566
So, he's not an overseas Korean.

326
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,406
What's happening here? I did it right.

327
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,325
What's wrong with this?

328
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,492
Is it broken?

329
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,702
What?

330
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,504
ID CARD
CHA MIN

331
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,505
Why do you have this?

332
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,175
They obviously found no belongings
of Cha Min along with that body

333
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,094
because this is the real Cha Min.

334
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,806
What? Then who's that man at the NFS?

335
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,851
Someone must've deliberately
disguised him as Cha Min.

336
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,689
But this guy looks nothing like him.

337
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:31,524
Fine.

338
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,278
Let's say plastic surgery in Korea
has become very advanced.

339
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,238
But it's just been a month...

340
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,367
Look at his height. How is this possible?

341
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,285
Exactly. It's only been a month,

342
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,953
but they're trying to close the case

343
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,623
by claiming that
the unidentifiable skeleton is Cha Min.

344
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,791
Does that make sense to you?

345
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,129
It means someone wants to cover
up the truth behind this case at all costs

346
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,131
for whatever reason.

347
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,259
And I know who that person is.

348
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,138
He's a man of power
who's received a presidential citation.

349
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,224
Making the skeleton look like Min
must've been easy.

350
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,226
Who are you talking about?

351
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,728
Hey, Mi-do.

352
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,814
I've been sensing
something is off about you.

353
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,440
You're hiding something from me, right?

354
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,691
Why are you looking into--

355
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,153
Even if I explain everything to you,
you won't believe me.

356
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,323
So please be patient, okay?
Give me a little bit of time.

357
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,866
I can sort it all out.

358
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,368
Right now,

359
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,787
you're the only person I can trust.

360
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,707
I know I'm being shameless,
but help me out here. Please?

361
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,295
Hold on.

362
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,297
Okay, all right.

363
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,967
Let's say you're right.

364
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,595
Let's say this guy is Cha Min,
and the guy at the NFS is fake.

365
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,180
The thing is, they're both dead.

366
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,224
There's no one to indict, so that's it.

367
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,101
It'll all end if we report
that this guy is--

368
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,688
But what if the sole suspect, Cha Min,
isn't dead yet?

369
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,524
Then they won't be able to close the case.

370
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,109
Well, he's dead--

371
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,571
I know it makes no sense,
but just give me three days, okay?

372
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,239
No, 24 hours. Just give me 1 day.

373
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,284
Please postpone closing the case
and the media report for one day.

374
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,119
I'll sort it out at all costs.

375
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:10,039
Dong-cheol, please. Just this one time.
Trust me just this once.

376
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,020
The suspect took his own life,

377
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,522
and even the prosecutor
doesn't want to indict him.

378
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,566
Why should we postpone the announcement?

379
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,736
If this is about you
not wanting to give the briefing,

380
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,571
just forget it. I'll do it myself.

381
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,698
It's not about that, sir.

382
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,408
- Then what's the problem?
- The thing is--

383
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,577
- You see--
- Hey, Dong-cheol.

384
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,080
I have the lab results regarding
the Myeongjin Hospital case.

385
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,250
But we found some things
that shouldn't have been there.

386
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,210
What? Like what?

387
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,670
Cha Min's fingerprints
and Oh Yeong-cheol's blood

388
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,671
were found there.

389
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,759
I have no idea what's happening.

390
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,305
<i>Hello?</i>

391
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,389
Hey, Mi-do.

392
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,683
Cha Min's fingerprint
and Oh Yeong-cheol's blood

393
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,686
were found at the crime scene
in Myeongjin Hospital.

394
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,688
What? Oh Yeong-cheol's blood?

395
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,856
<i>The thing is,</i>

396
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,652
<i>if that guy in the morgue
really is Cha Min like you're insisting,</i>

397
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:24,405
it's highly likely
that Oh Yeong-cheol did that to him.

398
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,409
But why on earth would Oh Yeong-cheol
do such a thing to him?

399
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,495
<i>Anyhow,</i>

400
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,914
I told my guys to look through
all the security footage

401
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,375
from the facility to the exit
and the vicinity, so just wait.

402
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,002
The security footage
won't help us find Oh Yeong-cheol.

403
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,588
Right, the security cameras.

404
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,382
That's it. We can find him

405
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,425
- because I can see that marble.
- <i>What?</i>

406
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,553
It's nothing. I can find Oh Yeong-cheol.

407
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,887
Wait for me. I'll be there...

408
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:50,932
What?

409
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,518
Who's here?

410
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,520
Auntie.

411
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,981
Pardon?

412
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,318
Who might you be? How did you get in?

413
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,156
I didn't know that she had a roommate.

414
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,908
I'm so sorry I barged in like this.

415
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,786
- It's okay.
- Hee-jin, the lady who used to live here,

416
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,454
will stay elsewhere starting today,

417
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,456
so I came to get her stuff.

418
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,499
Oh, right.

419
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,917
Hee-jin.

420
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,794
What? Where is she?

421
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,754
She shouldn't be wandering around now.

422
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,798
- Sorry?
- She has died once...

423
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,971
ONLY THE ONES WHO WERE REVIVED
BY ABYSS CAN SEE IT

424
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,390
Right.

425
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,559
It means she can see it too.

426
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,811
Where did that brat...

427
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,188
I mean, Jang Hee-jin. Where is she now?

428
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,036
Thank you. She's in there, right?

429
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,331
Wait. Ms. Eom told me
to make sure no one visits her

430
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,458
without her permission,
but I brought you here

431
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,418
because you said it's about Min--

432
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,129
Trust me. I won't be long.

433
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,840
And it's true that I must see Hee-jin

434
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,425
to make sure Min can live.

435
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,595
Min is really okay, right?

436
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,306
I'll sort things out
so that he can be okay.

437
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,224
Don't worry about anything, Auntie.

438
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,270
"Auntie"?

439
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,147
I'm not...

440
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,700
- I told you not to act up.
- Honey.

441
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,414
Please stop...

442
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,718
I told you to do exactly as I said.

443
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,012
Who do you think you are?

444
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,806
You killed Mom, didn't you?

445
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,474
How could you...

446
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,477
You still have the audacity
to talk back to me.

447
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,854
I obviously need to discipline you more.

448
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,986
<i>Brother.</i>

449
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,613
<i>Help me, please.</i>

450
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,449
If you don't want to end up like your mom,

451
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,452
just do as you're told.

452
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,162
You got that?

453
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,791
Hey.

454
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,127
- No!
- My goodness!

455
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,713
What are you doing here?

456
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,465
What? What am I doing here?
You're really something.

457
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,342
Hey, how can you be sleeping now?

458
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,510
I told you to stay put.

459
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,845
How did you find me?

460
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,805
Auntie Mi-sun...

461
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,476
I mean, the secretary told me
when she came by to collect your stuff.

462
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,603
By the way, what's the matter?

463
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,355
Are you all right?

464
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,740
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that?

465
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,658
Right, it's totally understandable.

466
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,493
Your looks didn't change at all, so I bet

467
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,037
it's harder for you to believe it.

468
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,205
I'm just speechless.

469
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,501
Fine, go ahead and call me
a con artist and a gold digger.

470
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,045
But who are you, really?

471
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,297
I told you. I'm Go Se-yeon.

472
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,757
Stop spewing total nonsense!

473
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,302
Whether you think it's nonsense or not,
it is true.

474
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,138
And whether you believe me or not,
I need your help.

475
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,309
You see, it was impossible for you
to walk away completely unscathed

476
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,643
from the accident you were in.

477
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,146
Look, this is what happened.

478
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,816
You don't have a single scrape though.
Does that make sense to you?

479
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,110
I'm sure you don't understand it,

480
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,154
but you already knew
what had happened was odd.

481
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,407
The marble that saved our lives

482
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,493
is in the hands of a murderer now.

483
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,412
And Min who saved both our lives with it

484
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,539
is dead.

485
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,210
Even so, how can that handsome guy be Min?

486
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,670
You can verify that yourself
once we revive him.

487
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,172
You've got nothing to lose anyway.

488
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,676
We're the only ones
who can see and find that marble.

489
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,263
And we need that to revive Min.

490
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,185
Two sets of eyes will be better than one.

491
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,189
That being said,

492
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,109
I need you to help me. Okay?

493
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,320
Come on. You promised to help.

494
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,863
Damn it.

495
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,241
What?

496
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,784
She wasn't abducted?

497
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,246
Still, she shouldn't be here.

498
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,373
We need her help on this investigation.

499
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,583
You decided to trust me
and let me in on this case.

500
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,794
Can't you let her help me just this once?

501
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,754
Hey, take a seat. Come on.

502
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,632
Just know that I'm here against my will.

503
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:39,095
How many cars went in and out
around the time of the incident?

504
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,179
Are these it?

505
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,807
There weren't many
since it was after midnight.

506
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,353
I spotted three suspicious vehicles,
but the drivers can't be reached.

507
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,856
Can we figure out
where these vehicles went?

508
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,941
Do you have footage
from the end of this road?

509
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:52,900
Just a second.

510
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,944
Hold on.

511
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,779
I'm not good at operating this.

512
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,121
Why the hell is this making such a noise?

513
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,875
Miss!

514
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,586
You're home, aren't you?

515
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,173
Miss, open up!

516
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,598
What's going on?

517
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,143
- Can I help you with something?
- Hold on.

518
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,854
Is she not home?

519
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,941
What business do you have
with my daughter?

520
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,235
So you're her father?

521
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,616
She's already three months behind
on her rent

522
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,743
and her deposit is now long gone.

523
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,787
I won't tolerate this anymore.

524
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,288
My goodness.

525
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,125
As her father, I am truly ashamed.

526
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,211
Why don't you wait inside?

527
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,798
I'll withdraw the money
and give it to you right away.

528
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,550
I wasn't saying that
I needed it right now.

529
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,970
No, I should give it to you today.

530
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,973
I'm only here until this evening.

531
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,644
Please don't stand out here
and wait for me inside.

532
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,189
You know where the nearest ATM is, right?

533
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,692
- It's at the convenience store.
- I know that.

534
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,735
Please wait inside.

535
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,247
Unbelievable.

536
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,250
Look at this.

537
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:19,297
When I visited the last time,
the house was filthy with trash

538
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,549
and had liquor bottles just lying around.

539
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,510
I guess she cleaned up
to accommodate her dad.

540
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,597
That's right.

541
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,475
I'd be satisfied if she kept
this place clean like today.

542
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,901
What is this stain on the wall?

543
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,265
Hey, why aren't you focusing?

544
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,641
Tell me if you see

545
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,478
something shining or glowing
in the footage!

546
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,106
How the hell is this going
to help find him?

547
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,649
Watch your temper.

548
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,526
Tell me about it.

549
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,820
How can we find
a sly guy like him this way?

550
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,073
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

551
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,283
We know all the possible routes
he can take, right?

552
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,828
Even if we know the specific time frame,
it'll still take us at least ten days.

553
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,288
Not for me.

554
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,207
Only I...

555
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,001
I can spot it for sure.

556
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,006
Wait, what was that?

557
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:44,924
Yes, that!

558
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,051
Do you see what that man is carrying?

559
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,136
Yes.

560
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,014
I see something shining too.
Is he taking a photo?

561
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,019
Wait, can you see that too?
You can see that light?

562
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,230
How can one not?

563
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,734
Set it to full-screen mode.

564
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,528
Damn it.

565
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,248
Darn it!

566
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,792
It's already stained and won't come off.

567
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,797
What is this
and why is it all over the place?

568
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,471
My gosh...

569
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,143
What are you...

570
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,062
doing there?

571
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,609
You're back so soon.

572
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,326
I thought about it

573
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,039
and I should receive the rent
from your daughter directly.

574
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,961
She knows my account number,

575
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,422
so please tell her to wire me the money.

576
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,938
You came for the money,

577
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,607
so why leave without it?

578
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,120
I've had enough.
This won't work. Let's give up.

579
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,830
What's there to spot?

580
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,296
Hey, wake up.

581
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,173
I wasn't sleeping!

582
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,132
Look.

583
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,259
Look at this. Can you see it?

584
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,969
I can.

585
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:54,970
Dong-cheol.

586
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,305
Detective Park! Dong-cheol!

587
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,389
- What?
- Look at this!

588
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,474
Hold on!

589
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,100
Can you see this, Dong-cheol?

590
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,436
What am I supposed to see?

591
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,648
The light glowing over there.
Can you not see it?

592
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,983
Where? Which one?

593
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,863
It's glowing so brightly.
How can you not see it?

594
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,865
Is it because you're old?

595
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,410
- Old?
- Where exactly is this camera installed?

596
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,954
- Hurry and tell me.
- What?

597
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,038
Where is it?

598
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,778
Why the hell is this acting up?

599
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:08,919
Mi-do, wait.

600
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,006
I'll get a composite sketch of that man--

601
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,008
I don't have time to wait for that.

602
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,509
Did you call for backup?

603
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,930
How can I do that
with such a ridiculous reason?

604
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,682
Helping you is insane enough.

605
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,183
Fine. I'll get him myself then.

606
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,560
- But--
- Why aren't you coming?

607
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,771
Mi-do, hold on. Wait.

608
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,398
Just us? But you said he's a murderer!

609
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,818
- You're coming, right?
- I am.

610
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,487
Wear your shirt properly.
I think it's on backward.

611
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,739
Unbelievable.

612
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,491
Talk about being rude.

613
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,913
Mi-do, you stubborn little minx.

614
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,712
Detective Choe, where are you?

615
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,075
It was around here, right?

616
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,619
If we do a thorough search
around the neighborhood,

617
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,496
I'm sure we'll run into him.

618
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,915
Even if we do,
two women can't catch a guy like him.

619
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,959
- We should call the cops--
- What? The police?

620
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,127
Are you kidding me?

621
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,628
Don't you know how we ended up here?

622
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,464
It's because you went off the grid
after selling the house Min bought.

623
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,675
- If you're a decent human, you--
- All right, fine!

624
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,594
Seriously, that brat!

625
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,723
The security footage showed
that the marble was glowing here...

626
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,724
Wait.

627
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,560
The gate's open.

628
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,647
Hello?

629
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,191
Se-yeon, isn't this trespassing?

630
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,361
Is anyone home?

631
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,869
What's that?

632
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,337
What is it? What happened?

633
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,433
Hey.

634
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,894
<i>His car is on the move.</i>
<i>It just exited the alley.</i>

635
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,575
Yes, past the Dobong-dong intersection.

636
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,077
It just passed Daerim Hill.

637
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,872
Yes, go straight ahead.

638
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,542
Exactly. That's the way.

639
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,260
Daerim Hill, please. Keep going straight.

640
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,553
- Daerim Hill?
- Yes.

641
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,013
Sir, can you please step on it?

642
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,683
AUTOPSY REPORT

643
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,687
THE DNA OF THE DECEASED
MATCHES THAT OF PRIME SUSPECT CHA MIN

644
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,652
What? Where?

645
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,780
Sir, can you head to Yeouido instead?

646
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,031
<i>Please hurry.</i>

647
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,159
I'll have Detective Choe take over
and head there myself.

648
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,370
Yes, that's the place. Keep going.

649
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,621
Dong-cheol, look.

650
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,873
PROSECUTOR MURDER SUSPECT FOUND DEAD

00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,667
<i>Is his car still in Yeouido?</i>

652
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,793
- What...
- <i>Hello?</i>

653
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,836
Are you still there? Detective Park!

654
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,547
Hello? Dong-cheol! Hey!

655
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,092
Mi-do, can you wait?
I need to stop by the station.

656
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,261
But we're close to catching him.
What are you... Hello?

657
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,387
He hung up?

658
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,680
- Damn it.
- <i>Breaking news.</i>

659
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:33,392
<i>Cha Min, the suspect wanted for the murder
of a female prosecutor,</i>

660
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,477
<i>was found dead.</i>

661
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:36,728
<i>Breaking news.</i>

662
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,814
- There they are.
- Over here!

663
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:39,940
That's him.

664
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,115
Is it true that the suspect
was found dead?

665
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,284
- Will this conclude the case?
- Was it suicide?

666
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,660
Could it be a homicide?

667
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,037
- Please answer the questions!
- Wait!

668
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,331
- Can you comment on this?
- Hold on!

669
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,171
What's going on?

670
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,007
<i>I'm as clueless as you are.</i>

671
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,385
We should let the people know about
Cha Min's body at Myeongjin Hospital.

672
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,220
<i>No! We can never do that.</i>

673
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,222
<i>Just give me some time. I almost got him.</i>

674
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,557
<i>Wait a little longer, okay?</i>

675
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,976
Damn it.

676
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,148
It's raining cats and dogs.

677
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,482
Did you girls bring umbrellas?

678
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,775
No, sir.

679
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,738
There are a few umbrellas back there
that people left in the car.

680
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,197
You can take those.

681
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,658
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

682
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,627
I'll go this way,
so you should go that way.

683
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,713
Do you remember Abyss?
The marble you saw at home.

684
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,882
If you see a man

685
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,009
with something like that,
make sure to catch him.

686
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,094
How would I hold down a grown man?

687
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,472
I'm not telling you
to physically pin him down.

688
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,766
You can sweet-talk him.
You're good at that.

689
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,727
If you stall him and send me the address,

690
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,437
I'll head over as soon as I can. Okay?

691
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,980
Go that way.

692
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,735
<i>I didn't give you my number
so you could call me anytime you want.</i>

693
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,029
You'll be surprised to hear

694
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,947
what I have in my hand.

695
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,118
We can easily turn the tables...

696
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,955
with this thing.

697
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,708
Where are you?

698
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,752
I'll head over there.

699
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,637
SKELETAL REMAINS OF
THE PROSECUTOR MURDER SUSPECT FOUND

700
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,764
Watch it!

701
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,643
SKELETAL REMAINS OF
THE PROSECUTOR MURDER SUSPECT FOUND

702
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,537
I just saw him
going into the alley you're in.

703
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,539
Make sure to find him, okay?

704
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:02,874
I got it.

705
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,130
How am I supposed to find him like this?

706
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,094
I don't understand what she's thinking.

707
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,455
You crazy jerk.
Get that away from me. Get it away!

708
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,457
I'm sure you know that I hate it

709
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,791
when it gets loud.

710
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,067
Are you all right?

711
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,030
Yes.

712
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,740
I'm all right.

713
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,757
Hey! Hee-jin! Are you okay?

714
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:35,717
Hey!

715
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,677
What happened?

716
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,766
What? He's the one who tried to kill you?

717
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,269
To be precise,

718
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,689
he's the one who forced me
to lie during my interview on the news.

719
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,442
What? Why are you telling this now...

720
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,611
Hold on a second.

721
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,656
Why did Oh Yeong-cheol force you
to do such a thing?

722
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,493
Did you just say Oh Yeong-cheol?

723
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,536
Yes.

724
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,122
He isn't Oh Yeong-cheol.
He's just a henchman.

725
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,041
That old man is Oh Yeong-cheol.

726
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,085
His appearance just changed

727
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,212
when he was revived by Abyss,
just like me.

728
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,505
That old man

729
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,341
is Oh Yeong-cheol, the real culprit
of the Eomsan-dong Murder Case.

730
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,929
- I told you not to act up.
- Honey.

731
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,597
Remember?

732
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,520
I told you to do exactly as I said.

733
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,938
Who do you think you are?

734
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,565
You killed Mom, didn't you?

735
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,358
How could you...

736
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,407
Why don't you say something?

737
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,617
What's going on between you
and Oh Yeong-cheol?

738
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,911
<i>If you don't want to end up like your mom,</i>

739
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,455
<i>just do as you're told.</i>

740
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,625
- I can't do this.
- What?

741
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,544
- I need to go.
- Hey, wait--

742
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,587
Let go of me!

743
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,589
I'm out.

744
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,090
I can't do this anymore.

745
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,926
Hee-jin. You can't just leave like this.

746
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,803
Hey! Hee-jin!

747
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,388
You can't leave now. Hey!

748
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,994
Stop the press first
and have the legal team ready.

749
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:30,707
EOM AE-LAN

750
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,398
Hello?

751
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,859
Is this Lawyer Lee Mi-do's number?

752
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,944
Yes, it is.

753
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,321
<i>Is Min really okay?</i>

754
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,239
<i>The articles are saying that he's dead.</i>

755
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,287
You told me earlier today
not to believe anything.

756
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,414
You said that he's really fine.

757
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,708
<i>But...</i>

758
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,711
<i>I don't know what I should believe.</i>

759
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,881
What the articles are saying isn't true.

760
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:22,801
<i>Hello?</i>

761
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,053
<i>Hello?</i>

762
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,472
<i>Ms. Lee?</i>

763
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,349
<i>Hello?</i>

764
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,895
IRI COMMUNICATIONS

765
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,981
You're becoming a regular.

766
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,275
And now you want me to fix it for free?

767
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,903
Stop with the mumbling and fix it already.

768
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,614
Do you know how many times
I let you off the hook

769
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,116
when you distributed cloned phones?

770
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,410
I should just fine you right now...

771
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,328
What is it?

772
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:53,915
What's going on?

773
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,544
WIRETAPPING

774
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,116
THE DEVICE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED

775
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,120
<i>This stop
is Myeongjin Hospital Intersection.</i>

776
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,621
<i>The next stop is...</i>

777
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,221
She's still alive?

778
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,310
DETECTIVE PARK DONG-CHEOL

779
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,355
<i>Can't talk. What's up?</i>

780
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,733
DETECTIVE PARK DONG-CHEOL

781
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,360
"What's up"? Is she serious?

782
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,240
Aren't you going to sit?

783
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,617
Sir.

784
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,745
I don't think we should suddenly announce
that the case is closed.

785
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,747
Why are you doing this? You know very well

786
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,208
that Cha Min's fingerprints
were found at the hospital!

787
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,710
If the skeletal remains
was really Cha Min's,

788
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,670
his fingerprints
couldn't have been found there.

789
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,214
We need to keep the case open--

790
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,424
Stop spewing nonsense and close the case.

791
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,467
Sir!

792
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,929
How can we close it?

793
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,388
We can't do that!

794
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,057
Damn it.

795
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,018
To celebrate our opening, you'll get
a bottle of soju on the house.

796
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,478
Hello, welcome!

797
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,022
We're having a promotional event
to celebrate our opening.

798
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,983
PLAYROOM

799
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,276
Please enjoy your time.

800
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,528
<i>Good evening.</i>

801
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,572
<i>Thank you for visiting Myeongjin Hospital.</i>

802
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,700
<i>With a history of 40 years,</i>

803
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,746
<i>Myeongjin Hospital will continue
to make every endeavor</i>

804
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,915
<i>to maintain the reputation
of being patient-oriented</i>

805
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,627
<i>by putting forth the health
of our patients as our highest concern.</i>

806
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,685
We will now begin the briefing

807
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,730
on closing the murder case

808
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,274
of Prosecutor Go Se-yeon.

809
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,191
Before we start...

810
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,484
Excuse me for a minute.

811
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,403
I need to take it. It's an urgent call.

812
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,529
What are you doing?

813
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,656
- Hello?
- What is he doing?

814
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,324
<i>Didn't I tell you</i>

815
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,494
someone is trying to cover up the truth
behind this case for a reason?

816
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,330
And that I know who that person is?

817
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,582
Who is it?

818
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,626
It's Oh Yeong-cheol.

819
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:47,672
<i>It's time to reveal the truth
about that bastard.</i>

820
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,757
He's at Myeongjin Hospital now.

821
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,302
I'll keep him busy.
Send over the police right away.

822
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,978
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

823
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,022
I need to use the bathroom.

824
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,023
Will you join me?

825
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,191
No... I'll be right back.

826
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,902
- What's going on?
- Where is he going?

827
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,236
- Dong-cheol!
- Come back!

828
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,738
<i>Jang Hee-jin?</i>

829
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,824
<i>She's scheduled to be admitted today.</i>

830
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,784
<i>Her room will be on the fifth floor.</i>

831
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,853
JANG HEE-JIN

832
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,422
JANG HEE-JIN

833
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,306
JANG HEE-JIN

834
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,520
I'll head up to the fifth floor.

835
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,231
You stand by
at any possible escape routes.

836
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,482
- You guys stay here.
- Yes, sir.

837
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,900
Escape routes? Got it!

838
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,484
You're alive!

839
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,986
- Min!
- But where's my Abyss?

840
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,363
That bastard has it.

841
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,323
Where did that old fart go?

842
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,783
<i>He's already left the hospital.</i>

843
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,161
<i>I want you to wrap up this case
without making any mistakes.</i>

844
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,539
<i>That marble
brought you back to life, didn't it?</i>

845
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,541
Se-yeon, what's wrong?

846
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,793
<i>Min. Listen.</i>

847
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,045
<i>Even if something happens to me,</i>

848
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,881
you have to make sure to save the ones

849
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,050
<i>I've been trying to protect at all costs.</i>

850
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,719
<i>Oh Yeong-cheol,
I won't let you get away this time.</i>

851
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,015
