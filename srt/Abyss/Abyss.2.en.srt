1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,504
Let go!
I'll tell them that Go Se-yeon isn't dead!

2
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,548
- Let go!
- I know what's going on, calm down.

3
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,674
What do you know?

4
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,634
I know everything.

5
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,471
I'm the one...

6
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,599
who brought you back to life.

7
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,438
With this.

8
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:12,781
AN ABYSS REVIVES THE DEAD
INTO THE FORM OF ITS SOUL

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,412
You're...

10
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,415
Se-yeon, right?

11
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,878
Who are you?

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,005
Are you a ghost?

13
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,467
Or the Grim Reaper or something?

14
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,178
It's me.

15
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,138
Cha Min.

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,059
You're a nutjob.

17
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,937
You seem normal, but you're talking crap.

18
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,730
You're Cha Min?

19
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,482
You? With this face?

20
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,151
Jang Tae-ha, Kim Jong-seok, Won Ji-cheol,

21
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,320
Park Gyeong-sik, Yu Jae-yeong,
and Lee Hyeok...

22
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,863
Never mind. He was just a fling.

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,865
Park Jun-min and Son Tae-su.

24
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,951
You rejected me to date them.

25
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,703
What else should I say?

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,039
When your parents opened their diner,

27
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,332
I ate five fried chickens

28
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,501
- on my own and ended up--
- You...

29
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,337
Who the hell are you?

30
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,217
I used this on you
since this brought me back to life.

31
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,469
I didn't think it'd work, though.

32
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,933
I can't comprehend what's going on.

33
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,102
I don't understand a word you're saying.

34
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,396
Okay, fine. Let's say I believe you.

35
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,275
How come you were reborn handsome,
but I turned out like this?

36
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,818
It wasn't my doing.

37
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,236
You read the rule, too.

38
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,824
It says that it revives someone
in the form of their soul.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,177
I know it seems crazy,

40
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,513
but you don't have any other explanation
for this situation, right?

41
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,391
It's the same for me.

42
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,937
It may sound outrageous,
but this is the truth.

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,732
So let's go somewhere
to dry our clothes and--

44
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,108
You're right.

45
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,735
None of this makes sense.

46
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,405
I can't explain any of this,
so I'll figure it out myself.

47
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,951
Se-yeon!

48
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,206
I'm going to head to
the prosecutor's office after the burial.

49
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,124
What about you, Detective Park?

50
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,501
I'd like to attend, as well,

51
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,671
but Cha Min has been located.
I'm afraid that takes priority.

52
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,507
- All right, then.
- I'll see you.

53
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,185
You're off to my burial site, right?
I'll drive.

54
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,896
Mi-do, aren't you supposed
to be in New York?

55
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,773
- Get in.
- What are you doing?

56
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,441
It's me, Go Se-yeon.

57
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,612
Others may not recognize me,
but you of all people should.

58
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,699
I have no time.
I must get there before they bury me.

59
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,910
Until you tell me what's going on...

60
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,255
You didn't know you'd die, right?

61
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,175
Well, I didn't think
I'd get to kill you, either.

62
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,935
Se-yeon!

63
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,687
Se-yeon, wake up.

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,647
Se-yeon!

65
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,275
Please open your eyes.

66
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,693
Se-yeon!

67
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,237
Doctor!

68
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,283
Why isn't she waking up?
You said nothing's wrong with her.

69
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,451
Please examine her again. She's...

70
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,913
She's not like other human beings.

71
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,248
I mean...

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,125
How do I explain this?

73
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,919
She's just really special, all right?

74
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,505
So please take a good look at her again.

75
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,134
I did all sorts of tests
because you kept pestering me.

76
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,760
Nothing showed up.

77
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,346
She's just in deep slumber.

78
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,849
She's fast asleep.

79
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,101
- Just be patient.
- But, sir...

80
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,110
Can you believe him?

81
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,029
Good looking and devoted?

82
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,448
Even a dead person
would wake up for that cute face.

83
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,160
Exactly. How did she get so lucky?

84
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,621
She's nothing but ordinary.

85
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,751
How did she snag a boyfriend like that?

86
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,629
Did you hear him earlier?
"She's just really special, all right?"

87
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,007
His veins were about to pop, you know.

88
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,551
Unbelievable. Now that's what I call sexy.

89
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,802
Lucky her.

90
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,861
Se-yeon, are you all right?

91
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,076
Wait. Where am I?

92
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,411
You're at the hospital, of course.

93
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,829
Are you all right?

94
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,040
Yes.

95
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,252
Oh, no. My burial.

96
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,609
Se-yeon.

97
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,612
Se-yeon.

98
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,739
Se-yeon.

99
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,371
LATE GO SE-YEON

100
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,612
It's...

101
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,407
all over now.

102
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,786
Wait for me, honey.

103
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,330
Prosecutor Seo.

104
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,915
Yes?

105
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,167
Did Prosecutor Go's funeral end?

106
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,252
Yes.

107
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,755
You should take the rest of the day off.

108
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,007
This just arrived.

109
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,805
Your girlfriend has been
sending gifts often these days.

110
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,851
Aren't you heading home?

111
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,771
I am right now. See you tomorrow.

112
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,098
Se-yeon, going there won't change a thing.

113
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,266
The burial is over.

114
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,477
How can I let it go when I'm still alive?

115
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,563
Things must be a mess.

116
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,649
My parents must be in deep grief
right now.

117
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,495
GO SE-YEON

118
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,868
EPISODE 2

119
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,796
GO SE-YEON

120
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,383
HERE LIES A BEAUTIFUL SOUL WHO LIVED
HER LIFE LIKE A SWEET CHERRY BLOSSOM

121
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,060
It's for the best.

122
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,647
They won't believe that it is you
if you show up like this.

123
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,358
They'll be devastated
once they see the body's gone.

124
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,485
- It's good that--
- Hey.

125
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,071
- Yes?
- Pass me what we bought.

126
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,739
Sure.

127
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,095
Just wait.

128
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,223
I'll find whoever murdered you.

129
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,934
I'll find the culprit...

130
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,228
and make him pay...

131
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,897
for what he did.

132
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,111
What do we know
about Cha Min's whereabouts?

133
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,322
His credit card was used
at multiple places,

134
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,700
but there's no sign of him
on security cameras.

135
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,410
Honestly, it's weird.

136
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,539
Also, the amounts are too small
for it to have been stolen.

137
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,167
We're working on the possibility
of there being an accomplice.

138
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,210
All right.

139
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,964
Has all the evidence been collected
from Prosecutor Go's house?

140
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,257
Yes, it's done.

141
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,843
Then can you help
clean up the crime scene?

142
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,094
Today?

143
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:04,140
Her parents, especially her mother,
are in a fragile state.

144
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,184
The scene has been processed
by the crime lab,

145
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,103
so there's no need to leave it that way.

146
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,232
They'll find it heartbreaking,
so I thought we should help.

147
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,943
I guess you're right.

148
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,238
I'll ask other officers
to help me clean it up.

149
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,031
Sure.

150
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,159
One more thing.

151
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,329
So you're now in charge
of the Eomsan-dong Murder Case?

152
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,750
Regarding the suspects, Prosecutor Go--

153
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,585
Which is more pressing?

154
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,379
A long-term cold case
or Prosecutor Go's murder?

155
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,842
If we're weighing the two,
I'd say the Eomsan-dong murder--

156
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,219
Investigations have a golden hour.

157
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,055
We should focus on the most recent case.

158
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,225
We can't afford to lose the culprit
when we know who it is.

159
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,729
Right. I understand, sir.

160
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,358
PROSECUTOR SEO JI-UK

161
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,657
EOMSAN-DONG MURDER CASE

162
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,160
PROSECUTOR IN CHARGE: GO SE-YEON
VICTIM: LEE SEUNG-HUN

163
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,796
Here. Put these on.

164
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,799
Like me.

165
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,594
Must you see it for yourself, though?

166
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,515
It's kind of weird to come
and see where you were murdered.

167
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,019
If you're going to be fussy, just leave.

168
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,816
No, I'm staying.

169
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:16,438
PROSECUTOR GO-SE-YEON

170
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,816
Who are you people?

171
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,195
You're not allowed to come in here.
Please leave.

172
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,406
Sure, we're leaving.

173
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,449
Why aren't you leaving?

174
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,952
Is the forensic examination over here?

175
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,454
- Are you from the office?
- I'm Go Se-yeon...

176
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm a family member of Prosecutor Go.

177
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,504
Right, she's a cousin
on her mother's side.

178
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,590
So you received the call.

179
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,759
We only came to lend you a hand.

180
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,600
YANGYANG HANGOVER SOUP

181
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,485
Why aren't you eating?

182
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,489
- You don't eat ox blood soup?
- How can you stomach this now?

183
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,367
Can you be any freakier?

184
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,455
Like you said, I was reborn.

185
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,791
I should have the ability to survive
without eating or have superpowers.

186
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,835
If not, I should be invincible,

187
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,671
or at least have blue blood.

188
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,632
But I get hungry at mealtime,

189
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,842
go to the bathroom,
and then I get hungry again.

190
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,761
I'm nothing but an ordinary human being.

191
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,220
You don't seem ordinary to me.

192
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,809
Besides, look at this crappy body.
There's nothing I like...

193
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,186
Goodness! Darn it.

194
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,773
I can't get used to this face.

195
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,901
Why does it look so familiar, though?

196
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,903
You have a common face now.

197
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,782
The old you had features
that were memorable,

198
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,825
but now...

199
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,036
Well, you seem common.

200
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,830
I feel like I've seen it too.

201
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,127
On the bright side,
it's good to be common--

202
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,754
- You have a death wish?
- Accept it.

203
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,048
- This is what your soul looks like.
- "Accept it"?

204
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,842
How can I accept it
when I was reborn to look like this?

205
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,013
How am I supposed to navigate this world
with such a hideous body?

206
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,307
As a former hideous being,

207
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,351
I'm upset to even hear you say that.

208
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:21,313
You were reborn this way
because of those shallow views on life.

209
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,190
What's wrong with your face anyway?

210
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,819
You're not glamorous anymore,
but if you look closely--

211
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,487
What? Look closely?

212
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,660
I can't believe I've come to the point
where you are assessing my looks.

213
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,036
Hey, Min.

214
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,915
My face wasn't one
that people had to look closely

215
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,458
to know its value.

216
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,712
People noticed my beauty
even from a distance.

217
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,173
When it comes to looks,
I was on another level.

218
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,426
Talking about it is annoying me even more.

219
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,761
Your soul must've been childish, though.

220
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,015
You're not as pretty as you used to be,
but you do seem younger.

221
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,310
Is this funny? Is this hilarious to you?

222
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,063
Let's talk about your soul, then.

223
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,481
Here we go.

224
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,236
You look at least 30 years younger now.

225
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,448
Just how childish
does that make your soul?

226
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,908
I'm just saying we should stay positive.

227
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,498
Se-yeon, we were given
a second chance, so be nicer.

228
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,751
Just look at my dashing soul.

229
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,588
Well, I say it's bullshit.

230
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,341
PROSECUTOR FOUND DEAD

231
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,094
You murder suspect.

232
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,014
I said I didn't kill you.

233
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,103
I wonder why you became the prime suspect.

234
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,856
Even you think it's crap, right?

235
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,405
What's with that gaze?

236
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,284
No one held a grudge against me
as much as you did.

237
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,121
I doubt there's anyone
who has a deeper motive.

238
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,707
Then why would I have
brought you back to life?

239
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,710
Who knows what a psychopath thinks?

240
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,670
That brat.

241
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,507
Let me see.

242
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,967
One iced Americano and...

243
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,930
- That'll be all.
- Sure.

244
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,308
- I'm good.
- Cover my bill.

245
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,019
How can I pay
when I just rose from the dead?

246
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,606
You're shameless, aren't you?

247
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,610
She's Go Se-yeon for sure.
I can tell from the way she behaves.

248
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,531
I'll get a two-shot espresso with that.

249
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,577
Hold on. You're the prime suspect.

250
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,246
Can't murder suspects drink coffee?

251
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,165
You idiot.

252
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,168
How can they suspect such a nitwit?

253
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,671
I'm not the murderer. I didn't do it.

254
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,215
Just shut up and follow me.

255
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,967
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,635
I'm sorry, too.

257
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,350
Consider yourself lucky
that you ran into me.

258
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,519
Why would you use your card?
You're on the run.

259
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,147
- Are you out of your mind?
- Now I get it.

260
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,441
That was why detectives came
wherever I went.

261
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,068
So how much cash...

262
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,905
- Is this all?
- Who carries cash these days?

263
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,874
Min, be glad that you were a rich lad

264
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,043
and that I used to be a prosecutor.

265
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,753
Follow me.

266
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,134
PAWN SHOP

267
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,262
Turn around.

268
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,223
Here you go.

269
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,602
This too.

270
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,192
- Here you go.
- Seriously? Are you kidding me?

271
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,236
I know how much it's all worth.
Don't lowball it.

272
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,323
A little more. Give me all of that.

273
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,532
- Give it.
- Here.

274
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,996
How much are those?

275
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,332
- They're 3,000 won.
- Hand it over.

276
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,793
- These too?
- Come on.

277
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,547
All right.

278
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,759
These too.

279
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,691
Mister, I'm not a weird person.

280
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,444
I'm a prosecutor,
but I'm in a little bit of trouble now.

281
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,820
Take this.

282
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,531
I gave you 100,000 won.

283
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,283
Can you please help me out?

284
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,994
IRI COMMUNICATIONS

285
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,503
Hold on.

286
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,964
Would you be able to fix this?

287
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,927
I need to take a look.

288
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,554
Stop being a fool.

289
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:10,269
IRI COMMUNICATIONS

290
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,645
Use this from now on.

291
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,400
Put me on speed dial.

292
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,404
Speed dial? Who sets those these days?

293
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,114
What year does he live in?

294
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,046
- My goodness.
- What the hell are you doing?

295
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,423
I'm sorry, sir.

296
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,427
Who washes their car
in the middle of the night?

297
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,886
Unbelievable.

298
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,972
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry, sir.

299
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,609
Are you Mr. Park Gi-man?

300
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,403
Yes.

301
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,488
That's me.

302
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,282
Here.

303
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,037
- Please sign here.
- Sure.

304
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,541
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

305
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,584
Take care.

306
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,359
Is he alive?

307
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,528
Are we good, then?

308
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,989
We've procured cash, so let's eat dinner.

309
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,992
- There's a beef restaurant--
- Beef?

310
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,161
We're fugitives
with no money or a place to go.

311
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,829
We'll eat something simple.

312
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,790
But I haven't eaten all day.

313
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,334
You should've listened
and finished the ox blood soup.

314
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,921
Come on.
I know a place where we can get free food.

315
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,381
Follow me.

316
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,222
MINI PIGS' FEET

317
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,726
LUNCH BOX

318
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,354
Rather than these,

319
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,022
I'd prefer a proper meal.

320
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,524
The total cost of these will be

321
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,276
- the same as eating in a restaurant.
- Min.

322
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,240
Do you want to drink <i>somaek</i>
to celebrate our return from the dead?

323
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,327
Unbelievable.

324
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,673
This and...

325
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,263
That'll be 5,600 won.

326
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,306
These too.

327
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,857
The expiration date for this has passed.
Would you like something else?

328
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,193
Do you know that displaying such a product

329
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,279
is a violation of the Food Sanitation Act?

330
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,780
Pardon?

331
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,950
I know for a fact
that you already paid a fine

332
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,827
for a violation a few months ago.

333
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,580
Isn't it too soon to be caught again?

334
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,667
It's an honest mistake.
I forgot to take it off the shelf.

335
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,421
Can't you let this slide?
My boss will fire me for this.

336
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,175
Fired? Well, we can't have that.

337
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,803
It's not like I'd die because
the food expired just hours ago.

338
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,847
- I won't make a big deal out of it.
- Really?

339
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,766
Thank you.

340
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,520
Still, "give and take"
is a basic rule of life.

341
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,938
Since I let it pass,

342
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,608
it'd be nice to get something in return.

343
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,665
Gosh, this is good.

344
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,793
We can take care of dinner here
for the time being. Right?

345
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,963
You are something else. Truly.

346
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,965
Let's drink together.

347
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,554
I know that this store
often sells food that has expired.

348
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,557
They knowingly leave it
on the shelf a lot of times.

349
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,894
When some drunk guy picks it up
without knowing that it has expired,

350
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,438
they accept cash
and don't even put it in the register.

351
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,482
Don't you feel bad
for that young part-timer?

352
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,151
Don't you have your own problem
to worry about?

353
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,447
That's why I gave the tuna mayo
and stir-fried pork <i>gimbap</i> to you.

354
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,991
- Dig in.
- No. You can have it.

355
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,787
You're a prosecutor, but you go
against the law like it's nothing.

356
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,208
The closer you are to the law,
the more of them you break.

357
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,462
Besides, did I do this
just for my own benefit?

358
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,883
Until I catch that bastard who killed me,
we have to get by with what we have.

359
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,553
You and I have to live like ghosts,

360
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,638
even though we are alive.

361
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,223
What choice did I have?

362
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,392
Darn it.

363
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,444
The night of your murder,
I bought the hangover cure drinks here.

364
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,949
Had I not bought them...

365
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,744
and kept waiting
for you in front of your house...

366
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,996
No...

367
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,125
had I gone into your house...

368
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,337
you wouldn't have been murdered.

369
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,718
I'm sorry, Se-yeon.

370
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,638
Hey, you're making me cringe.

371
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,767
Hey, we both came back to life,
so stop trying to act so cool.

372
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,396
Still, I don't blame you for all this.

373
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,106
I'm the one who asked you to get...

374
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,817
Hey, hold on.

375
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,529
Is that camera supposed
to record in this direction?

376
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,200
You said you were here
around 11:30 p.m., right?

377
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,702
Yes.

378
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,083
By the way, how will this help us?

379
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,003
My house is at the end of the alley.
And it's a dead end.

380
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,340
If the guy who came into my house
isn't a resident here,

381
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,884
he has to pass by
the convenience store again.

382
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,015
What's happening? What is this?

383
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,975
Why is it filming inside the store?

384
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,685
It's supposed to film the counter.

385
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,564
But my jerk boss kept spying on me,
so I turned it away for a little while.

386
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,360
My boss will be here any minute.
Please leave now.

387
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,655
Does it mean you don't have
any footage of outside the store?

388
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,198
- I don't.
- Hey!

389
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,533
- What are you doing?
- Darn it.

390
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,744
Jeez. Hide. You must hide now.

391
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,287
Hide right here.

392
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,415
Hey.

393
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,461
I told you not to leave the counter
unattended, didn't I?

394
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,589
I was organizing things here
before I get the delivery.

395
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,218
Stop giving me that excuse.
I really don't like you.

396
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,886
Should I just fire you?

397
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,638
Come out here.

398
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,099
Do you call this organizing or what?

399
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,601
- Come out here.
- Stay here, okay?

400
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,730
I told you to sort them out by color.

401
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,358
Put the green ones with green.
Orange with orange.

402
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,193
Can't you distinguish these colors?

403
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,569
- I can, sir.
- Hey.

404
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,115
Think about why people would shop here
over a small supermarket

405
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,950
despite five to ten percent markups.

406
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,494
Because it's neat, clean,
and a tiny bit luxurious.

407
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,954
- Didn't I tell you?
- You did.

408
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,164
You should organize them
to look luxurious then.

409
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,582
Didn't I tell you to do this?

410
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,257
That bastard.

411
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,720
Come on out. He's gone.

412
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,434
You got everything you need, right?
Leave now.

413
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,102
He'll fire me if he finds out.

414
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,981
Well, we didn't get anything,
but thanks for your cooperation.

415
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,317
Thank you.

416
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,029
That annoying jerk.

417
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,282
He should just park his car the other way.

418
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,451
He always parks backward
and makes me clean up.

419
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,703
Did your boss...

420
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,331
come to check on you that night
like he did just now?

421
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,499
He did.

422
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,918
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

423
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,378
- Hello.
- Hey.

424
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,466
- Who told you to turn the security camera?
- <i>It was about 30 minutes later.</i>

425
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,178
<i>He threw a fit for turning the camera</i>
<i>and told me to clean up here and there.</i>

426
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,972
<i>He left after giving me an earful.</i>

427
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,474
Do you not want this job?

428
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,522
That brat.

429
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,319
<i>He could have parked his car</i>
<i>the other way,</i>

430
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,197
but he parked backward,
and the dirty water splashed all over.

431
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,033
What's your boss' phone number?

432
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,746
How does it make sense that
my son is a murder suspect?

433
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,748
In case this becomes a problem,

434
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,750
I put the emergency legal team on standby.

435
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,127
That's not what I want to know right now.

436
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,464
He still hasn't contacted us?

437
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,346
Use all available manpower
to make this go away.

438
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,848
Whether Min...

439
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,228
killed her or not,
that's not important right now.

440
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,647
We must find Min first,

441
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,441
no matter what happens.

442
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,360
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

443
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,321
If you understood, why are you still here?

444
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,574
- Okay. I will get--
- Go find Min!

445
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,840
Min.

446
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,134
Where are you? What are you up to now?

447
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,388
SE-YEON FRIED CHICKEN

448
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,602
Hey.

449
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,480
That's not the entrance.

450
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,401
Gosh.

451
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,586
My body is itching like crazy.

452
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,462
What is it? Is there something wrong?

453
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,132
Did something bite me at the store?

454
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,509
Hey, this looks like an allergic reaction.

455
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,970
I ate all the meal boxes.

456
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,930
You only drank beer and ate peanuts.

457
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,016
Hey, were you allergic to nuts?

458
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,268
- No. I don't have any allergies.
- Really?

459
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,937
Maybe I got allergies
along with my new face?

460
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,440
That's weird.
Suddenly, you have an allergy.

461
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,027
Stay here. There must be
some medicine for allergies here.

462
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,113
My mom is allergic to peaches too.

463
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,282
What was that?

464
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,913
What do you think? It's a clock.
Did you forget you bought that?

465
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,123
You bought it
when we opened the restaurant.

466
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,626
But what's wrong with the cuckoo?
Why did it stop?

467
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,919
Because it's broken.

468
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,172
You said a master artisan
from Switzerland made it. Liar.

469
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,050
- When are you going to get off me?
- What?

470
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,760
I'm sorry.

471
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,929
Won't you get a grip?

472
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,723
I let you tag along even though
you're a murder suspect.

473
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:17,185
Hey, do you want to add
sexual assault onto your charge?

474
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,146
How dare you try
to fulfill ulterior motives?

475
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,858
I'm sorry,
but I wasn't trying to do anything.

476
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,736
- I really got scared for a second.
- I know you. I do.

477
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,113
For 20 years, you've been

478
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,367
trying to win me over
whenever you had the chance.

479
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,578
I get it. Who can I blame?

480
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,538
It's my fault for bringing you here.

481
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,542
It's late, and we're in an enclosed space.

482
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,795
It's just the two of us
in this confined space.

483
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,425
Yes, I do understand that
your heart must be pounding.

484
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,302
But don't you think this is--

485
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,723
Se-yeon, it's really hard
for me to get used to this.

486
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,643
- What?
- You must have forgotten.

487
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,604
What is it? What?

488
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:08,069
My heart is not pounding
because you're not my type anymore.

489
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,032
I know you better than anyone else.
Looks matter to you.

490
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,909
That's why you kept on rejecting me.

491
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,578
But with the face I have now,

492
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,665
don't you think I should
be the one to worry, not vice versa?

493
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,500
No?

494
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,960
Get out of my face. Seriously.

495
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,295
You're so annoying.

496
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,580
Go to sleep. You said you were tired.

497
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,333
My mom...

498
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,670
always made sure...

499
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,632
to have fresh flowers in that vase
no matter what.

500
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,928
She said that if the flowers wither...

501
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,682
she would also...

502
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,269
feel down like those flowers.

503
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,192
Let's go to sleep.

504
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,861
I need my energy to catch that jerk.

505
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,826
Why don't you just cry?

506
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,079
Why should I?

507
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,748
That's a waste of my tears.

508
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,292
I won't cry yet.

509
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,795
No, I can't.

510
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,510
Sure. Good for you.

511
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,642
Se-yeon, you're brave...

512
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,645
invincible...

513
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,898
and the most powerful in this universe.

514
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,820
The beauty and the brain.

515
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,905
The most beautiful...

516
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,282
Right. Now you're not...

517
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,785
- Do you have a death wish?
- Let me try again.

518
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,122
You were the prettiest
in your previous life.

519
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,999
You were the hottest
in your previous life.

520
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,876
In your previous life...

521
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,670
Stop it before I punch you.

522
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:36,551
Your fist was faster than your words.
You were a sly fox in your previous life.

523
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,261
I told you to stop.

524
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,804
- Stop it.
- In your previous...

525
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,055
Stop it. Stop.

526
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,724
- You always assume it doesn't hurt.
- Hey.

527
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,227
- You're unbelievable.
- You think I'm a pushover.

528
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,730
Hey. Do you really want to die?

529
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,859
- Seriously.
- Let's go to sleep.

530
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,861
- Stop it.
- Okay.

531
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,445
You said you'll stop.

532
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,386
My innocent daughter was murdered.

533
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,098
Park Mi-jin. You know her, don't you?

534
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,436
Just like my daughter...

535
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,147
you should feel...

536
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,067
every ounce of this pain now.

537
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,869
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER.
NO, NOT YET.

538
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,804
Is this seriously going to be
our meals from now on?

539
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,264
Why not? Is there a problem?

540
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,393
I'm already sick of it.
You can stomach it, so you eat it.

541
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,105
I'm going to kill you if you complain
later because you're hungry.

542
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,071
Hey, can I have 10,000 won?

543
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,114
What?

544
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,284
You want 10,000 won? For what?

545
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,370
I just need to buy something.

546
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:15,042
Wait, why do I have to beg
to get money from you?

547
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,503
Now that I think about it,
that's my money.

548
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,509
What a pest. He talks so much.

549
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,514
Here.

550
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,725
Spend it wisely.

551
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,398
He's had it easy.

552
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,066
He doesn't value money.

553
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,735
This is good. What's his problem?

554
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,072
SE-YEON FRIED CHICKEN

555
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,185
- What?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

556
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,811
<i>You'd better run here.</i>

557
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,855
I'm on my way. Gosh, calm down.

558
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,072
Are you over the moon now that
you had some tasty food by yourself?

559
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,449
That's not where I spent it.

560
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,786
Then tell me.
What did you use that money for?

561
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,662
Tell me what you spent it on. Tell me.

562
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,956
- What did you spend it on? What?
- Stop it.

563
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,042
You're acting like someone else.

564
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,419
I really can't get used to your face.

565
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,296
Stop coming so close.

566
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,758
I can't get used to your face either.
He's good-looking for no good reason.

567
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,302
- What did you say?
- Forget it.

568
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,262
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

569
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,979
Who are you?

570
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,482
You said you wanted to see me.

571
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,817
What is this about?

572
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,114
My gosh.

573
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,867
By the way, can you impersonate
a prosecutor with a name card?

574
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,538
- Nonsense. That's my name card.
- You can't make that argument right now.

575
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,958
We got it.

576
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:26,257
I said that he's not feeling well today,
so he can't be questioned today.

577
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,591
But if you don't comply...

578
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,511
I'm sure he'll continue to feel unwell.
Isn't that true?

579
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,644
Smoking isn't allowed in the hospital.

580
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:42,273
I get that you're a VIP patient,
but you can't smoke here.

581
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,734
Besides, you're being detained
because you have difficulty in breathing.

582
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,155
As you're making tremendous progress,
we can hold you--

583
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,281
As for the smell,

584
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,868
it's because his guest who smokes
has been visiting him. That's why--

585
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,785
It's still warm.

586
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,711
Why don't you just get up?

587
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,339
Your father and I went
to the same college.

588
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,675
Does he know what you've been up to?

589
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,510
I'll call Judge Seo myself right now.

590
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,053
You attended the same school.

591
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,598
But you don't seem to know that

592
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,225
my father hates those
who use connections for their gain.

593
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,687
Excuse me. The patient must be
on absolute bed rest.

594
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,190
You bought one billion won's worth
of medical checkups

595
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,484
at this hospital after
your release from custody.

596
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,944
He did it to show his appreciation
to his employees--

597
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,405
I'll find out soon enough
once I start digging.

598
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,540
Take good care of your health.

599
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,542
I'll see you soon.

600
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,722
Is Professor Oh Yeong-cheol
still not answering?

601
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,640
No, he's not.

602
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,226
How could he take
a leave of absence without a heads-up?

603
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,268
I know, right?

604
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,573
<i>Hello? Please let me out!</i>

605
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,825
<i>You can hear me, right? Are you there?</i>

606
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,744
<i>Please help me!</i>

607
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,997
CALL ENDED

608
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,445
AUNTIE MI-SUN

609
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,696
MOM

610
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,573
UNKNOWN NUMBER

611
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,161
WE ARE IN LOVE

612
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,621
HEE-JIN IS OFFLINE

613
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,293
You added avocado for mine, right?

614
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,670
Darn it.

615
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,882
This wouldn't have been high
for my old body.

616
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,052
Hey, I told you not to turn on the phone.

617
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,472
Seriously. I can't even believe
you actually got this phone fixed.

618
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,141
They can track the signal.

619
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,687
You said they can't find me
since I have a different face now.

620
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,398
Even so, you need to know your limit.

621
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,568
You must think cops in Korea are fools.

622
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,153
No matter how different you look,

623
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,573
you keep showing up in places where
the phone is,<i> </i>they'll investigate you.

624
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,451
If they do,
how will you explain it to them?

625
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,410
I got your point.

626
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,206
Come on, forget her.

627
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,458
After setting the date

628
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,669
and putting in the deposit
for the house...

629
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,004
Besides, it wasn't just a house.

630
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,174
It was a high-rise 50-<i>pyeong</i>
apartment in Gangnam.

631
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,385
She took the entire deposit and ran away.

632
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,303
And what was her last message?

633
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,514
"I'm sorry I don't have
the stomach for it."

634
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,557
Stop it.

635
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,810
Ask anyone. That's what gold diggers say.

636
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,229
How could you still be hung up on her
and be moping?

637
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,148
You were the one
who set me up with that gold digger.

638
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,321
Hey, think about it.
That's not what's important now.

639
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,907
If she comes back, that'd be a problem.

640
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,411
Right now, you're a murder suspect
for killing a beautiful prosecutor.

641
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,621
The whole nation is vilifying you.

642
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,249
Even if she changes her mind
and comes back,

643
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,751
do you think she can call you that easily?

644
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,004
Min, considering everything
that's happened,

645
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,214
should you do your best

646
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,299
in helping me find the killer or not?

647
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,220
Why did you have to come back alive
in that body?

648
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,180
Why couldn't you look like your old self?

649
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,932
You could've said you were alive,

650
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,934
I didn't kill you,
someone else killed you.

651
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,644
This would have exonerated me.

652
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,772
Hey, did I choose this body
to come back alive?

653
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,150
You were the one who saved me.
Don't get mad at me.

654
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,317
Darn it.

655
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,072
So what's your plan?

656
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,617
Look.

657
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,747
There is only one person
who came to this alley

658
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,374
around the estimated time of death.
It's this taxi.

659
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,127
What about your neighbor?

660
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,963
The culprit is always around
the victim even in cartoons.

661
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,592
I don't remember that guy's face,

662
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,636
but what I remember clearly
is that I've never seen him before.

663
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,888
I didn't know the killer.

664
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,308
Yes. I'm sure of it.

665
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,810
And this guy.
This guy went into the alley too.

666
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,146
This old man? I know this old man.

667
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,564
He always keeps a pile of...

668
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,777
Wait a second. Where is his stuff?

669
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,321
Come on. I can't believe this old geezer.

670
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,199
He promised to clean it up
after a fight with me that night.

671
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,701
I even saw him load his stuff
on his wagon that night.

672
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,453
Fine. I'll take them back.

673
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,289
This is my last stop. What's wrong
with leaving my stuff here?

674
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,166
Gosh, what a goodhearted woman you are.

675
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,336
Look at this old geezer.

676
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,964
He pretended to clean it up
and put it right back afterward.

677
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,090
Darn it.

678
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,177
I should just pick a day
and sell everything he keeps there.

679
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,763
A lot of people
must hold a grudge against you.

680
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,599
Still, you are the prime suspect.

681
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,978
This taxi.

682
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,856
I can figure this out
if I can look up the plate number.

683
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,857
With my old body,

684
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,735
this would've been a piece of cake.
I have no one to ask now.

685
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,197
Should I just go back to my office?

686
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:20,170
- I don't have time for this right now.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

687
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,590
- You can't block my way like that.
- Oh, no.

688
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,219
- Thank you.
- No problem.

689
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,554
Are you hurt?

690
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,764
No, I'm fine.

691
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,101
Sir, please watch where you are going.

692
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,648
Then, have a good day.

693
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,943
Okay. That rude wench.
She is so disrespectful.

694
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,737
Seriously.
People from her office can be so...

695
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,534
- I just remembered it.
- Remember what?

696
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,619
This face. I know this face.

697
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,306
You're such a good dancer!

698
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,748
You're doing great!

699
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,478
You're awesome!

700
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,609
You rock!

701
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,447
She's a great singer and a great dancer.

702
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,450
I heard that
she was always the golden girl,

703
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,744
but I didn't know she'd be this perfect.

704
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,579
She's got it all!

705
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,706
Is that even possible?

706
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,334
Hey, I can sing as good as she can.

707
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,798
My voice is prettier than hers, for sure.

708
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,717
Impossible, my ass.

709
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,844
Looks like plain jealousy to me.

710
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,596
They say jealousy is a disease.

711
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:50,487
I think we've both had a lot to drink.
Why don't we go get some fresh air?

712
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,824
I'm good, but you can go on ahead--

713
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,951
I said, "Let's go get some fresh air."

714
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,833
You know,

715
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:06,503
ever since you were on probation,
I didn't like you one bit.

716
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,131
But I kept it to myself.

717
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,257
No, you didn't.

718
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,509
You picked on me for everything.

719
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,722
So let me ask,
what's your problem with me?

720
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,766
Take a look at yourself.

721
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,601
Who would think you're a prosecutor?

722
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,820
I'll give you a word of advice
since I'm quitting.

723
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,280
Rumor has it that

724
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,283
you're using your pretty face
to get a higher conviction rate.

725
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,327
Being good at your job
is not the only thing that is important.

726
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,121
You have to mind the rumors as well--

727
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,415
I'll mind my own rumors.

728
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,500
And you mind your own, Ms. Lee.

729
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,418
Right.

730
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,880
Since you're leaving,
I don't have to be so respectful, do I?

731
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:50,797
What?

732
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:55,093
I heard you're going to Park & Jang.
And for a much higher salary, right?

733
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:59,598
I understand that
this is your last chance to vent on me

734
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,184
before you leave for the law firm,

735
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,021
but I've already had enough
from you until now.

736
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,983
That cow has so much to say.

737
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,194
- That what?
- Hey.

738
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,654
Why don't you shut
that rude ass pie hole of yours

739
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,449
before I give you a good ass-whooping?

740
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,202
What in the world are you saying?

741
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,162
Never mind if you don't understand.

742
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,332
I'm only saying this
because I'm old enough to be your sister.

743
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,375
Mind your manners, all right?

744
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,214
This looks so old-fashioned and pathetic.

745
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,257
Now I look like her.

746
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,176
How much will it be?

747
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,636
I'll just keep them on.

748
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,350
We would've picked you up,
if you'd called in, ma'am.

749
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,310
I'm just here for an urgent matter.

750
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:48,939
- I won't need my office set up--
- We set it up as soon as we got the call.

751
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,359
This way, is it?

752
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,248
This is amazing.

753
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:10,085
It's actually not a bad idea to work here
for the time being.

754
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,421
What's this? Is it real gold?

755
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,589
Cool.

756
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,591
Awesome!

757
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,305
How long will you be staying at the hotel?

758
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,307
The hotel? Well...

759
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:29,062
How long should I stay...

760
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,940
Wouldn't you rather stay
at Golden Palace, ma'am?

761
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,860
We've already packed everything there
because you said

762
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,278
you'd move after coming back.

763
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:40,073
Ms. Lee has a hard time falling asleep
in hotels. Isn't that right, ma'am?

764
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,409
That's correct.

765
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,662
I'm a light sleeper, you know.

766
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,664
All right, ma'am. I'll have it ready.

767
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,666
Thank you.

768
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,629
Hey, how did you come up with that?

769
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,048
Gosh.

770
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,680
<i>The door has been opened.</i>

771
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,599
Great job, Min.

772
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,893
How did you even think of that?

773
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,353
I thought it'd be easier for us
if we stayed here.

774
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,900
Her place is amazing!

775
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:19,029
Maybe I should've quit being a prosecutor
and worked for a law firm, too.

776
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,240
I think we should
take out daily necessities

777
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,492
like the tableware and covers first.

778
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,869
Fine.

779
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,164
You do look like her.

780
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,583
Do I? Let me see!

781
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,297
- What?
- Doesn’t it surprise you, too?

782
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,925
I told you that now
you have a common face.

783
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,509
No, that's not it.

784
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,303
This guy...

785
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,890
Are they dating?

786
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,645
Hey, Detective Choe.

787
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,898
Where's the case file Min-uk brought over?

788
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,942
He said he placed it on your desk.

789
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,193
Where?

790
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,362
Why don't you clear your desk?

791
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,989
You find it, then.

792
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,575
He should've put it properly.

793
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:06,910
Here you go.

794
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,206
<i>It's me, Mi-do. Are you busy? </i>

795
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,041
<i>Can you check a license plate for me?</i>

796
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:16,503
<i>It's 56B7767. Make it quick. Thanks.</i>

797
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,837
This girl...

798
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,339
Why, what's wrong?

799
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,053
Well, Detective Cha...

800
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,222
If...

801
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,808
an ex-girlfriend suddenly texts you...

802
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:35,105
and requests something ridiculous,

803
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,983
what do you think it means?

804
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,944
That she wants to get back together.

805
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,904
Why?

806
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,866
Is it that girl...

807
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,536
who left you to study abroad?

808
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,666
Of course not!

809
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,544
Are you sure?
You're not very good at hiding it.

810
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,172
Don't think about playing hard to get
and just text her back, sir.

811
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,384
Every time you get drunk,
you call her old number.

812
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,720
- I don't get it...
- I did not.

813
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,347
You did. You even cried last time.

814
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,182
I did not.

815
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,144
- Fine. Whatever.
- I did not!

816
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,315
Forget it.

817
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:21,151
I bet she thought I'd take her back

818
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,196
if she texted me like this.

819
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,158
But I'm not that kind of guy.

820
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,827
I'm not that easy, you know.

821
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:31,953
Please...

822
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,917
Please text me back, please...

823
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,172
<i>The owner is "Park Gi-man."</i> <i>His address is</i>
<i>1, 11beon-gil, Bichang-ro, Sapyeong-dong.</i>

824
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,466
<i>By the way, where are you now?</i>

825
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,633
<i>How have you been?</i>

826
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,218
Hey, Min!

827
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,348
It's been so long
since I had a bath like this.

828
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,768
Min! Hey!

829
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,644
- What is it this time?
- Goodness.

830
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,646
Hurry up and come over here!

831
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,191
I haven't had a bath in days!
Just let me finish!

832
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,527
No, I mean,
I got a hold of that bastard's identity!

833
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,862
Come on! Hurry!

834
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,655
Get out while I'm being nice, okay?

835
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,911
I need to rinse it off.

836
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,879
Why won't she text me back?

837
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,966
I was just getting over her,

838
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,178
but she comes back
and messes with my heart again.

839
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,015
What are you doing, sir?

840
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,644
The others are at the barbecue place.
Why don't we go have dinner?

841
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,398
Damn it!

842
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,610
Let's go.

843
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:02,544
This is it.

844
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,713
Wait. I'll do it.

845
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,799
Okay.

846
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,512
Is anyone there?

847
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:15,890
Hello?

848
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,143
Maybe he's not home.

849
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,479
No, wait! I'll go in first and...

850
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,941
That girl...

851
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,301
Take it all in. The pain you're feeling.

852
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,893
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER.
NO, NOT YET.

853
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,853
YOU'RE NEXT.
I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE PAIN.

854
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,067
What's this?

855
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,153
Does anyone even live here?

856
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,505
EOMSAN-DONG SERIAL KILLER

857
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,720
Park Mi-jin's father?

858
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:37,931
Se-yeon, come over here.

859
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:39,474
What?

860
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,877
See?

861
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,130
You shouldn't have looked down on me.

862
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,979
What's all this?

863
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,289
OH YEONG-CHEOL, 52

864
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,082
It doesn't matter...

865
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,126
if you're still alive.

866
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,087
I'll kill you over and over again...

867
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,299
until you die for good.

868
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:17,363
Then he's still been on this case
all this time?

869
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,616
OH YEONG-CHEOL, 52
MAJOR TRAUMA CENTER OF SEOHA HOSPITAL

870
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,619
I guess Park Gi-man is still after him...
Oh Yeong-cheol.

871
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,501
I know this person.

872
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,670
Who? Oh Yeong-cheol?

873
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,214
He's a famous surgeon.

874
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,257
No.

875
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,718
Not like that.

876
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,771
Step on it, Detective Choe.

877
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,189
All right, sir.

878
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:55,068
RECEIVING

879
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,696
<i>Sir, we got the identity of the suspect</i>
<i>for the Eomsan-dong murder case.</i>

880
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,241
<i>Before Prosecutor Go died, she told us</i>
<i>to check on Oh Yeong-cheol's days-off.</i>

881
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,744
<i>They almost match up with the case dates.</i>

882
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,331
<i>We looked into him further,</i>
<i>and that's not the only suspicious thing.</i>

883
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:11,084
<i>We're leaving immediately</i>

884
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,378
<i>so please come directly</i>
<i>with the arrest warrant.</i>

885
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,590
NAME: OH YEONG-CHEOL
ADDRESS: 34, EOMSAN-RO

886
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,772
Are you looking for someone?

887
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,567
The day you were killed...

888
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,362
I met him.

889
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,656
You met Oh Yeong-cheol?

890
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:42,990
Where?

891
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,831
Hey. Are you okay?

892
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,332
Hey.

893
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,255
You haven't left yet?

894
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,382
I don't think this man is breathing!

895
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,512
Who knows? This might be able
to save this guy, too.

896
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,393
Before I revived you...

897
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,313
I revived him with this.

898
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,816
I revived Oh Yeong-cheol.

899
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,079
Are you...

900
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,999
here to meet Yeong-cheol?

901
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,084
Yes, sir.

902
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:36,919
Well...

903
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:40,423
it's been a long time
since someone came to see him.

904
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,342
Why are you standing out here?

905
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,719
Come on inside.

906
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,514
It's all right, sir. I'll come later.

907
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,435
Let me treat you.
I'm sure you've come a long way here.

908
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,061
Come on inside.

909
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:58,232
I'll bring out a drink for you
while you wait.

910
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,860
- I'll be back--
- Come on in.

911
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,779
There you go. Come in.

912
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,825
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

913
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,578
I didn't think Abyss would work.

914
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:14,165
He was bleeding so much
and not breathing that I...

915
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,918
He was dying,
so I could only think about saving him.

916
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,426
Does that mean...

917
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,679
I revived a serial killer...

918
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,849
with this marble?

919
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:35,853
There we go.

920
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,900
Come on in.

921
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,920
I guess you'll finally get...

922
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,715
to meet that daughter of yours
you missed so much.

923
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:43,296
<i>I need to see for myself</i>
<i>the culprit who killed me.</i>

924
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,215
- Mi-do!
- What do I do?

925
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,467
Sweetie, could you do me a favor?

926
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,012
- Let's go, then.
- How disgusting.

927
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:54,223
- Have you found the culprit?
- <i>I think it's the guy you're looking for.</i>

928
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:58,019
<i>He's committed another murder.</i>
<i>And he's even left a trace this time.</i>

929
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,479
<i>Then he's the one who killed you?</i>

930
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,065
- Hee-jin...
<i>- Your fiance?</i>

931
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,860
<i>I need to catch that bastard</i>
<i>who killed Se-yeon</i>

932
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:08,362
<i>to return to my old self</i>
<i>and bring back my fiancée.</i>
