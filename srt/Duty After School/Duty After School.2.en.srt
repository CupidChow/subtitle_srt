1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,379
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:02,720
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,390
- What? - What was that?

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,599
That almost made me jump.

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:16,859
- What was that? - What's that sound?

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,269
- It hurts! - Sorry, Yeon Ju.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Young Hoon.

8
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Young Hoon.

9
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,260
Watch out!

10
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,489
Private Chi Yeol. Are you all right?

11
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,700
Private Chi Yeol.

12
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,319
(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

13
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,849
(Duty After School)

14
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,889
Yes, sir.

15
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,990
Those spheres.

16
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,949
You said that they weren't dangerous.

17
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,740
You clearly said...

18
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,789
that the school was safe and nothing would happen.

19
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:21,500
But...

20
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,379
how did Young Hoon...

21
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,750
We were not able to predict Private Young Hoon's death.

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,090
Young Hoon...

23
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,759
was not a soldier.

24
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,719
He was a student.

25
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,099
What do I do with my students now?

26
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,479
Shouldn't I send them home?

27
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,689
Please keep it a secret for now.

28
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,479
- Excuse me? - To prevent nationwide confusion,

29
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,400
we have orders to keep our mouths shut...

30
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,569
about the spheres.

31
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,159
To minimize the confusion when this becomes known,

32
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,780
- the countermeasures are... - A student has died!

33
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
Such a dangerous thing is at school, and the kids...

34
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
The kids are already under military supervision.

35
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,789
Everything will be handled...

36
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,879
according to military laws.

37
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,220
I'll tell the kids.

38
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,160
Are you all right? Any injuries?

39
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:33,050
It's all good. I'm here for you.

40
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,019
It's not your fault, guys.

41
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,740
It was an accident.

42
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,240
So, don't beat yourself up about it.

43
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,410
Come and talk to me when you're distressed,

44
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,120
and during class...

45
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,160
You know what? You should take a few weeks off.

46
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,250
What do you say?

47
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,720
Sorry.

48
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:19,589
I'm also...

49
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,519
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

50
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,629
Let's tell them...

51
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,420
that Young Hoon got hurt and went home.

52
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,050
Otherwise, it'll stir them up.

53
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,139
I'll...

54
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,810
talk to them about it later.

55
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,639
I hope you'll keep it from the other kids.

56
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,980
Can you do that?

57
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,610
Yes.

58
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
And Chi Yeol?

59
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,670
Hey, Kimchi.

60
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,839
Kimchi!

61
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,180
Hey.

62
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,470
You heard Ms. Park, right?

63
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,350
Don't run your mouth in front of them.

64
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,269
You saw it too.

65
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,980
He started the fight with me.

66
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,779
To be fair, it wasn't even my fault.

67
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,360
Young Hoon just got unlucky.

68
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,699
So, lie low...

69
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,329
unless you want to be an outcast like he was.

70
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,310
(Lee Chun Ho)

71
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,059
Lieutenant Lee.

72
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,690
How did the sphere attack?

73
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,029
Division? You mean that it split into pieces?

74
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,860
Can't you hear me? Lieutenant Lee!

75
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,120
Help!

76
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,330
Help!

77
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,500
Watch out!

78
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,080
Please!

79
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,629
Help!

80
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,179
Come on.

81
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,429
Okay.

82
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,600
- Go! - Seriously.

83
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,490
I heard a thud earlier.

84
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,029
Was there a car accident?

85
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,320
- Crap. - All right.

86
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,659
Hey.

87
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,539
How are you studying in this situation?

88
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,750
You...

89
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,460
Ignore him.

90
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:41,129
Let's play.

91
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:42,710
Here I go.

92
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,879
- It's my turn. - Fine.

93
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:50,970
- Here we go. - Chi Yeol.

94
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,679
Didn't you hear anything outside?

95
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,190
Why are only the two of you back? Where's Young Hoon?

96
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,190
Well...

97
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,360
He...

98
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,950
hurt himself and went home.

99
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,159
He hurt himself? Where?

100
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,750
Just his body.

101
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,169
How did he hurt himself?

102
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,580
He just hurt himself.

103
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:24,250
It must have been pretty bad if he had to go home.

104
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,009
Is he coming back?

105
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,340
I guess not.

106
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,259
He likes to play solo.

107
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,679
No way.

108
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,600
Young Hoon said no to extra points on the CSAT?

109
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,110
- Are you smiling? - No.

110
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,779
Well, I'm glad it's him.

111
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,909
If it was a close friend of mine,

112
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,620
I would have pitied him.

113
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,539
- Am I right? - Right.

114
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,080
Good for you, Young Soo.

115
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,870
You're the top student if Young Hoon isn't here.

116
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:02,250
Are you finally living up to your name?

117
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,039
Studied Korean, Math, and English his whole life,

118
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,210
- Kook Young Soo. - Kook Young Soo.

119
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,049
I'm not happy.

120
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:11,720
You're holding your laughter.

121
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,840
No, I'm not.

122
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,220
- Yes, you are! - Hey!

123
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,179
- You can't hide your smile. - You're so happy.

124
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,519
I'm really not.

125
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,850
Young Soo.

126
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,480
- Why do you study so hard? - What's wrong?

127
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,190
You look seriously anxious.

128
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,769
- A doctor? - A doctor?

129
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,230
Did something happen?

130
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,669
No.

131
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,340
Starting yesterday, all high school students...

132
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,429
have started studying and getting military training.

133
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:57,889
- ID, please. - The authorities are putting...

134
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,139
priority on safety to prevent accidents.

135
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,179
Next up in the news. Last night,

136
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,940
spheres have dropped all over the country, including Seoul.

137
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,649
About 30 spheres seems to have fallen,

138
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,230
- and the damage... - Ms. Park.

139
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,779
has not been announced yet.

140
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,700
- When you come across a sphere, - Ms. Park!

141
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,779
- Yes? - do not approach it or touch it...

142
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,370
- Thank you. - and make sure to alert...

143
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,240
the nearby troops or police force.

144
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,659
Thank you.

145
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,059
(Jang Young Hoon)

146
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,149
So, those loud thuds were the spheres dropping?

147
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,149
The guys in Class Three told me...

148
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:54,899
that the gym was demolished.

149
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,950
That must have been it.

150
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,200
If it destroyed a building,

151
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,909
I bet the impact was huge.

152
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,000
- You scared me! - Come on!

153
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,500
- Sorry. - Shoot.

154
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,129
- That was not funny! - Awesome.

155
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,210
Move! I need to write this.

156
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,590
Idiot.

157
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,639
That was uncool.

158
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,309
Maybe Young Hoon got hurt by one of the spheres.

159
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:22,470
What?

160
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,980
Well, the timing's right.

161
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,100
Right. It is.

162
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,649
- This is so stupid! - Come on!

163
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:32,940
Get away from me.

164
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,490
- Is it reddening? - It is.

165
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,149
- Absolutely. - It's swelling.

166
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,029
Hey!

167
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,490
- Attention. - At ease.

168
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,240
- Did you send the report? - Yes, sir.

169
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,289
You got the reply, right?

170
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,120
- We're working on it. - Gosh.

171
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,419
They never told us that those things were...

172
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,669
capable of attacking us, did they?

173
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Gosh.

174
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,590
So, what do we do now?

175
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,299
The accident last night occurred out of the blue.

176
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,129
The students aren't prepared to...

177
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,889
So, we should train them, shouldn't we?

178
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,759
Get them ready for rifle drills. Okay?

179
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,679
- Yes, sir. - Don't you think it's too soon?

180
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:06,429
Hey!

181
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,980
They could be on the battlefield in no time.

182
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,980
We should at least teach them how to shoot before that.

183
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,269
Get to work now!

184
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,779
You fire a gun at a monkey hanging on a tree.

185
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,830
The scared monkey lets go of the tree and free falls.

186
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,830
Then,

187
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,669
can the bullet hit the monkey?

188
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,460
Anyone?

189
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,419
At least, try and make a guess.

190
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,970
Gosh.

191
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,679
Come on. How many ambulances are there today?

192
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,850
It's so loud.

193
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,009
You're loudest.

194
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,429
Close the windows.

195
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,769
- Come on! It's hot. - It's hot.

196
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:48,980
But it's hot.

197
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,440
Turn on the air-conditioner.

198
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,399
There's another ambulance.

199
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,940
Oh, gosh.

200
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,399
Hey.

201
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,490
- Doesn't it sound like that? - Like what?

202
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,570
"Death or life."

203
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,659
"Death or life..."

204
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,000
The ones by the windows, close them.

205
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,460
- Okay. - Okay.

206
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,799
Vy is...

207
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:24,970
Kids.

208
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,269
Listen carefully.

209
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,440
I said earlier...

210
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,980
that no one could help you with your life.

211
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,940
So,

212
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,320
study hard...

213
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,830
and train hard.

214
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,330
Understood? Do everything hard!

215
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:51,370
- Okay? - Okay.

216
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,789
Go!

217
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,750
- It hurts. - Keep moving!

218
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,509
Focus.

219
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,509
Move quickly.

220
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:05,139
Hold on to your rifle and headgear.

221
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,220
- It hurts! - Don't stop!

222
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,429
Move faster!

223
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:10,470
Get out of there!

224
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,309
- Keep your rifle in your left hand. - What do you think you're doing?

225
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,350
- Move swiftly! - Hey!

226
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,149
- Get out of there! - Come on, move!

227
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,690
To the next one.

228
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,570
- Come on. - Keep moving.

229
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,940
- Faster. - Go.

230
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,950
To the left.

231
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,450
Keep your rifles up!

232
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,779
Hurry it up!

233
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,830
Who's standing still?

234
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,659
- Run! - Let's do this!

235
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,039
All trainees, into your assault fire positions.

236
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,419
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

237
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,419
Prone position in parts. One!

238
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:43,669
- One. - One.

239
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,549
- Two. - Two.

240
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,549
- Three. - Three.

241
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,389
Stand up. Prone position in parts.

242
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:50,559
- One! - One!

243
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,019
- Two. - Louder!

244
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,980
- Quickly. - Do not meet eyes with me.

245
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,230
- Why are you looking at me? - Put your head up.

246
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,610
Aim forward!

247
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,820
Pick up your rifles!

248
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,779
Who has the rifle facing the ground?

249
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,029
- Aim forward. - Look up.

250
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,400
Look up!

251
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,069
This is too hard.

252
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,450
Mom...

253
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,539
I just want to give up and go home.

254
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,500
But if I do,

255
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,170
I can't get the extra points that everyone else gets.

256
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,670
That's what I'm worried about.

257
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,509
All trainees,

258
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:27,549
focus and keep the stone on the barrel...

259
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:28,549
as you pull the trigger.

260
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,349
Relax your body.

261
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,559
Hold your breath.

262
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:32,890
Focus.

263
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,930
Fire.

264
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,849
You can do it. Why do you...

265
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,900
Do you have hand tremors?

266
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Young Soo.

267
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,980
Study the rifle as you study books.

268
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,940
Come on! Darn it.

269
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,859
The platoon commander is watching Hurry.

270
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,160
Fine.

271
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:02,839
Move it.

272
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,089
Stand up.

273
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:08,430
- Next, keep moving. - Get in line.

274
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,140
- Hold your rifles properly. - Get moving.

275
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,180
Left flank, march!

276
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,930
You have to be stupid to take this training seriously.

277
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:19,309
Studying in my spare time is the best for me.

278
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,019
I just hope none of my classmates get hurt.

279
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,440
I don't want this crap!

280
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,279
What is this?

281
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,740
This looks like rice cake.

282
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,359
- This is gross! - I think it's gone bad.

283
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,450
I'm serious. Try it.

284
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,079
Start disassembling your rifles from Group One.

285
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,660
Group One, begin disassembling.

286
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,000
- Begin! - Begin!

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,619
When you've finished disassembling your rifle,

288
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,630
raise your hand and make sure to show me.

289
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,309
Hey, you have to put one on it so that I can start!

290
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:55,470
Sorry.

291
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,430
This is insane.

292
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,859
- Pull the trigger. - What?

293
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:06,980
Pull it.

294
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:12,990
You can't do it even if I put one on it.

295
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,750
I am doing my best, but...

296
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,750
(Class 3-2, No Ae Seol)

297
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,329
But this keeps coming loose.

298
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:26,250
Is yours okay?

299
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,420
- Are you okay? - Wake up!

300
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,589
- Check the patient's breath. - Check the breath!

301
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:30,670
- Checking. - If the patient is not breathing,

302
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,880
apply pressure to the chest.

303
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,890
- Begin! - Begin!

304
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,930
Wake up!

305
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,349
- Keep going. - Come on!

306
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,849
Oh, my legs.

307
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,480
Hey, Kimchi. Drink water.

308
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,690
Okay.

309
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,319
Drink up.

310
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,700
What's the matter?

311
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,200
Hey.

312
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:00,500
Chi Yeol.

313
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,250
What do you mean, "How is it?"

314
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,579
It feels like crap.

315
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,539
Hey.

316
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,549
Find somebody else to interview.

(Class 3-2, Kwon Il Ha)

318
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:17,509
- Guys. - What?

Yu Jung.

320
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,390
Leave them be. I'll let you study by yourself today.

321
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,730
Okay.

322
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,079
There are more students remaining than the ones who left.

323
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,210
(Class 3-2, Cho Young Sin)

324
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,839
It's better to go with the majority in such cases.

325
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,920
This is nice.

326
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,799
But I only wore it for five days. Maybe I shouldn't wash it.

327
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,220
Five days? Give me that.

328
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:01,849
Why would you smell that?

329
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,309
But...

330
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:04,640
he said it's only been five days.

331
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,190
- Come on! - Stop!

332
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,730
You're nasty!

333
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,809
Come on!

334
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,150
During night watch?

335
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:13,029
Chatting with the girls is...

336
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:14,319
pretty nice.

337
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,240
(Class 3-2, Kim Duk Joong)

338
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,029
It'd be so cool to be on watch with Ha Na.

339
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:21,869
Make me look especially prettier.

340
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:24,200
I want to date a British guy too.

341
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,119
- A British guy? - But you don't even speak English.

342
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,250
Those animals are right outside.

343
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,589
We have to dry our underwear here?

344
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,880
Exactly!

345
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,380
- What if they steal it? - That's what I'm saying.

346
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,839
You two are so grouchy.

347
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,180
How are you two so alike?

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,509
She and I?

349
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,180
- That's offensive to me. - No, it's offensive to me.

Keep hanging the laundry.

Is he staring at me?

353
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,480
Pervert!

Those guys are...

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,559
- You guys are crazy! - Perverts.

356
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,400
- What a pervert. - I got goosebumps.

357
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,190
How long have they been standing there?

358

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,569
There's no way.

374
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,200
We will keep trying until you don't drop the stone.

375
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,829
- It's shaking. Hold your breath. - One second.

376
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,329
Private So Yeon.

377
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,000
Pull in your elbows.

378
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:01,130
Relax your left hand.

379
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,009
Hold your breath.

380
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,059
Focus.

381
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,269
Fire.

382
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:27,910
The hardest part?

383
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,869
(Class 3-2, Lee Na Ra)

384
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,079
So far, none.

385
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,250
It's amazing!

386
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,170
Na Ra succeeded!

387
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,089
Yu Jung succeeded too.

388
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:47,849
- I did it! - Yes.

389
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:49,390
- You did well. - Did you see that?

390
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,890
Get into your positions!

391
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:53,309
- Move forward! - Hurry and get out.

392
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,769
You jerks!

393
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,450
I feel alive.

394
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:04,529
- Move faster to the next. - Run!

395
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,450
Move quickly!

396
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Eat more.

397
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,119
Hey, stop.

398
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:11,750
Quickly be back into your positions.

399
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:13,670
- Get into your positions. - Run!

400
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,920
- Run quickly! - Go ahead!

401
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,089
- Ready. - Run!

402
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,210
- Run! - Pull yourself together!

403
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,759
- Let's do this! - Assume the prone position!

404
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,970
- Basic movement, one! - One!

405
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,839
- Two! - Two!

406
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,509
- Three! - Three!

407
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,119
Anyhow,

408
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,619
I don't feel safe.

409
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:53,460
I really didn't tell anyone!

410
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:00,380
Look.

411
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:02,630
I said you're dangerous.

412
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,720
I seriously won't tell anyone. Okay?

413
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,720
- I won't tell even if I die. - Is that so?

414
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,140
I'll see.

415
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,269
If you won't tell after you die.

416
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,559
What?

417
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,250
Don't do this!

418
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:36,210
- You punk! - Oh, gosh!

419
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,329
Come here.

420
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,599
Darn it. Where did he go?

421
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,230
Darn it.

422
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,259
For goodness' sake.

423
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,759
Please.

424
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,009
(Jang Young Hoon)

425
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,650
Kim Chi Yeol.

426
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,410
Where are you going?

427
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,619
I'm going to the bathroom.

428
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,579
Make it fast.

429
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,240
Na Ra.

430
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:05,789
What are you doing here?

431
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,210
I can't sleep after being on a night watch.

432
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,049
How about you?

433
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,920
Well, I...

434
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,930
just woke up for no reason.

435
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,390
(Goodbye, friends.)

436
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,269
I think they're the names of the people who went out.

437
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,230
(3-2: Baek Su Young, Cha Seung Ho, Jang Young Hoon)

438
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,480
If I had known this would happen,

439
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,690
I would have gotten closer to them.

440
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,779
Is Young Hoon hurt a lot?

441
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:38,869
What?

442
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,450
No.

443
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,289
Just...

444
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
a little bit.

445
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,180
(Jang Young Hoon, give "birth" soon.)

446
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,470
That letter means to give birth.

447
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,470
Yes? What did you say?

448
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,599
Never mind.

449
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,059
You lived in England, right?

450
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,150
Yes, why?

451
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:13,190
Just asking.

452
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,200
Chi Yeol,

453
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,240
were you close with Young Hoon?

454
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,910
We were born and raised in the same village.

455
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,039
Then you must've been close with him.

456
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:36,339
Yes.

457
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,140
I'll go first.

458
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,119
(Jang Young Hoon, get well soon.)

459
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:13,789
(Jang Young Hoon, get well soon.)

460
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,500
I'll give you a minute to disassemble and assemble the gun.

461
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,869
- What? - Sorry?

462
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:51,410
If you can't get it done in a minute,

463
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,789
you'll get a penalty.

464
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:54,960
- What? - A penalty?

465
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:01,089
Who whined?

466
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,799
Come out.

467
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,099
Group One, disassemble and assemble the gun.

468
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,769
Start.

469
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:11,849
- Start! - Start!

470
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,150
So Yeon, does he still look cool to you?

471
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:19,650
So Yeon?

472
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:22,819
Yes, whatever he does is so cool.

473
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:23,990
- Disassemble complete. - Disassemble complete.

474
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,119
- Disassemble complete. - Cool?

475
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,240
- Who? - What's next?

476
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,829
- Is it me? - Disassemble complete.

477
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,240
Shut it, squid.

478
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:30,869
"Squid?"

479
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:32,369
(The disassembly and assembly of guns)

480
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,710
- Completed. - Oh, gosh.

481
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,170
Completed.

482
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:40,630
- Completed! - Completed!

483
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,259
Completed!

484
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,839
Next is Group Two.

485
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,509
- Completed. - Completed!

486
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,720
Completed.

487
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,890
- Completed. - Completed!

488
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,430
Group Three, move forward.

489
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,519
This!

490
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,690
- Completed. - Completed!

491
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,690
Completed.

492
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,569
- Impressive. - Nice.

493
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,369
Completed. Gosh!

494
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Start.

495
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:14,539
Completed.

496
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,750
Completed.

497
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,339
- Nice. - She's fast.

498
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,759
Completed.

499
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,299
Completed!

500
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:26,890
- Nice work. - Yes.

501
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,319
Stop.

502
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,150
One minute passed.

503
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,450
Assemble the rifle again.

504
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:53,490
Private Ae Seol.

505
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,119
Assemble the rifle again.

506
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,289
- Yes. - Hey.

507
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:04,509
She's lost.

508
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:11,969
Again.

509
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,429
Why can't she do this?

510
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,230
- Again. - Gosh.

511
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,389
Again.

512
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,269
- She just took it off now? - Again.

513
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,769
- How long do we need to wait? - She's doing her best.

514
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,320
My butt hurts.

515
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,900
- How many times is she trying? - Again.

516
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,360
- Oh, gosh. - I'm hungry.

517
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,320
- Gosh. - She's taking it off.

518
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,199
- Again. - What? Come on.

519
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,000
- For goodness' sake! - Again?

520
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:41,710
(Sungjin High School)

521
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,210
- Oh, my gosh. - Ae Seol, make it quick.

522
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,750
- I'm so tired. - Do it well!

523
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,630
- Please. - When is this ending?

524
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,340
- I'm starving. - Oh, gosh.

525
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,340
I'm so tired.

526
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,510
Seriously.

527
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,929
I'm about to die of hunger.

528
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,269
Same here.

529
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,980
Hey, can you hear me?

530
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,030
Group Two, attention.

531
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:13,530
Attention!

532
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,420
There are no individuals or me on the training ground.

533
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,170
There's only us.

534
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,590
But...

535
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,090
you criticize your friends' mistakes...

536
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,260
and jeer at them.

537
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,889
If this was a real situation,

538
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:38,389
you guys would all be dead already.

539
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:40,980
Therefore,

540
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,860
until the last person succeeds,

541
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,190
you will not be getting any dinner tonight.

542
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,280
- Gosh. - What?

543
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,030
- That's not fair. - We're starving.

544
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,360
- Seriously. - I'm starving too.

545
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,030
Come on, that's not fair.

546
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,909
- What is this? - This is so annoying.

547
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,489
Private No Ae Seol.

548
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:02,960
Begin.

549
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,269
We're eating such great food thanks to somebody.

550
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:27,980
I know. This food is totally awesome.

551
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:33,570
Hey.

552
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:35,820
Hey.

553
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:39,369
You know we're eating this garbage because of you, right?

554
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,289
Sorry.

555
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:43,750
Do you think saying sorry is enough?

556
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:46,880
Sorry.

557
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,210
Hey!

558
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,550
Stop it. Ae Seol is eating.

559
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,590
Hey. This isn't the first time, you know.

560
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:58,849
If it was, I wouldn't even be complaining.

561
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,769
If you have something to say, say it after we're done eating.

562
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,730
Who are you? Her boyfriend or something?

563
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,230
If I'm her boyfriend, can I say that kind of stuff?

564
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,820
Then I'll be her boyfriend.

565
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,110
- Is that punk crazy? - What?

566
00:37:16,449 --> 00:37:17,530
He must be crazy.

567
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,909
Are they going out?

568
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:21,539
Are they actually dating?

569
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:23,000
You're making me lose my appetite.

570
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,619
Eat up.

571
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,039
Hey. Big news.

572
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,880
What's this?

573
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,920
I'm upset by this reaction.

574
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,050
Just eat.

575
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,599
Okay. I won't tell you.

576
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:43,889
Big news.

577
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,559
What is it?

578
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,190
Now that's the kind of reaction I was looking for.

579
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,110
Tomorrow,

580
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,019
we're shooting real bullets.

581
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,780
I know that too.

582
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,360
What?

583
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,909
- We all know, man. - How?

584
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:02,539
It says so on the training schedule in the front of the classroom.

585
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,460
How smart you are.

586
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,170
You're awesome!

587
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,610
I've checked the route to the shooting range.

588
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,070
- Good work, Won Bin. - Thank you, sir.

589
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,489
Bring the weapons too.

590
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,699
Those too?

591
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,659
I heard they were still being tested.

592
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,329
We never know what might happen.

593
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,579
Watch over them carefully so there aren't any accidents.

594
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,170
Yes, sir.

595
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,880
But...

596
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,920
they're quite pretty when you look at them like this.

597
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,550
The spheres, I mean.

598
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,309
- You're not getting it right. - One...

599
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:10,519
Hey, stop playing around.

600
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,940
- Gosh, seriously? - Gosh.

601
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,400
- My gosh. - This is annoying.

602
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,480
- There you go. - Are you doing my whole face?

603
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,690
I'm here.

604
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,570
You're late. Hurry up.

605
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,409
- Ms. Park. - Hey. Yes?

606
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:22,869
Ms. Park, are you coming...

607
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:24,409
- to the shooting range with us? - Class 2, total 22, no absentees.

608
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:25,739
- Of course, I'm coming with you. - All clear.

609
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,119
- Don't worry. - Yes!

610
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:30,460
Just focus on your training. Let me see. Do you have everything?

611
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,039
Platoon Two, status check is complete.

612
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,420
- I know, right? - We're shooting real bullets today.

613
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,800
Oh, gosh.

614
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,590
Hey, just stay still.

615
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,300
- That's not it. - Stop playing around.

616
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,469
We're all set.

617
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:48,769
- Oh, come on. - Be quiet, guys.

618
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:50,019
Platoon Two, attention.

619
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:51,480
- Attention! - Attention!

620
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,019
Follow along so we don't lose anyone on our way to the shooting range.

621
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,110
Got it?

622
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,730
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

623
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,320
Platoon Two. March.

624
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,070
- March! - March!

625
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,130
- Stop that. - What are you doing?

626
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,760
Hey, look.

627
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,429
Hey, you scared me.

628
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:23,630
You get scared too easily.

629
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,679
Oh, darn it!

630
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,760
What's this? Why are the streets empty?

631
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,230
I know, right? All the shops are closed too.

632
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,230
People might think the world has come to an end.

633
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,809
Oh, gosh.

634
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,150
Where is everyone?

635
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,690
- It feels eery. - Everyone is gone.

636
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,409
There were fire trucks yesterday, but I can't even hear those today.

637
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:50,159
Isn't that right?

638
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,039
- Do you need to go poop? - Darn it.

639
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,670
Why are you asking him when you're the one who wants to poop?

640
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,789
Hey, Kim Duk Joong.

641
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,840
- Darn it. - Platoon Two.

642
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,130
Remain silent as we move to the shooting range.

643
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,300
Silent! No talking!

644
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:15,440
This is no fun.

645
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,269
- Hey, get a move on. - Okay.

646
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,380
- One. - One!

647
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,170
Two.

648
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,010
- One. - Down! Shoot!

649
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,050
- Two. - Down. Shoot.

650
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,349
- One. - Look straight ahead.

651
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,519
- Stand up. Shoot! - Salute.

652
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,269
- Were things okay on your way here? - Stand up. Shoot.

653
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,059
Class 3-2. Line up in front of your platoon sergeant!

654
00:41:58,059 --> 00:41:59,360
- Line up. - Line up.

655
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,360
- No. - We're here!

656
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,690
Who are those guys?

657
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,940
I don't know.

658
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,820
No talking!

659
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,079
Line up!

660
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,500
- Get up. - Get up.

661
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,289
Oh, my gosh!

662
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,539
(Class 3-2, Im Woo Taek)

663
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,960
The sound of gunshots is...

664
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,800
so freaking loud.

665
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,260
I nearly pooped my pants, let alone wet myself.

666
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,179
Earlier, Duk Joong seriously pooped his pants.

667
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:33,849
(Class 3-2, Kim Duk Joong)

668
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:35,469
The poop won't stop coming out.

669
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,650
Starting with those who are ready,

670
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,860
commence zeroing fire.

671
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,949
- Commence fire. - Commence fire.

672
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,250
One.

673
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,159
- One. - One.

674
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,619
One!

675
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,039
One!

676
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,420
- One! - One.

677
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,170
- One. - One.

678
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:09,590
- One. - One.

679
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,719
I just thought...

680
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,550
that it would be scary if a war broke out.

681
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:13,760
I just thought...

682
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,769
that I wanted to go home.

683
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:16,969
But...

684
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,929
isn't Kwon Il Ha acting a bit weird these days?

685
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,150
Even when we're smoking, he keeps spacing out on his own.

686
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,059
(Class 3-2, Yeon Bo Ra)

687
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,610
I mean, he has always been a weirdo.

688
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:31,159
Don't tell Il Ha.

689
00:43:33,659 --> 00:43:34,909
Clear on the left.

690
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,369
Clear on the right.

691
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,699
All clear.

692
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,909
Shooters, check your target.

693
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,710
- Check targets. - Check targets.

694
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,929
Kim Chi Yeol.

695
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,429
- Kim Chi Yeol. - What?

696
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,269
Are you okay?

697
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,480
Why is your face so red?

698
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,150
My face?

699
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,780
Where?

700
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:17,989
Right here.

701
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:22,000
Are you okay? It looks like a bruise.

702
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,710
Oh, this? It must be that.

703
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,219
When I was getting ready to shoot,

704
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,760
I was trying to set my sight,

705
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,340
so I put it right up against my nose.

706
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,559
But then, because of the recoil...

707
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:42,059
You should be careful too. The recoil is no joke.

708
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:46,190
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

709
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,360
- Kim Chi Yeol. - What... Yes?

710
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,780
Aren't you going to check your target? Run!

711
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,119
- What were you doing? Dating? - Sorry, sir!

712
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:01,869
- Hey, you did well. - Gosh.

713
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:03,539
Hey, you...

714
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,119
- You just kept shooting. - When did I do that?

715
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,500
- Hey, I saw everything. - Your face was hilarious.

716
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,500
When did I do that?

717
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,630
Platoon Two, attention.

718
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,170
- Attention. - Attention.

719
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,340
Private number three.

720
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,300
Private number three, Kim Duk Joong.

721
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,550
I gave you three shots.

722
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:21,429
Why is there only one hole?

723
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:26,809
With my amazing shooting skills, all three rounds hit the bulls-eye.

724
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,190
- No way, really? - Come on.

725
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,320
- Awesome. - Unbelievable.

726
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,320
That's amazing.

727
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,610
- Get down. - Get down?

728
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:37,659
Who's poking holes right now?

729
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:42,199
Private number 12, Wang Tae Man.

730
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,710
Wang Tae Man. Get down.

731
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:46,579
Get down.

732
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,500
That little punk.

733
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,460
- Are you joking? - How badly did he do?

734
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,170
- Private number eight. - Yes, sir.

735
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,340
Private number eight, Do Soo Chul.

736
00:45:56,969 --> 00:45:58,340
Why do you have eight holes?

737
00:45:58,679 --> 00:45:59,849
Is this the solar system?

738
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:01,849
Private number eight and the shooters next to him,

739
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:04,019
all of you get down.

740
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,940
- Sorry, sir! - Sorry, sir!

741
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,820
Private number four.

742
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,739
Private number four, Kim Yu Jung.

743
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:19,530
This is your target paper.

744
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,329
Gosh, she's terrible.

745
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:23,119
- What is that? - What a joke.

746
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,829
- That's so bad. - Where would you use those skills?

747
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,000
My hand.

748
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,710
- Be quiet. - You did fine.

749
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,920
She actually did well here.

750
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,300
- What? - But why?

751
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,550
She might've missed the mark,

752
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,429
but all three shots are clustered together to form a shot group.

753
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,769
In this case, if you adjust the sight slightly,

754
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:48,139
you will be able to hit the mark.

755
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,019
- Go, class president. - Class president.

756
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:53,070
- That's impressive. - Nice one.

757
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,360
There's one person who did a really good job.

758
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,780
Private number 15.

759
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,159
Private number 15, Lee Na Ra.

760
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,199
This is perfect.

761
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,500
All three shots were in the center.

762
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,260
Now, re-adjust accordingly...

763
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:18,719
and fire again.

764
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,510
- For goodness' sake. - I don't want to.

765
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,800
You're going to get bad results again.

766
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,429
People who shoot well this time will gain extra points.

767
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:28,559
So focus and fire. All right?

768
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,139
How many extra points?

769
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,059
Three points.

770
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:35,110
- Three? - Three points?

771
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,570
Hurry.

772
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,650
- Get ready. - Let's go.

773
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,320
Let's go.

774
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,079
One shot!

775
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,170
(Class 2-3, Private Yeon Ju)

776
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,920
(Class 1-5, Private Na Ra)

777
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:01,050
One shot.

778
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,389
Two shots.

779
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:06,059
Three shots.

780
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,099
Oh, my gosh.

781
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:10,429
For goodness' sake.

782
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,019
You still weren't able to make it.

783
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:14,940
- In the middle? Where? - Just fire.

784
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,650
Dinosaur chicken, spring onion chicken.

785
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:17,780
- I like them all. - For goodness' sake!

786
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,280
Why?

787
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,280
- We were saying... - I'm tired.

788
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,570
I can't hear anything.

789
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:23,780
Let's be quiet.

790
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,159
- But I still got three points. - Oh, my.

791
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:28,329
- I hope we can get more points. - Or...

792
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:30,539
- For goodness' sake. - I gave up already.

793
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,789
- Let's go here. - Give up?

794
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,829
You just couldn't make it.

795
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:34,920
I can't.

796
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,170
Stop! Walk straight.

797
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:38,250
For goodness' sake.

798
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,380
(We don't sell alcoholic beverages to minors under the age of 18.)

799
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:45,510
- Platoon Two, halt! - Halt!

800
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:50,019
Take a ten-minute break at your positions.

801
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:52,849
Take a ten-minute break.

802
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,019
Let's take a break here.

803
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,769
- Have a rest. - Yes.

804
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,820
Sit down.

805
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,530
Don't go far away.

806
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:07,489
It's the same thing we saw just now.

807
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,659
- Adjusting. - Why is it here?

808
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:12,329
- Soon Yi, keep it. - What?

809
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,119
- Keep it. - Should I?

810
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,710
- Yes. - Okay.

811
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:18,920
Is everything okay?

812
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,969
- Hey. - What?

813
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:28,550
Don't you want to drink something cool?

814
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:31,639
Yes, definitely. I want something sweet too.

815
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,679
- Right? - Yes.

816
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:34,599
Do you want to go to the convenience store there?

817
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,360
Okay.

818
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:57,960
I'll go check the front just in case.

819
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,960
Yes.

820
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,880
Wait while making sure they don't cause any issues.

821
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,210
Yes, sir.

822
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:03,590
Check for live ammunition.

823
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:12,889
Live ammunition?

824
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,230
- Check that side. - Okay.

825
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,000
Excuse me.

826
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:37,619
Hello?

827
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,750
What?

828
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,260
Is there no one here?

829
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,179
The door is unlocked.

830
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:58,059
Why are the things all scattered?

831
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,400
I'm starving.

832
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:08,150
You're so fast.

833
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,329
- There's gum! - Gum?

834
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:19,119
They serve bad food. I'll have to bring everything here.

835
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,460
Gum.

836
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,250
No way. Cigarettes!

837
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,719
Nice work.

838
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,840
- Oh, my gosh. - This one.

839
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,599
Hey, there's money too.

840
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,699
Right? This is bad, right?

841
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,039
- Okay. - Okay.

842
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:01,829
Gum.

843
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,630
Yeon Ju, you'll get better.

844
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,750
- Yes. You'll improve. - You'll be good.

845
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,840
Gosh, I'm hungry.

846
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,010
Me too. Ms. Park, we're hungry.

847
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,929
I think we'll eat after we go back.

848
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,219
- Where are Tae Man and Hee Rak? - Yes?

849
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,809
Wait.

850
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:20,309
Yu Jung, have you seen Tae Man and Hee Rak?

851
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:24,400
They were here just now.

852
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:25,809
Where did they go?

853
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,190
Oh, gosh. These boys.

854
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,320
- Platoon sergeant. - Yes?

855
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,579
Two of the boys are missing. Tae Man and Hee Rak.

856
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:39,449
What? Since when?

857
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,539
They were here just now.

858
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:43,369
Corporal Park.

859
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,380
Two boys broke away.

860
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,960
Check that side. I'll check this side.

861
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,969
Yes.

862
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,800
Don't move and stay here with the students.

863
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,889
All right.

864
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,809
These boys aren't scared at all.

865
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,650
Have you seen Tae Man and Hee Rak?

866
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,769
- No. - No, I haven't seen them.

867
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:10,190
- You didn't see them, right? - No one was with them?

868
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,530
Hey, are we going to be punished because of them?

869
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,570
- No way. - Don't say something terrible!

870
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,070
I'll kill them both.

871
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:17,780
It's annoying.

872
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,030
Ms. Park. I...

873
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:25,420
I heard them say something about a convenience store.

874
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:26,630
- What? - What?

875
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,289
- Convenience store? - They went to a convenience store?

876
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,880
- For goodness' sake. - Gosh.

877
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,010
- What are they thinking? - Where's the convenience store?

878
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,550
- Why are they like that? - I don't know.

879
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,090
Yu Jung, let's go find them.

880
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:41,280
Gosh, who put their weapon like this?

881
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,949
They should be punished. For goodness' sake.

882
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:52,710
Isn't she Yu Jung?

883
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:55,550
Where are you going?

884
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,050
- What's wrong with her? - What's going on?

885
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,380
- It's Yu Jung, right? - Let's follow her.

886
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,219
Didn't this fall last time?

887
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:07,269
Why is there nothing?

888
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,980
Gosh.

889
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,980
What's wrong?

890
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:21,159
- What? - What is it?

891
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:22,449
- Oh, gosh. - What is it?

892
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:23,829
- What's that! - Gosh!

893
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:26,909
- What's that! - Gosh!

894
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:29,579
- Oh, my! - It's someone's hand!

895
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,829
Why is it here?

896
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,920
Is it real?

897
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,710
- Gosh. What's going on? - What happened?

898
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,050
Is this real?

899
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,260
- Are you okay? - Look at the nails.

900
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,010
Why did this happen?

901
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:43,469
- What is this? - I feel sick.

902
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,059
- What is it? - I want to throw up.

903
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,889
Is it real?

904
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,480
I want to go home.

905
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:54,019
Ms. Park!

906
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,239
Don't go. I feel bad about this.

907
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,449
No, Chi Yeol. I'll go and check.

908
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,320
Stay here. Okay?

909
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,210
Ms. Park.

910
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,119
Ms. Eun Young!

911
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,539
Don't go. What if it's the spheres?

912
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,670
Young Hoon died because of the spheres too!

913
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,920
- What? - Young Hoon died? Why?

914
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,340
- That idiot. - I thought he left.

915
00:56:22,469 --> 00:56:23,889
- What is he talking about? - No way.

916
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:25,889
Il Ha, what is he talking about?

917
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:27,719
- Do you know something? - What's all this, Il Ha?

918
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,980
- What are they talking about? - I don't know too!

919
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,570
Everyone, run!

920
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,449
Oh, my gosh.

921
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,030
No.

922
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:31,449
No.

923
