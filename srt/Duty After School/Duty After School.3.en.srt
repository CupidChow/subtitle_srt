Gunshots.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,399
- Those are gunshots, right? - Yes.

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,949
Seems like it. Did something happen?

6
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,449
Let's head outside.

7
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:30,539
We'll know then.

8
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,009
Hey.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,429
Cho Jang Soo.

10
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:46,929
What are you doing?

11
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:49,969
What? No.

12
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,890
- Don't do it. - Wait.

13
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,350
Hey!

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,979
You idiot!

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,399
Hey.

16
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:04,859
That scared me!

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,739
What is that thing?

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,870
I don't know.

19
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,129
- I'm not going. - Come on. Hurry up.

20
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,390
No. I don't want to.

21
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,349
Darn it. Get moving. The exit is over here.

22
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,719
No, I'm not going.

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,390
Follow me.

24
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,189
- Darn it. - Don't go.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,019
Seriously.

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,489

28
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,379
Here I go.

29

Hey. What the heck are you thinking, you idiot?

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,430
Let go of me, punk.

31
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,060
Seriously?

32
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,530
Hey. Try it with your finger.

33
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,490
- My finger? - Yes.

34

35

- It does? - Again.

37
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,610
- Hey. What the heck? - Help me!

38
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:05,979
Get off!

39
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,439
- Get it outside! - Hey!

40
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:23,919
What is that?

41
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,509
Get up. Hurry.

42
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,849
- What? - This way.

43
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,520

44
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,189

45
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,069

- Get up. - Darn it!

52
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,090
What was that?

53
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,350
I don't know.

54
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,180
- What the heck? - Let's run.

55
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,439
What do I do?

56
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,689

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,939

Take this, you jerk.

59

60
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,629
Nice.

61
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,269
- Hey. - What?

62
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,389
- Let's go. - Okay.

63
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,189

64
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,610

Hey, hurry up.

68
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,279
No.

69
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,899
- No. - Please help us.

74
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,019

75

76

78
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,069
Go get it.

79
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,660
- Hurry up and shoot the sphere! - I'm scared.

80
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,160
- Hurry up. - The gun won't work.

81
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
What are you saying?

82
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,160
- Why won't you shoot? - The gun won't work, you idiot!

83
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,920
You were trained to shoot.

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,379
It won't work, okay?

85

- Woo Taek! - Darn it, the gun won't work!

86
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,129
Just shoot at it!

87
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,800
Hurry up, Woo Taek!

88
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,360

99
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,870
I've contacted the nearby unit to recover the bodies.

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,169
Did you give them bullets?

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,299
Yes. Three each.

102
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,940
What you saw today...

103
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,779
are the divisions of the sphere that fell from that sky.

104
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,779
Those separated smaller spheres...

105
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,240
attack people...

106
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,000
and devour them.

109
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,710

110

- Yes. - Yes.

118

133
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:43,850
- Be quick. - Hit harder.

135
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:48,230

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,279

The official investigation ends today. Well done.

147
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,100
What will...

148
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:09,149
happen now?

149
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,149
You will either be transferred to another unit...

150
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,360

It's a state of war, as serious as a DEFCON Level One.

153
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,029
A mobilization order will be issued.

154
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,830
Reserve forces and even civilians will be drafted.

155
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,539
There's a chance even high school seniors will be drafted.

156
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,340
Even students?

157
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,970
One sphere destroyed an entire division of the army.

158
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,590
Imagine all of them up there dropping down.

159
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,720
The number we have now will be nowhere enough then.

160
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,179
But they are still students.

161
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,179
- Will they accept the situation? - We will make them accept it.

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,190
There's...

163
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,480

164
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,899
We can never hold the CSAT.

You know that better than anyone, sir.

166
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,620
They will all die in vain.

167
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,159
They will die even if they don't do anything.

168
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,500
At least give them guns.

169
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,330
I am not trying to kill them.

170
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,169

00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,089
I didn't intentionally not open the car door.

191
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,849
I was scared.

192
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,730
Never mind. I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

193
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,349
I am sorry, Bo Ra.

194
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:40,980
I am going home.

195
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,650
I can't stay here any longer.

196
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,569
So Yeon.

197
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,200
I am going home too.

198
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,029
Darn it. In the end, they just want us to fight that thing.

199
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,579
- Darn it. - Right. I'm going home too.

200
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,950
Will you stop acting like a child?

201
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,539
I don't care about college or getting extra points for CSAT.

202
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,630
Will you think before you act?

203
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,339
Don't just pack up your bag right away.

204
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,920
Never mind. I am going too.

205
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,509
- I'm going too. - Don't go.

206
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,049
Hey. Don't do this.

207
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,849
I'm going home.

208
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:15,930
Sit.

209
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,809
Screw that.

210
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,059
Sit!

211
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,369
Take a seat first.

212
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,509
It's dangerous outside.

213
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:53,099
School is the safest place for now.

214
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,970
Safe?

215
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,019
Our homeroom teacher died.

216
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,269
And we heard Young Hoon died too.

217
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,269
And you call that safe?

218
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:04,400
Being protected by someone else doesn't mean you will be safe.

219
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:07,029
You have to protect yourself.

220
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,779
And school is training you to do that.

221
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,410
But you saw us. We can't even shoot a gun.

222
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,569
So how can we...

223
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,039
How can we protect ourselves?

224
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,619
Just send us home.

225
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:20,329
We will stay put at home.

226
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,329
Then we will be all right, right?

227
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,630
Please send us home.

228
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,089
I want to go home.

229
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,799
Right.

230
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,680
Let's say you went home.

231
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,430
What if the spheres attack your home?

232
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,019
What will you do then?

233
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:44,269
(Lee Soon Yi)

234
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:54,029
The night training will be held as scheduled.

235
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,740
- What? - What?

236
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:57,990
Better get ready for it.

237
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,119
- Gosh. - Gosh.

238
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,750
Darn it.

239
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,549
Despite what the platoon commander said,

240
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,259
some of you must still want to go home.

241
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,019
I think we should either all go together...

242
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:23,599
or...

243
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:26,980
all stay together.

244
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,480
I think nothing will come of it if we don't come to an agreement.

245
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:33,900
You all saw it.

246
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,819
Platoon commander is right.

247
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,410
If we go outside like this, we will fall prey to the spheres.

248
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,369
I'd rather stay here than die miserably outside.

249
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:46,329
Darn it. What difference does it make if we stay here though?

250
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:47,789
Let's just go!

251
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,289
Did you hear what he said?

252
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:51,130
We have to act as a team.

253
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,799
If you think about it,

254
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,839
all of this happened because you didn't act as a team, you know.

255
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,299
Darn it.

256
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,549
What did you just babble about, Bo Ra?

257
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,849
You want me to babble about some more?

258
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,430
Is it time to quarrel?

259
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,809
What then? What do you suggest we do?

260
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,230
What do you want me to do?

261
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,440
Right. It was our fault.

262
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,319
Hee Rak,

263
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,529
it was our fault, you know. Right?

264
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:16,990
Let go, you idiot.

265
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,420
Guys.

266
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,089
I am sorry.

267
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,970
So you are saying...

268
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:38,930
it's better to stay here together?

269
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,140
Let's not get too extreme.

270
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,809
Let's hear what everyone has to say.

271
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,180
Hear what everyone has to say? What for?

272
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,349
Just take a vote.

273
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:47,390
Whether we will go...

274
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,609
or stay.

275
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:54,819
All right. Let's decide by show of hands.

276
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,819
Who thinks we should go home?

277
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,910
You darn idiots.

278
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,660
- Won't you raise your hands? - Kimchi.

279
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,470
Darn it.

280
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,140
- Il Ha! - You selfish jerk.

281
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,430
Raise your hand.

282
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,019
I said raise your hand!

283
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,480
- Stop it, Il Ha. - Say what?

284
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,769
Everyone has their own opinion and story.

285
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:34,319
What story? The extra points?

286
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,240
Even if your homeroom teacher and your classmate died,

287
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,400
you are happy as long as you get the extra points for CSAT?

288
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,069
How about you then?

289
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,869
Why didn't you say anything when you knew about Young Hoon?

290
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,579
If you told us, things would have changed.

291
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
He was an outcast, and we never cared about him anyway.

292
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Or did you care?

293
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,509
You must've been happy.

294
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,339
Your ranking will go up once he's gone.

295
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,259
Darn it!

296
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,599
We gathered to have a discussion,

297
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:10,480
not to fight.

298
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,650
So what is your brilliant idea?

299
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,190
Should we all die here?

300
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,359
Darn it!

301
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,700
Hey.

302
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,990
We are not real soldiers, are we?

303
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,029
I am going home.

304
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,119
If you want to stay, stay all you want.

305
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,329
That's why we should discuss it and come to an agreement.

306
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,170
I don't know about other things.

307
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,630
I just can't stand her. Send her away.

308
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,299
Why are you blaming Ae Seol?

309
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,180
We won't die because of the spheres. We will die because of her.

310
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,180
That's why we should send her away.

311
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,799
We have to come together.

312
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,720
Why do you keep trying to fight?

313
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,640
You all saw it.

314
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,390
After all we've been through, nobody asked...

315
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,559
if we are all right...

316
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,650
and how tough it must have been.

317
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:00,319
Did anyone ask that?

318
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,200
That's who we always have been.

319
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,869
When it comes to CSAT,

320
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,779
we can't say anything.

321
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,119
Right.

322
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,500
They know that CSAT is our weak spot.

323
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,170
Right.

324
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:19,799
Let's stop getting fooled by what the adults say.

325
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,180
Right.

326
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,980
Let's take a vote again by show of hands.

327
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:41,690
Who thinks we should go home?

328
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Guys...

329
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Yes?

330
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,349
Something terrible has happened,

331
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,930
but what if nothing happens after this?

332
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,349
We'll be the only ones who don't get additional points.

333
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,730
If so, I'll be at a huge disadvantage...

334
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,650
- Hey! - Kwon Il Ha!

335
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,650
You can wait a million years, but the CSAT won't happen for you.

336
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,990
Raise your hand.

337
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,859
Raise your hand, you piece of crap!

338
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,740
- Stop that. - You jerk!

339
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,539
- Let go of me. Get back here! - Stop it.

340
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:34,079
- Stop that. - Let go of me!

341
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,339
Young Soo.

342
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:48,339
I'm begging you.

343
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,849
I can't stay here anymore.

344
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,849
I'm...

345
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,349
I'm too scared.

346
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:58,559
Let me go to my mom, Young Soo.

347
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,359
Please!

348
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,380
(Operation Sphere Removal)

349
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:31,180
(Concentrated in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province)

350
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,220
(Sungjin High School 2nd Semester)

351
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,309
(November 18: Day of CSAT)

352
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,789
The whole class agreed on this.

353
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,670
(Petition)

354
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,039
We all want to go home.

355
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,890
It was just one.

356
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:21,559
Just one sphere killed hundreds of soldiers.

357
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,690
The area is now crawling with spheres,

358
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,690
so how do you expect to go home?

359
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,569
Even if you do go home,

360
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,079
- your parents won't be there. - What?

361
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:40,869
A nationwide evacuation order has been issued.

362
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:44,130
They will have arrived at the shelter by now.

363
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,920
That's crazy. Are you sure?

364
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,930
You're lying, aren't you?

365
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,720
Can't you take us to the shelter as well?

366
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,390
You are current soldiers of the military,

367
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,309
and we are at war.

368
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,400
You may not leave as you please.

369
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,029
So don't get any ideas...

370
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,609
and prepare for training.

371
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:23,039
Are you kidding me?

372
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,380
Seriously?

373
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:51,859
Are you okay?

374
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,029
Shut it.

375
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,240
What?

376
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,789
What are you looking at?

377
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,579
I'm worried, that's all.

378
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,079
So what if you are, you prick?

379
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:12,710
Young Hoon's death...

380
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,799
- isn't on you, so... - Hey.

381
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,680
Run your mouth again,

382
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,509
and I'll kill you myself.

383
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,569
Pick up the pace!

384
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,440
Faster!

385
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,609
Run faster.

386
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,990
You'll be as good as dead if you run like this.

387
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:43,950
Run!

388
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,539
Run if you wish to survive.

389
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,539
Run!

390
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,210
Get moving, Private.

391
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,049
Run.

392
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,380
Keep guns pointed up.

393
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,009
Run faster!

394
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,299
Run if you wish to live.

395
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,220
Run!

396
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:07,480
You'll be as good as dead if you run like this.

397
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:09,440
Keep going.

398
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,519
Get up and move if you want to live.

399
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,859
Private No Ae Seol,

400
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,900
do you wish to be a burden on your friends?

401
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:20,700
No, sir!

402
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:22,450
Then, run.

403
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:23,869
Run!

404
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,579
- Keep moving if you want to live. - Darn it!

405
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,750
No one will protect you.

406
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,210
Don't be a burden on your friends.

407
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:35,630
Run if you wish to live.

408
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:39,049
Move faster.

409
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,970
No one will protect you.

410
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,680
Survive on your own.

411
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,019
Keep moving if you wish to live.

412
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,269
Run!

413
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,529
Private. Get running.

414
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:58,069
Run if you wish to live!

415
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,450
I can't.

416
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,789
No, I can't.

417
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,539
Commander, I can't.

418
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,759
I can't do this anymore.

419
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,279
I'm scared.

420
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,250
This never made sense from the start.

421
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,000
How could we go through this training...

422
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,420
and take the CSAT at the end of the year?

423
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,089
We were too naive like a bunch of fools.

424
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:01,420
Hey, we weren't the ones who were naive.

425
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,049
The adults wronged us.

426
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,680
That platoon commander...

427
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:09,180
enjoys torturing us.

428
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,849
And here I thought he was a good person.

429
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,309
Don't think that way about the platoon commander.

430
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,690
Darn it!

431
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,490
The training will kill me at this rate, not the spheres!

432
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,660
You'll find out later on...

433
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,490
that the platoon commander...

434
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,789
is watching out for you.

435
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:48,849
As if.

436
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,750
The spheres are immune to weapons of mass destruction.

437
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,920
And with rifles, all we can do is slow them down.

438
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,639
Only depleted uranium ammunition has been working on them so far.

439
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:09,969
Depleted uranium ammunition?

440
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,010
But only on those small ones.

441
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:13,969
Those medium-sized seem to be immune.

442
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,619
But the problem is this.

443
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,539
We don't have enough ammo,

444
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:38,460
and we lack in the number of rifles...

445
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,750
that can shoot the spheres.

446
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,170
That is why...

447
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,130
we had to recruit high school seniors.

448
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,650
Okay.

449
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,280
The coast is clear. We're free to talk.

450
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:14,030
Must we stay like this?

451
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,409
We don't have any other option.

452
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:17,789
Darn it.

453
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,750
Honestly, I don't believe that our parents went to the shelter.

454
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,420
What if he lied to make us stay?

455
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,300
As if the platoon commander...

456
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,510
He isn't one to lie.

457
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,889
Darn.

458
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:37,469
I want to believe him, but I don't trust anyone anymore.

459
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:44,059
Let's confirm it ourselves.

460
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,900
How stupid are you?

461
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,320
We can't call, and the Internet is down.

462
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,199
And that is your limit. Of course, we can still communicate.

463
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,070
Is there a way to contact them?

464
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:58,659
What do we have a lot of in school?

465
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:01,789
I don't know.

466
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,250
Pigeons.

467
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,960
We'll tie a note around their legs and...

468
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,130
Somebody shut him up.

469
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,880
Let's rewind it a few steps.

470
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,340
We have no other option but to confirm it ourselves.

471
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,889
Here. I'll go.

472
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:21,309
Kimchi, shouldn't you go as well?

473
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,309
Me? Why me?

474
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,190
Your house is the closest.

475
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,860
It's the easiest place to confirm.

476
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,360
- But... - Chi Yeol will come with.

477
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,690
But I'm not ready for this.

478
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,070
- Duk Joong. - Yes?

479
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,329
Our house is quite far away.

480
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,159
(Restroom)

481
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,969
- We'll break out from here. - What?

482
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,349
How can one go through there?

483
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,269
Jang Soo and I won't be able to manage,

484
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
so I'm off.

485
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,119
This is a school of history and tradition.

486
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,489
What could I mean by that?

487
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,039
- Why you... - It's old.

488
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:26,920
Watch.

489
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,460
I get it. What?

490
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,090
Careful.

491
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,260
Careful.

492
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:40,179
Darn it.

493
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,690
Be careful.

494
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,190
Be careful.

495
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,079
Follow me.

496
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,380
We're going too?

497
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,429
Jang Soo!

498
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,820
Quick!

499
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,820
You should go next.

500
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,989
Darn it.

501
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,409
Hey, are you all right?

502
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:43,699
Just get out now.

503
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,880
- Hey! - Just come out now.

504
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,420
Do we really have to do this?

505
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,719
Darn.

506
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:05,719
Hey, are you okay?

507
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,730
Is it Duk Joong?

508
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,559
- Darn it. - Darn it.

509
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,280
Come out now. What are you doing?

510
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,829
Be quiet.

511
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,900
Shoot.

512
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,530
Where are they going?

513
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,199
Go.

514
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,449
Get down.

515
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,369
- Shall we go now? - Yes.

516
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,329
Oh, my.

517
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,039
Who's it there?

518
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,380
- Goodness. - Sorry. What shall we do?

519
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,760
- Duk Joong. - Yes?

520
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,010
You must be curious why you're here even when your home is not close.

521
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,389
What? Yes.

522
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:28,889
I'm sorry.

523
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,769
Why?

524
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,599
Hey!

525
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,059
Duk Joong.

526
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,239
Hey!

527
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,820
What are you doing here at this hour... What did you eat?

528
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,909
I didn't eat anything...

529
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,119
Why?

530
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,710
- That thing... - What is it?

531
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,789
What's wrong?

532
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,289
What is it?

533
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,590
Catch me if you can!

534
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,670
That punk... Hey!

535
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,969
- Let's move. - Let's go.

536
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,599
- Oh. - Gosh.

537
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,099
What on earth are you doing here?

538
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:19,230
Hey, do you want to run?

539
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:25,449
If I do that, you should...

540
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,369
Gosh, what are you saying?

541
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:28,449
"What are you saying?"

542
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,829
- Follow me if I... - What?

543
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,539
You idiots...

544
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,289
- What? - You idiots...

545
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:37,960
Run, idiots...

546
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,800
- Run, idiots. - Run, idiots.

547
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,800
Run, idiots!

548
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:48,469
- Go! - Run now!

549
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:50,349
- Duk Joong! - Where are you going?

550
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,889
Run fast!

551
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,769
Run!

552
00:41:57,769 --> 00:41:58,809
Hey!

553
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,269
- Wait! - Run!

554
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,570
Stop following us!

555
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:11,949
Stop there!

556
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:13,289
Stop!

557
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:15,079
- Stop! - Quick!

558
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,420
Sir, everything is fine!

559
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,550
Any movements on the sphere?

560
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,840
Everything is fine so far. We'll keep watching.

561
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,550
- Duk Joong! - Gosh!

562
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,599
- Stop! - Gosh.

563
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,639
What are you doing? Come here.

564
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,519
- Run! - Run.

565
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,889
What is it?

566
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:50,320
Catch them!

567
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,239
Catch them...

568
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,869
Did you catch them?

569
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,170
I caught Duk Joong.

570
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,670
Oh my...

571
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,969
Second platoon, roll to the right.

572
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:10,550
- To the right! - To the right!

573
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,550
To the right!

574
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,300
- To the right. - Sorry.

575
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,349
Roll to the left.

576
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:16,099
- To the left! - To the left!

577
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,639
- Stand up. - Yes, sir!

578
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,730
Stand up!

579
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,570
Okay.

580
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,940
From now on, you're not students.

581
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,030
I'll treat all of you as soldiers now.

582
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:34,030
You can't act like a baby...

583
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,949
and have no privilege as a student.

584
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:41,710
You have to follow every order I give...

585
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,920
as soldiers.

586
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,920
Do you understand?

587
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,010
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

588
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,429
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

589
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,429
Second platoon, lie face down.

590
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,090
- Face down! - Face down!

591
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,260
Face down!

592
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,809
Face down!

593
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:59,599
- One! - One!

594
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,269
- Two! - Two!

595
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,559
Focus!

596
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:06,400
Gosh.

597
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,030
Does anyone still want to go home?

598
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:15,369
- Second platoon, stand up. - Stand up!

599
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,920
From now on, if you get out of here, it's desertion.

600
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:25,960
And you'll be tried by court-martial.

601
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:44,440
From this very minute, anyone who leaves without permission,

602
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,150
will be considered as a deserter...

603
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,070
and may be shot under my order.

604
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,780
Has the platoon commander gone really crazy?

605
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,320
Are they really going to shoot us?

606
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,329
No way. They won't really shoot us.

607
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,239
But what if they do?

608
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:44,199
It will hurt so bad.

609
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:45,579
When you get shot,

610
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,460
the bullet hole is small in the front...

611
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,590
but it's as large as a watermelon in the back. I heard.

612
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,590
That's a lie.

613
00:45:56,929 --> 00:45:57,969
Is that true?

614
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:01,059
You can try and see.

615
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,059
Are you really going to stay put?

616
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:06,639
But there's no other way.

617
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,480
We should either endure this or hold up.

618
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,230
Aren't those the same thing?

619
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,820
To endure and to hold up.

620
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,119
So, that's the only way, I mean.

621
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:22,949
There's a way.

622
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:29,670
There's a way we can try.

623
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,019
Young Hoon is dead.

624
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,360
What?

625
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,690
He's dead.

626
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,360
Hey, you know Young Hoon, right?

627
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,320
- We do. - Yes.

628
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,329
I'm not lying.

629
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:05,369
See? I was almost dead.

630
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:07,000
Just right there...

631
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,409
What was the reason?

632
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,380
I'm leaving.

633
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,710
- Wait. - Let's talk for a minute.

634
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,260
Let me go.

635
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,260
We might all end up dead.

636
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:21,679
Hey, come here quickly!

637
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,099
- What is it? - Quick!

638
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:24,929
I heard Ms. Park and Young Hoon are dead.

639
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:27,059
- What? - What?

640
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:29,769
That alien or something did that!

641
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:31,309
Is what students in Class Two saying true?

642
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,269
- Is it? - Is it?

643
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:34,690
Is the CSAT only an excuse you made...

644
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,400
and are you trying to make us fight against the spheres?

645
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,360
- You should tell us! - Teacher, tell us!

646
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,699
- What's happening? - What's your plan?

647
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:43,199
- What's going on? - Calm down!

648
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,590
My class will follow what your class does.

649
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,340
Thank you.

650
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,130
- Just give us the signal. - Okay.

651
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,190
(Confidential)

652
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,730
- Thank you. - It's mine.

653
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,280
I think you should get some sleep.

654
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:26,699
What about the kids?

655
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,289
They have a lot of complaints.

656
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,170
You know,

657
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,840
after what happened, isn't this too much?

658
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,090
You know how it feels to lose a colleague.

659
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:47,889
It's hard for us.

660
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,889
It must be even harder for the kids.

661
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:56,269
We need to give them time to mourn and console them.

662
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,030
There's no time to console them.

663
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,860
If I can save one more kid, I can be even harsher than this.

664
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:13,039
Let's go. The kids are waiting.

665
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,750
Let's go!

666
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,340
Let's go!

667
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,090
- Come out! - Let's go!

668
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,010
- Let's go! - Let's go!

669
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:24,380
Let's go and take our freedom!

670
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,719
- Let's go! - Gosh!

671
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:27,469
- Move over! - Let me go!

672
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:29,179
Stop them!

673
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:31,139
Quick!

674
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:34,139
Block them! You punk, move over!

675
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,309
Push them back!

676
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:37,980
You punks!

677
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,150
Push them back!

678
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,570
Block them!

679
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:45,360
Go back inside!

680
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,949
Darn it!

681
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,159
You punks...

682
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,659
What are you doing? Go back to your classroom!

683
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,250
- I heard Ms. Park is dead. - She's dead!

684
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,630
I heard it from the kids in Class Two!

685
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,340
- I heard everything! - Is that true?

686
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,630
I don't want to die!

687
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,670
Jang Young Hoon of Class Two is dead too.

688
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,929
- Please send us home! - Send us home.

689
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:09,010
- Now! - Let us go home.

690
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,550
Who said so?

691
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,760
- Gosh. - Let's push through.

692
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,889
Gosh, what?

693
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:14,929
What are you doing?

694
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,769
Stop the kids!

695
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,480
What are you waiting for?

696
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,780
Stop them!

697
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,900
Why wouldn't you let us go?

698
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,070
Why these little...

699
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,949
Listen.

700
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:36,119
Doing this won't do you any good.

701
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,750
You won't get any extra points...

702
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,460
for your college entrance exams.

703
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,880
Look, mister.

704
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,460
I don't care, so just let me go home!

705
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,760
You'll get penalty points, you punk.

706
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,469
Thanks for that.

707
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:47,550
- Let's go! - Okay!

708
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,510
Don't you dare!

709
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:51,010
Let us go!

710
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,010
Stop!

711
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,010
What are you doing?

712
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:56,099
What do you think you're doing?

713
00:50:57,309 --> 00:50:58,519
Go back inside now.

714
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,940
Doing this won't change anything. Hurry back inside!

715
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,570
Why must we do that?

716
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,190
We aren't even soldiers.

717
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,900
I already told you. This is all for your...

718
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,489
We don't need it.

719
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,659
If it's for our sake, let us go.

720
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:16,500
Why can't we have anything our way?

721
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:19,619
Why can't we do what we want?

722
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:37,719
What are you waiting for?

723
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,889
Force them back inside if you must!

724
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:41,599
Stop them.

725
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,849
- Get them inside now. - No!

726
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:44,440
- Move! - I'm going to go home.

727
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,900
- Let us go! - Goodness.

728
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,239
Stop them.

729
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,530
No!

730
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,050
Stand up.

731
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,730
What on earth?

732
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,820
Focus.

733
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:31,780
Everyone, ready to fire.

734
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:35,949
Go forward.

735
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,440
Go back inside. Quickly!

736
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,769
Hurry inside.

737
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:17,409
Run.

738
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,420
Protect the students!

739
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,400
Pull yourself together!

740
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:55,780
Run!

741
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,579
Move out of the way!

742
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:06,369
Move! Darn it.

743
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,980
Shoot them.

744
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:51,750
