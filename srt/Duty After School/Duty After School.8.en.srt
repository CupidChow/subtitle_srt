1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,550
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,839
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,929
What is this?

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,730
Why are they the only ones here?

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,810
Did the prison officers really leave them behind?

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,899
Who knows what happened?

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,649
We can't trust what they say.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,570
From what I know,

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,820
in times of war, they let the petty criminals go,

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,239
and they transfer the hard criminals to Busan.

11
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,579
All of those people must be hard criminals.

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,420
Maybe that's why they were left here until the end and got stuck.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,000
You saw the red tag earlier, right?

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,880
That means he's on death row.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,590
Then isn't he a serial killer or something?

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,840
Darn it, he looked super scary.

17
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,350
Maybe he's the boss of a gang,

18
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,429
and he wiped out his enemy gang before getting locked up.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,850
Bring it on.

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,149
Get lost.

21
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,399
Darn it.

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,899
Hey, guys.

23
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,270
Are you still there?

24
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:03,399
Come here and open these doors for me.

25
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,950
Darn it! At this rate, we might actually die! Open up!

26
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,409
Please, save us.

27
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,409
We're not bad people, guys.

28
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,909
- Come over here for a minute. - Guys!

29
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,370
- Come over here, - Hey, guys.

30
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,079
and listen to us.

31
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,670
We can never open the doors for them. They're dangerous people.

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,290
- That's right. - Guys!

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,340
But they said they haven't even eaten for days.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,840
- Should we at least give them... - Are you crazy?

35
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,219
Then should we just leave them alone and ignore them?

36
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,599
If we leave them like that, they'll all end up dead soon.

37
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,310
Why should we care?

38
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,349
Let's just grab what we need and get out.

39
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,230
Yes, let's leave them here and get out.

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,019
It's none of our business.

41
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,060
Darn it! Come and open the doors, you punk!

42
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,269
Shut it, you idiot!

43
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,980
What should we do?

44
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,620
Darn it.

45
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,219
Hey, but...

46
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,759
I thought something was weird since a while ago.

47
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,020
You guys look really young. What are you doing with guns?

48
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,979
And why do you look like such a mess?

49
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,439
Right now, the outside world is at war.

50
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,569
At war?

51
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,110
There's a war going on?

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,530
Hold on, then...

53
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,069
Did North Korea invade us?

54
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,110
See? What did I tell you? Darn it.

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,780
I told you, didn't I?

56
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,120
I said North Korea would invade us, didn't I?

57
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,039
That's why they left us behind and ran off.

58
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,870
Those darned prison guard jerks.

59
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,000
Just wait until I get out of here. Those jerks.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,379
I'll kill those guys first. Darn it.

61
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,800
I knew they'd be like this.

62
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,340
Gosh, I feel much better now. Thank you.

63
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,759
Kids.

64
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,300
If you go around that corner, there's an office for the guards.

65
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:56,469
There are a set of keys in there.

66
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,099
Go and grab them for us.

67
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,270
- We can't do that. - What?

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,900
What did you just say?

69
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,439
You darned punks!

70
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,939
Hey, kids.

71
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,280
Stop joking around.

72
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,530
Hurry up and grab the keys.

73
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,370
The outside is even more dangerous right now.

74
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,580
It's dangerous?

75
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,000
What's it like out there?

76
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,919
Well,

77
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,379
do you really not know anything?

78
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,169
Right now, there are...

79
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,639
What is it? Why won't you finish what you're saying?

80
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,219
- Why? What is it? - What on earth is going on?

81
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,560
Did the spheres in the sky fall down or something?

82
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,060
What? Those purple balloon things?

83
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,439
That makes sense.

84
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,150
What's this?

85
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,280
Is this for real?

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,900
Darn it, this is driving me crazy! Just say it.

87
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,949
No, you don't have to tell us.

88
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:55,659
We don't really want to know anyway.

89
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,870
Hey, just open these doors for us, quickly.

90
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,199
Thanks for this. Now, open the doors.

91
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,000
Kids, we were wrongfully convicted.

92
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,169
All of us were framed by others.

93
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,759
That's right. We haven't done anything wrong.

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,220
Isn't that right? The prison guards didn't like us...

95
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,560
Aren't you going to eat?

96
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:22,769
Are you sick?

97
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,810
You little punks.

98
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,189
- Excuse me. - You darned kids.

99
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,860
Open the doors right now!

100
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,069
Go get the keys!

101
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:37,120
Gosh, that jerk. Why are you yelling at the kids?

102
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,160
Please excuse him. It's because he's been locked up alone for so long.

103
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,540
Hey.

104
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,459
Kid. I'm sorry,

105
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,420
but could I ask you for a favour?

106
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,589
My mom...

107
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,259
My mom doesn't know I'm in here.

108
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,470
I should've sent her to a senior home,

109
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,430
but I ruined everything.

110
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,139
I just...

111
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,899
want to know if my mom is doing okay.

112
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:12,980
- Hey, you punk! - Come on.

113
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,779
Could you call...

114
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,360
this number, please?

115
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,949
Please do that for me.

116
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,660
The last time I saw my mom,

117
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,500
she couldn't eat very well.

118
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,170
Since I'm not around, I'm worried...

119
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,589
how she might be eating.

120
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,509
But we can't really call people...

121
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,009
Please, I'm begging you.

122
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,759
Tell her that her son is living happily, so she shouldn't worry.

123
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,639
There's no need to worry, and I'm really sorry.

124
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,769
And tell her that I love her.

125
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,069
Sorry for bothering you.

126
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:54,069
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,899
What are you doing? Go get them.

128
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,449
Please, just open the doors!

129
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,079
We'll go back as soon as we can and report on the situation here.

130
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,870
Please hang in there a little longer until then.

131
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,250
Darn it, open up!

132
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,879
Open the doors, darn it!

133
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
What a bunch of lies.

134
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,920
Hey, are you kidding me?

135
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,839
- Let's go. - Hey, where are you going?

136
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,759
- Don't go! - Darn it!

137
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,220
- We'll be back. - Hey, stop.

138
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,720
- Hey, don't go! - Don't go.

139
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,810
Hey, you kids.

140
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,889
This is murder.

141
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,399
Then you won't be any different from criminals like us.

142
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:40,279
Darn it!

143
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,660
- Ae Seol! - Kids.

144
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,949
- Hey, hurry up. - Get over here.

145
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,829
Get over here.

146
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:50,670
You punks!

147
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,040
Why is that murder? Darn it.

148
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,629
Why did he have to say such a thing and make us feel gross?

149
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,670
This is the right thing to do, isn't it?

150
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,009
What would Mr. Lee have done in this situation?

151
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,019
Mr. Lee would've done the same thing.

152
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,100
Right.

153
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,399
When the walkie-talkies are fixed, we can report this to them too.

154
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,230
Darn it, this feels wrong.

155
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,779
But...

156
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,110
the guy in the last room...

157
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,360
He seemed really sick.

158
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,279
He couldn't even eat the food we gave him...

159
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,660
Why are you getting all sentimental all of a sudden?

160
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,540
I think we need to help him. He might...

161
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,829
Hey, No Ae Seol.

162
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:32,870
You seemed like you were coming to your senses. What's wrong now?

163
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,670
We decided not to open the doors for them as a group.

164
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,800
Then can we at least...

165
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,009
Stop caring, you idiot.

166
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,759
- I will... - That's right, Ae Seol.

167
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,970
We're also worried and feel bad about this,

168
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:49,639
but for now,

169
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,350
we should focus on the reason we came here in the first place.

170
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,269
Let's look for the parts for the walkie-talkie now.

171
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,689
And let's grab anything else we might need and get going.

172
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,279
This is a prison, so there must be protective gear or weapons too.

173
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,360
Right.

174
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
As I said earlier, we just need to find the circuit board.

175
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,949
- It's the thing that looks like... - The thing that looks like a card.

176
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,620
If we find it, we'll bring it to you or Young Sin.

177
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,120
Are we good?

178
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,290
Right.

179
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,500
Let's spread out and look for it.

180
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:14,829
Be careful, guys.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,209
Let's go.

182
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,019
(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

183
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,750
(Duty After School)

184
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,629
(Yongdu Service Area)

185
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,169
This is strange.

186
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,049
Gosh, seriously.

187
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,129
Yes, that's it.

188
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,470
We are girls who dream, let's go

189
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,809
Can you feel me? Feel me

190
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:58,019
Can you touch me? Hold onto me

191
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,230
Hey.

192
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,110
What are you doing there and not standing guard?

193
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,279
You came down here too.

194
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,779
I don't want to be alone.

195
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,779
I had to go to the restroom.

196
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,990
How many times are you going to the restroom?

197
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,409
Aren't you just slacking off?

198
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:13,580
I'm not.

199
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,080
I just have sensitive bowels.

200
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,500
Besides, you're the one who's slacking off.

201
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,129
I let you get away with faking sick.

202
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,500
I was really sick and had a fever earlier.

203
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,419
Hey.

204
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,090
Why are you both in here?

205
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,350
Darn it. What if the spheres suddenly appear?

206
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,970
They're not here.

207
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,850
Besides, we didn't see any spheres, let alone a single cat until now.

208
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,269
Don't go overboard.

209
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,730
Why, you little... You told me to go and sleep.

210
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,360
You're both slacking off. Darn it.

211
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,610
She's right, we have the detector too.

212
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,610
We don't have to be so strict about standing guard.

213
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,740
It's cold outside.

214
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,200
Let's get some rest.

215
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,909
- Hey, you... - It's finished!

216
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,960
Ta-Da!

217
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,409
How is it?

218
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,919
It's so pretty.

219
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,129
Jun Hee, how is it?

220
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:07,960
You look like a darned beggar! Darn it.

221
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,009
Why don't you even attach a flower to show how crazy you are?

222
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,049
Come on. It looks totally like an idol singer's stage outfit.

223
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,350
There you go again.

224
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,470
Pick me up...

225
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,440
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

226
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,649
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Pick me

227
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,399
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

228
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,990
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Hey.

229
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,370
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

230
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,080
Pick Ha Na

231
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,409
All right, the honorary first-place winner...

232
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:43,539
- is... - Who is it?

233
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,379
Trainee Yoo Ha Na!

234
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,340
Thank you!

235
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,379
- Thank you, - Yoo Ha Na.

236
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,889
- Yoo Ha Na. - dear national producers.

237
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:56,509
You've got to be kidding me.

238
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,899
- What's wrong with her? - It's because you called her lame.

239
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,440
Me? What did I do?

240
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Goodness.

241
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,899
I wanted to début before the age of 20.

242
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,460
Guys.

243
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,710
I think it's weird though.

244
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,710
What?

245
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:29,629
What is?

246
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,710
- What is? - I mean, the voting.

247
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,220
A lot of those I asked threw negative votes.

248
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,429
So why was the result always positive?

249
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,559
Maybe they actually voted positive and lied to you...

250
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,559
in case you would call them names.

251
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,519
Hey, not everyone is hung up on extra points...

252
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,070
like you and Young Soo.

253
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,529
Extra points, my foot.

254
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:53,570
A CSAT?

255
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,159
Forget it. We don't even know how things will be next week.

256
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,330
I saw you study in secret at night.

257
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,909
- Me too. - Right, Duk Joong?

258
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,000
You're 100 percent right, Ha Na.

259
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,289
Hey, you...

260
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,750
So who's right?

261
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,629
- Wait. - Within...

262
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,009
Guys, be quiet.

263
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,720
You're 100 percent...

264
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
- Darn, be quiet. - Right.

265
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,049
- What's wrong with you? - What is it?

266
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,600
Just follow me.

267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,720
What's this sound?

268
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,720
- What is it? - Do you hear it too?

269
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,059
Guys... Gosh, the rifle.

270
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,139
The rifle.

271
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,559
- Hey. - Why give this to me?

272
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,190
Be quiet!

273
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,269
Okay.

274
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,779
One, two, three.

275
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,070
- Take this. - Goodness.

276
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,700
- Darn it. - Who are they?

277
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,029
Maybe they're here for backup.

278
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,620
- Let me... - Just stay still.

279
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,039
- Stay put. - Why must we hide?

280
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:48,539
- Be quiet. - We have to ask them.

281
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,210
Don't be a fool. We don't know what they're like.

282
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,049
What if they try to harm us?

283
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,720
- Oh, no. - Darn you.

284
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,179
Guys, stay put here while I go take a look.

285
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,220
- Stay here. - Okay.

286
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:04,809
Darn it.

287
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,399
- Guys. - What is it?

288
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,230
Quiet. They're right next to us.

289
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,309
Stay still.

290
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,149
- Is there anything? - They took everything.

291
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,860
- Go out! - Go!

292
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,899
Stay still.

293
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,779
Guys, there's so much food here.

294
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:21,870
- Gosh. - Really?

295
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,950
- No way. - Let's go.

296
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,789
- This is crazy. - There's more here.

297
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:26,870
- What on earth? - No way!

298
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,370
- Awesome. - Goodness.

299
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,669
That's my food!

300
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,039
- Hey. - My food!

301
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,840
Please be quiet. They might hear us.

302
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,460
But that's my food.

303
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,210
Chi Yeol.

304
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:40,509
What's on your mind?

305
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,639
What?

306
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,809
Well, it's nothing.

307
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,649
There are no clean sheets.

308
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,690
I know. We have to take some blankets too.

309
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,820
Should I express my feelings now?

310
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,450
Before Soo Chul makes a move first.

311
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,789
What do I do?

312
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,039
Look.

313
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,419
I keep having anxious ideas these days.

314
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,679
It's been just us for a month now.

315
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,179
I wonder how things are in Seoul and other cities.

316
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,970
Would it be similar to our situation?

317
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,389
All communication is dead.

318
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,059
It's been so long since we heard from our parents.

319
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,399
I keep having bad imaginations.

320
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,690
Will we be able...

321
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:41,860
to go back to school?

322
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,159
We're returning to school once this war ends.

323
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:50,500
If we get to go back safely, will you go out with me?

324
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,299
Maybe I made you feel down too.

326
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,509
We're all in the same situation after all.

327
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,340
There isn't any here. Let's check upstairs.

328
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,429
Na Ra.

329
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,429
By any chance,

330
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,269
last night...

331
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
What?

332
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:21,649
Last night...

333
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:27,740
Did you sleep well?

334
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,539
I mean... At a time like this,

335
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,960
you need to sleep and eat properly to keep yourself healthy.

336
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,340
Health comes first, you know.

337
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,590
Right.

338
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,389
I couldn't sleep, but I'm all right.

339
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,220
Now is the time.

340
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,610
Kim Chi Yeol, tell her how you feel. Tell her, you idiot.

341
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,860
- Chi Yeol. - Yes?

342
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,190
Thanks...

343
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,400
for looking out for me.

344
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,200
Don't mention it. This is only natural.

345
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,789
We're friends.

346
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,500
Right. Let's go out.

347
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,509
You idiot.

348
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,720
(Yongwon Metropolitan Hospital)

349
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:34,559
I wanted to go to med school too.

350
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,769
My mom was sick since I was little.

351
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,690
But my grades weren't high enough...

352
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,400
that I decided to go to nursing school.

353
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,200
I might barely get accepted to nursing school though.

354
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,460
When I was a junior, my first choice was med school too.

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,130
Apply for it. Your grades are high enough, no?

356
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,339
Well...

357
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,970
The tuition costs too much.

358
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,680
And it takes too long to graduate.

359
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,009
I think it's better to just go to a regular college...

360
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,269
that offers a scholarship and take a civil-service exam later.

361
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,900
You should have a bigger picture in mind.

362
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,059
You know if you become a doctor, you'll earn much more.

363
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,660
My family isn't well-off enough to wait for me until then.

364
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,410
And I have to get a job soon...

365
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,740
for my siblings' college education.

366
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,450
I see.

367
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,000
This is unexpected of you.

368
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,000
Sorry?

369
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,130
What is?

370
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,049
I'm proud of you.

371
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:50,880
Your parents must be.

372
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,970
Not really.

373
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,019
Guys! The dispensary is this way.

374
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,690
- Come quick. - Okay.

375
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,269
- Let's go. - Okay.

376
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,190
My gosh, there's so much useful medicine here.

377
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,400
Look.

378
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,569
I'm so annoyed to think how many trips we made...

379
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:10,900
to pharmacies just for nothing.

380
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,490
We need to take antibiotics and anticoagulants.

381
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,950
- Okay. - We can treat frostbite with those.

382
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,289
Really?

383
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,200
Jun Hee will be delighted.

384
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,869
Oh, we should take cold medicine...

385
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,619
and anti fungal drugs for athlete's foot too.

386
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,710
Got it.

387
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,049
Never mind. Let's just take everything here.

388
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,089
Sure thing.

389
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,839
Oh, right.

390
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,180
So Yeon, wait. Let me carry that.

391
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,299
Young Soo. This too, please.

392
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,470
That too?

393
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,809
Young Soo, wait. This too.

394
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,140
This is...

395
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,690
- Goodness. - Hey!

396
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,019
- Young Soo! - Oh, dear.

397
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,650
(Rooms 301 to 312)

398
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:50,109
What's wrong with you?

399
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,819
Come on, Kim Chi Yeol.

400
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:57,029
Why regret now after not being able to say a word?

401
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,869
That was a perfect moment...

402
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,829
No way!

403
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,670
Goodness.

404
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,009
I haven't had a chocolate bar in such a long time.

405
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,390
Thanks for the food.

406
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,440
This is crazy.

407
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,779
This is the one! Nice.

408
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,200
There. I found it.

409
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,569
There are more than a few.

410
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,119
It's worth a month at least.

411
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,119
Please...

412
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,039
Yes!

413
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,509
Thank goodness.

414
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,210
If...

415
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,799
by any chance, I end up dying,

416
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:38,549
I won't be able to confess at all, so I'm leaving this.

417
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,930
Na Ra.

418
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,640
From the moment I saw you for the first time,

419
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,190
I have liked...

420
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,279
This is not it.

421
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,950
When we go back to school, will you go out...

422
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,789
Will you go out...

423
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,619
I just like... Let's go...

424
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,880
Darn my stupid mouth.

425
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:18,680
Soo Chul...

426
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,140
was brave.

427
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,140
It's nerve-racking to do it alone,

428
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:27,640
and he did it in front of Na Ra.

429
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,730
You're good. I will give you that.

430
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,029
What do you suggest we do? Should we just go back?

431
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,029
Are you suggesting that we just quit it like this?

432
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,349
You want to tell them everything now?

433
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,099
You think the kids will just understand it then?

434
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,150
Gosh.

435
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,450
Is anyone there?

436
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:41,509
What is it?

437
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,839
I thought...

438
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,009
I heard something.

439
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,220
- Were you with someone? - No.

440
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,680
I was alone.

441
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,650
Right.

442
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,309
I see.

443
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,529
What is it? What did you hear?

444
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,150
It's...

445
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,369
It's nothing.

446
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,240
I must have heard it wrong.

447
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,460
Why aren't you asking me?

448
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,329
About what happened yesterday?

449
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,259
Yesterday. Right.

450
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,299
What happened?

451
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,349
Na Ra said yes.

452
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:29,599
We are together.

453
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,349
I'm joking.

454
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,359
- Right. - I told her to take her time.

455
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,319
But...

456
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,740
even if she turns me down, I won't give up.

457
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,410
I will keep asking her out...

458
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:47,410
until she accepts me.

459
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,079
Right.

460
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,170
What's wrong?

461
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,089
Are you nervous because you have a rival now?

462
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,339
What are you talking about?

463
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,049
You like Na Ra too.

464
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,309
How did you know...

465
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,599
You stare at her every day.

466
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,730
Am I wrong?

467
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:22,980
Where are you guys?

468
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,990
- Chi Yeol! - Guys!

469
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,319
- Kim Chi Yeol! - They are calling for us.

470
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:28,910
Let's go.

471
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:50,470
(Yongwon Penitentiary)

472
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,529
Hey, Mister.

473
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,380
Are you really unwell, Mister?

474
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,349
Mister.

475
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,529
You witch!

476
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,319
I can't find cigarettes anywhere.

477
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,990
I guess people make sure to take cigarettes with them.

478
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,910
I know.

479
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,579
Did you hear that?

480
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,789
What?

481
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,880
- Where's No Ae Seol? - What?

482
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,299
Where is No Ae Seol?

483
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,549
Wasn't she with you?

484
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,339
Darn it.

485
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,849
Why wouldn't you open the door?

486
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:59,930
Why won't you listen to me, you witch!

487
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,099
Why would you make me the bad guy, you wicked witch!

488
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,730
I thought I was going to die in here.

489
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,279
Gosh.

490
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,450
My darling.

491
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,619
Thank you.

492
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,690
What is he saying?

493
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,690
- I don't know. - Gosh.

494
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,650
- What are you doing? Come on. - You go.

495
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,069
- Darn it. - Come. You have to do this.

496
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:53,819
You go first.

497
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,069
Never mind.

498
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,369
Gosh.

499
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,410
Darn it.

500
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,250
Development plan. Search status.

501
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,250
Look at these.

502
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,250
They are actually pretty systematic.

503
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,339
It looks like they are on their own without a commander-in-chief.

504
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:13,420
Right.

505
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,799
Are they naive or stupid?

506
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,430
They must've had a vote.

507
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,259
They've stocked up quite a lot of food too.

508
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,390
Look, guys.

509
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,730
They've saved up a lot of bullets.

510
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:26,190
- How many have they got? - Over 800.

511
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,019
Let's ask them if we can borrow some.

512
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:29,309
No. I'm shy.

513
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,109
I will ask them.

514
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:33,109
- You're the best. - Look.

515
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,609
There are lots of girls.

516
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,319
- Girls? - Girls? Let me see.

517
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,740
- Look. - How many are they?

518
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,240
One, two, three, four,

519
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,039
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

520
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:43,789
- Ten girls! - Hey.

521
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,910
- Are you happy? - We are happy.

522
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,119
I am not happy.

523
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,130
I hope they are...

524
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,500
the feminine type, unlike you girls.

525
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,130
- Right? - Right.

526
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,589
Female sex chromosome wouldn't be their only female attribute.

527
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:57,299
- Are you crazy? - Think about how you look.

528
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,759
- Hey. - Gosh.

529
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,220
I will actually shoot you.

530
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,259
Just shoot him.

531
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,720
Do not hesitate.

532
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,309
Hands up!

533
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,480
Hands up!

534
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,730
You. Move.

535
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,400
- Okay. - Move.

536
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,440
- Hands up. - Hurry up!

537
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,569
Science high school?

538
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,369
Gosh, they are high school seniors too. We didn't have to get scared.

539
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:21,740
Don't get intimidated.

540
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,369
Science high school.

541
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:28,500
- So you study science? - Yes.

542
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:31,460
What's wrong with her?

543
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,339
Yes.

544
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,920
We go to science high school.

545
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,730
You don't look nerdy, so we nearly got you wrong.

546
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,519
This?

547
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,480
We normally don't get to do this,

548
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
so I thought I would do it now.

549
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:54,650
And you know,

550
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,900
and it's a prejudice that a smart kid has to look like a nerd.

551
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,700
It's my first time to meet students from the science high school.

552
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:02,160
You guys must be really smart.

553
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,490
Well, we are not too bad.

554
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,410
But you are the worst among us.

555
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,500
So what? There are three people after me.

556
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,130
So what? You're not any better than them.

557
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,549
Whatever you say.

558
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:20,930
By the way, why are you here?

559
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,059
We were passing by, and it looked occupied.

560
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:29,680
By the way, there are just the three of you?

561
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,599
No. Other kids went out on a mission.

562
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,650
We are guarding the base camp.

563
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:37,730
Darn it.

564
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:39,990
Hey, we don't know if they are an ally or foe.

565
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,740
Why would you give away our Intel?

566
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,569
They are not the spheres, are they?

567
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,279
How can they be the foe?

568
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,950
We don't know who they are.

569
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:50,710
And what is up with your tone?

570
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,579
What's wrong with my tone?

571
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,339
You sound too cute.

572
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,839
I always sound cute.

573
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,509
And why do you care how I sound?

574
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,470
I am just worried.

575
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,589
Who asked you to worry?

576
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,640
My heart wants to worry. My heart.

577
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,559
You two are going out, aren't you?

578
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,480
- Is it obvious? - It's obvious.

579
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,359
It's obvious?

580
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,900
Just ignore them.

581
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,029
So where are you headed?

582
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,450
- Seoul. - Seoul?

583
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,200
Yes. We are going to the shelter in Seoul.

584
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,660
Do you want to join us?

585
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,710
Seoul?

586
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,170
On your own?

587
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,750
Sounds good. Let's go together then.

588
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,210
- That sounds good. - I love it.

589
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,170
- I love it too. - No.

590
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,130
We have to stay here.

591
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:45,430
We have to wait for the others.

592
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,140
- Right. - Right.

593
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,640
We were like that first,

594
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
but we decided to go separate ways this time.

595
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,849
What?

596
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,730
What about the others then?

597
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,190
They are staying behind, carrying out the operation.

598
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,309
CSAT is cancelled though.

599
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,190
What's wrong with them?

600
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,779
I know.

601
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:04,279
What did you just say?

602
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:06,869
I don't know what's wrong with them.

603
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:08,950
No. Before that.

604
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,450
CSAT got cancelled?

605
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:13,160
Is that true?

606
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,619
Yes.

607
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,250
You...

608
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,039
didn't know?

609
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,210
Wait. CSAT really got cancelled?

610
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,299
How did you guys find out?

611
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,849
They radioed each unit and let us know.

612
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,519
Didn't you guys hear about it?

613
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,349
No. Our walkie-talkie is broken.

614
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,609
Gosh, then were you here carrying out the operation...

615
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:42,230
when your walkie-talkie is broken?

616
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,450
Gosh, it must've been hard for you.

617
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,069
- Hey, tell us in detail. - What?

618
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,619
Are you sure the CSAT is cancelled?

619
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:50,990
Then is everyone supposed to go home?

620
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,829
Are we being discharged? What did they say?

621
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:54,579
We're not being discharged.

622
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:56,000
The CSAT has been cancelled,

623
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,960
but they'll give us extra points for next year's exams.

624
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,670
They said to continue with the operation as planned.

625
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,750
That's right. But we had different opinions.

626
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:05,220
We can't really believe what they tell us.

627
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,380
And as you can see, we're really exhausted. That's why.

628
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,889
So you guys were the only ones who got the news.

629
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,769
Well, I'm sure the other schools got the news too.

630
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,849
Then we should go back to Seoul too.

631
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,610
Why should we stay here if the CSAT has been cancelled?

632
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,610
When the others get back,

633
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,269
- let's tell them to go home. - Right.

634
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,940
- Jun Hee. Let's go home. - Did you really get the radio?

635
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,320
I want to hear it myself.

636
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,159
Could you maybe tell them news about our unit too?

637
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,579
But our walkie-talkie is with the others who stayed behind.

638
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,789
- Gosh, darn it. - Darn it.

639
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,039
Do you want me to fix your walkie-talkie for you?

640
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:42,210
What? Can you fix it?

641
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,880
No.

642
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,630
Not me, but him. I'm sure he can fix it.

643
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,510
He even entered a science competition and won.

644
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,349
Really? Can you really fix it?

645
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,019
I'm not sure.

646
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,480
I'll have to see it first.

647
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,280
- Oh, so that's what it looks like. - That's cool.

648
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,489
So you can get calls but can't get radio messages, right?

649
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:11,530
Yes.

650
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,829
- What? - Why?

651
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:22,920
- I don't think this can be fixed. - What?

652
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,630
Gosh, you were so confident before. My goodness.

653
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,880
No. This is a PRC-999K model.

654
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,429
From where you're standing, if you look at the bottom left,

655
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:34,969
there's a thing called a circuit board card.

656
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:37,099
That's this thing right here.

657
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,889
Explain it in easy terms.

658
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:40,940
Look here.

659
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,940
This rectangular thing is the frequency modulator.

660
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,190
But...

661
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,320
it's missing these two parts.

662
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,739
- Really? - No way.

663
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:49,820
You're right.

664
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,739
- What's he saying? - No way.

665
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:53,239
I told you to explain it in easy terms.

666
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,070
My goodness.

667
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,119
This part is gone.

668
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:00,159
So, you're saying we can't get radio messages...

669
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,000
because we don't have this part, right?

670
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,380
Did it bump into something and get knocked out?

671
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,420
Is that what happened?

672
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,590
This can't be removed unless somebody takes it out on purpose.

673
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,050
On purpose?

674
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,849
He's saying it's not broken.

675
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:19,679
Someone took it out on purpose.

676
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:23,139
Someone did it on purpose?

677
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,980
Why?

678
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,750
(Hopeful Corrections)

679
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,590
What is it?

680
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,380
Who shot that? Was it a sphere?

681
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,719
Gosh, what do we do?

682
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:00,010
Idiot.

683
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:01,679
Hey, Yeon Bo Ra. Where are you going?

684
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,730
Hurry up!

685
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,599
Darn it.

686
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,690
- Hey, wait up! - Darn it.

687
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,690
Gosh, it was a real gun.

688
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,610
You scared me, you jerk.

689
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,280
Gosh, it was real.

690
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,610
Darn it.

691
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,659
Hey, scrawny man, nice job.

692
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:20,079
Gosh, how scary.

693
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,369
- Am I cool? - Yes, you are.

694
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:28,460
Oh, I borrowed your mom's photo for a little while.

695
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,039
We made it out thanks to that.

696
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,050
You used it like that?

697
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,760
- Unbelievable. - I got goosebumps.

698
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,969
Brother, I salute you.

699
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:38,969
Thank you very much.

700
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,309
What...

701
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:47,019
Hey, it would've been nice if you opened it sooner.

702
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,400
Did you really have to make us show you our true colours?

703
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:52,280
Still, it's a good thing that she's naive.

704
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,440
We almost died in here.

705
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,530
- I know. - Right.

706
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,780
Hey, look how soft her skin is.

707
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,070
- You're right. - Let me touch it too.

708
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:01,489
Stop that.

709
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,829
Don't quiver. It's making me want you more.

710
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:07,119
What? Really?

711
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:11,590
All right, cutie. What's going on out there right now?

712
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,969
Hey, stop wasting time and let's get going.

713
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:23,059
Mister, there's no need to rush so much.

714
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:24,849
What if the whole military is out there?

715
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:27,559
We should find out what's going on out there first.

716
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:31,269
You might have been the boss in the outside world,

717
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,030
but in here, you have to listen to us.

718
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,110
Bang.

719
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,780
Hey, you're a good shot.

720
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,659
All right, now tell me.

721
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:41,489
What are you guys hiding?

722
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:46,949
Aren't you going to talk?

723
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,679
Please let me go.

724
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:02,929
Darn it, you really won't listen!

725
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:05,099
- Hey, give me that. - Okay.

726
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:09,889
Kids! Your friend is with us.

727
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,440
Let's have a meeting!

728
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,269
Let's talk!

729
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,690
- Darn it. - Gosh.

730
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,739
Darn it!

731
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:29,210
(Yongwon Metropolitan Hospital)

732
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:30,750
- Gosh. - There are so many.

733
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:34,090
Hey, they have regular ammo,

734
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,210
and they have more than two boxes of these.

735
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,420
- Really? - Gosh.

736
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,719
But was this truck trying to get patients out?

737
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,969
Why did they leave it here?

738
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,260
Were they attacked by spheres?

739
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,519
Who cares? We have a whole lot of ammo now.

740
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,139
Is today some kind of special day? Is it our birthday today?

741
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:55,190
If the others find out, they'll be so happy, right?

742
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,320
What? Yes, right.

743
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,400
Hey, we found the medicine. This is so great.

744
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,949
Yeon Ju, why are you crying?

745
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:06,449
You should smile.

746
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:11,000
Goodness, someone might think you found a river of gold.

747
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,670
Let's grab everything and get back.

748
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,920
I want to see the others become happy too.

749
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,460
- Then I'll load up the ammo. - And I'll help.

750
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,300
Then the rest of us should go upstairs and grab what we need.

751
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,679
We can get stuff like medicine, blankets, and anything else we need.

752
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,760
Okay, then we'll go get the water tanks.

753
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:26,929
Twenty minutes should do it, right?

754
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,719
- Then let's meet back here. - Okay.

755
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,389
- All right. - Okay!

756
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:33,809
The others will be so surprised.

757
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,519
Hey, but where is Soo Chul?

758
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,650
What?

759
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,739
Did he go to the restroom for a bit?

760
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:47,119
Is that so? Then you get Soo Chul and grab the blankets.

761
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:48,869
Why should I?

762
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:52,250
Just do what you're told. Why do you ask so many questions?

763
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,539
Everyone else is helping out.

764
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,670
Hey, I'll just go.

765
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,130
Darn it. That would've been nice.

766
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,429
Then I'll see you later.

767
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,480
Who does he think he is to order me around?

768
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,820
Do your ears hurt?

769
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:30,079
Gosh, you guys got here so fast.

770
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,949
Oh, gosh. Your friends are here.

771
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,289
Jang Soo.

772
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,710
What are they doing?

773
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,130
What are you doing? Darn it! You punks!

774
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,670
What do you think you're doing?

775
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,960
Hey, you punk!

776
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,420
- Hey, jerks. Can't you see? - You darned punks!

777
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,679
Come with us.

778
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:50,300
Your friends are here. Say hi.

779
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,260
Can't you see what's going on, you little punks?

780
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,599
- Let her go first. - Open this door first, punk.

781
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,230
I'll open it if you let her go!

782
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,230
Darn it.

783
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,940
Hey, open up first. If not,

784
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,190
your friend will die. Got it?

785
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,320
She really will die.

786
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,449
Got it?

787
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:10,489
Okay?

788
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:15,039
Darn it, here we go again.

789
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,079
Hey, get on your knees.

790
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,670
Darn it!

791
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,590
Your friend is dying because of you guys.

792
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,130
Do you not care?

793
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,469
She really will die.

794
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,309
She's not our friend.

795
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,780
You nasty wench. Hang on. What are you doing?

796
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,900
- You guys, aim your guns too. - Bo Ra.

797
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,570
We have seven guns. And they only have one.

798
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,320
Don't you see Ae Seol is being held hostage?

799
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,880
Darn it, what are they doing?

800
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:14,389
Hey.

801
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:16,559
Do you want to see your friend die?

802
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,019
I told you, she's not our friend.

803
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:20,389
She acted however she wanted and got everyone in danger.

804
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,440
She's no friend of ours.

805
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,230
Yeon Bo Ra. Just calm down for now.

806
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,360
Bo Ra is right.

807
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,690
There's no need to give in to these criminals' demands.

808
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:31,239
Darn it, we're screwed. They have so many guns.

809
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,869
No, they're bluffing.

810
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,909
- Can't you see his hands trembling? - Darn it.

811
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,289
- Gosh. - Oh, man.

812
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:43,789
Hey! You darned punks! Open up!

813
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:46,460
I have to get out of here... Darn it.

814
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,510
Gosh.

815
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,340
If you just open these doors, no one gets hurt and it'll all be over.

816
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,929
Let Ae Seol go first.

817
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:11,489
Just go.

818
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:19,329
And I'm really sorry for causing this situation.

819
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:38,309
Shut your mouth, you wench.

820
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:41,099
You darn stupid idiot.

821
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,099
Why do you have to act up?

822
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,059
You filthy moron.

823
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,769
Darn it!

824
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,730
Look at you, idiot.

825
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,440
Kids.

826
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,900
I'm sorry.

827
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:57,159
That must hurt.

828
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:58,869
It must be painful.

829
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:00,039
Get up. It's all right.

830
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,829
No!

831
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:06,210
- You little... - Hey!

832
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,840
- Get up. - What are you doing? Stop!

833
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,960
It's been darn hard for me to hold it in.

834
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,300
Please stop!

835
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,050
Kids, it's time for sex education.

836
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,260
We'll teach you how babies are made.

837
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,179
Stop, darn it!

838
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:19,050
Stop.

839
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,719
- Stop! - What are you looking at?

840
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:24,769
I said, stop!

841
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,400
Darn it! Get your hands off her!

842
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:42,119
Darn.

843
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,159
Goodness.

844
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:46,829
Should I go first?

845
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,250
Never mind.

846
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,550
Kids, I will give you...

847
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,260
just 10 minutes.

848
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,090
If you're even a second late,

849
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,969
I won't be able to stop these guys.

850
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,510
Gosh, a scent of woman.

851
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,019
Do you understand, Bo Ra?

852
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,949
Okay.

853
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,369
Goodness.

854
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,630
Let's just release them.

855
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:38,880
There's no other way.

856
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:40,090
Then what?

857
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:43,059
Do you think they will let Ae Seol go that easily?

858
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,429
All of us will be in danger.

859
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,940
Then what do we do?

860
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,519
Darn it! Those despicable scums.

861
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:02,699
What is it?

862
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:04,369
Spheres?

863
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:05,619
Where did they suddenly come from?

864
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:08,869
There are four.

865
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,289
They're approaching near.

866
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,460
What do we do?

867
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:13,880
Why even the spheres now?

868
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,469
Given this speed, they'll enter the building in a few minutes.

869
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:21,389
It can't be helped.

870
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,010
Let's release them.

871
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:25,760
Gosh.

872
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,099
What if they just ran off?

873
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,309
Maybe we're doomed for being all laid back.

874
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,940
Whether it's war or anything,

875
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:37,110
something definitely happened outside.

876
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,400
In that case, going outside unprepared...

877
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:43,159
could be more dangerous.

878
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,320
Hey.

879
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:46,739
Is it really true that the spheres or whatever fell from the sky...

880
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,119
and caused a disaster outside?

881
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:50,369
Be honest with me. Where did you come from?

882
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,039
Tell me.

883
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,710
Say something, you wench.

884
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,840
You should've cornered them even more...

885
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,210
instead of giving them 10 minutes.

886
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,800
They couldn't have run off, could they?

887
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,590
It's not that I don't trust you.

888
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,010
They will come back.

889
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,219
Look at her.

890
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:09,139
She's young, but she doesn't even weep for mercy.

891
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:10,389
She just told them to go.

892
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,059
Couldn't you tell by that?

893
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,650
And think of how they looked at her.

894
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:16,900
I won't doubt you.

895
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:26,579
- They're here. - See?

896
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:27,789
Good to see you.

897
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,659
Welcome.

898
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,079
- It's nice to see you. - Welcome.

899
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,750
Nice to see you.

900
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,719
Two are missing.

901
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,800
What's there to worry, mister?

902
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,429
Maybe they ran off.

903
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:46,889
Everyone, back off.

904
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:48,349
And send Ae Seol over to us first.

905
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:49,639
The door first.

906
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:51,269
Open it quickly.

907
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:53,019
We have no time for this.

908
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,019
Kids, put the guns down.

909
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,269
It's dangerous.

910
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,070
- Tell them to put them far away. - Yes, put them far away.

911
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,860
Put them away over there.

912
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,400
Put them down.

913
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,110
- Put them down. - Come on.

914
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,949
There's no need to fight.

915
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:07,199
- Hurry up. - Come on.

916
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,659
There's no time.

917
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:09,699
I won't let you have her.

918
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,199
Do you want her or not?

919
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:13,500
Hurry up.

920
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,460
- Come on. - Do you want her?

921
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,679
Now open the door.

922
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,139
Open it.

923
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,139
There you go.

924
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,719
Open it already.

925
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,849
Stick it in.

926
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,650
And turn it.

927
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,730
Now the door is open.

928
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,860
That's smart of you. Good boy.

929
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,360
That's worth an award certificate.

930
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:48,949
Now let Ae Seol go.

931
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:50,329
Ae Seol?

932
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:51,739
Who's that?

933
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,960
Why are you all so serious?

934
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,090
All right. Hey, go.

935
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,300
Send her over.

936
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,750
- Send her over. - Ae Seol.

937
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,760
It's all right. Let's go.

938
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,719
Goodness, you're heavy.

939
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:10,050
Let's go.

940
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:13,469
You went through a lot, Ae Seol.

941
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:14,769
It was only for a moment,

942
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:16,099
but my feelings were sincere.

943
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:18,690
Go.

944
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,110
All right.

945
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,739
Now she's on her way.

946
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,360
Okay? Kids.

947
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:31,199
This seems to be all.

948
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,369
Gosh, I'm tired.

949
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,699
Why aren't the others coming?

950
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,289
What was that sound?

951
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,989
Goodness!

952
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,909
What is it?

953
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:22,460
Oh, my.

954
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,880
Now go.

955
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,309
It was a lie!

956
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:38,230
It was a lie!

957
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:39,389
Run!

958
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:41,230
Bang!

959
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,559
One kill. Two kills.

960
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:43,809
What's "three" in English?

961
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,780
Be gentle. Or they will bleed.

962
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,440
Two, three.

963
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:54,699
We're finally freed!

964
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:25,769
(Duty After School)

965
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:41,960
Even if you all criticize me, it can't be helped.

966
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,420
Now even I don't know...

967
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:49,880
if I'm doing right.

968
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:57,389
But...

969
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,519
But I want to put an end to it.

970
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:27,380
