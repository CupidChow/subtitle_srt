A year ago, except for polar regions and some areas in Russia,

83
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,430

85

and roads across the world were a mess.

We couldn't sit idly by though.

91
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,949
We must launch a preemptive attack!

92
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,569
Attack!

93
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,540
Hold on a second. Why are they doubling in numbers?

94
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,120
If we keep on attacking them,

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,040
they might take up all the space and we'll be doomed by...

96
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,920
I mean, it could lead to a dangerous situation...

97
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,509
which is why the mission was aborted.

98
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,470

99
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,300

101

were thoroughly analyzed,

103
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,399

104
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,819
that the spheres were a danger to mankind.

105

so we were to live our lives normally.

108

Why couldn't they simply put it like that?

109
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,290
The only major change in our lives...

110
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,370
was that we traveled by ship now rather than plane.

111
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,370
Traveling via hot air balloons became a new trend,

112
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,170
but we learned to live with the spheres...

113
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,709
without suffering any specific changes.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,879
But don't you think that the spheres...

115
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,430
look like eyes that are hunting their prey?

116
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,470
They could attack us at any second.

117
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,350
Or maybe thinking that...

I haven't gotten my nicotine fix. So I'm really sensitive right now.

368
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,309
Stay still.

369
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,769
Bo Ra. I'm the toughest guy in our class.

370
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,690
- Sure. So where is it? - Hey.

371
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,769
- Come on. Where is it? - Why are you touching me?

372
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,230
Wait.

373
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:12,529
Hold on.

374
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,990
Right. I smoked all of them yesterday.

375
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,700
Come on.

376
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,910
Sorry.

377
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,000
Him. Bo Ra.

378
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,579
Hey, don't touch me.

379
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,829
Okay. I'll look for it.

380
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,430
Two cigarettes still remain with me.

381
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,970
I thank you for your generosity.

382
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:45,390
All right. Thank you.

383
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Come on.

384
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,319
- Jerks. - Do you want to die?

385
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,240
Gosh. What's taking her so long?

386
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,069
You know that she's slow.

387
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,819
Seriously. The bell is going to ring soon.

388
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,779
Hey, Bo Ra.

389
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,910
Bo Ra. Here's the portable battery.

390
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Hey.

391
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:15,589
I told you not to call me by my name.

392
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:17,049
I'm not your friend.

393
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,890
Sorry.

394
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,559
Beat it.

395
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:26,180
- What? - Come on.

396
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,019
Ae Seol, you should go.

397
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,390
Go.

398
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,519
Calm down. You scared her.

399
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,859
- Ae Seol. Bye. - Ae Seol. Bye.

400
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:36,819
You guys are so mean.

401
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:38,240
- Hey, be nice to her. - What?

402
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,029
Hey.

403
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,910
Let's go inside.

404
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,579
Ma'am.

405
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,670
- Hello. - Hello.

406
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,960
Hello.

407
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,579
Go in already.

408
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,170
It smells.

409
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,089
- I told you that! - No!

410
00:22:58,089 --> 00:22:59,970
- You should be in your seats! - Hurry.

411
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,930
- Come on. - I'm late.

412
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,390
- Is that good? - Goodness.

413
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,680
That's your problem.

414
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Stop it!

415
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,849
- Attention. - Gosh.

416
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:09,980
- Come on. - Be quiet!

417
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,400
Attention!

418
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,269
I have a present for you.

419
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,109
The report cards for the mock test from September.

420
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,619
And there is one more thing.

421
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,490
I'll distribute them in the order of your scores.

422
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,950
- What? - Come on.

423
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,660
- That's not right. - No!

424
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,829
- You can't do that. - Ma'am.

425
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:32,250
- Be quiet! - I don't want that!

426
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:34,460
When I call your name, come up here.

427
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,299
Let me begin.

428
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:39,509
First place in our class as well as the entire senior class.

429
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Young Hoon.

430
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,390
Give a round of applause.

431
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,690
Young Soo, second place.

432
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,230
- Young Soo. - Young Soo.

433
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,690
Yu Jung, third place.

434
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,980
- Class President! - Nice.

435
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,400
- Young Sin. - Gosh.

436
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,450
- Thank you. - Yeon Ju.

437
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,910
- Hey. - Hey.

438
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,079
- Jang Soo, good job. - You did so well, Yeon Ju.

439
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,079
- So jealous. - Na Ra.

440
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,490
(Report Card for September Mock Test)

441
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,710
All right. Two students came in last with the same mark.

442
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,250
- Let's not humiliate them! - Right!

443
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,710
There are only two of you. What's the point?

444
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,299
Il Ha. Hee Rak. Come on up.

445
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,420
- A round of applause, everyone! - They came in last.

446
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,930
Gosh. Unbelievable.

447
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,259
Seriously.

448
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Thank you.

449
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Thank you.

450
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,849
Let's study harder next time.

451
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:34,559
- Okay. - Okay.

452
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,440
Hey, you two!

453
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,950
Can every single teacher please come...

454
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,119
to the teachers' office immediately?

455
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,789
I will repeat.

456
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,710
Can every single teacher please come...

457
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,589
- to the teachers' office? - That's all.

458
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,339
Prepare for class.

459
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,970
Hand in your phones!

460
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:06,640
- Okay. - Oh, darn it.

461
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,640
Hand in your phones!

462
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,309
- Hand in your phones. - Do as you're told.

463
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,309
Come on.

464
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:17,900
- Give me a few minutes. - No.

465
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:24,740
Hey. Better luck next time.

466
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,450
- Kimchi. - What?

467
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,160
See what's going on.

468
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:29,740
In the teachers' office?

469
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:32,910
Me?

470
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Excuse me.

471
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,079
Go, now.

472
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,670
Okay. I'll go.

473
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,009
Why? Do you have a hunch?

474
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:48,180
I have this real bad feeling.

475
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,759
I don't like it.

476
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,650
What?

477
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,740
This is too sudden.

478
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,400
And the seniors...

479
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,740
Ms. Park.

480
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,869
My goodness. Ms. Park.

481
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,200
Let's go back upstairs.

482
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:17,960
Chi Yeol.

483
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,920
It doesn't work.

484
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:27,220
It looks like...

485
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,299
Hey. Wait, isn't it time for class?

486
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:31,930
What a loser.

487
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:38,640
Guys.

488
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,319
- The rolling admission's canceled. - What?

489
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,319
- What... - What do you mean?

490
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,529
Is something wrong?

491
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:50,950
- What? - Why cancel that?

492
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,240
- That's weird. - Ms. Park. Are you serious?

493
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,450
What's the matter?

494
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,700
Are you sure?

495
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,750
Does that go for all high schools?

496
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,170
What happens to people who applied?

497
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,589
Wait a minute.

498
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,670
This is nonsense.

499
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,299
Yes, we scored.

500
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,890
No, canceling rolling admissions isn't enough.

501
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:16,640
Don't we need the CSAT to be canceled?

502
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,180
That's what we want.

503
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,269
Will you hear me out?

504
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,809
Only the rolling admissions got canceled.

505
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,940
The CSAT will happen as scheduled.

506
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,440
The CSAT's on?

507
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,859
And...

508
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,920
I'll explain slowly if you all concentrate.

509
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:51,009
The Minister of National Defense will release...

510
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:53,799
a statement regarding the Student Reserve Forces.

511
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,099
We'll head over to a reporter who's on site.

512
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,640
Oh Eun Ji will report.

513
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:02,730
I'm outside the briefing room at the Ministry of National Defense.

514
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,480
An emergency announcement will soon be made.

515
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:09,940
Minister Park Sang Man just stepped onto the podium.

516
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,900
Let's hear what he has to say.

517
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,410
(Ministry of National Defense)

518
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:19,700
I'm Minister Park Sang Man.

519
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:24,289
It has been a year since the unidentified spheres...

520
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,000
appeared in our skies.

521
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:29,460
As of now, we cannot determine the level of threat,

522
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,089
- but at any moment... - Isn't a minister high up?

523
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:34,299
- Super high up. - To be prepared,

524
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:39,509
please understand we must issue a nationwide mobilization order.

525
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,680
- A what? - A nationwide...

526
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,440
Other than military personnel who are currently serving,

527
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,349
those who will soon be drafted,

528
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,359
military reservists,

529
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,569
male and female adults up to the age of 24,

530
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:52,690
and...

531
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,569
those who are currently high-school seniors...

532
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,490
will all be mobilized.

533
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,700
High-school seniors?

534
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,950
- Us? - Us?

535
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,410
- Why us? - What about the CSAT?

536
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,920
- Why us? - What does that mean?

537
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,210
What happens to us seniors?

538
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,539
Be quiet so I can listen.

539
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,210
Students will be contacted through their schools.

540
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:13,720
We have no choice...

541
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,680
but to cancel the rolling admissions...

542
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,680
to all universities and colleges...

543
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,430
for the year 2023.

544
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,599
They're canceled?

545
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,140
It must be for real. It's all over the internet.

546
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,849
We hope to keep regular admissions open as scheduled.

547
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,150
High-school seniors will receive military training...

548
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,359
besides their regular classes.

549
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:37,319
The government has decided to grant extra points...

550
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,700
to students who agree to receive military training.

551
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,039
- What does that mean? - We'll discuss the extra points...

552
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,579
with the Ministry of Education...

553
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,630
We have classes and military training?

554
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,789
What's this about military training and extra points?

555
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,839
- We still have to take the CSAT? - What a stupid question.

556
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:56,259
It doesn't make sense.

557
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,099
Silence!

558
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:01,430
Silence.

559
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,640
As you just heard, there will be military training...

560
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:07,230
apart from your regular classes.

561
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,650
The government says you're categorized as reservists.

562
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,569
You're reserve forces,

563
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:17,400
so don't worry too much.

564
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:23,660
(Performance assessment, 12th Grade, Sungjin High School)

565
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,369
Yu Jung, hand these out.

566
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:26,450
Okay.

567
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,460
What's that?

568
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,500
- It must be for real. - What about the CSAT?

569
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,799
- Hey, move it! - Move faster.

570
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,799
(Military Training Consent Form)

571
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,970
What the heck?

572
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,349
- Be quick. - Sorry.

573
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:46,059
That's a military training consent form.

574
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,099
Show it to your parents.

575
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:49,640
- For real? - No way.

576
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:52,400
Ms. Park. We must camp together?

577
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,569
What happens to people who don't sign this?

578
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:57,109
I'm not sure,

579
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,279
but it'll be replaced with a remote learning class.

580
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,619
How many extra points do we get?

581
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,910
Is there a differential system?

582
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,910
The details will come out later.

583
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,670
I'll share as soon as I hear from the Ministry of Education.

584
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,000
What I am sure about is that only those...

585
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,630
who apply for military training get extra points.

586
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,380
Get the form signed if you want them.

587
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:22,930
Ms. Park. What about people who'll major in performing arts?

588
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,349
Are we going to war?

589
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:27,019
What if we're skipping college?

590
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,349
How long will the training last?

591
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:29,519
What if we quit halfway through?

592
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,849
Where will the training take place?

593
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,440
I know you're flustered and in shock.

594
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,400
I am too.

595
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,569
But...

596
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,079
let's not worry.

597
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:50,210
Keep studying hard and stick with the military training too.

598
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,289
Just keep doing what you always did.

599
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,670
Don't forget the years of work...

600
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,299
you put in to go to a good university.

601
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,420
Okay?

602
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,930
What the heck...

603
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,349
- Study hard! - What?

604
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,190
- Ms. Park, we're not... - Ms. Park!

605
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,109
- Ms. Park. - Explain what's going on!

606
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,779
- What's happening? - Ms. Park!

607
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,630
Hey, look at this.

608
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,839
"Worst national defense crisis since the constitution."

609
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,599
- This means there will be war. - No way.

610
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,220
Why does it have to be high-school seniors?

611
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,349
What about the others?

612
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:55,019
I know. Shouldn't we be exempt so we can study?

613
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:56,480
That's more fair.

614
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,019
To us, college is everything.

615
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,940
How hard would we train if they offered up extra points?

616
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,819
That's why it's us.

617
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,740
For the first time in your life, you sounded convincing.

618
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,240
They won't suddenly start a war, will they?

619
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,369
- Against what? - Them.

620
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,039
- Against them? - Yes.

621
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,039
It would look pathetic to go to war...

622
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,210
- against balloons. - Would it?

623
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,630
It's true!

624
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,670
What? You got it too?

625
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,630
For real?

626
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,140
I don't know. Maybe we'll fight the balloons.

627
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,599
Bye.

628
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,140
Shut your mouth. Bye.

629
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,940
Take care. See you.

630
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,569
It must be for real.

631
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,240
Hey. If you're done, skip off to your own seat.

632
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,779
I don't want to.

633
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
There's a penalty for not handing in your phone.

634
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,670
If I beat you to a pulp,

635
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:04,799
how many penalty points do I get?

636
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,800
What? Are you scared?

637
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,599
- Darn you. - Oh, no!

638
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,280
You scumbag.

639
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,949
- Stop them. - You stop them!

640
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,420
Darn you.

641
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,380
- You scumbag. - You scumbag.

642
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,539
What?

643
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,210
Stop them! Do something!

644
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,099
You're all so annoying!

645
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,940
- Come at me! - Darn you.

646
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:00,349
Screw you.

647
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:02,440
- Stop it! - Let go!

648
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,780
What, dirtbag? What?

649
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:13,530
My gosh...

650
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,300
Hey. Soldiers.

651
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:30,050
Guys.

652
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,760
What?

653
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,809
What are they doing here?

654
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,400
- I don't know. - It must be that.

655
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,500
All personnel and firearms accounted for.

656
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,920
Unpack the firearms first.

657
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
The rest, head indoors.

658
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:13,510
We're screwed.

659
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,889
I should call Mom.

660
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,309
It looks serious.

661
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,309
What's going on?

662
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,190
- Unbelievable. - We just found out about it.

663
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,650
They can't be here for us.

664
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,250

665
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,179
(Band-aids)

666
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:00,969
Are you all right?

667
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,730
About what?

668
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,690
You fought earlier.

669
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
So,

670
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,530
the kids in our class are nice if you get to know them.

671
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,449
You could become friends or...

672
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:18,739
I don't want to make friends.

673
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:21,619
We're just passing acquaintances.

674
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:25,420
You meet and befriend people like you after school.

675
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,420
That's easier.

676
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,090
You don't have to be so considerate or cautious.

677
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,670
People who will benefit me.

678
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,710
Those are my friends.

679
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,179
Oh, I see.

680
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:41,429
Is that it?

681
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:48,150
Will you sign the military training consent form?

682
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,690
I can't sign it.

683
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,570
My parents have to.

684
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:04,539
See you.

685
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,420
Mom.

686
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,550
Who will care for your siblings if you go to training camp?

687
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,550
Mom and Dad leave for work at dawn.

688
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,550
Can't you just study at home?

689
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,969
The other kids will get extra points.

690
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:23,639
One point could mean an Ivy League school.

691
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,889
No rolling admissions means I have a much better chance.

692
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,599
I'm worried about the younger kids.

693
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,110
Why should I always sacrifice for them?

694
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Sign it.

695
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,650
Okay, fine.

696
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,539
You said you'd be late.

697
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,829
Yes, but I left early.

698
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,539
You said...

699
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,539
you'd draw cartoons or something.

700
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,590
You don't need a college degree.

701
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,630
Staying alone at home will be so boring.

702
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,800
I'd rather be with the others.

703
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:01,550
Okay, then.

704
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,679
Don't sleep out because I'm not home.

705
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,849
And don't go clubbing as much.

706
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:13,059
My gosh. Listen, I'm your mom and it's my life to live.

707
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Cheers.

(Military Training Consent Form)

709
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,610
I don't want to go.

710
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,530
Why bother when I can't go to college anyway?

711
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,239
Whether you go to college or not,

712
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,659
I can't stand the sight of you doing nothing at home.

713
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,409
Can we have another soju?

714
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:32,210
Yes, of course.

715
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,670
There will be this online class.

716
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,380
You don't even study at school.

717
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,050
I'll be darned if I believe you'd study at home.

718
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,679
Go to training.

719
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:48,980
But I don't want to.

720
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,360
Do your best.

721
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,610
Do all you can to get extra points.

722
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,159
Raise your hand and volunteer for training, okay?

723
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:09,039
Now you must compete with...

724
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,210
all the gifted kids from the special high schools.

725
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,420
Don't you fail to get into Seoul National University...

726
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,750
over a few points.

727
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,550
Okay, so stop it.

728
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,429
This is such an important time...

729
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:25,929
and you got into a fight?

730
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:30,889
I said I fell.

731
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,059
- I'll take it. - But...

732
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:36,400
Okay, good.

733
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,530
Don't take too long a break, okay?

734
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,860
Okay, Private Ryan.

735
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,329
He's packing excitedly, of course.

736
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:53,659
Here.

737
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,670
Why are you taking this?

738
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,050
Mom, this is the most precious one.

739
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,550
You fool.

740
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,130
You're my son, but you're such an embarrassment.

741
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,429
Oh. No, not at all.

742
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,099
I'm worried, of course.

743
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,719
But what can I do?

744
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,639
They have to do it.

745
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,769
- Yes. - Okay.

746
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,139
Yes.

747
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
We must trust them when they say school's safer.

748
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,610
Okay, bye.

749
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:26,030
You need things like this when you train.

750
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,570
The more, the better.

751
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,369
It's just four weeks. I'll never use all this up.

752
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Dad.

753
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,710
What will we do?

754
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,039
You'll do things like run,

755
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,460
learn how to pack your bags, and shoot.

756
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,590
Don't you worry.

757
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:47,590
You're like me, so you'll do fine.

758
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,099
When I was in the army,

759
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,019
I was a top marksman and model squad leader.

760
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:56,889
Mom said you didn't go to the actual army.

761
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,820
Go on, help him pack.

762
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,489
You'll be with your friends,

763
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,699
so do as the soldiers say,

764
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,369
and eat well.

765
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:16,119
Don't get hurt.

766
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,420
Are you crying? Why would you cry?

767
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,380
Chi Yeol, look after yourself.

768
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,300
Just come back healthy and safely, okay?

769
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,849
Don't worry.

770
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,639
Will you just sign this for me?

771
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:40,519
Darn it.

772
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,070
Why are you crying when he's not going off to his death?

773
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,949
What if he does?

774
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,170
Whatever.

775
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,590
I'm not going off to die.

776
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,170
Why make a fuss?

777
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,889
(Let's go to university!)

778
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:34,159
Move it.

779
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:37,699
Hey.

780
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:38,869
Hello.

781
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,789
- Just a quick photo. - Leave it.

782
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:41,789
Salute!

783
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,670
(Sungjin High School)

784
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,710
Hello, there.

785
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,670
- You filled it in? - Yes.

786
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,670
Awesome.

787
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,510
Do Yoon, did you fill it in?

788
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,260
That's insane.

789
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,519
I'll come for kimchi stew afterward.

790
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:58,519
Hey.

791
00:43:58,519 --> 00:43:59,769
Good morning!

792
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,349
Go away, will you?

793
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,150
- One, two, three. - One...

794
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,570
Gosh, you brought a lot of stuff.

795
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,690
Most of them filled in the form.

796
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,159
My mom hates the idea of me...

797
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:17,159
not going to college more than going to training.

798
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,250
Mine too. I was so shocked.

799
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,619
Ha Na, are you emigrating? Why did you bring two suitcases?

800
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,920
I had a hard time cutting them down to two.

801
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,710
I only brought half my makeup.

802
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,130
Did you set up a chewing gum store?

803
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,550
Yes.

804
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:33,929
My post-meal dessert.

805
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:35,849
To freshen my palate.

806
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,389
Do you want one?

807
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,349
- Hey! Just brush your teeth! - Hey! Just brush your teeth!

808
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,019
You're disgusting.

809
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,230
- Go away. - How gross.

810
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,860
Why are you acting like you need to pee?

811
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,489
It's nothing.

812
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,079
Hi, Na Ra.

813
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
You!

814
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,929
You...

815
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:18,889
- What about me? - Your face turned red.

816
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,760
What?

817
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,429
- Na Ra! - Don't.

818
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,809
Don't you dare.

819
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,980
Go to your seats.

820
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,110
Kwon Il Ha.

821
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Did you sleep well?

822
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Listen up.

823
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:42,289
There's someone you need to meet.

824
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Salute.

825
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,630
Nice to meet you.

826
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,670
I'm Lieutenant Lee Chun Ho, your platoon commander,

827
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,170
in charge of Class 3-2.

828
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,380
Lieutenant Lee...

829
00:45:57,469 --> 00:45:59,679
will explain your training regime.

830
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:02,219
There's a diamond on his forehead.

831
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:09,559
You are Sungjin High Battalion Combat Platoon Two.

832
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,820
I'm your commander.

833
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,320
Most of the training will happen...

834
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,989
in the evening, after your regular classes.

835
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:20,239
- What? After school? - No way.

836
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,829
- After school? - I need to play games.

837
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,869
If there's a special agenda,

838
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,039
training will take priority.

839
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,119
Keep that in mind.

840
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,710
Class president.

841
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,460
Yes?

842
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,590
You're the Senior Private.

843
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,010
- What? - What does that mean?

844
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
I don't know.

845
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,010
- Do you know? - What's a Senior Private?

846
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:44,679
Next, I'll select a clerk who'll record your training...

847
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:48,480
as well as your videos to send home.

848
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:50,769
Any volunteers?

849
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,730
Hey, look away. Don't look at him.

850
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,860
- You do it. - Are you crazy? Why me?

851
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,150
Don't volunteer.

852
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,150
No one?

853
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,530
Broadcasting Club, anyone?

854
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,789
Then I'll randomly select...

855
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,409
Mr. Commander?

856
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,079
Can I recommend someone?

857
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,579
Young Hoon.

858
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,289
Will you have a go?

859
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,090
Me?

860
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,010
Yes. I think you'd learn a lot...

861
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,969
from the experience.

862
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,969
What should I learn?

863
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:29,349
Jang Young Hoon. Just do it. It's not a big deal.

864
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,269
Then you do it.

865
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
Give it a go and if you don't like it,

866
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,320
I'll let you swap.

867
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,570
I have to study.

868
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,409
I don't want to waste my time.

869
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,619
Gosh, what a punk.

870
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:45,489
That's fine.

871
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,119
I told you he's weird.

872
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,500
What a piece of work.

873
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,750
You there, Private.

874
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,849
He means you, idiot.

875
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:11,440
Who... Me?

876
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,809
You're the clerk.

877
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,349
Any objections?

878
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,980
Well...

879
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,530
No.

880
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,610
You get three bonus points.

881
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,570
- What? - What?

882
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,409
So does the Senior Private.

883
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:25,619
What?

884
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,829
- Just like that? - So many points?

885
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:30,789
There's a bonus point system separate to the extra CSAT points.

886
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,710
You'll be scored for your attitude and aptitude,

887
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,630
and ten bonus points equals one extra CSAT point.

888
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,130
Accumulate 30 penalty points and you'll be discharged.

889
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:44,050
All the extra CSAT points you earned will be scrubbed.

890
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,429
- What? - What the heck?

891
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,519
- Darn it. - Then...

892
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,269
we'll head to the dormitory.

893
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,349
The dormitory?

894
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,019
- Where's that? - What?

895
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,309
A dormitory?

896
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:57,769
We have one?

897
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,739
Go away!

898
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:08,619
- I told you. - Get moving, you jerk.

899
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:10,539
- Hey! - Ouch. Get lost.

900
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,659
- Darn you. - Go!

901
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,329
Hurry up, will you?

902
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,920
Each locker has a name on it. Find your name.

903
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,460
That's your spot.

904
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,670
Get moving quickly.

905
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,880
- Hello. - Hey. He said "quickly."

906
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:27,010
- Look at my bowl. - Here's mine.

907
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:29,679
- Hey! - Look, that's us!

908
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:31,849
- Hey! - Nice!

909
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,150
Darn it. I can't sleep on a bad mattress.

910
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:41,070
As if. You always sleep at your desk and drool all over it.

911
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,070
Hey, don't you feel like we're here to shoot "Real Men?"

912
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,030
Oh, you're right.

913
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,820
Private Woo Hee Rak!

914
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,199
- Private First Class Wang Tae Man! - Kim Duk Joong!

915
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,289
Let's go!

916
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,119
Attention.

917
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:00,420
Oh, no!

918
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,550
Unpack and get settled in quickly.

919
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,059
We will distribute firearms in the field.

920
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:16,480
Assemble in the field in exactly 30 minutes from now.

921
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,190
Do you understand?

922
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,820
Yes. We got it, sir!

923
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,030
- Yes, sir. - Hey.

924
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:31,659
That's all for now.

925
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:38,460
You little...

926
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,670
Bye.

927
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,590
"Assemble in exactly 30 minutes from now. Go!"

928
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:43,840
Yes!

929
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,670
- Hey, did you see that jerk's name? - What is it?

930
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,170
- His name is Won Bin! - Won Bin?

931
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,719
Why is he so tanned?

932
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,599
Was it always this big?

933
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:53,389
Hey, I brought this.

934
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:54,599
I brought this too.

935
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:57,139
- Great minds think alike! - Yes!

936
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:58,849
- How many did you bring? - I brought tons.

937
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:00,730
Me too. We should eat it while we're here.

938
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,150
- Totally. - My mom won't let me eat it.

939
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,690
Girls, what did you bring?

940
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,110
I brought my perfume.

941
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:07,489
- Oh! Can I smell it? - It smells really good.

942
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:08,650
- I want to smell it too. - What do you think?

943
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,659
- Hey, it smells so good! - It smells really good.

944
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:11,739
- Hey. - I want some too.

945
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:14,530
- Can I have some too? - Girls, I brought my camera.

946
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,119
- Nice! - Let's take pictures.

947
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,329
Gather around.

948
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:21,380
All right, 1, 2, 3. Make a V!

949
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,880
- No! - Don't let anyone see them.

950
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,510
- Don't reveal your cards. - Only you can see them.

951
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,010
But what is this?

952
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,139
It's the November card. Double Junks.

953
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:34,929
It's my grandma's favorite card.

954
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:37,309
Put it here. It's the same month.

955
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:51,320
You're a liar.

956
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,909
You've done this before.

957
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:55,780
Go on and play.

958
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,039
Hey, girls. What does "personal firearms" mean?

959
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:03,750
- I don't know. - No idea.

960
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,630
Personal guns, you idiot.

961
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,550
- I see. They're guns. - Oh, look!

962
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:10,219
- Oh, my. - That looks awesome.

963
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:11,300
Hey, let's take lots of pictures.

964
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,969
- Attention. - Hey, of course!

965
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:15,219
- I told you. - I told you too.

966
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,179
- Attention! - Goodness.

967
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:19,349
Do you think this is a camping trip?

968
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:23,400
Listen carefully.

969
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,940
Any items that you won't need here...

970
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,480
must be submitted at once.

971
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
- What is this? - No!

972
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,489
- Curling irons, toys, lipsticks! - Oh, no.

973
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:39,119
Foundation, perfume... What? A scented candle?

974
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,909
Your foundation, lipstick...

975
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:43,920
You little...

976
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,130
Hey, quick.

977
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,289
- Don't move. - Hide this, quick!

978
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,500
What? Cigarettes?

979
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,880
Girls, get moving at once!

980
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,429
Go!

981
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:56,429
Hey, hurry!

982
00:52:56,429 --> 00:52:59,139
Submit them all. Why you little...

983
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:01,429
That moment, I just knew.

984
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,769
(Hong Jun Hee, Park So Yoon)

985
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:06,690
This is so wrong.

986
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:10,690
Hey, can we take back our agreement?

987
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,449
What? No one's doing that?

988
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:16,239
Gosh.

989
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,119
- Darn it! - Darn it!

990
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,829
The seniors in the classrooms...

991
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:24,960
Make sure you check the number of students.

992
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,250
- Assemble at once. - Yes, sir.

993
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,630
- Once you check in... - Move it!

994
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,800
- Hurry! - Class Two!

995
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,719
- Fall into one line. - Form a line.

996
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:36,179
Fall into one line.

997
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,639
Hurry up!

998
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:39,760
- Go, quick. This way. - Class Two!

999
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,179
- Hurry up. - Fall into one line.

1000
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:44,639
- Which class? - Class Two!

1001
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,349
- Hurry! - Stand over here.

1002
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,110
Attention.

1003
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,940
We'll distribute firearms now, so focus!

1004
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,320
Stay still, will you?

1005
00:53:54,989 --> 00:53:58,239
Hey, Young Hoon. Do you want to be a clerk?

1006
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:03,449
Well, I don't really need the bonus points.

1007
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:06,619
But you could really use some extra points.

1008
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:09,380
My gosh.

1009
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,300
- But... - Hey, Kimchi.

1010
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,090
The platoon leader told you to do it.

1011
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,050
Stop bugging him. You should just do it.

1012
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,139
Oh, okay.

1013
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:27,309
When you receive your firearm, shout the serial number.

1014
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,480
Do you understand?

1015
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,480
I can barely hear you. Do you understand?

1016
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,769
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

1017
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,829
Private Kim Yu Jung.

1018
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:45,159
It's 701404.

1019
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:46,579
Thank you.

1020
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:50,670
Private Kim Duk Joong. Serial number 701403!

1021
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:51,670
Next.

1022
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,210
- Next. - Next.

1023
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,670
The weight's not bad.

1024
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,510
Who said you could goof around with a firearm in your hand?

1025
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:03,349
Oh, I'm sorry.

1026
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,190
What makes them think they could give us guns?

1027
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:12,690
- I wonder too. - Next.

1028
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,360
Private Kim Chi Yeol.

1029
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,650
Serial number 701406. That's it.

1030
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,909
Next.

1031
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,670
- Look at this. - My gosh.

1032
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:39,469
Gosh, it's so heavy. We have to carry it around all the time?

1033
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:40,929
Right? It's nuts.

1034
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:43,260
If we lose it, we get kicked out. We'll have to pay a fine too.

1035
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,969
Hey, doesn't it look just like the ones you see in the game?

1036
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:48,559
But they don't use the M16 rifle in the game.

1037
00:55:48,769 --> 00:55:51,309
There's too much rebound, and it's too loud.

1038
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,110
Where does the M16 appear? 5 or 7?

1039
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:57,280
Are you that dumb? You've played the game thousands of times.

1040
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,860
It was Five.

1041
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,530
Of course, you know everything about the game.

1042
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:04,739
Darn, I wish I got the Kar98k. That's my specialty.

1043
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:05,949
Hey.

1044
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:08,909
Shut it and run.

1045
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,460
No.

1046
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:12,869
- Run. - Go!

1047
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,380
Hold on, guys. Give me just two seconds.

1048
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,460
- Two seconds? - Go!

1049
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,960
- Go. Run! - Just two seconds.

1050
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,710
Go. Get him!

1051
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,219
- What are you doing? - Help me.

1052
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:23,929
Hey, guys. Goodness. What are you doing?

1053
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:25,639
- Oh, my. - You little brats.

1054
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:26,809
Hey, wait. Hey!

1055
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:28,969
Hey, get back here. Goodness.

1056
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:30,269
Sit back down!

1057
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:32,769
- Move over. - Hey!

1058
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:33,980
Your break is over. Assemble.

1059
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,730
You guys too. Assemble!

1060
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,530
Come on down!

1061
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,650
You guys, stop that and assemble!

1062
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,909
Hey, old man!

1063
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:47,659
"Old man?"

1064
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,829
I'm not old!

1065
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,789
I'm 21.

1066
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm only two years older than you guys.

1067
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,469
I see. He's 21.

1068
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:08,309
What's his deal? Anyone can tell he's 21.

1069
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:11,519
- Hey, old man. - Yes?

1070
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:15,730
Can I get a clean one?

1071
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,400
This one looks used.

1072
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,110
They're all used.

1073
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,150
Come on down at once!

1074
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,280
You guys, stop fooling around and assemble!

1075
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,070
Come down at once.

1076
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,489
- Gosh, that scared me. - Assemble!

1077
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:30,239
Assemble, everyone! Did you not hear me?

1078
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:33,710
Assemble!

1079
00:57:33,869 --> 00:57:35,289
- Quick. - Can you not hear me?

1080
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:36,539
What are you all doing?

1081
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,130
Assemble!

1082
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,840
Did you not hear that? Assemble!

1083
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,719
- Hurry up and come down. - Hurry.

1084
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:59,440
The firearms that you just received...

1085
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,900
could save...

1086
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:07,820
or kill you.

1087
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:16,289
In times of emergency, the only thing you can trust...

1088
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:18,579
isn't your friend or colleague next to you,

1089
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,920
but your firearm in your hand.

1090
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,469
So is it okay for you...

1091
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,139
to handle it carelessly?

1092
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:38,559
I am asking you guys.

1093
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,610
- No, it's not okay. - No, it's not okay.

1094
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,610
See that goalpost over there?

1095
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,909
The first three people.

1096
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:51,659
- What? - What's he talking about?

1097
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,030
Hey.

1098
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,289
Go.

1099
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,920
- Don't. You'd better not run. - No.

1100
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,039
- Hey. - Don't do it. Don't run.

1101
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:05,090
- Hey. - Hey, what's he doing?

1102
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,920
- Gosh. - Hey!

1103
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,219
Go!

1104
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:09,510
- Hey! - Don't run!

1105
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:11,429
Run!

1106
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,099
- Hey! - Gosh.

1107
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,389
Go faster!

1108
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,730
Hey, wait up!

1109
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:20,900
- Wait, hold on. - Hey!

1110
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:22,309
Come this way!

1111
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,480
This way! Move it! Faster!

1112
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,989
Now, the first five. Go!

1113
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,070
Go, run! Only the first five!

1114
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,070
Hey! Go faster.

1115
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,199
- Hey! Wait up! - Move it.

1116
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,579
I'm so exhausted.

1117
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,079
I feel like throwing up.

1118
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,210
I feel like I'm dying right now.

1119
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,789
- Hey. - I'm dying.

1120
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,550
Me too.

1121
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,010
- Gosh. - I can't believe this.

1122
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:53,010
- Hey, I'm dying. - Me too.

1123
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:55,559
I'm dying because I'm so smitten by the platoon leader.

1124
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:56,969
He's totally my type!

1125
00:59:56,969 --> 01:00:00,849
Hey, what about that handsome guy on social media?

1126
01:00:00,849 --> 01:00:04,190
Oh, him. How should I put this? He's not mature enough.

1127
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,110
Girls, look. Look at my rash!

1128
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,570
This is what happens when I'm in the sun even for a short moment.

1129
01:00:09,989 --> 01:00:11,489
- What about me? - What about me?

1130
01:00:11,489 --> 01:00:13,530
Hey, Yeon Bo Ra. I told you. Look at this!

1131
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,909
Gosh, you're so loud.

1132
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:16,909
I'm about to throw up, so be quiet.

1133
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:18,449
What about me?

1134
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,289
Your face is red.

1135
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:21,960
- Why? Is it red? - Yes.

1136
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,039
- Look at this! - It hurts.

1137
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:28,380
Why do I have to do this?

1138
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,219
Darn it! Now that I think about it, those jerks make me so angry!

1139
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:32,800
That jerk is crazy.

1140
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,590
Darn it. I'm fuming mad.

1141
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,889
This is nuts.

1142
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:40,309
Gosh, she's at it again.

1143
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:42,889
Lee Soon Yi is crying again!

1144
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,150
Hey, please!

1145
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,690
Girls, hand over your rifles. Don't leave them everywhere.

1146
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,440
Look at my sun rash. What about my face?

1147
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,280
Gosh, seriously!

1148
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,110
- Look, my arm... - Gosh.

1149
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,659
Hey!

1150
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,199
Do you want to do that race again?

1151
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,329
Bring your rifles over here and organize them. Now.

1152
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,130
- Gosh. - Ouch...

1153
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,630
Mom.

1154
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,889
(Lee Soon Yi, Class 2)

1155
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:16,969
Mom...

1156
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,469
They tricked us.

1157
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:20,389
(Hong Jun Hee, Class 2)

1158
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:22,349
They said it'd be like a camping trip.

1159
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:24,940
But it's like being in the real army!

1160
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,860
Mom, Dad. Don't worry about me.

1161
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,860
The platoon leader is very handsome and charismatic.

1162
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,239
I'll listen to him and follow him around.

1163
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:33,739
(Cha So Yeon, Class 2)

1164
01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:34,820
I feel hot.

1165
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:40,159
(Cho Jang Soo, Class 2)

1166
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:41,239
I'll do a good job.

1167
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,289
Oh. That's it?

1168
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,619
Yes, that's it.

1169
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:50,250
Once I complete this, you have to buy me a motorcycle. Okay?

1170
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:54,130
Grandma, don't skip meals.

1171
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,130
And don't forget to take your medicine.

1172
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,139
(No Ae Seol, Class 2)

1173
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:00,929
I numbered them for you yesterday. Remember?

1174
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,679
Don't forget to take them as you promised.

1175
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:06,639
Okay?

1176
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:11,900
- Gosh. - Hey, look at this.

1177
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,190
- Oh, my. - That's nuts.

1178
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,949
Hey, this is crazy! Gather around.

1179
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:18,989
- What is it? - What's going on?

1180
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,070
Guys.

1181
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:22,289
- What is it? - What is it?

1182
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:23,789
Guys, you need to see this.

1183
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:28,960
They're here. What should we do?

1184
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,039
Oh, no.

1185
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,210
What are you doing?

1186
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:38,340
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry!

1187
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,599
What the... Isn't this fake?

1188
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:41,599
Yes, it's got to be.

1189
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:43,389
Why would soldiers kill animals?

1190
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,099
This is totally fake.

1191
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:46,389
No.

1192
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,769
I've seen this before.

1193
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,239
You see, one of the things...

1194
01:02:56,489 --> 01:02:59,110
that the government does before war breaks out...

1195
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,320
is getting rid of the animals in zoos.

1196
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:03,949
Tigers, lions,

1197
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:05,289
elephants!

1198
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:07,789
They kill such vicious animals.

1199
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,210
But why?

1200
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,880
If starving animals escape,

1201
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,920
they'll eat people. That's why.

1202
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:20,429
Then what about the animals that aren't vicious?

1203
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:24,679
Well, they'll be just left there to starve and die.

1204
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:26,809
Starve to death, you idiot.

1205
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,599
- Hey, let me eat the chips. - Hold on.

1206
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:30,769
If what Duk Joong is saying is true,

1207
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,940
it means a war has broken out.

1208
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,070
That's right.

1209
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,320
It's either that, or it will begin very soon.

1210
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:46,159
No way.

1211
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,789
Duk Joong, who told you that?

1212
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:49,869
What?

1213
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,460
Where did you hear about it?

1214
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,000
"Machine Gun Parade March."

1215
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:55,750
It's an animated film.

1216
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,050
Darn you.

1217
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,510
- It's a masterpiece. - Goodness.

1218
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:03,679
You deserve a beating, you fool!

1219
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:05,849
- Get this! - You little...

1220
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:14,309
Seriously...

1221
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,030
- Get this! - Does this hurt?

1222
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:19,239
- Hey! - Get this!

1223
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:20,739
What is going on here?

1224
01:04:28,829 --> 01:04:29,829
Where are you going?

1225
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:31,250
I have to study.

1226
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,170
You're not allowed to go off on your own.

1227
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,130
If you want to study, do it here.

1228
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:40,920
They're too loud. I can't focus here.

1229
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:47,679
Kwon Il Ha over there has his cell phone.

1230
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:55,769
You're not allowed to keep your cell phone. Did you not know that?

1231
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,280
Hand it over.

1232
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:04,989
Go, hurry.

1233
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,750
You violated the rules for cell phone use.

1234
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,500
You get three penalty points.

1235
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,000
Okay, sure.

1236
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,679
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

1237
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:29,389
We can talk now.

1238
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,019
You little piece of...

1239
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:34,139
What are you doing?

1240
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,570
Follow me, both of you.

1241
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:46,449
Darn it.

1242
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:50,619
It's all your fault, idiot.

1243
01:05:52,539 --> 01:05:54,909
- Come on, guys. - Let's go.

1244
01:05:55,579 --> 01:05:56,710
Darn it.

1245
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,250
Gosh.

1246
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,920
Hold it properly, will you? It's splashing all over me.

1247
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,929
This is why you have no friends. What a loser.

1248
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:11,510
You piece of...

1249
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:12,929
Hey.

1250
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:15,599
Seriously, what's your problem?

1251
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,900
Hey. You're really getting on my nerves, you little jerk.

1252
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,690
Hey, got a death wish?

1253
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:25,440
Gosh, he's at it again.

1254
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:33,699
Hey, do you know that everyone thinks you're obnoxious? You loser.

1255
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,449
That's rich coming from someone who plays bully.

1256
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,500
You gangster want-to-be.

1257
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:41,340
Oh, your family must be happy...

1258
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,300
that a piece of trash like you is gone.

1259
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,710
You little...

1260
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,630
Hey, guys!

1261
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:48,090
- You piece of... - Hey, don't!

1262
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:49,510
- Hey! Please. - Move.

1263
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:50,849
- Hey, please. - Let go.

1264
01:06:50,849 --> 01:06:52,639
- Please don't do this. - Why you little...

1265
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:54,849
- You stupid piece of... - Please, guys.

1266
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:57,309
Please stop. Hold on.

1267
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:11,659
Darn...

1268
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,050
Hey, guys.

1269
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,349
What is that? That thing.

1270
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:39,769
Can't you tell?

1271
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:41,690
It's the sphere.

1272
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:46,280
I've never seen one right in front of my eyes.

1273
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,400
- Hey, wait! - Why?

1274
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:52,110
Don't. It could be dangerous.

1275
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,869
Darn it!

1276
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:57,750
I got my phone taken away because of that loser.

1277
01:07:57,789 --> 01:08:00,119
If I post this, my follower count will skyrocket.

1278
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,329
It really is too bad.

1279
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:10,219
Is that right?

1280
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,639
Then why don't you post videos of yourself bullying the others?

1281
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:14,969
Those videos will go viral too.

1282
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,229
Scumbag.

1283
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,229
Hey, Young Hoon! Hey.

1284
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:25,060
- Please calm down! - Let go!

1285
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:27,729
- Darn it, seriously. - Calm down, please.

1286
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:31,069
You are a scumbag.

1287
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,119
When you don't like something,

1288
01:08:34,699 --> 01:08:37,699
you get angry and hit others.

(Duty After School)

1290
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,810
There, it's ready.

1291
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,560
Well...

1292
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:49,149
State your class, student number, and name.

1293
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,359
Then say a few words to your parents and friends...

1294
01:09:56,739 --> 01:09:57,739
You can just...

1295
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,659
say a few words to your parents.

1296
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:03,119
Well...

1297
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:09,130
Is Cyberpia Internet Cafe still around?

1298
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,130
We used to play video games there back in middle school.

1299
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:14,470
Oh, that place?

1300
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,050
That's random.

1301
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,640
Why? Did they go out of business?

1302
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,510
No, it's still there.

1303
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,430
I see.

1304
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,729
Do they still cook instant noodles for you?

1305
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,189
- Yes. - What about the egg yolk?

1306
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,359
They pop it.

1307
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:35,949
Still?

1308
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:39,159
They really shouldn't pop the yolk.

1309
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:41,199
The owner always forgets.

1310
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,460
You know, that game...

1311
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,630
Is my ID still saved as one of your friends?

1312
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,220
Yes, of course.

1313
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,930
Let's go back there sometime and play it together again.

1314
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:11,560
(Jang Young Hoon, Class 2)

1315
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,569
Sure.

1316
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:14,779
After the CSAT.
