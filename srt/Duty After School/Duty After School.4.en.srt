(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:02,470
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,500
What is this?

4
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,049
Something suddenly fell from above.

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,049
And then... And then what happened again?

6
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:48,549
Darn it.

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,520
Oh, right. Duk Joong. Did he arrive safely?

8
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,020
What about Na Ra?

9
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,379
Darn it. Where are the other cars?

10
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,419
Don't tell me we're the only ones who escaped.

11
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,549
No way.

12
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,010
They must be behind us.

13
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,439
I wonder if the shelter is all right.

14
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,150
The shelter our parents are.

15
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:46,150
Mom.

16
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,859
Mom.

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,988
Mom.

18
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey. Stop crying, will you?

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,459
It's annoying.

20
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,469
The others must be in another car, right?

21
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,259
Including Won Bin.

22
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,099
Yes. They're probably okay.

23
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:22,900
They must be okay.

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,830
Gosh. I must be crazy.

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,590
I'm dead scared but dead sleepy at the same time.

26
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Well, me too.

27
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,389
Is it because I feel relaxed now?

28
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,560
I hope...

29
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,689
it all turns out to be a dream after I wake up.

30
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,569
What was that? Darn it!

31
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,710
What the heck?

32
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,169
Guys, get out!

33
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,500
Stop! It's dangerous!

34
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,759
Stop it! Get out!

35
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,549
- Shoot straight! - Hurry up!

36
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,550
Shoot!

37
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
"Shoot?"

38
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:53,990
Darn it.

39
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,789
Oh, gosh. Are you guys all right?

40
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,500
It hurts.

41
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,710
Is everyone okay?

42
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,629
- Hold on a second. - So Yeon.

43
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,800
- Where's So Yeon? - What?

44
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,969
So Yeon!

45
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,509
So Yeon. Are you okay?

46
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,550
Chi Yeol, help her up.

47
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,310
Get up. Be careful.

48
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,310
- Hold her arm. - Be careful.

49
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,980
Let her sit down. Here, sit. Slowly.

50
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,560
Are you okay?

51
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,980
Let us have a look.

52
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:31,689
- Darn it. - Oh, my gosh.

53
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:33,569
- Darn it. - Gosh.

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,078
- You scared me! - What is it?

55
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,088
- It hurts. What do I do? - Are you okay?

56
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,050
I think my bone is broken.

57
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,179
Let me see.

58
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,219
- It's bad, right? - Darn it.

59
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
Hey. Stop being a crybaby.

60
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:59,889
- It hurts. - It's just a scratch.

61
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,480
But it hurts.

62
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,439
Will So Yeon be okay?

65
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,769
Darn it.

66
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,120
It's empty.

67
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,290
- What about you? - Me too.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Darn it.

69
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,379
I'm sorry. Seriously.

70
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,088
- I think she has a fever. - What?

71
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,089
What do we do? Hang in there, So Yeon.

72
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,680
Hey, Jang Soo.

(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

74
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,639
How are the soldiers?

75
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,188
They're all dead.

76
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:13,230
- What? - What?

77
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,189
Darn it. What now?

78
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,399
What do we do now?

79
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,659
Isn't it obvious? We should go back to Seoul.

80
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,278
Hey, are you crazy? Can't you see all of this?

81
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,619
We're out of bullets. So what? Return so that we can die?

82
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,829
What else can we do?

83
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,079
Where were we assembling again? Shouldn't we go there?

84
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,129
- Mount Soak. - Right, Mount Soak.

85
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,709
There are soldiers there. It should be safer than Seoul.

86
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,379
Young Sin. How long will it take us to Mount Soak?

87
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,889
We're about here. The gathering place is over here.

88
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,688
It's about 20km from here to the gathering place.

89
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,899
- What? About 20km? - About 20km?

90
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,439
Darn it.

91
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,148
Are you mad?

92
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,740
How on earth can we walk 20km in this blazing heat?

93
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,120
Rather than getting tired midway, let's wait here to get rescued.

94
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:10,039
He's right, guys. Let's just wait, okay?

95
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,619
Hey. What if a sphere jumps out as we wait?

96
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,329
What if it does as we walk? Is that any different?

97
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:18,959
And look.

98
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,339
There aren't as many spheres here compared to Seoul.

99
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,180
There are no traces of fallen spheres either.

100
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,769
What? Why aren't there any here when there are tons in Seoul?

101
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,320
Is it because there are no people here?

102
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,320
Is that why?

103
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,070
I can't go. I'm going to wait here.

104
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,289
Hey, guys. It didn't seem like any other cars passed by...

105
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,370
on our way here.

106
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,788
Isn't it better to go to Mount Soak?

107
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,499
Will you use your darn brains already?

108
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,339
Let's just stay here, you idiots!

109
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,999
Seriously! Hey.

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,220
Will you take responsibility if no one comes? Will you?

111
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,719
You little...

112
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,008
Guys, we better move to a place we can rest first.

113
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,508
So Yeon's condition looks bad.

114
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,480
Darn it. Hey. Look around, will you?

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,139
Where on earth can we rest?

116
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,689
Forget it. I can walk. Let's go to the gathering place.

117
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,269
- Hey. - It hurts.

118
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,239
I stopped the bleeding. But her wound is severe.

119
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,110
She'll get worse if we don't get her treated fast.

120
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,949
Then let's search as we walk...

121
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,659
Darn it! Seriously!

122
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,909
Do you only use your brain to study?

123
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,250
We don't even know what's around.

124
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,500
Are we going to look around blindly?

125
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:49,970
Yes. Hee Rak's right.

126
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,179
There aren't any villages on the map.

127
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,269
It's best not to move when we don't know anything.

128
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:59,480
See that? Cho Young Sin is the only one who understands.

129
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,519
Just stay here, you bunch of scum!

130
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,029
We saw it today, didn't we?

131
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,120
What happened to our friends.

132
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,950
I don't want any of us to fall into danger.

133
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,500
I don't want to lose anyone.

134
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,019
Let's search the area first.

135
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,559
If we don't find anything after looking around for 30 minutes...

136
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:42,610
Let's think about it, then.

137
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,360
Then I'll search that side first.

138
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,409
- I'll take the other side. - Okay. This side for me.

139
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,829
I'll go with Tae Man.

140
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,289
Hey. Take me with you.

141
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,830
You guys. Since when did we have such great teamwork?

142
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,009
You can stay here with Young Sin.

143
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Gosh.

144
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,389
Get out.

145
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,450
I don't think the first vehicle arrived yet.

146
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,730
Are you all okay?

147
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,070
What about the first vehicle?

148
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,610
They were ahead of us.

149
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,299
Did you see that?

150
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,559
Why aren't they here yet?

151
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,399
I hope nothing happened to them.

152
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,740
They should already be here.

153
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,320
Something bad must've happened to them.

154
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,490
No way.

155
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,830
- They'll be here soon. - You saw what happened.

156
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,619
In Hye was trying to get in the vehicle and...

157
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,709
Hey.

158
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,789
Yoo Ha Na.

159
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,179
Starting this moment,

160
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,179
stay here until further orders.

161
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,600
What about the others?

162
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,059
We haven't...

163
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
heard from them yet.

164
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,730
You haven't heard from them?

165
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,528
They should already be here.

166
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,200
Don't worry. They'll be fine.

167
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,570
Let's wait a bit longer.

168
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:02,820
Until when?

169
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,199
Hey.

170
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,289
You should've let us leave when we wanted to.

171
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,950
- Darn it. - Il Ha.

172
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,370
- What? - That's enough.

173
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,539
If it weren't for him,

174
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,340
we wouldn't be alive now.

175
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,139
Lieutenant.

176
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:29,600
Please make sure...

177
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,649
the others arrive safely.

178
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,110
Please.

179
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,289
You should...

180
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:57,169
all get some rest.

181
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,850
Darn it.

182
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,649
I'm tired and hungry.

183
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,730
I hate all this.

184
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:18,899
I hate it.

185
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,279
There's nothing.

186
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
We didn't find anything either.

187
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,289
Hey, guys!

188
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,330
Did you find something?

189
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:37,379
Yes.

190
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:38,379
- What? - What?

191
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,379
Where?

192
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:42,669
Over there.

193
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,840
Are you serious?

194
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:47,720
- I'll help you get up. - Okay.

195
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:48,929
One, two.

196
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:50,929
Are you okay?

197
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,139
I'll carry So Yeon.

198
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,649
- Okay. - No, thanks. I can walk.

199
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,980
Your injury will get worse. Get on his back.

200
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,269
I'm fine.

201
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,860
I'll walk until I can't.

202
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,150
Help her.

203
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,989
- I'll help her. - Hold her for a minute.

204
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,990
Okay.

205
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,880
We're ready. Let's go.

206
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,710
Wait a second.

207
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,799
Aren't you going?

208
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,880
I want to,

209
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,258
but my knee hurts so much I can't take a single step.

210
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,179
Hey. Stop being a baby.

211
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,098
It really hurts.

212
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,349
She's so annoying.

213
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,349
I'll carry Soon Yi then.

214
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,730
You're too weak to carry anyone.

215
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
There.

216
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,119
Stop worrying and get on my back.

217
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:55,869
Thank you.

218
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,829
I'm quite heavy.

219
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,970
Let's go.

220
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,299
Are we leaving?

221
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,140
We're leaving?

222
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,970
Those crazy idiots.

223
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:16,349
Seriously?

224
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,769
- Hey. - Yes?

225
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,730
You're staying, right?

226
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:22,109
What?

227
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,068
Hey, Park So Yoon. Wait for me!

228
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,069
Hurry up.

229
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,990
Darn it.

230
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
No way.

231
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:00,349
We're at war.

232
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,518
Transport vehicles are as important as soldiers' lives during a war.

233
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,779
I can't let you use it for personal reasons.

234
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,279
It isn't a personal reason.

235
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,700
Some of my platoon members seem to have fallen behind.

236
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,119
Please help me find them.

237
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:20,329
Lieutenant Lee.

238
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,500
Take a look outside.

239
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,788
It isn't just your platoon members.

240
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,170
Tons of Student Reserve Forces haven't arrived yet.

241
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,130
None of the Jungreung High School students made it here.

242
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,679
Don't cause more damage,

243
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,139
and take care of the kids that are here.

244
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,809
I'm sure the kids are alive.

245
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,019
Please.

246
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:51,609
I'm begging you.

247
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,029
Later,

248
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,619
you'll be thanking me.

249
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,759
How did it go?

250
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,559
What should we do now?

251
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:29,150
Won Bin.

252
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,819
Yes.

253
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,450
How much do you trust me?

254
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,250
I'll even trust you if you say pigs fly.

255
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:44,829
Thank you.

256
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,009
I need to ask you for a tough favour.

257
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,170
I said I trusted you.

258
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,509
Don't ask for a favour.

259
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,220
Just give me orders.

260
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:05,890
Darn it.

261
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:07,440
It's so hot.

262
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,109
I can't take this any longer! Hey, Chi Yeol.

263
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,160
When will we arrive at the house? Darn it.

264
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,569
Did you really see one?

265
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,289
Careful.

266
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,750
I'm sure...

267
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,630
it's here somewhere.

268
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,180
So where is it, you idiot?

269
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,839
Well...

270
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,799
I'm not familiar with this area and was running.

271
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,929
It must be here somewhere.

272
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,268
You idiot.

273
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,098
I shouldn't have believed him.

274
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:46,099
Hee Rak.

275
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,558
That's enough. You aren't the only one exhausted.

276
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,149
I told you we should stay there, you idiots.

277
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,440
If we stayed there like I said we should,

278
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,990
we'd be rescued by now.

279
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,069
This is so annoying!

280
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,880
- I see it! - Where?

281
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,419
Over there.

282
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,420
What?

283
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,680
We're saved!

284
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,220
- I'm so relieved! - I know.

285
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,980
Gosh.

286
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,189
Hey, guys.

287
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,440
There's a room here. Let's have So Yeon lie down inside.

288
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,650
- We're here. - Just a little more.

289
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:35,319
(Safety first)

290
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,150
Watch your step.

291
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,579
Darn it.

292
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:50,920
Put her down here.

293
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,750
Here you go.

294
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,549
- I'll help her. - Okay.

295
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:57,420
One second, So Yeon.

296
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:02,720
Thank you.

297
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,930
It's okay.

298
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,660
What was that?

299
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,199
(Under construction)

300
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,829
It's so hot.

301
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,130
She has a high fever.

302
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,588
Find me some clean water and cloth to cover her wound.

303
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,759
- I'll go and find it. - I'll help.

304
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:44,389
Also, try to find medication for her fever or antiseptics.

305
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,009
Okay, I'll go look.

306
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,608
Let's look for food or anything that will come in handy.

307
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,609
Okay.

308
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,069
Darn it.

309
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,118
Liquid nitrogen.

310
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:17,630
(Liquid nitrogen)

311
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,799
Why are they making me do this?

312
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,269
(Storage area, Water supply and drainage facility)

313
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,529
Darn it.

314
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,740
Everything here is useless.

315
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,170
I wonder if everyone in the other vehicle arrived safely.

316
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,710
I can't wait to see them.

317
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,230
Soo Chul, you've been quiet.

318
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,309
What is it? Do you feel sick?

319
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,109
Do you think the others are alive?

320
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,490
Of course. Why would you ask that?

321
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:37,460
- Woo Taek. - What?

322
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,630
I couldn't save Woo Taek.

323
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,920
What do you mean? Isn't he in the second vehicle?

324
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,299
Woo Taek...

325
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:57,059
I left him behind.

326
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,740
No way.

327
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,490
Is Woo Taek dead?

328
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,259
There's nothing here.

329
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,509
How is there nothing here?

330
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,809
Did anyone even live here?

331
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,930
(Butane gas)

332
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,019
- Did you find anything? - What?

333
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:44,940
No, I didn't.

334
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:47,569
What is with you?

335
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,579
I found something. Look.

336
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,669
I'm sorry. That must hurt. Hang in there.

337
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,670
Here you go.

338
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,720
I'm cold.

339
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,180
Her fever won't drop.

340
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,480
We need a fever reducer.

341
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:23,559
This looks like cold medicine.

342
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,190
(Fever reducer)

343
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,029
So Yeon, this is a fever reducer. Take it.

344
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,279
Here's some water.

345
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:43,710
I think this was a construction site office.

346
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,460
There is nothing to eat here other than water.

347
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,549
I found a blanket.

348
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,299
I think we can create a stretcher for So Yeon with it.

349
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:54,589
I found something quite important. Something we need at night.

350
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
What is it?

351
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,099
Mosquito repellent incense.

352
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,400
Seriously.

353
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,319
Do you know how vicious mountain mosquitoes are?

354
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,859
I'm hungry.

355
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,910
The phone is dead. Darn it.

356
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,039
We'll starve to death at this rate.

357
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,130
- Where are you going? - What?

358
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,180
The bathroom.

359
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:52,690
No one will get full if I share.

360
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,779
It's better for one person to get full.

361
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:18,640
Who is going to take responsibility if something goes wrong?

362
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,890
I'm sorry, sir.

363
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,720
This isn't the first time.

364
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:26,059
Reorganize this starting from a month ago.

365
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,269
Yes, sir.

366
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,559
Sir.

367
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,119
(Park Jin Soo)

368
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,289
Park Jin Soo, I didn't expect to see you here.

369
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,500
(Kim Won Bin, Republic of Korea Army)

370
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,288
- Do I know you? - Come on.

371
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,960
We were in the same troop.

372
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:54,880
From where?

373
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,219
Nonsan.

374
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,838
- Nonsan? - Yes.

375
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,009
I was in Chuncheon.

376
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,980
We said it would've been easy if we were stationed in Nonsan.

377
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,899
I'm disappointed you don't remember me.

378
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,109
Come on. Can't you remember me?

379
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,910
That's right. You wanted chocolate snacks so bad...

380
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,750
that you converted to Catholicism. Don't you remember?

381
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,879
I remember.

382
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,130
There you go. You startled me.

383
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,548
- How have you been? - Good.

384
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:40,589
It's so good to see you.

385
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:44,009
Have a seat. It's really good to see you.

386
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,598
Did all your kids make it here?

387
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,768
Yes, they did.

388
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,980
Why? Aren't your kids here yet?

389
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:57,319
No, I'm waiting.

390
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,700
They'll be here soon. Just wait and see.

391
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,319
- Thank you. - Excuse me.

392
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,950
Sergeant Park Jin Soo at Transportation speaking.

393
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,369
Yes, sir.

394
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,079
I'm getting it ready, sir.

395
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,130
Yes.

396
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,549
I'll have it ready by 1pm.

397
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Yes.

398
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,720
Yes, sir.

399
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,559
You're still muscular.

400
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:30,599
Of course, I still work out.

401
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,730
- You do? - Yes.

402
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:32,768
Keep up the good work.

403
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:33,809
- Okay. - See you.

404
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,690
Wait a minute.

405
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,069
What is it?

406
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,410
Do you have any cigarettes?

407
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,500
I don't smoke.

408
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,960
- Stop lying. - I'm serious.

409
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,839
Wait a second. Give me your hand.

410
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:00,549
What?

411
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,719
You really don't smoke.

412
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,980
No, that's what I told you.

413
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:14,268
- I'll smoke next time. See you. - Okay.

414
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,519
Bye, Won Bin.

415
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,200
Do you know what the punishment is...

416
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,869
for stealing a transport vehicle during a war?

417
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,079
Death.

418
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,210
I know that much.

419
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,750
I'll be back.

420
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,970
I'll go with you.

421
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:47,929
No, if I'm sentenced to death,

422
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,849
I need someone to take care of my dog tags.

423
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,779
Gosh.

424
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,240
- Won Bin. - You scared me.

425
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,950
What are you doing here?

426
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,579
Where is the lieutenant going?

427
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,119
He isn't going to eat something.

428
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,789
It's none of your business.

429
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:21,420
You should button up.

430
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,589
Wait.

431
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:29,849
Let's go.

432
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,599
Be honest. What were you eating in there?

433
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:35,890
Ginkgo nuts?

434
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,940
Listen, guys.

435
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,069
Guys.

436
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,490
I think the platoon commander is off to rescue the kids.

437
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,029
- Really? - Yes.

438
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,619
We've been told to wait here until further notice.

439
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,369
So why else would he go outside?

440
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,210
He must have the same thing in mind.

441
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,249
I also think Soo Chul and the others are alive.

442
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,669
Would they be dead, then?

443
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,759
- Of course, they're alive. - Right.

444
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,470
Speaking of which,

445
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:09,218
I'm going to go with him.

446
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,429
Hey, are you out of...

447
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:13,309
Are you out of your mind? Aren't you scared?

448
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,059
Yes, I'm scared.

449
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,268
But if it were Soo Chul, he'd come for my rescue...

450
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:19,440
without thinking twice.

451
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,110
I'll go with you.

452
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,150
I'm too frustrated to wait without doing anything.

453
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,539
Hey, Na Ra.

454
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,539
- Get me my gun too. - Hey!

455
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,170
Darn it.

456
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,510
Ae Seol.

457
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,058
What are you doing? You can't even protect yourself.

458
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,559
Just stay here.

459
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:58,480
I'm going too.

460
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:01,059
Look, guys.

461
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,940
Let's try to think rationally.

462
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,230
If they're alive, they would've come already.

463
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,948
And what if we get caught going outside to rescue them?

464
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,070
If we get caught,

465
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,570
then what?

466
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,698
We could get penalty points all together...

467
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,328
to take joint responsibility or whatnot.

468
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:19,579
- Then... - You idiot.

469
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:22,169
You actually think we'll take the CSAT in this situation?

470
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,960
They didn't say we wouldn't.

471
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,460
So we'll probably take it.

472
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,799
You know we can't go to the college we want if we get penalty points.

473
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Gosh.

474
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,010
Forget it.

475
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,139
What did I even expect from you?

476
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:39,429
I'm off.

477
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,309
Me too.

478
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,110
- What are you waiting for? - I'm not going.

479
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,610
Gosh! What?

480
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,329
Goodness...

481
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,679
Gosh. Kimchi, hand me the pincers.

482
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,099
- Hey. - What?

483
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,440
What's on your mind?

484
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,730
No, nothing.

485
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,940
What is it?

486
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,239
Anyway, it seems those people rushed away from this place.

487
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:38,029
They even left a delivery van in the garage.

488
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,238
Darn it.

489
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,409
Why couldn't you tell us sooner?

490
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,828
Let's ride that to escape.

491
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,829
Will you cut the nonsense?

492
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,709
- None of us can drive. - I'll do it.

493
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,379
You're poor at driving a motorcycle, to begin with.

494
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,709
Still, I'm better than Kwon Il Ha.

495
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,170
What are you saying, idiot?

496
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,110
I should have some left in case I need it later.

497
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,500
Who's screaming?

498
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,210
What is it with her this time?

499
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,089
- Darn, we're doomed! - What on earth?

500
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,339
- Woo Taek! - Let's go inside.

501
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,800
- Behind you! - Gosh.

502
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,800
Help me!

503
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,218
Go in!

504
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:42,219
- What is it? - Go inside.

505
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,768
- Run! - Help me!

506
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:44,928
Behind you, darn it!

507
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,439
- Oh, my. - Go inside.

508
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,019
- Watch out! - No!

509
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,940
- Run! - Go inside already.

510
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,860
Watch out!

511
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,780
- Goodness! - Get up!

512
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,909
Close the door!

513
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,249
No. That won't be enough.

514
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,340
Let's move this thing.

515
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,760
Gosh.

516
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,669
- Do it with them! - What's wrong with you?

517
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,429
- Goodness, gracious. - Hurry up.

518
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,530
Did it leave?

519
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:41,699
Goodness.

520
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,789
- Darn it. - Come on!

521
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:02,468
It's coming through the ventilator!

522
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:03,969
Go into the room now!

523
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,260
Quickly!

524
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,519
Go!

525
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,230
- Get in there! - Get the door.

526
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:27,869
Do something.

527
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,289
What do we do?

528
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,039
It's okay. Don't worry.

529
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,250
- Soo Chul, the windows. - Okay.

530
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,800
- Yeon Ju, check that window. - Okay.

531
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,679
- Is it okay? - Yes.

532
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:48,469
It doesn't open?

533
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,099
I think this one's good too.

534
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,189
Guys, over here!

535
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,190
- Let's block this. - Darn it.

536
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,340
Why does it keep moving around?

537
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,179
Did it leave?

538
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:46,369
Darn it. There are two.

539
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:49,869
Let's check.

540
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,289
No, don't.

541
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,039
I think we should check.

542
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,780
I think there's just one.

543
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,360
What are you guys doing here?

544
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,699
You're off to find the kids.

545
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,949
Leave it to me and go back to the camp.

546
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,000
Do you know...

547
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,869
what will happen if you get caught?

548
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,420
Probably get penalty points.

549
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,340
What about you, though?

550
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,839
- Duk Joong. - What?

551
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,219
What happens in this case?

552
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:31,050
He'll be executed, at the least.

553
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,480
Let's keep going.

554
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,849
We've come too far to go back.

555
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,650
Let's just go back.

556
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,460
What is this?

557
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,510
The thing is...

558
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:13,349
Jun Hee, did you have ramyeon?

559
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,219
Well...

560
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,149
But I couldn't eat anything all day.

561
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,979
Are you out of your mind? We're all starving!

562
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,319
You let that thing find you...

563
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,489
while eating alone in secret?

564
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,239
- Let go. - Knock it off.

565
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,320
What matters is how we will escape.

566
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,829
I'm sorry.

567
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,218
Anyway, why did it suddenly stop...

568
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:50,550
moving around?

569
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,679
Could it be...

570
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,760
This is just my guess,

571
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:58,598
but maybe it knows that we can't run away due to the window guards.

572
00:43:58,599 --> 00:43:59,769
What?

573
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:01,389
Think about it.

574
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,518
It knows that we can't run away through the windows.

575
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,230
It's waiting for us in front of the only way out.

576
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,780
It can't be that smart, though.

577
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,610
I thought they were unicellular creatures.

578
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:14,030
We know nothing about the spheres.

579
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,699
If they're intelligent, where they came from,

580
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:21,710
and why they came.

581
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,380
But one thing is certain.

582
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,960
It reacts to sounds.

583
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,190
So Yeon?

584
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,440
So Yeon.

585
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,289
What's going on?

586
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,340
Her wound started festering. Her fever is back too.

587
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,929
She'll be seriously ill if we don't take action.

588
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:23,639
Let's just get in the truck and drive away.

589
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,769
What am I saying?

590
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,780
What are you doing?

591
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,440
I have to tell them.

592
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,650
That we should drive away in the truck, as you said.

593
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,578
I was just saying. I wasn't actually suggesting it.

594
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:43,409
So, we just sit here and watch So Yeon suffer?

595
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:05,389
Chi Yeol.

596
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:08,019
Be careful.

597
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:09,690
I will.

598
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,150
Hee Rak, block it as soon as I leave.

599
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,239
Chi Yeol.

600
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:21,159
Are you sure about this?

601
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:24,659
I'll be fine.

602
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,960
(Disinfectant Storage)

603
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,849
(Disinfectant Storage)

604
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,170
Shoot.

605
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,019
Hey. Jang Soo.

606
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,599
Jang Soo!

607
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:46,369
How did you get out?

608
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:48,619
Is that Chi Yeol?

609
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:50,539
Yes. How did he get here?

610
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:53,500
So Yeon's condition is worsening.

611
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,630
So, we had an idea.

612
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,260
Why don't we just get in the truck and drive away?

613
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,599
Chi Yeol, do you think you can let us out?

614
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:08,639
Let's see.

615
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,530
Gosh.

616
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:24,320
No. Not with my bare hands.

617
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:29,119
- We're going to need some tools. - Tools?

618
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,130
(Butane gas)

619
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,170
Okay. I'll go and find one.

620
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:39,670
Hey.

621
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:42,800
Be careful.

622
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:46,550
I will. Don't worry.

623
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,190
Gosh.

624
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,190
Is this the right way?

625
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,610
We'll have to try something.

626
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,949
We can't just stay locked up here.

627
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
Come on, man.

628
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,250
- What's taking him so long? - Gosh.

629
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,329
What if something happened to him?

630
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:23,730
Oh, no.

631
00:50:58,269 --> 00:51:00,730
What was that? What's happening?

632
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,820
Take this!

633
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:20,539
Guys! Retreat!

634
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,419
Guys! Retreat!

635
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,839
- Open the door! - The door!

636
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,550
Get the door! Hurry!

637
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,469
- Let's go. - Come on!

638
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:33,759
- Go! - Where is he?

639
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,218
- Go! - Run!

640
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:36,969
Open the door!

641
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:39,429
The door!

642
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,400
- Shoot. - Chi Yeol!

643
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,399
- What's happening? - What do you think is happening?

644
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,820
- The door! - Keep running!

645
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:54,070
- This way. - Hey, Chi Yeol!

646
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,829
- Block it. - Come back in.

647
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,919
What is going on outside?

648
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,630
You listened to the whole thing, darn it!

649
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:12,800
At least, Chi Yeol is safe, right?

650
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,309
Guys.

651
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:19,139
Do you think this can get you out?

652
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,570
Kimchi. You were much faster than usual.

653
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,949
Let's get ready to break out.

654
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:37,489
Wait.

655
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:41,750
We have to make the sphere think that we're still inside.

656
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,578
- What? - How do we do that?

657
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,170
What are you talking about?

658
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,429
- What is he up to? - I have no idea.

659
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,719
("The Host")

660
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,489
What is this?

661
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,159
I thought that was only a movie.

662
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:23,000
Do you remember how that movie ends?

663
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,000
They kill the monster and win at the end, right?

664
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,510
Beats me. I haven't watched it.

665
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,260
Yes. That is how it ends.

666
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,809
But the daughter they tried to save...

667
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:44,230
ends up dying.

668
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,730
What? She dies?

669
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,739
She dies?

670
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,010
Guys, move this.

671
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,519
It's the guys.

672
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,570
Come outside.

673
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:45,038
- I'm scared. - Jun Hee.

674
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:46,789
- Let's go and find the car keys. - What?

675
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,789
Hey.

676
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,260
(Under construction)

677
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,019
Darn it.

678
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:16,860
Gosh.

679
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,159
Let me help.

680
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:22,369
Careful.

681
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,460
Oh, gosh.

682
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,110
Darn it.

683
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:25,178
The flue!

684
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:26,928
What is it? Gosh.

685
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:28,469
- Run! - It's dangerous!

686
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,649
Go!

687
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:37,820
Take her and go first.

688
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,610
- Hurry. - Let's go.

689
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,198
- Let's go! - Go!

690
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,280
I said go!

691
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:45,369
Run!

692
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:47,949
Let me do it. Let's do it together.

693
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,198
- Just leave it and go! - Go!

694
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,619
- Let's do it together! - Go!

695
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,249
Run!

696
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,038
- What's going on? - Run!

697
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:01,170
- Run! - Retreat!

698
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:05,339
I brought So Yeon.

699
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,760
Be careful.

700
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:09,510
Go!

701
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:10,969
Let's just go!

702
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:14,849
Gosh.

703
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,518
Darn it. Come here!

704
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:17,809
Hey! It's here!

705
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,400
- There. - Come here!

706
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,570
Soon Yi! Behind you!

707
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,239
Run, Chi Yeol!

708
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:30,538
- Let's go. Hurry. - Chi Yeol.

709
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:31,868
- Yes? - Where are Tae Man and Soo Chul?

710
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:33,828
I don't know. The sphere came out.

711
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:35,579
Come here!

712
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,389
Darn it.

713
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,269
So Yeon, stay with me. All right?

714
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:55,690
Why aren't they coming?

715
00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:00,860
Hey, do something!

716
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,940
Darn it!

717
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:11,409
Get up! What are you doing?

718
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,619
Why aren't they coming?

719
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,379
- They are coming. - Hurry!

720
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,919
- Hurry! - Hurry!

721
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,169
- Go inside. - Hurry.

722
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,170
- Hurry. - Hurry.

723
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:34,849
- It's this, isn't it? - All right!

724
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:38,480
- We're going to spend all night! - Is that not it?

725
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:39,849
Darn it.

726
00:58:48,949 --> 00:58:50,868
Hey. This. This is it, isn't it?

727
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:52,280
All right!

728
00:58:52,489 --> 00:58:53,909
- All right! - Hurry!

729
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,839
Darn it. I'm doomed.

730
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,630
- What is it? - It's manual.

731
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,670
What's that?

732
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,839
- How's So Yeon? - Not good.

733
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,179
Hurry.

734
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,969
There.

735
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:16,019
Darn it.

736
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,730
What is he doing?

737
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,610
Hey! We have to go!

738
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,319
You said you could drive!

739
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,530
Darn it.

740
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,948
- It's different from my dad's car. - What?

741
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:32,319
Darn it. This is crazy. What are we supposed to do then?

742
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,659
- Darn it. - Gosh.

743
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:37,658
- Move. I will do it. - You know how to drive?

744
00:59:37,659 --> 00:59:39,538
- I do. Give it to me. - You really know?

745
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:42,130
- Move! Gosh. - Hey!

746
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:44,038
- Hey! - Hey!

747
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,039
- Darn it. - Hey!

748
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,090
Hey!

749
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,760
- Darn it. - Move. I got it.

750
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:51,010
Move.

751
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,139
Darn it.

752
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:01,809
Just a little more.

753
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,230
One more time.

754
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,400
- No? - No.

755
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,948
Darn it. Let's just run.

756
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:13,280
We can't. We will all get caught if we carry her on the back.

757
01:00:13,449 --> 01:00:15,408
So why would you meddle with it when you don't know a thing?

758
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:17,408
You stop messing around, idiot!

759
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:19,079
My family runs a driving school!

760
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:23,500
Darn it.

761
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,710
Isn't that the sphere?

762
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,510
If it comes in here, we will all die.

763
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,179
Our best chance of survival is...

764
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,940
leaving So Yeon behind.

765
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,189
- What? - What?

766
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,439
Hey. Are you mad?

767
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,230
Right. None of us wants to do that.

768
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,079
It's my fault.

769
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:01,539
I am sorry, guys.

770
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,090
No, it's not your fault. It's all right.

771
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,669
Then one person should lure the sphere and the rest should...

772
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,259
ride the truck and escape. That's the only way.

773
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,630
What if that person gets caught?

774
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:16,050
That's too risky.

775
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,260
The tentacles!

776
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:23,139
This is...

777
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,559
the best decision we can make to not have any regrets later.

778
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,880
Gosh, will you hurry and choose?

779
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,349
Show yours.

780
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,119
Hee Rak.

781
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:22,659
Yes?

782
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,829
Woo Hee Rak.

783
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,130
I think it's me.

784
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:38,050
I'll get going.

785
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,639
Jang Soo!

786
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:43,679
Hey!

787
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,239
What are you waiting for? Open it.

788
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,510
Jang Soo.

789
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:20,130
Be careful.

791
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,820
You can begin.

792
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:41,449
I'm well and healthy.

793
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,368
I hope you are well too, Mom and Dad.

(Cho Jang Soo, Class 3-2)

795
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:47,000
Wait.

796
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:48,710
That's it?

797
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,039
Yes.

798
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,039
It's too short.

799
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:55,960
You don't have anything else to say?

800
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,928
Thanks to you, Dad, I'm getting trained well.

801
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:04,929
Right. Your dad is a soldier.

802
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:09,179
Did he not tell you anything when you were coming to the training?

803
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,940
There's something he says when he drinks.

804
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,739
You wear a gas mask during the CBR training, you know.

805
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,488
To find out if the training is over,

806
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:24,779
they have to get one person to take the mask off.

807
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,829
What?

808
01:04:25,989 --> 01:04:27,699
Gosh. Really?

809
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,079
That must be hard to choose.

810
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,880
But if you are the commander, you must not hesitate to do it.

811
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,920
When you decide who can and who can't do it.

812
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,129
Whichever decision you make,

813
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:41,340
the commander becomes the villain at that moment.

814
01:04:41,719 --> 01:04:42,840
When I heard that,

815
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:45,969
I thought I would never be able to be the commander.

816
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,769
The tenacious Cho Young Sin might be able to do it.

817
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:52,309
Then...

818
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:56,610
what do you think it would be like if you become the commander?

819
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,610
I don't know.

820
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:04,158
I guess I will have no choice but to become the villain too.
