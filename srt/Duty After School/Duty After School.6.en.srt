It's okay now. All the spheres have been killed.

4
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:16,980
What happened?

5
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,829
Is this...

6
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,710
a dream?

7
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,729
I think they also have survivors.

8
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,108
There are boys too.

9
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,728
- I told you. - They have many people.

10
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,150
Don't step on her.

11
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,780
Don't step on her.

12
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:11,030
Hey.

13
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:15,659
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,209
Don't step on my friend.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,379
Don't step on her.

Don't step on my friend.

Don't step on her!

19
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,310
Don't step on her!

20
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,230
Oh, gosh.

21
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,989

Darn it.

00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,990
- Gosh. - Here...

30
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,240

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,650
It stinks.

38
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,680
Any survivors?

39
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,439
It seems everyone's dead here.

40
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,480
I don't think there are any survivors.

41
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,779
I wonder if my parents are okay.

42
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,579
Guys, check this place.

43
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,600
This must've been a dormitory.

44
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,790
You kids are...

45
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,910
the only survivors.

46
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,540
We were told to deliver supplies to the shelter.

47
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:34,420
But when we arrived...

48
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,389
- What about the person in charge? - We don't know.

49
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,639
He disappeared.

50
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,519
Why did you stay here...

51
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,230
without the commander in charge?

52
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,019
We were told to wait.

53
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,939
That's why we waited.

54
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,490
We did as we were told.

55
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,449
So why...

56
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,379
It must be very hard,

57
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,220
but please calm down.

58
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,970
We'll talk again once things are sorted out.

59
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,930

61
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:36,149
Okay.

62
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,449
Aren't you hungry?

63
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,290
Do you want something to eat?

64
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,689
- One, two, three. - All right.

Did you...

72
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,569
see her eyes earlier?

73
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:10,949
They were unfocused.

74
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,540
Completely blank.

75
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,540
It is just dreadful.

76
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,389
If I had been left alone,

77
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,139
would I have become like them?

78
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,139
Will we be able to survive?

79
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,629
This small-sized shelter...

80
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,759
was devastated as if there was a surprise attack.

81
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,798
Shelters were set up in the outskirts of the city...

82
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,139
where medium spheres don't appear in the first place.

83
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,220
Besides, there are no traces of medium spheres falling.

84
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,269
I wonder how this place was raided by smaller spheres.

85
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,519
Spheres looking for prey swarmed in here.

86
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,490
How did they know that the shelter was here?

87
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,409
Mr. Lee.

88
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,409
Ae Seol might cause big trouble at this rate.

89
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,669
She was already weird, but it's gotten worse now.

90
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,250
Something might actually happen.

91
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,129
Don't worry about her.

92
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:48,509
She's doing good enough, and she will continue to do so.

93
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,139
You don't know much about her.

94
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,769
Just don't regret it later.

95
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:01,559
It's because of No Ae Seol, that darn wench.

There are no spheres.

99
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:24,710
No spheres.

100
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,049
Gosh.

101
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,600
This is too bad.

102
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,769
I heard their commander-in-chief ran away.

103
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,899
Thank goodness, we have Mr. Lee.

104
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,190
I know.

105
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,700
You must be starving. Eat up.

106
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,899
- No way. - Hey.

107
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
What are you doing?

108
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,139
Why are you holding a rifle?

109
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,820
What are you doing?

110
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,899
I...

111
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,529
ran away.

112
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,779
My friends...

113
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,500
They asked me for help.

114
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
But I...

115
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,840
ran away alone.

116
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,549
They all died.

117
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,639
No.

118
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:40,639
It's not your fault.

119
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,309
It was the same for me.

120
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,309
When my friends died,

121
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,690
I was busy running away.

122
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,529
It's never your fault.

123
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,950
Please put the rifle down.

124
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,000
It's dangerous, that's why.

125
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,539
Yoon Seo.

126
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,769
Please put the rifle down.

127
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,190
Don't come close.

128
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,529
Your name...

129
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,990
is Yoon Seo, right?

130
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,949
Yes.

131
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,370
I know...

132
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:43,830
you've suffered a lot in fear.

133
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,539
From now on,

134
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,340
we'll protect you.

135
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,590
Put down...

136
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,220
the rifle.

137
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,769
Yoon Seo.

138
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:07,480
Please put the gun down.

139
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:09,850
Please...

140
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,909
You said it was okay.

141
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,840
That we just had to do as we were told.

142
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:41,759
That we should wait.

143
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,600
I know you'll run away again.

144
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,929
- Yoon Seo. - Stop.

145
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,889
Extra points?

146
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,110
What's the big deal about all that?

147
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,320
It's merely nothing!

148
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,240
I don't believe you anymore. Because of you people...

149
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,789
Because of you adults, everyone died.

150
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,210
My friends...

151
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,169
They're all dead.

152
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,840
You killed them all!

153
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,090
No!

154
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,759
- What was that? - Darn it.

155
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,929
What was that sound?

156
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:25,138
- What? - Wasn't that a gunshot?

157
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,220
- Hold on. - Was it shot in this building?

158
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,940
Darn it.

159
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,370
Won Bin.

160
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,659
Won Bin.

161
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,460
- Gosh. - What do we do?

162
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,758
Wake up, Won Bin.

163
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,840
Kim Won Bin!

164
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,549
Here.

165
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,219
- Mr. Kim... - Go get the blood-stopper!

166
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,099
- Yeon Ju, the blood-stopper! - Won Bin.

167
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,730
Quickly!

168
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,059
- Oh, my! - Go get it quickly.

169
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,940
Darn it.

170
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,070
Darn.

171
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,110
Hang in there.

172
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,370
No...

173
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,750
It's not my fault.

174
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,289
The adults...

175
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,299
The adults are to blame.

176
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,590
It's not my fault.

177
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,759
It's not my fault. It's not...

178
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,980
It's not my fault.

179
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,860
No...

180
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:32,450
(Duty After School)

181
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:38,210
Wild goose, this is seagull, over.

182
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,839
Wild goose, this is seagull, over.

183
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,769
He...

184
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,990
Is he asleep?

185
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,740
Mr. Lee.

186
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,000
Is he okay?

187
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,079
Fortunately, the bullet went through his shoulder.

188
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,379
He's not going to die.

189
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,039
Oh, goodness.

190
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,880
But he needs to be treated as soon as possible.

191
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,509
I'm all good,

192
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,469
so don't worry.

193
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,140
Won Bin, are you okay?

194
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,019
Gosh, I'm telling you I am.

195
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,240
- Don't get up. - Thank you.

196
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,529
You guys should go now.

197
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,289
- Duk Joong, what time is it? - What?

198
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,750
It's 10pm.

199
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,079
It's time to give him painkillers.

200
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,710
Leave that to me. Thanks.

201
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,588
I'm not going. I want to stay by his side.

202
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,008
- Let's just go already. - Why?

203
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,680
- Are you sure he's okay? - He will be all right.

204
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,259
I don't want to go.

205
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,599
Gosh.

206
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,609
Oh, goodness. Mr. Lee...

207
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,480
Please do it gently.

208
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,990
I'm already holding myself back from wanting to throw you a punch.

209
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,160
You were in no position to take that bullet for me.

210
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,789
If something bad happens to you,

211
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,710
the kids will be left without you.

212
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,380
I can't take care of them alone.

213
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,519
Don't blame...

214
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,980
that girl too much.

215
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,359
She must've been...

216
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,440
confused and terrified.

217
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,359
She'd believed that the adults would protect her,

218
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,950
so she must've felt betrayed.

219
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,329
I used to be like them as well.

220
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,539
Then now what?

221
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,589
I'll do the best I can.

222
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,089
How did it go?

223
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,549
How's Mr. Kim?

224
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,390
He's all right.

225
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,349
- Goodness. - What a relief.

226
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,109
Guys, what if they end up...

227
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,818
shooting us too?

228
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:59,029
Hey, lower your voice.

229
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,579
They might hear you.

230
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,450
Gosh.

231
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,459
I'm just anxious, that's why.

232
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,500
You really need to watch your tongue.

233
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,299
But I understand her in a sense.

234
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,799
It was like she took the words...

235
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:18,880
right out of my mouth.

236
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,650
Mr. Lee wants to see us all.

237
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
As soon as the sun rises tomorrow, we will withdraw...

238
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:42,868
and return to the camp.

239
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,989
- What? - Can we do that?

240
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,039
What about the mission?

241
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,329
I can't guarantee your safety here.

242
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,000
We can't even figure out how many spheres are out there.

243
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,710
And if they attack us all together,

244
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,670
we won't be able to handle them.

245
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,930
Look, Mr. Lee.

246
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,049
With what happened last time,

247
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,640
won't you get in trouble if you keep disobeying orders?

248
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,599
I've just decided that your safety is the current priority.

249
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,690
I'll take responsibility.

250
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,059
Don't worry.

251
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,109
The sentinels should make sure to keep guard on alert.

252
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,730
The rest should go to bed.

253
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,359
We'll take off right when the morning comes.

254
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,029
That's all.

255
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,249
- What? - But...

256
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,538
- Gosh, why must we go back? - He can't just go like that.

257
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,578
- It was hard to come here. - We're going back?

258
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,249
- My gosh. - If we just go like this...

259
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,709
- Are we really going back? - Just like this?

260
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,750
Let's go.

261
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,630
If this is what happened to a shelter,

262
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,220
I wonder what happened...

263
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,140
to our school.

264
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,980
But if we go back,

265
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,150
won't Mr. Lee get punished?

266
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,900
- What if he goes to the guardhouse? - The guardhouse?

267
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:03,569
This is worth the death penalty for sure.

268
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,740
- Death penalty? - No way.

269
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,579
Hey.

270
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,410
Stop, or you might jinx it.

271
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:14,920
Come to think of it, Mr. Lee's quite disobedient.

272
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,920
That's because of us.

273
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,799
By the way,

274
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,720
what will happen with extra points if we fail our mission?

275
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,639
Darn you.

276
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,059
We have to clear the mission to get extra points.

277
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,980
His nonsense is so darn consistent.

278
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,058
But if they don't send us to our parents...

279
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,518
for not clearing the mission?

280
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,109
Is that actually your concern when someone's to be executed?

281
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:45,240
Well, I was just saying...

282
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:46,619
Let's look on the bright side.

283
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,200
It's good that we're returning from this dangerous situation.

284
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:58,289
Culprits are bound to be at a crime scene.

285
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,380
("Dr. Frost")

286
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,759
Hold on.

287
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,180
What the?

288
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,049
My Coke.

289
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,180
I swear I put it in here.

290
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:13,389
- What? - Gosh.

291
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,729
- So Yoon. - What?

292
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,309
- Was it you? - What are you saying? I'm innocent!

293
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,940
What are you looking at?

294
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,900
I think that punk already drank it.

295
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,199
Darn, who took it?

296
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,199
- Hey. Goodness! Where is it? - What are you doing?

297
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,449
- Move. Where did it go? - Are you kidding me?

298
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,118
Knock it off, you punk.

299
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,880
- What is the matter with you? - Did you see it? Where did it go?

300
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,970
So Yeon.

301
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,650
You should be asleep. Why aren't you in bed?

302
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,859
Well, the thing is...

303
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,910
I'm worried about the return.

304
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,660
It's not yours to concern.

305
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,869
You came to say that?

306
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,750
Pardon?

307
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,970
Actually,

308
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,049
I have something to tell you.

309
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:34,890
What is it?

310
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,440
Mr. Lee.

311
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,109
The truth is, I...

312
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,819
- Duk Joong. - Good heavens!

313
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:49,990
- What are you doing? - Well, I...

314
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:52,319
I'm off to the bathroom.

315
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,329
- Go on. - Thank you...

316
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,369
Gosh.

317
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,670
What are you waiting for? Go on now.

318
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,380
This requires a great deal of focus.

319
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,390
What is it that you have to say?

320
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,740
It's nothing. Goodnight.

321
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,400
(Woo Hee Rak)

322
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,269
"Woo Hee Rak"?

323
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,609
I wonder how it went.

324
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:11,068
Kim Duk Joong, that pooper.

325
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:13,450
- She's back. - This is so annoying.

326
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,910
Did you tell him how you feel?

327
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:21,828
No, I don't think the time is right.

328
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:23,788
- Gosh. - My friend's helpless.

329
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,579
Goodness.

330
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:27,960
I'll do it when we return.

331
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,549
I don't get why you like him.

332
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,839
Gosh.

333
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,509
You see it's bound...

334
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,429
to get beautiful when you fall in love during a time of war.

335
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,890
What are you saying? Gosh, you're insane.

336
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:04,079
Na Ra, there's no need to do that much.

337
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:05,710
Okay?

338
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,500
Oh, right.

339
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:10,839
Get some sleep while I keep watch.

340
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,299
I'm okay.

341
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,680
I see.

342
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,730
Should I tell her now?

343
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:30,819
No, she'll think I'm a psycho if I tell her at this time.

344
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,029
Still,

345
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,910
it's just us here. This might be a chance to tell her.

346
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:47,000
- Look. - What?

347
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,710
Well...

348
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:55,170
Na Ra, do you perhaps...

349
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,339
have someone...

350
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,180
Do you perhaps have...

351
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:09,190
a celebrity you like?

352
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,359
- I see spheres. - What?

353
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,038
The detector doesn't show anything.

354
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,660
They're outside its radar.

355
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,710
About 2km away from here.

356
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,289
Let me see.

357
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,789
Are you saying they exchanged signals?

358
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,750
We're not exactly sure,

359
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:17,210
but a giant sphere gave out light in the sky.

360
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:20,839
Then a boss sphere emitted light as well.

361
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,549
After that,

362
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,799
they went somewhere.

363
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,809
It seemed like they were communicating.

364
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,680
So they're showing...

365
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,400
a pattern where a few go somewhere...

366
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,269
and come back...

367
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,609
after exchanging signals.

368
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,450
Maybe they're looking for something.

369
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,700
- Could it be... - Scouting.

370
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,829
Scouting?

371
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,869
Yes, it's as if they're scouting.

372
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,589
They're checking where people went.

373
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,089
They're smarter than we think.

374
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,430
They went somewhere around here and came back.

375
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,230
What's there?

376
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,440
I heard a shelter was there.

377
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,480
Our platoon commander said so.

378
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,150
That a small-sized shelter was there.

379
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:23,990
Hold on a second.

380
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,160
Then does it mean they got an order from the giant sphere...

381
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,579
and decided on a nearby shelter as their next target?

382
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,749
No way.

383
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,880
Because it has...

384
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,960
a lot to prey on.

385
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,759
- Pardon? - People gathered to find shelter,

386
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,180
but it ended up becoming a place full of prey.

387
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,809
And it got much easier for the spheres.

388
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:55,309
- Gosh. - We better inform them quickly,

389
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,859
but the communications are down.

390
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:58,940
What do we do?

391
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,740
We will...

392
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,619
withdraw tomorrow morning as planned.

393
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,460
Okay.

394
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,669
What about the shelter?

395
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,589
The number is too many.

396
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,880
Let's return as soon as possible and come up with another way.

397
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:27,089
What if the spheres attack them before then?

398
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,430
Given their speed, it'll be too late when the backup force arrives.

399
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,140
What are you trying to say?

400
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,229
There's nothing much we can do.

401
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,269
Right, we have to follow orders.

402
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,980
We can't go home until we kill all the spheres, no?

403
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:45,028
You know what happened to the Hamil High students.

404
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:46,240
You don't want to die, do you?

405
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:50,329
Right, it's too dangerous.

406
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,200
Soon Yi. You're scared too, right?

407
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:56,539
I'm scared.

408
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,000
But...

409
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,380
someone's parents might be there.

410
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,170
Who's going to protect them?

411
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,230
If we go, other students will come.

412
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,739
Sungjin High instead of Hamil High.

413
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,530
And another high after that.

414
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,789
Gosh.

415
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,340
I guess it's decided.

416
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,179
- Thank you. - You make me smile.

417
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,150
Doesn't it feel like...

418
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,809
the kids somehow became so mature?

419
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,440
Gosh, I feel so proud.

420
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,449
Maybe this is how a parent feels to watch their child grow.

421
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,869
Be honest with me. How old are you?

422
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,579
I'm 41.

423
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,010
It's a different spot.

424
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:21,230
We're going to get busy. Stay focused.

425
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,150
What are you talking about? I'm a patient.

426
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,690
There are no exceptions.

427
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,279
- Sir, you're too mean. - You heard me.

428
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Oh, please.

429
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,119
Attention.

430
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,329
The spheres are scattered near the neighbourhood,

431
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,920
and it's too dangerous to find and kill them 1-by-1.

432
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,050
Right.

433
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,460
So we will...

434
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,010
gather the spheres here at Maesong City University...

435
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,219
and get rid of them all at once.

436
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,599
- What? How? - How will we do that?

437
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:01,308
- At once? - How?

438
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:03,808
- Is that even possible? - How?

439
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:04,809
From now on,

440
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,690
listen carefully to what I say.

441
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,730
(Seolbong Building)

442
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,570
Be careful.

443
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:22,449
Oh, that.

444
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,369
What is it?

445
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,839
Isn't this the one, guys?

446
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,210
Yes, I think it is.

447
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,969
First off, we'll combine dynamite with depleted uranium...

448
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,590
to make depleted uranium explosives.

449
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,099
It was here.

450
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,349
- Hey, be careful! - Be careful.

451
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:47,349
Careful.

452
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Be careful.

453
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,070
This is not right.

454
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,360
Gosh.

455
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,070
There.

456
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,119
Platoon Two, attention.

457
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,449
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

458
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,159
Each team should figure out where to install the explosives...

459
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:08,250
and install them while ensuring safety.

460
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,130
When you're all done,

461
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,630
move quickly to the rooftop of Seolbong Building and stand by.

462
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,009
- Understood? - Yes, sir!

463
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,049
All teams, get to work.

464
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,130
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

465
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,940
Team One...

466
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,650
will restore power in the machine room.

467
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:43,659
(Basement Floor)

468
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,559
When the power is restored,

469
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,269
the rest will place the explosives in the building.

470
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,860
Team Six will observe the spheres...

471
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,690
until the job is done...

472
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,610
and cover the other teams so that they can leave safely.

473
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,739
If the spheres make an unusual move in the middle,

474
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,159
report to me right away.

475
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,539
So what are we doing with the explosives, Soo Chul?

476
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,209
Didn't you hear Mr. Lee?

477
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,969
I got distracted because I chipped my nail.

478
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:44,349
We'll place the explosives, lure the spheres, and...

479
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,510
And?

480
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,519
Bam!

481
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,980
It's simple.

482
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Simple, you say?

483
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,360
If we fail to place the explosives, we'll die.

484
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,110
If we fail to lure the spheres, we'll die.

485
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,449
If we fail to kill them all at once, we'll die.

486
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,659
We'll also die if we're distracted during this operation like you.

487
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:11,619
What do you think? Is it simple?

488
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,300
Where? Where do we look to keep watch?

489
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,670
Gosh.

490
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:32,849
- Duk Joong. - Yes.

491
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:38,819
- Duk Joong. - Wait. I'm working on it.

492
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,900
Take this.

493
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,609
- Jun Hee. - Yes.

494
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,820
- So Yeon. - Hold this.

495
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,279
Didn't you learn how to do this?

496
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,949
Darn, I learned the easy way.

497
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,538
When you're all done installing the explosives,

498
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:53,659
- Slowly. - seal every door to the outside...

499
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,289
and move swiftly to the rooftop to stand by there.

500
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,090
- Do we install the explosive here? - Yes.

501
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,929
Give it to me. I'll do it.

502
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,570
What is this smell?

503
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,820
- It keeps smelling like spheres. - What?

504
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:28,199
You know, there's this fishy smell peculiar to them.

505
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:46,429
What's with this mood?

506
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,139
Hey, Young Soo. Do you have a crush on So Yeon?

507
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:51,969
What are you saying? I don't.

508
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:54,980
I guess you do like her.

509
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,348
Hey, this is enough.

510
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,150
Hey, you shouldn't say it stinks about a boy who likes you.

511
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,650
I mean, I really appreciate it. Right, Young Soo?

512
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,110
Stop it.

513
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,619
What on earth? You don't stink at all.

514
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,869
Hey, try smelling him again.

515
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,750
Darn, I told you to stop!

516
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,210
Are you out of your mind, you darn moron?

517
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:27,380
- Hey. - Stop.

518
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,889
This isn't the time to fight. Come back to your senses.

519
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:35,559
Wait until we talk later.

520
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:57,500
We'll lure the spheres,

521
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,960
and when every entrance is sealed, we'll explode the bombs...

522
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,000
and kill them all.

523
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,369
- They've started moving. - What?

524
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,250
Darn it.

525
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,380
Where?

526
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,139
Hey, hold this.

527
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:57,769
Mr. Lee, the spheres are moving unusually.

528
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,389
I think they're preparing to take off.

529
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:12,739
- Already? - Darn it.

530
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:15,570
Guys, let's do it quickly.

531
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:18,619
The kids.

532
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,699
What about the kids?

533
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,869
They aren't done with their job yet.

534
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,750
What do we do about them?

535
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:42,729
- Did you hear it? - Yes.

536
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,018
- Gosh. - It's too soon. What do we do?

537
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,518
Isn't it obvious? Let's install them quickly.

538
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,480
- Let's move. - Go.

539
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,899
They're moving already?

540
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,489
Gosh, this is strange.

541
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:53,739
Darn it.

542
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:56,738
What are you waiting for? Run!

543
00:44:56,739 --> 00:44:58,369
Goodness, gracious.

544
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:03,079
We must change their direction before they arrive at the shelter.

545
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,050
Aren't you done yet?

546
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,889
We have a few left.

547
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,389
If we don't lure them now, the shelter will be attacked.

548
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:23,178
But if this rings, they'll come in 10 minutes.

549
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,269
What, 10 minutes?

550
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,059
Let's wrap it up in 10 minutes and leave this place.

551
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,940
Platoon Two, begin luring the spheres.

552
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,329
- Young Sin, can you do it? - Yes, I think so.

553
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,210
We'll begin the operation to lure the spheres now.

554
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:48,920
Everyone, wrap it up in 10 minutes...

555
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,539
and move to Seolbong Building.

556
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,250
Are you kidding me?

557
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,019
Gosh.

558
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,360
It's stuck!

559
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:14,739
Let me try.

560
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,239
Push!

561
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:29,420
Quickly!

562
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,550
All right, it's loud.

563
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,800
One, two, three.

564
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,320
Oh, come on!

565
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,448
My hands are so shaky that I can't do it properly.

566
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,030
- Let me do it. - Help me.

567
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:07,619
Aren't you done yet? We must get out now.

568
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,289
I'm almost done.

569
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,829
- Are you? - Yes.

570
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,840
Do we do it for real?

571
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,420
- Do it! - Darn it.

572
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:25,639
What are you waiting for? Smash it now!

573
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:31,559
- They're almost here. Hurry up! - Where are the others?

574
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,529
We must go. Let's go!

575
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:37,820
Let's go!

576
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,199
- Run. - Goodness.

577
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,820
Gosh!

578
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,699
(Seolbong Building)

579
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,079
Mr. Lee, we must get out now.

580
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,420
I have to connect them all. I'm almost done.

581
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,380
We'll do the rest.

582
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,340
Then finish it up in the hallway.

583
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,260
Let's go.

584
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:21,280
Let me help.

585
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:51,679
They're crowding in.

586
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,690
Why aren't they coming?

587
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,238
- Bo Ra. - Guys. What about the others?

588
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,360
- Gosh. - Where?

589
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,869
There are too many!

590
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:11,829
Darn, we're doomed.

591
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,369
Mr. Lee, you must get out of there quickly!

592
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,170
Run!

593
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:29,929
Go without me.

594
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:32,309
Mr. Kim.

595
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,940
I'll follow you soon. Be careful.

596
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,030
- Gosh. - Darn it.

597
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:57,500
- Come on. Do it faster. - Darn it.

598
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,789
How many more do you have left?

599
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,630
A few more.

600
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,630
Darn.

601
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:07,260
Hurry.

602
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:12,219
Darn it.

603
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:13,969
We have no time. Finish it quickly!

604
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,030
They went toward the main building, right?

605
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,900
I can't see.

606
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,780
Let's go downstairs.

607
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,869
Goodness.

608
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,868
- What do we do? - They shouldn't come this soon.

609
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,999
- Guys! - What?

610
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,079
- What is it? - Let's go first.

611
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,459
- Gosh, where are you going? - This way!

612
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,510
- What? - Darn it.

613
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,880
What do we do?

614
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,429
- What is it? - What? Why are they going there?

615
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:53,559
- Let's do this quickly. - Darn.

616
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,480
Mr. Lee.

617
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,190
The spheres have come very close.

618
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,400
Goodness.

619
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,699
I'll wrap it up. Move to Seolbong Building.

620
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:15,039
I'll do it.

621
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:18,409
The kids' safety comes first.

622
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,119
Go with the kids.

623
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:23,090
Now.

624
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,630
Finish it and join us quickly.

625
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:32,050
Kids, let's go downstairs.

626
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,389
No, I'm not going.

627
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,139
- Hurry and go. - No.

628
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,150
Now!

629
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,320
No...

630
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,408
I'm not going!

631
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,409
Hurry up!

632
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:56,158
I don't want to go.

633
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:58,658
- Let's go. - Hurry up!

634
00:51:58,659 --> 00:52:00,538
- I don't want to go. - Come on!

635
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:01,619
Go!

636
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,500
- Go quickly. - Move!

637
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,380
Darn it.

638
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,650
Darn, not again.

639
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,150
There are too many.

640
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:31,739
They're swarming in.

641
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,119
What about the others?

642
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,000
Soo Chul...

643
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:00,769
Let's go.

644
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,690
Let's go.

645
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,170
Come quick.

646
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:07,769
Let's arrive safely first.

647
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,150
Now.

648
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,610
Darn it.

649
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,329
Gosh.

650
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,670
Gosh.

651
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,738
They should be here. Why aren't they coming yet?

652
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:04,659
- Guys, they're coming. - What?

653
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,699
Young Sin, over here!

654
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:10,159
- Gosh. - Young Sin.

655
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:11,500
Thank goodness.

656
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,499
- Why is it just you two? - Yeon Ju.

657
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,669
What about the rest?

658
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,299
- Oh, no. - Darn it.

659
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,420
- Why aren't they coming? - What...

660
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:28,969
Gosh.

661
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,440
Goodness.

662
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,618
- They're here. - Oh, it's them.

663
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,420
- Eun Young. - Thank goodness.

664
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,710
- Are you okay? - Yes, what about you?

665
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:28,340
Jang Soo, connect the line.

666
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,889
What about Mr. Lee?

667
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:34,139
What happened?

668
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:38,559
Everyone,

669
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,110
stand by here...

670
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,739
until there's an order from Mr. Lee.

671
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,159
- What? - Why?

672
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:50,739
- What? - What's going on?

673
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:52,658
So Yeon, what happened?

674
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:55,539
- So Yeon, where's Mr. Lee? - Why isn't he here?

675
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,500
- So Yeon. - What is it?

676
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,710
- What happened? - What is going on?

677
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:38,909
(Seolbong Building)

678
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,079
(Field Trip, the Best Part of College Life)

679
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,710
(Curriculum)

680
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:00,079
Sungjin High Platoon Two.

681
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:03,409
- This is the platoon commander. - Mr. Lee.

682
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,539
Initiate...

683
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,550
the explosion now.

684
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,380
But you are still in the building.

685
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:17,929
I'm not, so explode the building.

686
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:20,639
Where is he?

687
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,610
You must do it now to kill the spheres.

688
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,360
No, Mr. Lee. Get out of there now. Quickly!

689
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,030
Mr. Lee.

690
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,159
I'll go now.

691
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:40,409
- What? - I'll go too.

692
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:42,250
Are you going to get us all killed here?

693
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,829
Kim Won Bin, pull yourself together.

694
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,539
If you don't explode the building now,

695
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,630
all of us will die.

696
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:59,300
No... No, Mr. Lee.

697
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:03,309
Please get out of there.

698
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,059
Please!

699
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,019
Blow it, Won Bin.

700
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,360
I can't escape anyway.

701
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,530
Don't let me die in vain.

702
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:17,820
This is an order.

703
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,239
Blow it now.

704
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,369
The spheres might come out soon.

705
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,789
What...

706
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,460
At this rate...

707
01:02:41,719 --> 01:02:42,719
What do we do?

708
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,360
No...

709
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,239
- No. - There is no other way.

710
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:09,750
You promised...

711
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,590
that you'd protect us until the end.

712
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,130
So please get out of there.

713
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,760
Please!

714
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,360
I'm sorry...

715
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,199
I can't protect you until the end...

716
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:44,949
as I promised.

717
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:48,329
And...

718
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:52,579
for dragging you into this war as an adult.

719
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,889
At first, I thought you were just disobedient kids.

720
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:11,190
But now that I think about it,

721
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,019
I'm so grateful...

722
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,280
and proud of you.

723
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,280
Thanks to you,

724
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:27,079
this endless war...

725
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,869
didn't feel so frightening.

726
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:34,460
So,

727
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:36,920
trust and rely...

728
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:40,880
on the friends next to you.

729
01:04:43,889 --> 01:04:45,510
Protect each other.

730
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,599
And...

731
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:55,860
do not get killed.

732
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,880
This is my last order.

733
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,010
Initiate the explosion.

734
01:05:25,179 --> 01:05:26,219
That's all.

735
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:40,900
Mr. Lee.

736
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,280
Mr. Lee!

737
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,320
No... This isn't right.

738
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:49,079
No!

739
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:53,119
