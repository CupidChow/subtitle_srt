1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,628
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,629 --> 00:00:02,669
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,619
What do we do?

4
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,520
What's going on?

5
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:02,689
Shoot.

6
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,569
Guys, can't we just stay in the truck?

7
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:08,989
Come on.

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,659
Move.

9
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:13,500
Hurry.

10
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,250
What is that?

11
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,040
Isn't that Class One's truck?

12
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,000
Yu Jung, you're with me.

13
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,129
The rest of you, search the perimeter.

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,969
To your positions.

15
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,930
Wait.

16
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,598
Did they all get eaten up by the spheres?

17
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,730
Hey, stop saying unlucky stuff.

18
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,650
I'm just scared.

19
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,829
So, the kids...

20
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,709
What the heck is going on?

21
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,250
What?

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,719
Lieutenant!

23
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,060
Look.

24
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,240
They must have hidden.

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,659
They couldn't have gone far.

26
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,579
Duk Joong and Hee Rak, go back down and stay on guard.

27
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,699
Bo Ra and Na Ra, cover our right flank.

28
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,539
Ae Seol, Ha Na, and Yu Jung,

29
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,370
come with me.

30
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,250
- To your positions. - Sir.

31
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:56,219
But I'm scared.

32
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,150
What's that?

33
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,229
What is it?

34
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,240
Something's flapping over there.

35
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:16,330
Darn it.

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,370
Lieutenant! It's a sphere!

37
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,539
Get ready to fire!

38
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:31,419
Oh, no.

39
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,300
What do I do?

40
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:02,960
Move.

41
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,129
Fire!

42
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,680
Die, scum!

43
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,600
Die!

44
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,439
Get the key!

45
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,899
Shoot.

46
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,480
Hey, punk!

47
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,489
Get in the truck. Now!

48
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,699
Shoot.

49
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
- Do you think you can reach it? - Come on.

50
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,449
Darn.

51
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,620
- Kill them! - Die!

52
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,990
Crap.

53
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,160
Can you reach it?

54
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,489
Hee Rak, get in the truck.

55
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,579
Just a little more. No?

56
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,540
What?

57
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,209
- Here. - Get in the truck now!

58
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,680
Start the truck!

59
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,768
We're ready!

60
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:46,060
Okay. Drive.

61
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,269
Here I go.

62
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,439
Hang on tight!

63
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,189
Jang Soo...

64
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,069
What do we do about him?

65
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,160
Where's Hee Rak?

66
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,160
Crap.

67
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,939
Crap! Go away!

68
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,399
Freak!

69
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,169
Stupid. Where's your bluff now?

70
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:01,340
I remembered that the thing was weak against the cold.

71
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,379
I wasn't sure, but...

72
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,009
Are you laughing?

73
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,399
Here.

74
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,879
Idiot.

75
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,169
Did you think I'd help you up?

76
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,090
Let's go.

77
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,059
Let's go!

78
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,558
I was the one who saved you.

79
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,690
Why are you acting like the hero?

80
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,909
By the way,

81
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,289
why did you do it?

82
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,370
Do what?

83
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,539
Stop trying to be a hero.

84
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,669
Whatever.

85
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,379
We're so incompatible.

86
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,369
I thought I'd never see you again!

87
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,539
Do you want some water?

88
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,549
- Where do you think you're going? - What?

89
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,629
We thought that we'd lost you.

90
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,258
Don't even get me started on that. We barely made it out.

91
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,639
We had it pretty tough too.

92
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,638
- Right, Duk Joong? - It was legendary.

93
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,768
We'd need more than three days...

94
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,519
to finish telling our story.

95
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,639
Jang Soo.

96
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,019
Am I wrong?

97
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,480
Four days.

98
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,450
- What did he say? - That was so random.

99
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,120
- Lame. - Lame.

100
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,659
You're so boring.

101
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,709
- Guys. - You still smell.

102
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,538
- What? - Take a shower, please!

103
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,589
- I did. Four days ago. - What?

104
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,379
- Why? - That's impossible.

105
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,589
It's good to see you alive.

106
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,628
Wasn't there water?

107
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:51,840
What?

108
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,758
- I'm so glad to have you back. - Get off me.

109
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,799
Same here.

110
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,559
Come here, Hee Rak!

111
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,690
- Is that okay? - What's wrong with you?

112
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,768
I hurt myself.

113
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,979
- How? - No, she's just being a crybaby.

114
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,028
- She is! - Seriously.

115
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,359
Oh, my gosh.

116
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,860
How are you doing?

117
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,699
Fine.

118
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,029
We'll get you treated soon.

119
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,330
Are you okay?

120
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,370
Are you hurt?

121
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,710
Well, I'm fine.

122
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,340
That's a relief.

123
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,710
I was worried sick.

124
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,009
What?

125
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:37,509
I'm relieved...

126
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,679
that everyone's safe.

127
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,100
Right. Me too.

128
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,029
Thanks...

129
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,409
for coming for us.

130
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,230
- Won Bin! - What?

131
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,059
- Kids! - Won Bin!

132
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,439
- Won Bin! - Look who's here!

133
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,898
- I can't believe it! - You guys came!

134
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,200
Are you all feeling okay?

135
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,359
Are you hurt or anything?

136
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,569
- No. - Are you okay?

137
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,119
You look way older.

138
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,039
I got older every second I waited for you.

139
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,409
- You're all safe? - Yes.

140
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,210
Young Soo!

141
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,049
- You're here. - Hey.

142
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,590
It sounds like you don't want us here.

143
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:58,629
Selfish bastard.

144
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,350
If we had failed to come, he would have celebrated...

145
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,559
having less competition.

146
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:06,519
Come on, buddy.

147
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Young Soo!

148
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,279
Did you set up all these by yourself for your classmates?

149
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,190
Good work.

150
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,450
Young Soo was...

151
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,490
also worried about you guys.

152
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,240
So, don't give him a hard time.

153
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,669
Attention.

154
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,128
Great job on making it alive.

155
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:34,299
This is the boys' tent, and this is the girls' tent.

156
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,710
To your tents!

157
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,470
You want us to rest here?

158
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,508
But we narrowly escaped death on our way here.

159
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:40,799
You'll have to get used to it.

160
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:44,429
The cots are 1st-come-1st-served.

161
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,850
To your positions!

162
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,350
What?

163
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,939
You're so sneaky!

164
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,230
- Hurry. - I want to go to the back!

165
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,939
Thanks.

166
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,070
Yes!

167
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,450
Awesome. It's soft.

168
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,450
I was dying to wash. They have everything here.

169
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,169
Lieutenant.

170
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,090
Sergeant.

171
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,379
Welcome back.

172
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,379
Take care of the kids.

173
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,429
Check this out! See?

174
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:27,769
- Hey. - Not so fast.

175
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,559
Come on!

176
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,268
I'm taking it.

177
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:33,100
- Stop all this fight. - Get him!

178
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,819
But I want it!

179
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,190
Not on my watch.

180
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,320
- Catch him! - Come here.

181
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,658
- But I want it. - Throw it.

182
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:44,909
Throw it away.

183
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,370
You ought to be executed!

184
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,158
Going AWOL, using unauthorized gear,

185
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,450
and insubordination!

186
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,159
What else?

187
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,000
- I apologize, sir. - "Apologize?"

188
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:58,629
Buddy.

189
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:02,509
Is that your apologizing look?

190
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,309
- I ought to... - Sir!

191
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,269
You'll be shot to death next time.

192
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,279
Eventually, you brought the kids here safely.

193
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,909
We'll at least be able to tell the superiors and parents something.

194
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,700
Thank you, sir.

195
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,029
You're a madman.

196
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,409
Dismissed.

197
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:36,709
That imbecile.

198
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,539
I can't even send him to prison.

199
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,960
Should we send him?

200
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,379
What are you talking about?

201
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,759
He's twice as better a soldier as you are.

202
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,299
Gosh.

203
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,470

(Duty After School)

205
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,880
- He looks good! - Look at you.

206
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,180
You look like a middle-aged woman.

207
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,059
Hi!

208
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,808
Stop filming.

209
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,150
You certainly know who the cutest girl is.

210
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,979
It's better than I thought.

211
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,069
Soon Yi. How do I look?

212
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,700
Check this out.

213
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,779
Get that camera out of my face!

214
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,289
How are you?

215
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,410
You guys are a cute couple!

216
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,039
Beautiful.

217
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,250
I'm jealous.

218
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,170
We're not trainees anymore. We're reservists.

219
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,390
But now that I'm in uniform,

220
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,049
it feels so odd.

221
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,939
We just finished counting.

222
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,568
(Reservist number 19, Cho Young Sin)

223
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,190
A lot of us couldn't come with us.

226
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,449
aren't with us anymore.

(Reservist number 23, Choi Yeon Ju)

228
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,200
I still can't believe it.

229
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,288
You have to shave this part nicely.

230
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,249
- You need to be careful. - Gosh.

231
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,750
It was torn.

232
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Seriously. Do you want to see it?

233
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,630
Poor you.

234
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,048
Kimchi! Get out of here!

235
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,379
- What are you doing? - Sorry.

236
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,469
- I'm really sorry. - Hey.

237
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,930
Pervert.

238
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,519
- What? - What happened?

239
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
What's wrong with me?

240
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,558
- I'm so sorry! - Is her eye okay?

241
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,190
- Use that one. - This one?

242
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,690
How are you feeling, So Yeon? All right?

243
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,529
Yes. I'm all cured now.

244
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:50,818
(Reservist number 21, Cha So Yeon)

245
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,160
I almost got everyone killed.

246
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,200
I felt so bad that I could die.

247
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,828
(Reservist number 21, Cha So Yeon)

248
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,660
But what if the scar never goes away?

249
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,789
You're so cool!

250
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,130
It's nothing.

251
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,170
- Aren't they heavy, Soo Chul? - They're not.

252
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,719
Soo Chul, you must be really strong.

253
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,970
This was nothing.

254
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:15,339
Cheer up, Young Soo.

255
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,720
Cheer up.

256
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,230
Young Soo!

257
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,518
- Do you ever help? - Fine.

258
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,979
How long have we been here?

259
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,268
Who knows? Get back to work.

260
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,729
I was so relieved when I first got here.

(Reservist number 12, Wang Tae Man)

262
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:35,450
But it was still the army.

263
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,409
Shovel it in properly.

264
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,660
We'd be perfectly fine if you held the bag properly.

265
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,920
Don't you think we're shovelling too often?

266
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:54,048
We dig waterways, foxholes,

267
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:55,839
and make camps all day!

268
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,009
This is messed up.

269
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,308
Soon Yi, I ate dirt. Soon Yi!

270
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,430
By the way, Chi Yeol,

271
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,889
- Yes? - we'll be moved to a shelter...

272
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,479
before CSAT, right?

273
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,149
(Reservist number 1, Kook Young Soo)

274
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,109
Then, we'd only have a few days.

275
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,778
I didn't even get to mathematics for seniors.

276
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,029
(Reservist number 1, Kook Young Soo)

277
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,160
You're still talking about studying in these circumstances?

278
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,039
- What? - It's gone!

279
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,159
- What? - What?

280
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,869
- My underwear! - Gosh.

281
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,788
- Unbelievable. - You took it, didn't you?

282
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,549
- It wasn't me. - Says who?

283
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,919
These perverts!

284
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,008
Gosh. It's right here.

285
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:38,719
- Gross. - I knew it.

286
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,099
I heard we'd be discharged soon. Is that true?

287
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,099
- Yu Jung. - Yes?

288
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,059
Do you have any info?

289
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,940
I have no idea.

290
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,859
They all ask me, though.

291
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:55,190
Yu Jung, you look exhausted.

292
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,859
I'm fine.

293
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:03,619
Class President! What's for dinner?

294
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,289
- Class President! - Yes?

295
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:08,959
- How do we do it? - Are you slacking over there?

296
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,288
- Are you holding it? - Yes.

297
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,588
Is this how we do it?

298
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,839
Three people sleep in this tiny tent?

299
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,009
It looks small even for two.

300
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,220
No!

301
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,679
This isn't a tent. This is a rag.

302
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,519
Anyway, we're doomed.

303
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,439
Tae Man is going to take up the whole space.

304
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,769
Stop complaining.

305
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,190
This is a fun activity, compared to other drills.

306
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,440
Be optimistic and consider it camping.

307
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,490
Darn it.

308
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,039
It doesn't go in! This is so messed up.

309
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,159
The group that fails to set it up properly...

310
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,750
will have to take it apart and start over.

311
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,419
These are the tents that we'll use in the actual battle,

312
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,210
so stop fooling around. Take this seriously!

313
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:57,379
I fixed it, so don't trip on it.

314
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,420
Okay.

315
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,470
Soon Yi!

316
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,258
Hey, Yu Jung! Come here.

317
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,139
I can't be in this group. Let me move to a new one.

318
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,650
It's like they're crying for milk.

319
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,190
Just get in there!

320
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,779
That boy from another school was pretty cute.

321
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:21,990
He asked for my number.

322
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:24,200
But we don't even have phones.

323
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,369
What about the boy in Class One?

324
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,039
I ended things with him already.

325
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:29,829
He doesn't get training.

326
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,500
I can't date a guy who hasn't even fired a rifle.

327
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,089
Men who haven't finished their military service...

328
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,049
are little boys to me now.

329
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,588
Whatever you say.

330
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:39,630
Hey.

331
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,799
You do it. I'm done.

332
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,508
But I can't do it if you can't do it!

333
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,140
Oh, gosh.

334
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,680
Let me try.

335
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,348
Na Ra!

336
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,018
- Ae Seol, hold on tightly. - Wait.

337
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,230
Give me a second.

338
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,190
Seriously. What are you doing?

339
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:05,739
What is the matter with you?

340
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,410
Sorry.

341
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,160
Hold onto it!

342
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:34,808
Hi, Bo Ra.

343
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,019
Hey, No Ae.

344
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,819
Why don't you just drop out?

345
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,700
- Why? - It's for your own good.

346
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,029
What do you get from staying here?

347
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,910
Are you dying to go to college too?

348
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,539
No, right?

349
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,500
Who cares about college?

350
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,000
You could get in serious trouble if you stayed.

351
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,130
I'm not leaving.

352
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,298
All my friends are here.

353
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,180
You don't have any friends!

354
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,009
Ae Seol does have friends.

355
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,559
Gosh.

356
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,599
Never mind. I shouldn't have said anything.

357
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,539
Stop being nosy about everything.

358
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,210
What is the meaning of being nosy?

359
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,839
Na Ra, are you being a show-off for being a good marksman?

360
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:48,429
Why do you care what I say to No Ae?

361
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,469
You're always on her...

362
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,220
You probably feel fine because you manage everything.

363
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,019
Do you think you'll be accepting when she causes you trouble?

364
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,059
You don't know anything.

365
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,690
Neither do you.

366
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,359
I don't manage everything.

367
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,619
- What? - We're all trying as we suffer.

368
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:15,160
The same applies to Ae Seol.

369
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,129
As you can see, most medium spheres...

370
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,930
have fallen.

371
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:32,349
We seem to have eliminated 20 percent of the smaller spheres.

372
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,809
In the process, unfortunately, we have lost...

373
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,930
about 50 percent of our soldiers.

374
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,269
Most of these spheres are crowded in the city.

375
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,569
There are fewer spheres in the suburbs.

376
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:47,239
We believe that this is because the spheres...

377
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,569
take nourishment from humans.

378
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,990
So,

379
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,119
because they feed on humans,

380
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,039
they're mostly where there are people.

381
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,210
- Is that what you mean? - Yes, sir.

382
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,828
Also, since we figured out...

383
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,670
that the spheres are weak against the cold,

384
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,169
the UN has been developing cryogenic weapons...

385
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,088
to get rid of them.

386
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:08,338
We can't just wait for them.

387
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:10,180
We're hopelessly outnumbered, sir.

388
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,720
It will get cold soon, so we can wait until...

389
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,518
If the large spheres drop as we wait,

390
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,390
and we all die!

391
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,729
While the main units eliminate the spheres,

392
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,569
we need to stop those tiny evil beings!

393
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:33,910
Hey.

394
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,950
What's the use of Student Reserve Forces?

395
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,589
The military and the people are...

396
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,799
well aware of your hard work.

397
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,140
There have been sacrifices along the way,

398
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,809
but you are the proud sons and daughters...

399
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,890
that protect this nation from alien beings.

400
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,940
Have pride in it.

401
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,109
- Hey. - To end this war...

402
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,230
What do you think he wants that it takes so long to build it up?

403
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,979
- Maybe... - Eliminating...

404
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,739
- he's sending us home. - the smaller spheres...

405
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,609
- Seriously? - No way.

406
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,869
I'm worried.

407
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,279
From now on,

408
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,909
I will make the important announcement.

409
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,039
Sorry.

410
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,368
At 0700 hours the succeeding day,

411
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,368
the reservists of the second platoon,

412
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,000
Class 3-2 of Sungjin High School,

413
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,920
will carry out an operation of eliminating the spheres.

414
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,299
- An operation? - What?

415
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,379
- Are we going to war? - What is this nonsense?

416
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,889
- There's no way. - I thought we were going home!

417
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,849
- This makes no sense. - What's "the succeeding day?"

418
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,220
It means tomorrow.

419
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,309
Quiet!

420
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,769
Second Platoon leader.

421
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,539
Second Platoon...

422
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:08,880
will leave the camp tomorrow at 0700 hours,

423
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,009
join the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Brigade,

424
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,380
and carry out...

425
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,049
the clean-up operation.

426
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,890
Crap.

427
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,969
The objective of this operation is to go through...

428
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,808
the nearby residential areas...

429
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,190
and head to Maesong-Si.

430
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:28,809
We must eliminate as many spheres...

431
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,529
we encounter along the way as possible.

432
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,700
As you know, these are hard times.

433
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,950
Most national infrastructure collapsed,

434
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:42,869
and we've lost numerous soldiers.

435
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,910
We're in desperate need of riflemen.

436
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:48,960
Keep in mind that you are currently soldiers.

437
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,380
What about the CSAT?

438
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:56,838
I really need to take the CSAT.

439
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,049
Shut it.

440
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,680
No way.

441
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,519
After the operation, you will take the test as scheduled.

442
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,519
Given that you conducted the operation successfully,

443
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:08,940
not only will you get extra CSAT scores,

444
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,319
but you will also return to your family.

445
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,119
Dismissed!

446
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,759
Heck.

447
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,339
I knew something was up.

448
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,720
I asked the other kids,

449
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,308
and we're going first because we're the largest group.

450
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:48,519
This is so annoying.

451
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,359
Who made a fuss about being discharged?

452
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,450
I can't eat.

453
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,660
Well, that's a first.

454
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,829
You're right. Being able to eat in this situation would be bizarre.

455
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,390
A will, sir?

456
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,970
(Kim Yu Jung, Yeon Bo Ra...)

457
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:30,309
But they're already scared.

458
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,650
How would we ask them?

459
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,950
- I'll hand them out. - Leave them.

460
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,990
This will...

461
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,039
only put you in a fix.

462
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,589
Lieutenant!

463
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,269
(No Ae Seol)

464
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:12,849
(Cho Young Sin)

465
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,619
Apparently, writing a will is...

466
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,579
only a formality before an operation.

467
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,199
Also, cut your fingernails or your hair...

468
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,250
to submit them in these bags. These are for...

469
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,339
These are for your funeral...

470
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,879
when they can't find your body.

471
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,798
What? Are we going out to die?

472
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,179
No, that's not it.

473
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,890
Stop scaring us.

474
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,558
It's a formality.

475
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,440
Exactly. Why do we need to do it if it's only a formality?

476
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,940
It's because it's going to be dangerous!

477
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,900
I thought we were being discharged.

478
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,779
Why are they sending us for an operation?

479
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:04,239
I'm not sure about that. But...

480
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,279
Hey.

481
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,119
Ask again if you're not sure.

482
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,038
Ask them if this is necessary...

483
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,000
- Ha Na, stop. - She's the class president.

484
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Why don't you even ask them such things?

485
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,130
You had the nerve to just accept these?

486
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,920
Hey, stop yelling at her.

487
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,429
You couldn't even say a word in front of the commander.

488
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,720
So what?

489
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,640
She's Senior Private.

490
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,390
Then, she should represent all of us.

491
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,268
Are you grubbing...

492
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,099
for extra CSAT scores, or what?

493
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,940
You do it.

494
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,229
You little punk. What did you say to her?

495
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,900
Let go of me, jerk.

496
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:44,818
- Darn you. - Stop fighting, guys.

497
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:46,359
What do you want?

498
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,319
Jerk.

499
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,380
Yu Jung, how are you so unaffected?

500
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,589
Doesn't this scare you?

501
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:09,469
Man, I hate this.

502
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:13,969
Yu Jung.

503
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,309
Even for me, a will doesn't sound right.

504
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,539
Ridiculous.

505
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,320
Jang Soo.

506
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,289
To be honest, I became the class president...

507
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,710
for the student records.

508
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:21,369
At first,

509
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,710
I had zero consideration...

510
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,670
for a sense of duty or responsibility.

511
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,969
By only a one-vote difference,

512
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,519
you became the president, and I the vice president.

513
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,269
Do you remember?

514
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,570
I just realized how lucky I was.

515
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,570
Because I couldn't have done it as well as you.

516
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,380
Hey, Kimchi.

517
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,550
Are you sleeping?

518
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,130
No. I can't fall asleep.

519
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:17,260
Do you remember the beginning of the semester...

520
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,519
when we made a list of girls by popularity?

521
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,389
Yes, I do remember.

522
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,940
Was So Yeon in first place?

523
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,570
- And Ha Na was second? - Hey.

524
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,609
The girls found out about it later on...

525
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,609
they threw a fit.

526
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,110
I was terrified.

527
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:34,530
Me too.

528
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,448
Seeing the girls without washing or cleaning themselves up,

529
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,659
the difference is noticeable.

530
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:45,170
This must be what's truly scary about war.

531
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,750
It's terrifying.

532
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,420
Some aren't different.

533
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,719
Kimchi.

534
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:00,010
What?

535
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,939
We used to take classes,

536
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,599
go to Internet cafés, and goof around.

537
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,900
Days passed by without me giving much thought to it.

538
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,489
I never imagined...

539
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,860
this would happen to us.

540
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,368
- Ouch. - What was that?

541
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,698
You're talking too much. I can't sleep.

542
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:26,250
Did we wake you up? I'm sorry.

543
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,000
Can anyone sleep right now?

544
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:38,139
The thought of having to sleep is keeping me awake.

545
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:45,059
Hi.

546
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,480
You can't sleep either, right?

547
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,239
It's merciless.

548
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,820
The kids...

549
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:00,409
Wait.

550
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:01,739
Where did it go?

551
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,159
You're all here.

552
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:46,619
I can't sleep.

553
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,579
It's tomorrow. What are we supposed to do?

554
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,750
I'm really scared.

555
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,049
It won't be that dangerous in the suburbs.

556
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:00,468
Then why would they have us write our wills?

557
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:04,218
They'll let us go home if we get through this.

558
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,599
That's the only reason I'm going.

559
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:08,519
If we get through this...

560
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,610
I miss my parents.

561
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
Me too.

562
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:21,989
Darn it.

563
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:25,788
- Mom... - I miss my mom's kimchi jjigae.

564
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:27,118
- I'd gulp it down. - Mom.

565
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,868
I miss my mom.

566
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,039
- I miss my mom. - What else?

567
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,960
Quiet.

568
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,260
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

569
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,510
It's hot in here.

570
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:42,299
- Sorry. - Stop it.

571
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,429
- Move it. - Stop it.

572
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,019
- Won Bin. - Duk Joong.

573
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,400
You guys.

574
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:06,909
I'm sorry.

575
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,789
We couldn't sleep.

576
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:10,960
We'll go back immediately.

577
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,749
- We should sleep. - Go on.

578
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,038
Let's go.

579
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,039
You guys.

580
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,010
I heard you didn't have dinner.

581
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,010
Sergeant Kim.

582
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,639
Yes, sir.

583
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,429
Bring that over now.

584
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:32,179
Yes, sir.

585
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,979
What is this?

586
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,399
- What is it? - I don't know.

587
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,320
- It's bread. - Is it good?

588
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:21,440
This is a magic trick that turns hardtacks into a cupcake.

589
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,739
There you go.

590
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:29,159
- Duk Joong. - Yes?

591
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:35,709
It smells amazing.

592
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,959
It's so good.

593
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,670
- It really is. - Hey.

594
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,670
Caught it.

595
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:51,349
- Nice. - Good job.

596
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:55,940
Catch.

597
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,649
I didn't know hardtacks were this good.

598
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,779
- I used to throw them away. - Me too.

599
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,659
The hardtack-sando is amazing.

600
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:11,280
I'll salivate when I see hardtacks from now on like Pavlov's dog.

601
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,000
You mean the dog of Flanders.

602
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,210
Patrasche?

603
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,510
You can be the dog.

604
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:36,730
Forget it if I'm wrong.

605
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,150
- You didn't... - How could you?

606
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:40,650
No way.

607
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,860
What are you doing?

608
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,400
Tae Man!

609
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,159
Look at him.

610
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,409
Look at that.

611
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:53,869
Hey.

612
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:56,789
- How dare you play with food! - Old man.

613
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:02,920
Stop it.

614
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,170
Stop it.

615
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
Look.

616
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,219
Look!

617
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:12,010
You don't get it, do you?

618
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:14,558
- Do you? - Won Bin.

619
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,718
Let go of me.

620
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:16,719
What?

621
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:24,269
I'm sorry.

622
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,570
I'm sorry.

623
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,900
Kim Won Bin.

624
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,249
Get him.

625
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,289
- Take this. - I'll get you.

626
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:40,058
- We're a mess. - I'm covered in it.

627
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:42,138
- Look at you. - You look worse.

628
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:44,650
You're so childish, Lieutenant Lee.

629
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:47,149
You look like you're having more fun than we are.

630
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,439
That was cruel.

631
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,819
He's right.

632
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,489
What did you do before you came here, Lieutenant?

633
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,909
I was part of a combat unit.

634
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,199
No, before that.

635
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:00,409
Did you go to university?

636
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,460
Do you have a girlfriend?

637
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,460
You little...

638
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,468
I don't take questions unrelated to training.

639
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:16,509
Do you hear me?

640
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,718
He has a girlfriend.

641
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,259
No, he doesn't.

642
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,309
- Hey. - What?

643
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,769
If we all go home...

644
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,779
and the war ends, what will you do? Will you go back to school?

645
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,949
I said I won't take questions unrelated to training.

646
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,869
It's related.

647
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,578
We have to know more about you...

648
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,460
for the platoon members to be more efficient.

649
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,039
Change the subject.

650
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,879
- Fine. - Come on.

651
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,049
- Tell us. - Please tell us.

652
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,089
Tell us.

653
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,010
- Tell us. - Tell us.

654
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:05,059
- Tell us. - Tell us.

655
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,348
- Tell us. - Tell us.

656
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,439
- Tell us. - Tell us.

657
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,150
- Tell us. - Stop it.

658
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:20,449
Listen.

659
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:28,670
I'm part of the ROTC, so I joined after graduating from university.

660
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:31,670
I have a year left to serve,

661
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,420
but I haven't decided whether I'll leave...

662
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,590
or extend my term. That's it.

663
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,638
Extend? Why would you do any more of this?

664
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:44,009
I know, isn't it tiring?

665
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,019
- Better to go out into the world. - You're right.

666
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:50,730
Being out in the world is tough too.

667
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,940
I'm still young and don't know much,

668
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,110
but it's a war out there too.

669
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,489
You could say getting into universities is a local war,

670
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,369
and being out in the world is a world war.

671
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,239
This is the happiest you'll be.

672
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,010
I have a question.

673
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,969
When will this war end?

674
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:27,059
Will...

675
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,400
we be able to go home?

676
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,940
They said we can go home if we get through this operation.

677
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,400
Can we...

678
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,449
believe that?

679
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:45,489
Don't think we don't know anything because we're kids.

680
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:49,328
Tell us the truth.

681
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:51,670
What if we get stabbed in the back after trusting it?

682
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,179
I don't know when the war will end.

683
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:12,019
But just remember this.

684
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:17,610
Survive to the end.

685
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,199
I can't end the war for you,

686
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:27,989
but I will help you fight to the end...

687
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:32,409
without anyone getting hurt.

688
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:37,039
I can promise you that.

689
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,110
Let's go.

690
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,489
Squad One, marksman Cho Jang Soo.

691
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,570
Assistant marksman Kook Young Soo.

692
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:09,619
Squad Two, marksman Kim Yu Jung.

693
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,619
Assistant marksman Wang Tae Man.

694
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,460
Me?

695
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,419
No.

696
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,039
Search team, Cho Young Sin, Kwon Il Ha.

697
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,340
Sniper Lee Na Ra, spotter Do Soo Chul.

698
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:28,218
When we arrive at our destination,

699
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:29,889
the raiding party will put the guard up.

700
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,598
The two people in the search party...

701
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,268
will take the lead and request troops.

702
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:34,349
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

703
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,449
This is a sphere detector.

704
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,658
- A sphere detector. - What is that?

705
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:48,949
Does it detect spheres?

706
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:51,738
He just said it's a sphere detector.

707
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,368
Why do you think it's called that?

708
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:54,710
Is it a prototype?

709
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,210
What is that?

710
00:49:56,211 --> 00:49:58,669
Something that hasn't been fully developed yet.

711
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,499
You're right. It isn't perfect yet.

712
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,340
So don't rely on it too much.

713
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:05,760
What's its radius?

714
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,050
It's 1km in open areas.

715
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,928
In the city of villages,

716
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:12,469
it'll only be 500 to 700m.

717
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:13,639
So,

718
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,598
always be alert.

719
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:17,599
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

720
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,099
That's it.

721
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,440
Let's go. Come here.

722
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,448
- Look at that. - It's amazing.

723
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:28,820
- Turn it on. - Turn it on.

724
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,788
The people high up aren't just sitting back and watching.

725
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:38,868
You're right. Why didn't they give this to us earlier?

726
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,210
Look at that.

727
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
What's this?

728
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,380
Why isn't it detecting anything?

729
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,760
Seriously?

730
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,260
- Since there is no sphere. - Since there is no sphere.

731
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:56,178
- That idiot. - Seriously.

732
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:57,268
Three minutes until we leave.

733
00:50:57,269 --> 00:51:00,558
Divide into your squads and get in the vehicles.

734
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,018
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

735
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:04,440
- Duk Joong. - What is it?

736
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:05,820
Hurry up.

737
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,690
Darn it.

738
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:53,989
Lieutenant.

739
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,539
We'll need equipment to move this.

740
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:04,579
Let's search the area first.

741
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,769
Walk in a straight line.

742
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,940
How does this work?

743
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:26,110
I can tell you're a nerd.

744
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,480
We just marvel at how cool it is,

745
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,110
but don't care about how it works.

746
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,820
I'm not a nerd. It's my family's genes.

747
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:38,239
They're good genes.

748
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:43,420
- Bam. - What?

749
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,879
- Stop it. - Cut it out.

750
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,038
Go ahead.

751
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,380
You go ahead.

752
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,839
Do you have the safety on?

753
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
What?

754
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,510
Yes, I do.

755
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,849
Don't shoot me in the back.

756
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:04,440
You just have to turn this a little.

757
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:14,489
I'm scared.

758
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,030
I am too.

759
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:20,738
No Ae, keep up with us.

760
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,750
Okay.

761
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,869
- Yu Jung. - Yes?

762
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,500
Why do you keep checking behind you?

763
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,630
We have to watch our backs.

764
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,340
Just walk backward.

765
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,510
Is that better?

766
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:44,639
- Help. - I got you.

767
00:53:46,269 --> 00:53:47,349
Are you okay?

768
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:48,769
Yes.

769
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:50,769
I'm fine.

770
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,480
Thank you.

771
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,860
I didn't think you'd really walk backward.

772
00:53:57,739 --> 00:53:59,489
You're clumsier than I thought.

773
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,210
I feel queasy.

774
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,090
What is going on?

775
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,300
Let's see.

776
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,509
I know women.

777
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:22,349
You have it all wrong, Young Soo.

778
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,929
Then what should I do?

779
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:27,349
Do better.

780
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:29,400
Be manly and cool.

781
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,360
Be careful, Na Ra.

782
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:36,570
Okay.

783
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:41,159
Be careful, Ha Na.

784
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:43,239
Get out of my way.

785
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:45,500
She wants me to get out of her way.

786
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:56,670
Are you anxious?

787
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,920
About what?

788
00:54:58,469 --> 00:54:59,719
Those two.

789
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,639
It's like a melodrama.

790
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:09,809
And this man that watches from afar.

791
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,480
Hey.

792
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,610
Let's go quietly.

793
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,239
I have enough on my mind.

794
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,988
Doesn't this feel like an operation?

795
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,829
We are on an operation.

796
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:28,079
Focus.

797
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,250
Whatever.

798
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,880
Quiet.

799
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,880
Show yourselves, spheres.

800
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,340
Come on.

801
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:41,929
Cut it out.

802
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,638
Wait, over there.

803
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,760
You scared me.

804
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:48,889
- Look. - Unbelievable.

805
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,480
Awesome.

806
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,690
Isn't it working?

807
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,940
Hee Rak.

808
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:56,730
What is it?

809
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,820
It's nothing, sir.

810
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,360
Lieutenant.

811
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:08,449
What is it?

812
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,658
Look what I got.

813
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,500
- Unbelievable. - Give me some.

814
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,169
- Ouch. - I want a sip.

815
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,749
I'm going to save it, so get away from me.

816
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,379
- Don't be cheap. Share with us. - Don't be cheap. Share with us.

817
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,259
You shouldn't shake cola, right?

818
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,259
But I can since this is mine.

819
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,929
- Why you... - Why you...

820
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,849
I love this.

821
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:31,349
- Forget it. - Forget it.

822
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,820
Lieutenant.

823
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,820
Il Ha.

824
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:51,329
What's its location?

825
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:57,500
It's 300m to the southwest.

826
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:06,029
That hurts.

827
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:08,369
Why did you come this way?

828
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:38,809
What was that?

829
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:13,050
Lieutenant.

830
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,348
Lieutenant.

831
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:16,388
- Get ready to fire. - Lieutenant.

832
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:18,138
- Are they coming? - Over there.

833
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:19,979
- They're coming. - What should we do?

834
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,480
- Shoot them. - Hurry.

835
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:24,479
- They're coming. - I don't think I can.

836
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,230
Hold your fire.

837
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,029
All right.

838
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,530
Open fire.

839
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:43,170
To the left.

840
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,880
- On 1, 2, 3. - On 1, 2, 3.

841
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,920
- No. - I can't.

842
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:57,099
- Shoot. - Got it.

843
00:59:57,889 --> 00:59:59,519
Where is it?

844
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,979
Stay in position and fire.

845
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,400
- Die. - Die.

846
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:11,780
I got one.

847
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:17,078
I got another one.

848
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:18,539
Can't you do any better?

849
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,000
I'll reload and try again.

850
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,538
That's hot.

851
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,960
Why would you touch the barrel, you idiot?

852
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,550
Kook Young Soo, Lee Soon Yi.

853
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,718
- Pull yourselves together. - Okay.

854
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:36,719
Start firing.

855
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,940
- What are you doing? - I don't know.

856
01:00:44,059 --> 01:00:45,440
Place it on your soldier.

857
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,940
I have horrible aim.

858
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,109
No. Tae Man!

859
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,779
Help me.

860
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,409
Hurry.

861
01:00:55,409 --> 01:00:57,328
I can't get any of them.

862
01:00:57,329 --> 01:00:59,238
- Jang Soo. - Yes?

863
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,829
Help us, Jang Soo.

864
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:02,960
Maintain your positions.

865
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,089
- Where did it go? - Where are they?

866
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:08,210
Over there.

867
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,880
Darn it.

868
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,669
I'm out of ammo.

869
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,340
Hand me some now.

870
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,260
- What are you waiting for? - Are you serious?

871
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:26,809
What?

872
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,400
What is it?

873
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,820
Why aren't they coming out?

874
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:37,869
I don't know.

875
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:40,489
Cover me.

876
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,659
I don't see them.

877
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,079
What's going on?

878
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,710
Are they going after something?

879
01:01:56,969 --> 01:01:58,599
I think they're hiding.

880
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,559
- Where are you going? - We have to find and kill them.

881
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:08,190
You can't do it alone.

882
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:09,809
- Let go of me. - What's this?

883
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:11,939
It's still here.

884
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:12,940
What?

885
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,069
Where is it?

886
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:18,239
Behind you!

887
01:02:18,489 --> 01:02:20,449
It's coming.

888
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,670
- Where did it come from? - Where did it come from?

889
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,380
- Get it. - Kill it.

890
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:45,559
Are you okay?

891
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,448
What are you doing?

892
01:02:57,449 --> 01:02:59,280
Take your positions and search your surroundings.

893
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:02,829
- Back to your positions. - Yes, sir.

894
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:04,039
Yes, sir.

895
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:07,159
Young Sin.

896
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:11,880
Cho Young Sin!

897
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,460
Locate the sphere.

898
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:21,760
Darn it.

899
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:23,849
What should we do now?

900
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,849
We'll find every one of them...

901
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:30,599
and eliminate them all.

902
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,190
Yes, sir.

903
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,119
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

904
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:47,789
Ladies first.

905
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,329
You go first.

906
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:04,510
Hey, that way.

907
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,969
Wait. Darn it.

908
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:29,409
Darn it.

909
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,960
No.

910
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,090
What happened?

911
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,509
We got one.

912
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,010
We just lost one.

913
01:04:47,059 --> 01:04:48,349
Seriously?

914
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,150
Up there.

915
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,119
That scared me.

916
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:18,289
Na Ra.

917
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,170
Let's go.

918
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,760
Come on.

919
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,840
I shouldn't have saved him.

920
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:55,039
No.

921
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:15,099
Darn it.

922
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,558
Go to the left.

923
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:19,650
Come with me, Chi Yeol.

924
01:06:28,949 --> 01:06:30,119
I don't believe it.

925
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:33,198
Na Ra.

926
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:35,119
Stop whining.

927
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,079
Stop with the whining.

928
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,510
Hey.

929
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:49,009
It's too dark. Maybe we shouldn't go in.

930
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:51,799
One was detected.

931
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,929
We have to get it.

932
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:55,269
Take your lantern out.

933
01:06:55,769 --> 01:06:56,769
Okay.

934
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,280
Why am I in the lead?

935
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,109
- Stop that. - I'm sorry.

936
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,779
- Seriously. - I'm sorry.

937
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,909
Get it out of my face.

938
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:21,710
I don't think it's in here.

939
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,500
Careful.

940
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:33,679
Okay.

941
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:50,909
- There it is. - Get it.

942
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,989
I can't see it.

943
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,390
It's getting away.

944
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,109
Hey.

945
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,779
Duk Joong.

946
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,279
- Are you okay? - Yes.

947
01:09:14,909 --> 01:09:17,118
- I'm alive. - Yes.

948
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,119
You're okay.

949
01:09:18,869 --> 01:09:20,749
- You scared me. - Are you okay?

950
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,289
I think he's okay.

951
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,130
- That scared me. - I know.

952
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:29,750
Quiet.

953
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:45,159
