1
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,796
There's no way

2
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,758
you'll come back,

3
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,385
but I still wait

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,014
alone in the field of reeds.

5
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,819
Was it all

6
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,198
my fault?

7
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,212
Come on, we're late.

8
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
Hurry. Come on.

9
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,340
Okay.

10
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,097
My gosh, I'm sorry.

11
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,142
-See you.
-Sure.

12
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,520
Aren't we late?

13
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,813
What time is it?

14
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,612
Thank goodness.
The professor isn't here yet.

15
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,031
He's cool.
He's giving us time to catch our breath.

16
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,550
JEJU SAEOREUM MARATHON

17
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,515
PEOPLE YOU WILL LOVE
123,107

18
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,651
Yes. I knew it.

19
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,653
What?

20
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,238
All the guys here

21
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,490
are on the list of people I'll like.

22
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,286
Really? Every single one?

23
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,080
Yes. What about you? Check yours too.

24
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,341
Hello, professor.

25
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,146
I guess there are a lot of girls in
this classroom who like this tardy boy.

26
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,901
The weather is nice,
and cherry blossoms have bloomed.

27
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,028
Was it you?

28
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,029
He's cute.

29
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,073
I couldn't help it.

30
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,367
Seriously.

31
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,577
We should start class.

32
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,375
Let's all stop resenting me
and start class, shall we?

33
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,961
JOJO, I'M ON CAMPUS
I'LL WAIT AT THE AMPHITHEATER

34
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,052
That was close!

35
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,595
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

36
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,706
Now,

37
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,419
you don't have to ask
where your partner is if you are dating.

38
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,924
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

39
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,761
Hi sweetie. You're here.

40
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,932
-Let's go.
-Okay.

41
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,858
It has to ring if you like someone
in the world we live in now.

42
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,180
What about work?

43
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,223
I finished early

44
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,100
because I missed you.

45
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,686
It's nice to have cafeteria food again,
isn't it?

46
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,063
I'll get you a new one.

47
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:39,982
Wait here.

48
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,380
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

49
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,318
What the heck? Seriously.

50
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,071
Oh, come on.

51
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,992
I guess they're dating.

52
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,289
I'm so jealous.

53
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,389
Stop it.

54
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,914
It's finally ringing.

55
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,832
Thanks.

56
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,754
I promised that I'd make your Love Alarm
ring ten times a day.

57
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,092
Why are you in such a good mood today?

58
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,928
Did something good happen?

59
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,359
See that? See the name of the person
who will love me?

60
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,031
Is that why you're so happy?

61
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,242
Of course. It says you'll love me.

62
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,037
The data accumulated
in Love Alarm 2.0 is pretty accurate.

63
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,206
I'm not saying that because I work there.

64
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,211
Still, you'll be a lot happier
if I made your Love Alarm ring.

65
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,553
I like building things up slowly
like this.

66
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,832
This won't do.

67
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,835
Maybe looking sad will be better.
Okay. Sadder.

68
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,379
Think about your first love or something.

69
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,967
Yes. Nice.

70
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,137
You love her like crazy. Like crazy.

71
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,975
But suddenly,
she stops ringing your Love Alarm.

72
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:07,356
Yes, you look sorrowful.
A little more. More.

73
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,526
Why not?

74
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,864
What? Why not what?

75
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,199
Why doesn't it ring anymore?

76
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,702
When we like each other so much?

77
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm asking you to act
as if that's happened.

78
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,209
It wasn't mine.

79
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,171
Me?

80
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,089
It wasn't me.

81
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,804
Let's go.

82
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,890
Where? You're not done yet.

83
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,433
I don't want to do it.

84
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,268
-Hey, Sun-oh.
-Sun-oh.

85
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,353
Sun-oh!

86
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,104
That rude punk!

87
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,273
I'm sorry.

88
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,956
Want me to help you unpack?

89
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,376
No, it's okay.

90
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,173
I'll be done soon, so wait here.

91
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,562
You still have these?

92
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,026
I can't throw them out.
They're all memories.

93
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,616
This was from the '70s.

94
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,076
Do you see the serial number?

95
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,871
The very first cassette player
was sold in 1974 in Korea,

96
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,706
but this is even older than that.

97
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,086
But I couldn't find the missing part here,
so it still won't work.

98
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,340
Still, the most important component,
the magnetic tape head, is clean,

99
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,883
so once I find the missing partâ€¦

100
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,765
I'm boring you, aren't I?

101
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,353
What? Am I lame?

102
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,688
No.

103
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,740
I got that for the viewfinder
and the lens.

104
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,619
Everything's set up correctly,
and it has the original lens cap too.

105
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,914
The very first photo I took
is in there too.

106
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,209
I planted a bean after reading
Jack and the Beanstalk.

107
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,961
And it really sprouted.

108
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,464
I thought it was cool,
so I took a picture.

109
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,675
This is a bean sprout?

110
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,054
It's because the light seal was too old.

111
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,724
I could've stopped the light leaking
if I had replaced it,

112
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,058
but I didn't know then.

113
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,898
-Sun-oh.
-Yes?

114
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,983
Did you get a gift?

115
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,276
What gift?

116
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,028
Isn't today your mother's birthday?

117
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,532
Hello.

118
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,375
This is nice.

119
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,543
We'll take this.

120
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,753
I'll wrap it up for you.

121
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,799
You can never receive too many flowers.

122
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,219
Flowers never fail.

123
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,999
I could've gotten it for you.

124
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,084
You don't eat sweets.

125
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,835
I do.

126
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,799
I thought you hated sweets.

127
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,430
You said flowers never fail.

128
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,565
I guess this is good enough.

129
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,694
What is?

130
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,695
I like it

131
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,738
because you're trying.

132
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,576
When did you buy these flowers?

133
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,494
I just thought they were pretty.

134
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,412
Want some?

135
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,064
There's still film in this.

136
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,774
What?

137
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,944
What did you just shoot?
Let me see. Show me.

138
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,196
This is a film camera,
so you can't see it now.

139
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,657
What if I look funny?

140
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,328
Will you get this developed?
You have to show me first.

141
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,038
Sure. Let's finish the roll

142
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,748
-so I can get it developed.
-Okay.

143
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,292
-What should I do? Just sit here?
-Hold on.

144
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,294
Okay. One, two, three.

145
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,505
-Ms. Kim Jojo.
-Yes?

146
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,423
Act natural.

147
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,717
-Forget that the camera's here.
-Okay.

148
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,721
Do I look okay?

149
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,640
What are you doing?

150
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,641
Hold on.

151
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,101
-Say, "Yay, I finished."
-Yay, I finished.

152
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,730
Work hard and concentrate. Focus, okay?

153
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,648
All right.

154
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,901
Try to look cooler.

155
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,362
Cooler? I'll look cooler holding a camera.

156
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,368
I can't do it.

157
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,662
Is it good?

158
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,790
Yes, it's good. Here we go.

159
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,750
Hurry.

160
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,822
How nice.

161
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,242
Aren't cherry blossoms pretty?

162
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,122
Yes, very pretty.

163
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,270
Are you hurt?

164
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,980
No.

165
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,204
Let's go. I'll drop you off.

166
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,790
Where?

167
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,751
Time flew since you were with me, right?

168
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,252
Your part-time job.

169
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,338
Oh, right.

170
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,307
-Hey.
-Look that way.

171
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,018
-Take a look at this.
-Turn a little more.

172
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,686
Look closely.

173
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,524
These are all the men who will like me.

174
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,027
Even if I break up with my husband,
I have so many options.

175
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,405
If my husband annoys me,
I don't have to put up with it anymore.

176
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,574
-Okay. Good for you.
-Hey, show me too.

177
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,119
You know, Love Alarm 2.0.

178
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,245
More and more people have been

179
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,788
-signing up for Love Alarm 2.0
-It's Love Alarm 2.0.

180
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,915
and one person has been
at the center of it all.

181
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,584
That person is Brian Chon,
the CTO of Love Alarm.

182
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,670
He showed himself to the public
and demonstrated

183
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,922
-This is insane.
-the new functions of Love Alarm 2.0.

184
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,465
-Totally insane.
-Many people are showing interest

185
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,801
-in Brian Chon since he is
-He's so good-looking.

186
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,969
-both handsome and talented
-Insane is right.

187
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,804
-and the viewer count has been
-You're totally insane.

188
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,013
-skyrocketing.
-What's the time?

189
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,057
-Until now, Brian Chon's identity wasâ€¦
-Mom, I have to go.

190
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,809
I need to be at work. Bye!

191
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,768
What work?

192
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,061
Did you get a job?

193
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,105
All these men.
They're all going to like me.

194
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,696
It's Brian Chon!

195
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
This way please.

196
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,902
Hold on. Wait! Just a second!

197
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,279
Wait. Just a second!

198
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,579
Did you see that? You saw that, right?

199
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,748
He was shocked when he saw me

200
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,750
because I'm so pretty.

201
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,253
He was shocked when he saw me
because I'm so pretty.

202
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,008
We'd be able to go in
if we were members of the Badge Club.

203
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,510
The artist behind The Ringing World
went in too.

204
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,888
-Exactly.
-I want to go in so badly.

205
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,431
He's so hot.

206
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,602
The Ringing World, again?

207
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,927
Center camera, ten minutes ago.

208
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,347
Do you have to serve seaweed
when the election is coming up soon?

209
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,768
Make sure to attend the donation event.

210
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,729
Get some nice photos taken.

211
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,524
If you cause trouble again--

212
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,942
I'm sure he'll behave.

213
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,862
I thought he'd behave on the school trip,

214
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,406
but he got into a motorcycle accident
with some chick.

215
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,409
Do you know how difficult it was
to cover that upâ€¦

216
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,371
Keep the kid in check.

217
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,679
You look stunning today.

218
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,514
It reminds me
of when you were in First Love.

219
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,933
-You haven't--
-I played a supporting role for that.

220
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,561
I'm sorry.

221
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,108
Did you like the flowers?

222
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,194
Sun-oh picked them himself.

223
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,403
What for?

224
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,697
They'll wither soon anyway.

225
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,702
Get up. Let's go.

226
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,829
Sun-oh.

227
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,852
Go inside.
I'll message you when I get home.

228
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,659
Is she still not growing on you
after all this time?

229
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,001
You quit smoking, right?

230
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,257
Your dad still doesn't know that I smoke.

231
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,762
After I smoke, I wash my hands,
brush my teeth,

232
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,514
change, put on perfume--

233
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,890
Don't put on perfume.

234
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,102
It makes you stink even more.

235
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,732
What is she up to these days?

236
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,904
The girl you liked in high school.

237
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:14,494
When you liked her, you set her photo
as your phone wallpaper and bragged to me.

238
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,000
But now, it's the stock wallpaper.

239
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,672
Why are you looking at my phone?

240
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,467
Should I steal her for you?

241
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,761
Kim Jojo.

242
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,889
Right?

243
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,391
Do you want to be a mom all of a sudden?

244
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,644
You should have done that
when I was young.

245
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,147
What does she like?

246
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,777
Does she like money?

247
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,906
You think everyone's like you, don't you?

248
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,326
Then what does she like?

249
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,079
If she doesn't like money

250
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,373
what could she like?

251
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,876
Hye-yeong.

252
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,924
She likes Hye-yeong.

253
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,031
She's completely clueless.

254
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,509
What?

255
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,719
What else?

256
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,596
I'm just trying to help.

257
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,934
Hey, soâ€¦

258
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,852
You haven't been posting that recently.

259
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,812
What?

260
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,065
That. The Ringing World.

261
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,193
I guess you don't need it anymore.

262
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,830
Hey.

263
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,623
If you don't want to do it, should I?

264
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,126
Hear me out.

265
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,129
I really need it for something.

266
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,464
Can't I say I'm the artist
behind TRW just once?

267
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,426
It's not like
it's going to do you any harm.

268
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,844
Stop being ridiculous.

269
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,680
You use my room as if it's yours too.

270
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,848
So why can't I?

271
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,850
I'll use it just once. Just once.

272
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,602
No. You don't even know what that is.

273
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,732
I do know. It's obvious.

274
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,694
You're selling your past
to get pity points

275
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,696
like you did with Sun-oh back in the day.

276
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,115
If you get even more famous,

277
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,701
people will find out about your past.

278
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,828
I guess that doesn't scare you anymore.

279
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,955
Hey. How could you say that?

280
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,417
I could have been as famous as you were
if my parents died like that.

281
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,545
Are you even jealous of my misery now?

282
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,882
You brat! Get over here.

283
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,885
My ear! It hurts!

284
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,180
I'm sorry I'm still alive.

285
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,848
How could you say such a thing?

286
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:26,144
-Mom, that's not what I meant.
-Where did you spend my million won?

287
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,897
You took Jojo's money not too long ago,
and now this?

288
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,523
I was going to tell you!

289
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,361
I've been getting too many returns lately,
so it was an emergency.

290
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,445
You brat.

291
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,738
What exactly do you do?

292
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,742
You say you want to sell clothes,
but all you do is spend money!

293
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,203
Aunt, please calm down.

294
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,330
Who are you to tell her to calm down?

295
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,999
She's acting all high and mighty again.
I can't stand her.

296
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,000
Shut up and get out!

297
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,377
Why should I?

298
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,337
She started it!

299
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,839
Why take it out on me
when you don't know anything?

300
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,341
Then both of you can get out!

301
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,731
LOVE MI, HOT ITEMS THIS SUMMER

302
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,900
START LIVE STREAM

303
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,076
I can't stand her.

304
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,371
Just wait. I'll become successful
and leave this hell hole.

305
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,959
Ta-da!

306
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,087
Do you see this beauty that I'm wearing?

307
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,881
It's this year's trendy color, purple.

308
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,801
-But it isn't just purple.
-This store is closing.

309
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,719
It has puffed sleeves as well.

310
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,848
So it's called
"Purple Puffed Sleeve Dress."

311
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,058
This one's been hand-picked by Gul-mi.

312
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,812
-When will I get my refund?
-I'm waiting for my refund too!

313
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,607
When did they all leave?

314
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,484
Those jerks.

315
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,245
Guys.

316
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,373
Want to hear something interesting?

317
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,333
What is it this time?

318
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,794
I'll bring more people if it's fun.

319
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,006
I know the artist
behind The Ringing World.

320
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,758
-Who is it?
-Tell us.

321
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,342
I'll make you pay if you don't.

322
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,973
If I get 20 orders for the new dress,
I'll tell you where the artist is.

323
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,625
HYE-YEONG

324
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,710
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
AT THE SCHOOL ENTRANCE

325
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,308
Hye-yeong, what are you up to?

326
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,941
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

327
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,159
Welcome.

328
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,596
-This item is on two for one special.
-That'll be 1,000 won.

329
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,765
Thank you.

330
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,561
Excuse me. You forgot this.

331
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,064
You can have it.

332
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:00,984
It's okay. Iâ€¦

333
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,976
Sorry,

334
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,312
I wanted to ask you something earlier.

335
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,816
Why don't you upload them anymore?

336
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,568
Sorry?

337
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,320
The Ringing World.

338
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,906
I've been waiting for updates.

339
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,829
It's hard, isn't it?

340
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,582
I understand.

341
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,085
I don't know what you mean.

342
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,464
Tell me.

343
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,799
I can help--

344
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,725
Hye-yeong.

345
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,774
Can't I say I'm the artist
behind TRW just once?

346
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,777
It's not like
it's going to do you any harm.

347
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,405
If you get even more famous,

348
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,699
people will find out about your past.

349
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,452
I guess that doesn't scare you anymore.

350
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,506
Gul-mi.

351
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,176
Don't you have something to tell me?

352
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,094
Tell you what?

353
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,387
Do you want me to yell at you some more?

354
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,018
I'm the one who's bitter
and pissed off right now.

355
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,187
I have to sleep in the basement
because of you.

356
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,940
Not that. Are you sure
there isn't anything else?

357
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,108
Jeez.

358
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,904
What is she babbling about?
What? Just say it.

359
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,115
What are you blaming me for this time?

360
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,409
The man who followed me just now.
Did you have nothing to do with that?

361
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,869
Are you freaking mad?

362
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,082
Who followed you?
You're not a Badge Club member.

363
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,711
I can't hear. Raise the volume.

364
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,840
You said you knew the artist behind TRW.
Where does she live?

365
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,425
-She doesn't know anything.
-She's a pathological liar.

366
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,512
END LIVE STREAM

367
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,599
Why would I tell you?
You didn't buy any of my clothes.

368
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,642
You jerks.

369
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,875
I'm sorry.

370
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,294
Have you calmed down?

371
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,671
Yes.

372
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,260
It's fine. I'm just glad you're okay.

373
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,263
You must have been startled.

374
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,599
You were startled more.

375
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,789
Your ankles must be cold.

376
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,091
I won't be able to sleep
if I let you go like this.

377
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,886
He may be waiting in front of your place.

378
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,476
Stay at my place tonight.

379
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,800
You're going tomorrow
to make your donation, right?

380
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,844
But my shoot has been delayed by an hour.

381
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,472
Does this mean I can't see you tomorrow?

382
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,918
Sun-oh, are you all right?

383
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,423
I'll be on your side.

384
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:27,096
I'm happy to have Hye-yeong in my life.

385
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,492
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

386
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,552
Did I wake you?

387
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,929
Was I too loud?

388
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,807
No. I thought you were gone.

389
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,852
What are you doing? Just do it tomorrow.

390
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,355
I'll be done soon.
There's too much light coming in.

391
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,030
So this is how it feels

392
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,159
to see an empty heart
when you're together.

393
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,599
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

394
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,435
NO ONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

395
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,608
Are you okay now?

396
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,151
Yes.

397
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,237
Good night.

398
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,745
Good night.

399
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,939
I wonder.

400
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,734
If I didn't have the shield,

401
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,072
would I have rung
Hye-yeong's Love Alarm just now?

402
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,276
All that I can do now

403
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,404
is get rid of the shield, andâ€¦

404
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,000
Can I try?

405
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,418
Sure.

406
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,016
You can't go to work like this, can you?

407
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,601
No.

408
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,896
Watch. Loop this around once like this.

409
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,609
-If you do thisâ€¦
-And be honestâ€¦

410
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,193
About the width of two fingers.

411
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,111
See that?

412
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,241
Have a nice day at work.
I'll work hard today too.

413
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:40,826
On what?

414
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,620
Anything.

415
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,500
And be honest in front of
good people like him.

416
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,760
Nice.

417
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,778
Very good.

418
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,238
I'll go see how they look.

419
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,129
-They're going out.
-They look good together.

420
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,048
I didn't think I'd get to see you today.

421
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,304
I have to go soon, so focus on the shoot.
Stop texting.

422
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,896
How can you work with Sun-oh waiting?

423
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,732
I'm shaking myself.

424
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,530
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

425
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,659
She likes him.

426
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,537
Yuk-jo, it's not like that.
It must be broken.

427
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,915
I know you didn't do it on purpose.
What can you do? You have eyes.

428
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,083
Let's go again.

429
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,212
Okay. Give me
a little more attitude this time.

430
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,718
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

431
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,470
Thank you.

432
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,013
Let's go.

433
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,810
I'm jealous. How could someone like him
exist in real life?

434
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,771
He didn't look at her once
during the shoot.

435
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,023
They still ring each other's Love Alarm.

436
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:40,404
How do you think it feels to have
Hwang Sun-oh ring your Love Alarm?

437
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,866
Well, it probably feels like that.

438
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,992
Let's go.

439
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,097
Hello?

440
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,141
The police?

441
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,522
You caught him?

442
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,152
Really?

443
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,905
Okay.

444
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,951
Yes!

445
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,703
Yes!

446
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:35,250
There is always hope.

447
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,921
You jerks. You're dead meat now.

448
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,187
Please quiet down!

449
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,105
Listen to me.

450
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,900
If you're too loud,
it'll hinder the investigation.

451
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,860
Okay. Yes, I know you were wronged,

452
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,987
-but please listen to me.
-Step back, please.

453
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,074
Please write down your information
and what loss you suffered.

454
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:11,328
Since October 5th, you've been claiming
that you're the developer

455
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,122
and sold fake items to members.
Am I correct?

456
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,417
We'll know once we see the records.

457
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,380
Hey, mister.

458
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:32,432
I don't need my money back.
Can you do it for me?

459
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,189
I want my heart alarm number faked.

460
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,193
Can you fake it for me just once?

461
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,486
Please?

462
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,613
Young lady. Please step away.

463
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,324
Are you kidding me?

464
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,674
You said you were a developer.
You said you could do it.

465
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,884
Do it for me just once. Just once.

466
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:49,217
Please. I have no more money
to get scammed out of.

467
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,345
This is really my last chance.

468
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:58,185
You said you created the Love Alarm
to tell a girl you liked how you felt.

469
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:02,064
Then did you and that girl
ring each other's alarm?

470
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,024
Back thenâ€¦

471
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,324
I was rejected.

472
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,408
Sorry?

473
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,079
That's impossible to imagine
given your popularity now.

474
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:22,501
Then I guess you look rather different now
than you did in school.

475
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,836
When I was in schoolâ€¦

476
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,899
I don't think I looked all that different.

477
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,237
I have an inquiry to make.
I would like to meet you in person.

478
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,780
Does he even read them?

479
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,323
-He won't respond.
-Do you even read these?

480
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,951
I'm the artist of The Ringing World.
I've called you before.

481
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,452
Did you call?

482
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,080
Did you tell him
you're the artist behind TRW?

483
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,916
Yes, but it's useless.

484
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,878
I don't think they give him my messages
anymore because I call too often.

485
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,172
When we saw him at the showcase,

486
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,552
we should have just asked him
if he was Duk-gu.

487
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,722
But Hye-yeong came.

488
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:22,352
No. Come to think of it,
even if Hye-yeong hadn't shown up,

489
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,187
I doubt he would have met with me.

490
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,315
From what I've seen on TV,
I don't think it's Duk-gu.

491
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,358
He looks different.

492
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,902
-His face?
-Yes.

493
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,197
Are you sure Duk-gu was the developer?

494
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,533
How do you know that?

495
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:38,994
Jojo.

496
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:43,749
If you had a choice between a sword
and a shield, which would you choose?

497
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,421
I'm not sure.

498
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,132
I wouldâ€¦

499
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,093
The shield?

500
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,220
Sure.

501
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,306
I knew you would say that.

502
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,683
Darn it.

503
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,934
You have so many secrets.

504
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,646
You're very alluring.

505
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,108
So? What will you do now?

506
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,363
I want to go to the school
and get Duk-gu's address.

507
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,368
You said you met your boyfriend
in high school, right?

508
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,579
Was it love at first sight?

509
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,083
That's the best kind of love
you can be in.

510
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:09,376
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.
