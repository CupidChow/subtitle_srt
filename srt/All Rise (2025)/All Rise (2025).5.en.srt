28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,181
Okay.

29
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:59,141
You're all so noble and righteous.

30
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:00,941
I'm the villain here.

31
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,221
I know you're not poor.

32
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,540
But I am.

33
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,021
I blame no one.

34
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:11,660
Maybe this is just my problem.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,460
I'm just not cut out for Jun An.

36
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,261
Li Ke, don't worry.

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,981
Next week,

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,541
I'm applying to leave
the Talent Hunt Program

39
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:24,940
and go back to Hangzhou.

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,413
It's...

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,021
It's not that serious, Xiaoyu.

42
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,261
I'm exhausted.

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,701
I can't keep up.

44
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,541
Since you're leaving,

45
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,141
why not get a clear answer?

46
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,940
Isn't it better to know the truth?

47
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,500
You're a lawyer.

48
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,301
Quit all the whining and complaining.

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,861
Getting scared over little things.

50
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:53,141
Be bold and ask her.

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,581
Did she actually see it?

52
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:55,460
How did she do it?

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,060
Any explanation?

54
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,421
Are you free later?

55
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,421
Clear some time.

56
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:05,500
Xiaoyu wants to talk at the noodle shop.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,660
I asked Ren Jiatong to go

58
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,141
to the noodle shop later.

59
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,940
It's fine. Take time to think.

60
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,180
You don't have to go.

61
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,581
But if you want the truth,

62
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:17,021
go to the noodle shop.

63
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:21,821
(Noodles)

64
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,060
Jiang Chen filled me in.

65
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,421
First, I didn't.

66
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Honestly, I don't have to

67
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,740
explain something I didn't do.

68
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,421
But Jiang Chen told me

69
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,381
you're upset and want
to return to Hangzhou.

70
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,940
So I felt I should tell you.

71
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,460
If you're leaving because you lost,

72
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:39,740
then just go back.

73
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:41,861
But if it's because you
think I copied you,

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,581
I suggest you stay.

75
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,981
Gather evidence to defend yourself.

76
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,220
Am I being petty?

77
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,180
These noodles are amazing.

78
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,460
Want to eat first
before self-reflection?

79
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,701
No appetite.

80
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:05,660
Try some, then decide.

81
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,500
Your noodles.

82
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:10,460
Come on, taste it.

83
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:12,301
Thank you.

84
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,541
Enjoy your meal.

85
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,501
This shop fuels me up.

86
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,741
Whenever I'm stressed or upset,

87
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,061
I come for a bowl.

88
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,821
It's really that magical.

89
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,980
You'll feel better.

90
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,261
Try it.

91
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,261
It's really good.

92
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,540
I wrongly accused you earlier.

93
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,100
This is on me.

94
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,061
When that Warm Nest video surfaced,

95
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,021
I was really scared.

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,181
But someone told me,

97
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,141
"If you want to be a lawyer,

98
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,780
learn to fight for your rights."

99
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,340
Guo Xiaoyu, this goes for you too.

100
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,141
Though I don't know your situation,

101
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,900
if you feel wronged,

102
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,540
demand fairness.

103
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:14,501
Stand up for yourself.

104
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:20,701
After what you told me,

105
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,660
I can probably guess.

106
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:24,420
It was Huang Yue.

107
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:28,141
She looked at my computer last night.

108
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,460
With her tech skills,

109
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,100
she'd memorize that URL instantly.

110
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,261
Our group's proposal

111
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,300
was actually Huang Yue's idea.

112
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:41,340
But I've got no solid evidence

113
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,900
that she copied it.

114
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:44,581
Is it possible

115
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,821
that she came up with this herself?

116
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,540
Actually, the idea's pretty common.

117
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,660
Anybody could've thought of it.

118
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,900
Am I being conceited

119
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,900
to think she copied me?

120
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,021
Drink?

121
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,021
You said your idea was so ordinary.

122
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,220
Anyone could think of it.

123
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,220
Well, I couldn't think of it.

124
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,141
Because in my knowledge framework,

125
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,340
there's no trace of that anime website.

126
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:28,300
This is your unique approach
to solving problems.

127
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:29,900
How could you lack confidence?

128
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:32,540
You're usually so aloof.

129
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,381
How come you talk
so much after drinking?

130
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:36,900
Ren Jiatong.

131
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,061
Are you drunk?

132
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,581
You're the drunk one.

133
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,220
I've only had one glass, okay?

134
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,701
I think I might be a little drunk.

135
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,701
I'm seeing double vision
when I look at you.

136
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:11,941
Goodness.

137
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,581
You're awake. Are you okay?

138
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,840
Morning.

139
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,780
Your alcohol tolerance is so low.

140
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,300
So hard to get you back here.

141
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:30,780
I didn't do anything embarrassing
last night, did I?

142
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,384
No.

143
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:35,261
You just cursed someone
named Zhu Zhisheng,

144
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:36,741
whined about Jun An's retention

145
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:37,900
and the territorial marking

146
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,141
brought up

147
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,821
by your picky roommate,

148
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,261
and mentioned seeing double vision.

149
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:45,300
I had to steady you.

150
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,141
Hold on, hold on.

151
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,061
Stop talking.

152
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,420
I was drunk, okay?

153
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,941
Don't take it to heart.

154
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:52,992
Hold on.

155
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,860
Double vision.

156
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,941
Great! Thank you.

157
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:03,980
I figured it out.

158
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,381
Figured what out?

159
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:06,181
Double vision.

160
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,621
It's hard to explain.

161
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,860
You'll know later.

162
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,501
I might be late.

163
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,141
Ask for leave on my behalf.

164
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,420
Thanks.

165
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:57,540
This manga character's name is Xiaoxiao,

166
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,341
but I searched online last night

167
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,580
and found the author

168
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,420
had never admitted or suggested

169
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,580
in any public forum

170
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:05,700
that this character

171
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,741
was based on the real-life celebrity,

172
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,501
Ms. Xiao.

173
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,341
That's just an assumption made
by netizens in the comments.

174
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,341
So you're saying

175
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:14,981
that the manga itself

176
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,461
isn't sufficient to prove

177
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
that the person in the ad is Ms. Xiao.

178
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:21,021
We need stronger evidence.

(Isabelle Aesthetic and Plastic
Surgery Hospital)

180
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,861
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

181
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,660
I have some new findings.

00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:36,780
(Aesthetic and Plastic Surgery Hospital)

183
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,501
This is a contour line drawing I made

184
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:39,981
by removing the accessories

185
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:41,621
from her photo shoot image.

186
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,248
Thanks.

187
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,700
The contours are identical.

188
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,780
This is what you meant
by "double vision"?

189
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,341
Yes. Looking just at the photo,

190
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,741
the outfit has
too many complex decorations,

191
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,261
making it impossible to see

192
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:09,981
the real torso clearly.

193
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,700
But my line drawing,

194
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,621
by stripping away all that complexity,

195
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,940
clearly shows

196
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,780
the manga character's pose and angle

197
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:19,341
actually come from this photo.

198
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:22,501
Nice work, Xiaoyu.

199
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,141
I didn't know you could draw.

200
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,180
Great thinking. Unconventional.

201
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,780
This young lady did very well.

202
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,820
Her name's Guo Xiaoyu. Gen Z.

203
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,900
The youngest candidate among them.

204
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,981
In our daily casework,

205
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,621
we constantly encounter fresh concepts.

206
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,008
That's a real challenge for us lawyers.

207
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:44,660
Today's law firms

208
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,021
need young talents like you all.

209
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
Times have changed.

210
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,981
We can't just bury ourselves
in laws and regulations.

211
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,741
Beyond the law,

212
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,101
it's best to have
varied interests and hobbies.

213
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:58,016
Look at

214
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,580
Guo Xiaoyu's drawing.

215
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,300
How good.

216
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:04,580
Xiaoyu, I'll ask for your guidance
on drawing sometime.

217
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,780
I'm flattered.

218
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,021
Thank you.

219
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,101
For this task, all members

220
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,900
of Guo Xiaoyu's team get a 20 bonus.

221
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,540
Thank you, Mr. Zhuang, Mr. Zhou.

222
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,741
Thank you. Thank you.

223
00:11:35,021 --> 00:11:35,712
Mr. Zhou.

224
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,940
Now, I have the lowest score.

225
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:40,180
Am I the one getting
eliminated this round?

226
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Ms. Bai, Mr. Song, and I discussed it.

227
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,621
Your first time.

228
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:47,621
It should serve as adaptive training

229
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:48,940
to help you quickly adjust

230
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,700
to the work rhythm and environment here.

231
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:51,940
So...

232
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,940
No one will be out?

233
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,300
That's right.

234
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,381
Eliminations officially
start next round.

235
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:01,536
Mr. Zhou.

236
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,261
Our previous scores?

237
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:07,861
The previous points

238
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,700
won't carry over.

239
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:10,820
Of course.

240
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,341
The past two weeks weren't a joke.

241
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,780
We reward your efforts.

242
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,341
In the next round,

243
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,141
Wang Lu, ranked last,
starts with minus ten points.

244
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:20,300
Huang Yue, second from the bottom,

245
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,820
starts with minus five.

246
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:22,741
In other words,

247
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,021
you must score significantly higher

248
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,221
to stand any chance of staying.

249
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,621
The top five will receive
rewards based on rank.

250
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:32,900
The top Jiang Chen

251
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,341
gains immunity from one elimination.

252
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:38,300
Second place,
Ren Jiatong and Guo Xiaoyu.

253
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,261
You get five bonus points
added to the next task's scores.

254
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,900
Third place, Yan Fei and Li Ke.

255
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,300
You start the next task with zero.

256
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,021
Get some proper rest tonight.

257
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,700
The real competition begins now.

258
00:12:59,381 --> 00:12:59,981
Go for it.

259
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:00,960
Go for it.

260
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:11,101
We all made it through the first round.

261
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:12,221
No one got eliminated.

262
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,420
So what's the plan?

263
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,540
Celebration dinner tonight?

264
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,580
New hot pot place nearby.

265
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,700
Every time I pass by,

266
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,780
there's always a queue.

267
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,141
It must be really good.

268
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:21,660
I'll sit this one out.

269
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:23,940
Huang Xiaoyue,

270
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:27,060
your team's proposal this round

271
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,381
was miles behind ours,

272
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,940
but you still need to eat.

273
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:32,981
Technically,

274
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:34,221
that proposal's copyright

275
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:35,180
belongs to Guo Xiaoyu.

276
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:37,221
But we're a team

277
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,420
with team spirit.

278
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,900
Credit doesn't matter, right?

279
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,861
Jokes aside.

280
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:43,501
We survived round one.

281
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:46,180
But the next round gets real.

282
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:47,580
People are getting cut.

283
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:49,261
So we should definitely

284
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,021
have dinner.

285
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,221
It's fate we all met.

286
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,580
Guo Xiaoyu should treat us.

287
00:13:58,861 --> 00:13:59,501
Me?

288
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,180
You were the first one Mr. Zhuang

289
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,341
personally praised.

290
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,461
I just paid my rent.

291
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,580
Stop putting her on the spot.

292
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,141
What's with the hero act?

293
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,648
Jiang Chen.

294
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:13,180
Are you two a thing?

295
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:14,900
Ren Jiatong, as her roommate,

296
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,780
do you know anything?

297
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,780
I have a boyfriend.

298
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,208
Alright.

299
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,180
Well then.

300
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,101
I'll reserve seats.

301
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,180
Let's count...

302
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:25,940
Seven.

303
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,221
I'll book a large table.

304
00:14:28,021 --> 00:14:28,741
Will Yan Fei come?

305
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,341
She left with her bag

306
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:32,141
at 6:03 PM.

307
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,180
Okay.

308
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,580
Text her to confirm.

309
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:35,501
I'm going.

310
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:44,420
Give it two days.

311
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,221
That cosmetic ad should be taken down.

312
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660
No more case talk outside the office.

313
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,621
Focus on

314
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,501
hot pot ingredients, ice jelly,

315
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:52,981
and tripe.

316
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,060
Yue mentioned recently

317
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,141
you were craving tripe.

318
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:58,021
See you.

319
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:59,381
Go ahead. I'm taking this.

320
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,621
I'll wait.

321
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,832
(Zhubao)

322
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,144
(Zhubao(6))

323
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:29,261
Zhubao.

324
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,381
I was in the elevator
and missed your call earlier.

325
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,381
Xiaoyu, I've already taken leave.

326
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,501
I've been exhausted these days.

327
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,820
I worked overtime.

328
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:39,820
The director worried I'd collapse

329
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,940
and approved my leave.

330
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:42,940
Oh, and I've booked the ticket.

331
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,021
I'll come to Beijing tomorrow.

332
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:45,981
Are you happy?

333
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,021
Why aren't you saying anything?

334
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,176
Xiaoyu?

335
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,384
Xiaoyu?

336
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:54,621
Sweetheart.

337
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,700
I might not return to Hangzhou.

338
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,180
Guo Xiaoyu!

339
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:03,461
Are you messing with me?

340
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,180
Why?

341
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,060
P-Please don't get mad, okay?

342
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,261
I'm not messing with you.

343
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:10,660
It's just that I feel like

344
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,820
I can push a little longer.

345
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,420
And I don't want to admit

346
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,021
defeat early and flee back home.

347
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,540
I'm not doing too badly after all.

348
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,180
Today,

349
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
the director praised me.

350
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,060
Do whatever you want.

351
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,180
Where did Guo Xiaoyu go

352
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,540
to answer that call?

353
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,300
Did the joke about making her pay

354
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,580
scare her off?

355
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,820
Yan Fei isn't here either.

356
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,700
Yan Fei? That's different.

357
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:03,300
She's not like us.

358
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,060
We aren't in the same league.

359
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,664
Enough.

360
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,261
No backbiting.

361
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:09,300
Just joking around.

362
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,540
Ren Jiatong,

363
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,261
you're great.

364
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:13,100
But you're too aloof.

365
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:15,620
When we toasted earlier,

366
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,701
you didn't drink with us.

367
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:18,060
You didn't raise it.

368
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:19,701
Here's to you.

369
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:21,580
You were the very first person

370
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,021
I met at Jun An.

371
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:24,820
For that reason, let's drink.

372
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,580
Just one glass, okay? Come on.

373
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,976
I'll take this.

374
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:35,540
What a nice guy.

375
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,461
You defended Guo Xiaoyu

376
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:37,181
and Ren Jiatong.

377
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,580
Two people in a day. Is it good?

378
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:39,860
That's my style.

379
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:40,741
- Fine.
- Cheers.

380
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:42,528
Cheers.

381
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,661
Are you sure?

382
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,184
Fine.

383
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,820
I'll drink half.

384
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,540
Are you okay?

385
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,780
There's gossip.

386
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:57,340
Mr. Song and Ms. Bai

387
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,060
used to be together before.

388
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,181
Senior lawyers mentioned it.

389
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,060
When Mr. Song and Ms. Bai were young,

390
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,181
they apparently dated.

391
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,100
But nobody knows the specifics.

392
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:09,060
It could just be rumors though.

393
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,580
Well, it is gossip.

394
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:13,620
Who needs that much rigor in gossip?

395
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:14,580
Don't be so serious.

396
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,000
Then...

397
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,021
Doesn't Ms. Bai have a child?

398
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,941
Could the child be Mr. Song's?

399
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,741
Probably not.

400
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
I heard from Duoduo

401
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,100
soon after Ms. Bai
and Mr. Song broke up,

402
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:26,540
she married someone.

403
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:28,340
Her husband wasn't in law anyway.

404
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,661
She divorced when the kid was three.

405
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
She's been single since.

406
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,941
And Mr. Song never married.

407
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,340
Their relationship
seems perfectly fine now.

408
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:38,941
Can't they make up?

409
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,860
Not allowed.

410
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:43,501
Jun An's policy

411
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,060
discourages workplace romances.

412
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:46,140
Partners or staff,

413
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,981
it's the same rule.

414
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,221
If two people

415
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:49,221
in one group date,

416
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,501
one will have to leave.

417
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,380
I just started shipping them,

418
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,380
only to find bitterness.

419
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,901
This firm rule

420
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:59,741
is so unreasonable, don't you think?

421
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:01,100
Just think about it.

422
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,340
We had to find a partner

423
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,860
during college.

424
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:06,580
Otherwise, with this workload,

425
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,701
who'd have time for dating?

426
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,140
We work extreme hours.

427
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,300
After joining Jun An,

428
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:11,741
I never get to bed before 1 AM.

429
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:13,140
Not only you.

430
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
My hairstyle is doomed.

431
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,620
I lose hair fast. I dread washing it.

432
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,741
Too bad? That joke?

433
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,701
Let's drink.

434
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,100
I need to use the restroom.

435
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,056
Wang Lu.

436
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:39,300
What games do you play?

437
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,941
(Not our place
to judge your relationship.)

438
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,741
But I do think
it's good to follow your heart.

439
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,701
And please stop crying now.

440
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,300
Or people will assume

441
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,380
I did something to you.

442
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:57,981
I just got snot on your clothes.

443
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,501
Want me to take it home and wash it?

444
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,741
Or I could buy you
a new one to replace it.

445
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:06,741
Honestly,

446
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:08,221
it's costly.

447
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,060
I'm sorry, Yan Fei.

448
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,380
Don't apologize to me. No need.

449
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:19,860
Then...

450
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,501
can we still be friends?

451
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:24,580
I've told you.

452
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,021
I didn't come here to make friends.

453
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,981
Let's go. Didn't they mention

454
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,820
a dinner gathering or something?

455
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,421
You're forgiving me?

456
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,780
Don't misunderstand.

457
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,421
This is just a colleague dinner.

458
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:46,901
No misunderstanding here.

459
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:49,221
Just colleagues. I get it.

460
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:05,461
How are you?

461
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,340
Okay?

462
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,421
You've asked me multiple times
if I'm okay today,

463
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,300
hoping I'm not?

464
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,021
No. I saw you constantly sipping

465
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,421
hot water and holding your stomach.

466
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:19,421
D-Did you eat something bad?

467
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,300
I have medicine.

468
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,221
My stomach's fine. It's actually...

469
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:27,140
To be honest,

470
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:28,021
my uterus

471
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,060
is periodically bleeding and shedding

472
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,620
its lining

473
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,661
along with the cyclical changes
of my ovaries.

474
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:33,701
Commonly known as...

475
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,340
menstruation.

476
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,380
You need to go home and rest?

477
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:48,501
Drink warm water.

478
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:53,501
Well,

479
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,741
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,741
Yesterday morning,

481
00:21:58,701 --> 00:21:59,661
I might be too harsh.

482
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:02,221
I've been wanting to apologize to you.

483
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,860
What? Line at the restroom?

484
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:25,380
Ren Jiatong.

485
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:27,140
Why is your face so red?

486
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,981
Feeling unwell?

487
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:29,501
I'm fine.

488
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,461
Just stuffy inside.

489
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:32,140
So suffocating.

490
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,380
Y-You can go check.

491
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,741
Why didn't you guys wait for us?

492
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,941
Now, there's only
one piece of tripe left.

493
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,100
I still remember our first day.

494
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
You were eating nonstop.

495
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,421
I thought, "This girl is so carefree."

496
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,100
That was just me being dumb.

497
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,221
Ignorance is bliss.

498
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,021
Why don't we share

499
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,981
who impressed us most

500
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:59,181
on our first day at the firm?

501
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,060
You'll say Ren Jiatong, right?

502
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:02,421
Actually, no.

503
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,021
Because the night before,

504
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:06,501
I'd already witnessed
her bold, flashy confidence.

505
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:09,620
For me, it was Wang Lu.

506
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:12,800
Me?

507
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,100
Back then, I really wanted to ask you

508
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,501
why you transferred
from Jun An's internship

509
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,701
to the Talent Hunt Program.

510
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:21,380
Honestly, I wanted speed.

511
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,901
To prove myself faster,

512
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,941
work on cases
with senior lawyers faster,

513
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,901
and secure a spot.

514
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,981
A regular intern

515
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:30,620
only stays three to six months

516
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,100
and then leaves,

517
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,941
never getting real case experience
with seniors.

518
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:36,941
At best, with someone like Mr. Zhou,

519
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:37,941
a mid-level associate.

520
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:40,100
The Talent Hunt Program changes it.

521
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,701
Just look at Ren Jiatong.

522
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,941
Working with Ms. Bai from the start.

523
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,580
Most interns wouldn't even dream of it.

524
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:50,140
Impressive.

525
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:53,661
But if it were me,

526
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:55,741
I'd never have your courage.

527
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,780
So if I can't stay,

528
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,300
I won't go back.

529
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,941
After all, my mentor lawyer

530
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,300
was really great to me.

531
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,221
Even now, I can't figure out

532
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:05,901
why, to this day,

533
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:08,100
I'm still ranked last.

534
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:09,860
It's fine. Come on.

535
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:21,580
Let me speak from the heart here.

536
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,540
Ren Jiatong, honestly,

537
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,780
I'm jealous of you.

538
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:27,701
But truthfully,

539
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
I genuinely admire you.

540
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:30,860
Come on, cheers.

541
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:32,860
I'll pour a drink.

542
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,261
I've got one poured already.

543
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:35,712
Thanks.

544
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:37,344
Cheers.

545
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,461
Oh, come on.

546
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,820
Admire her?

547
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
I've seen a Bentley picking you up.

548
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:44,580
That's your boyfriend?

549
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,421
Annoying.

550
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:49,261
Shut up.

551
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:58,461
No need for jealousy here.

552
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,941
We're all pretty awesome
in our own ways.

553
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,100
Huang Yue, cheers.

554
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:03,780
Cheers.

555
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:11,744
(Ren Jiatong:
Thanks for swapping my beer for tea.)

556
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,140
(Jiang Chen: Don't mention it.)

557
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,701
Guo Xiaoyu, you better slow down.

558
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:16,620
Drowning her sorrows.

559
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,860
Boyfriend trouble.

560
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,701
Sorrow? No way.

561
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,540
No matter what, I'm staying in Beijing

562
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:23,820
and Jun An.

563
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:26,181
He claims to like me all the time,

564
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,661
so why won't he come to Beijing for me?

565
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,860
Why should I chase after him?

566
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:32,981
Exactly.

567
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:34,300
I'm staying too.

568
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,380
Since childhood,

569
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,501
I've been demanded
perfection by my parents.

570
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,380
I never once got a "good".

571
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,100
Only "excellent".

572
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,421
How could I fail to stay?

573
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,040
Alright.

574
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:49,620
Now that the mood is right,

575
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,540
and the seven of us
are finally together,

576
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,860
let me speak.

577
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:56,181
Spare us the speech.

578
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,300
Do all student council presidents

579
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,100
get the same training manual?

580
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:03,501
Why that identical formal tone?

581
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,140
Sorry.

582
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:05,701
The emotions just took over.

583
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,421
I can't keep

584
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:08,060
this in any longer.

585
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:11,820
In just two weeks of bonding,

586
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:13,741
we've built real team spirit.

587
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:15,741
What is team spirit?

588
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:16,820
Enough, President Li.

589
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:20,580
Too many corporate dinners ruined you.

590
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,221
Skip the "past and future" talk.

591
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,461
Just drink.

592
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,421
Fine.

593
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:27,981
Sure.

594
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,340
Sincerely wishing

595
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,501
we all can finally

596
00:26:32,021 --> 00:26:32,780
stay.

597
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,140
Stay!

598
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:35,741
- Stay!
- Cheers!

599
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,901
Work already?

600
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,421
I'm so sleepy.

601
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,261
I can't take it.

602
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:55,820
Huang Xiaoyue,

603
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,580
your dark circles are pronounced.

604
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,741
Did something upset you?

605
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,501
You look awful.

606
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:03,580
Are you sick?

607
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:05,701
Maybe go home and rest for the day?

608
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,741
I just overdid the drinks last night.

609
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:10,140
Way too much drinking happened.

610
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,261
If Ren Jiatong hadn't woken me,

611
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:13,421
I'd have been late again.

612
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,021
Love you.

613
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:16,941
You saved my life.

614
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:21,421
Yan Fei.

615
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:23,540
Mr. Zhou.

616
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:26,780
Seems nobody rested well last night.

617
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,780
Everyone's dragging.

618
00:27:30,701 --> 00:27:31,380
It's okay.

619
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,300
I have an announcement

620
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,221
to cheer you up.

621
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,140
The second round
of the Talent Hunt Program begins now.

622
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,221
There's only one task for this round.

623
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,461
The deadline is today.

624
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,620
- Today?
- Today?

625
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,620
All materials

626
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,421
have been sent to your email.

627
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,461
Please review them.

628
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,340
Let me briefly outline

629
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,300
the case details.

630
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:53,941
Our clients

631
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:56,340
are Ms. Tan and her agency.

632
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:58,580
(Case Introduction)
Ha'erjian Foods

633
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,540
went to Ms. Tan

634
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,540
to invite her to endorse

635
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,100
their candies.

636
00:28:02,368 --> 00:28:03,820
(Case Introduction)
As requested,

637
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:05,780
they've submitted promotional materials

638
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,741
and product certifications

639
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,060
in the email.

640
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:10,380
Your assignment

641
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:11,501
is to prepare

642
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:14,380
a brief legal memorandum for Ms. Tan,

643
00:28:14,981 --> 00:28:16,540
assessing whether she can sign it

644
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,340
and outlining associated risks.

645
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,340
Am I clear?

646
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,820
One more thing.

647
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,780
This is individual scoring.

648
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,981
The top three performers will get

649
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:30,100
30, 20 and 10 points accordingly.

650
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,380
The lowest cumulative scorer
faces elimination.

651
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,540
What's the DDL?

652
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:36,860
Midnight tonight.

653
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:52,540
I'm so nervous that I might throw up.

654
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,421
Wang Lu, give me some of your goji

655
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:57,300
to replenish my blood.

656
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,624
Thanks.

657
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:06,461
The elimination notice
really dampened the mood.

658
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,580
Here's some good news
to lighten things up.

659
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:10,941
Young lady.

660
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:12,060
- You're here, sir?
- Hello.

661
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:12,941
- Hello.
- Sir.

662
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,860
Ren Jiatong and Jiang Chen

663
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,501
went to the community legal aid event.

664
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:18,421
They provided

665
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:20,261
legal consultation for this man,

666
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:21,701
and he was very satisfied.

667
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,300
Not only did he
retain Jun An for his case,

668
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:26,421
he also wrote this thank-you letter

669
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,620
and sent it today.

670
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,181
That young lady is so considerate.

671
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,661
Knowing my old age,

672
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,421
she made enlarged print copies

673
00:29:35,421 --> 00:29:36,780
of all documents,

674
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,941
so I could read without glasses.

675
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:39,616
Right?

676
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,620
It's nothing, sir.

677
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,860
Mr. Song

678
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
just commended you two

679
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:46,941
for your bold hypotheses

680
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:47,860
and careful checks.

681
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:49,261
Your opinions were well-written.

682
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,941
Ren Jiatong deserves the most credit.

683
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,780
We disagreed on core approaches,

684
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,021
so my contribution was limited.

685
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,580
But she put in tremendous work.

686
00:30:00,261 --> 00:30:00,780
No, no.

687
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:02,540
She specifically told me

688
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,140
you pulled an all-nighter,

689
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,501
cross-checking the film subtitles,

690
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:07,981
reviewing word by word.

691
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,140
Thank you.

692
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,901
Your prestigious law firm

693
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:15,461
helped an old man like me so much

694
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:16,960
without charging a penny.

695
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,981
It's our duty.

696
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:20,701
Pro bono legal services

697
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,780
are always free.

698
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:23,540
Don't worry.

699
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,461
The firm will reward their work.

700
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,261
Great.

701
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,221
I won't keep you

702
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:32,421
since you're all so busy.

703
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,060
Come visit me sometime.

704
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:37,021
I'll cook you noodles with fried sauce.

705
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:38,661
Thank you.

706
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:39,300
- Yes.
- Okay.

707
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,380
- Yes.
- I'll walk you out.

708
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,901
Okay. Goodbye.

709
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:42,752
Goodbye.

710
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:45,221
Mr. Zhou.

711
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:48,820
Will the reward include bonus points?

712
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:52,661
Focus on your report.

713
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,720
(Script Plagiarism Case +10)

714
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,864
(Script Plagiarism Case +10)

715
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,741
Hello?

716
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,021
Jiatong, did you see my WeChat message?

717
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,701
I need your help.

718
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,021
I can't talk now.

719
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,021
Call me tonight.

720
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:40,140
I got to go.

721
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:41,060
Don't hang up.

722
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,501
Really an emergency.

723
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:44,140
I'm right downstairs.

724
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:45,901
If you're busy,

725
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,901
I can come up.

726
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,140
Don't come up.

727
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,941
I'll come down now.

728
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,680
Mr. Zhou.

729
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:03,021
I have an urgent matter.

730
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,780
Could I take half an hour off to go out?

731
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:05,820
Leave?

732
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:07,820
Today's the elimination round.

733
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,181
I have to remind you.

734
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,661
The praise letter is good.

735
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,661
But that doesn't count
toward the evaluation.

736
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,380
Understood. I'll be back soon.

737
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,741
Fine, I'll approve your leave.

738
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,661
Plan your time well.

739
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,261
Ren Jiatong, are you okay?

740
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,221
Why do you
keep asking the same question?

741
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:34,181
You're hoping otherwise?

742
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:40,701
Stop worrying about me.

743
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,060
Go back to work now.

744
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,580
The assessment is coming.

745
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,860
Don't you care?

746
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:51,501
I do care. I care deeply.

747
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,741
That's why I won't lose.

748
00:33:03,603 --> 00:33:05,043
Help me one more time.

749
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:50,100
Want some water?

750
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,100
I'll get you some.

751
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:52,780
No, thanks.

752
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:19,861
You submitted yours?

753
00:34:20,341 --> 00:34:22,620
How come I'm surrounded
by all these amazing people?

754
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:25,180
Aren't you almost done too? Keep going.

755
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,381
Yue, your phone keeps ringing.

756
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:49,821
Is it an important call?

757
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,301
My work

758
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:52,941
is the most important right now.

759
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:03,381
You submitted yours?

760
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:06,740
Save me, Yue!

761
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:16,480
(My older guy)

762
00:35:38,421 --> 00:35:39,260
Finally finished.

763
00:35:40,821 --> 00:35:41,941
Yue, let's grab food later.

764
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,540
Okay.

765
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:45,341
How's your progress?

766
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,540
Let's eat together.

767
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:47,700
I'll pass.

768
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:53,941
(Memo)
You've only written so little?

769
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,981
What masterstroke are you brewing?

770
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,740
I got held up earlier.

771
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,421
But I'll make it.

772
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:04,540
Go ahead without me.

773
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,260
It's fine. We have
bonus points. Push on.

774
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:14,560
Let's go.

775
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:15,968
Go.

776
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,740
- Bye.
- Bye.

777
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:06,080
(Send: Memo on Endorsement
of Ha'erjian Candies)

778
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:25,740
Ren Jiatong, you are
pushing way too hard.

779
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,941
Morning.

780
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,981
Mr. Zhou, morning.

781
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:29,901
Morning.

782
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,260
Ren Jiatong.

783
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:34,981
The mentor lawyer told me

784
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:36,540
you submitted yours past the DDL.

785
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,180
Zero point.

786
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,861
Go ask about it.

787
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:53,620
Sorry about this.

788
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,180
What's wrong with you?

789
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,740
Why the rush?

790
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,901
I need Mr. Song.

791
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:00,821
He just went downstairs.

792
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,220
Thank you.

793
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,220
It's okay.

794
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,580
- Sorry.
- Nothing. Go.

795
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,140
Ms. Bai.

796
00:38:58,901 --> 00:38:59,660
Not coming in?

797
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:09,540
Ms. Bai.

798
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:15,540
I need to explain something.

799
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,461
That's what happened.

800
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,060
I didn't mean to miss the DDL.

801
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,781
Can you please help me?

802
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,781
At least review my report

803
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,501
before deciding whether to score me.

804
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,220
Stop insisting it wasn't intentional.

805
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,821
I don't want to hear why.

806
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:32,821
Just like no judge cares

807
00:39:32,821 --> 00:39:34,821
why a lawyer missed an appeal deadline.

808
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:36,861
And personally,

809
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,461
I see no reason

810
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,060
worth missing even one minute.

811
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:41,260
Forget one minute.

812
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,700
Not even one second.

813
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:44,341
For a lawyer,

814
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,021
keeping promises is the most essential

815
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,421
and fundamental virtue.

816
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:50,461
It determines if you're trustworthy.

817
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,740
Go wait for the results.

818
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,901
I heard Ms. Bai rejected
Ren Jiatong's appeal.

819
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,301
She might be in trouble this round.

820
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,901
She must be frantic.

821
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:12,021
But with her skills,

822
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:14,220
she shouldn't have worked
until midnight to submit.

823
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,781
Did she try to pull off
some grand move and mess it up?

824
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,861
Ren Jiatong isn't like that.

825
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,140
I know her.

826
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,341
She wrote slowly yesterday.

827
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:23,901
We already all submitted

828
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:25,140
when she just started hers.

829
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,301
I heard something delayed her.

830
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,180
What could delay her?

831
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,180
Ren Jiatong is so driven.

832
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,861
What could make her
miss a knockout round?

833
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:35,260
Oh, right.

834
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:36,421
I saw her leave earlier.

835
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,740
Did she get addicted to

836
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,381
pro bono work?

837
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:41,021
Helping another old man with paperwork?

838
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:44,740
Ren Jiatong understands priorities.

839
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:46,100
I don't think so.

840
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,180
Jiatong,

841
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:19,620
what really happened yesterday?

842
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,501
If it was an emergency,

843
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:24,140
maybe ask Mr. Song?

844
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,821
I don't think he'd...

845
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:26,944
It's fine.

846
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,861
Ren Jiatong,

847
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:30,220
something like this

848
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,580
wouldn't be a big deal at other firms.

849
00:41:33,301 --> 00:41:34,620
But at Jun An,

850
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,140
I doubt they'll let it slide easily.

851
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:39,941
How about

852
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,821
you leave?

853
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,501
You quit.

854
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,341
I'll ask around

855
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:49,941
to see which firm can place you

856
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:50,781
as an intern.

857
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,740
No matter what,

858
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:01,781
at least I'll have them

859
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:03,220
read my report first.

860
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:05,901
They can't just sentence me outright.

861
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,728
Jiatong,

862
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:12,540
I'm with you.

863
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:21,821
Mr. Song,

864
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,580
a document needs your signature.

865
00:42:23,981 --> 00:42:24,672
Okay.

866
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:36,861
Done.

867
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:37,501
Okay.

868
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:38,060
Mr. Song.

869
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:41,021
No need to say it.

870
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:43,740
I read your report.

871
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,301
It is well-written.

872
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,140
But don't forget you work in law.

873
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,461
You must follow rules

874
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,381
and honor your commitments.

875
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:52,540
We mentors can stay up

876
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,501
waiting for your report.

877
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:55,580
And clients?

878
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:01,941
I understand.

879
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:16,736
(Can cartoon images count as portraits?)

880
00:43:16,736 --> 00:43:18,656
(The core of portrait rights
is "recognizability",)

881
00:43:18,656 --> 00:43:19,744
(so if traits or captions)

882
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:21,674
(make the person identifiable,)

883
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:23,392
(the cartoon qualifies as a portrait.)

884
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,552
(Besides real photos or videos,)

885
00:43:24,552 --> 00:43:26,400
(cartoons, sketches, Al-morphed faces
and deepfakes can count as portraits.)
