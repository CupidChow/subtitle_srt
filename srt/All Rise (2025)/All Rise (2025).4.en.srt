(Talent Hunt Program Day 8)

26
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:52,155
(Huang Yue 4, Li Ke 4,

27
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,960
(Guo Xiaoyu 2,

28
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:55,908
Mom, three more months, okay?

29
00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:59,188
I'll win first place
in the Talent Hunt Program.

30
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,668
I don't need to inherit anything.

31
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:02,867
Think about it.

32
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,787
What if you don't make it to the end?

33
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:18,307
Life is unbearable

34
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:19,988
after retirement.

35
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,627
I have nothing to do.

36
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:23,907
So I came up with an idea.

37
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:25,348
I started writing down

38
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:27,388
my childhood memories, work stories,

39
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:28,427
and all sorts of things

40
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,828
into a novel.

41
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,988
Zhou Nian, be serious
about what I told you.

42
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:40,268
Get started.

43
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:40,907
Got it.

44
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:42,027
Take action.

45
00:02:42,907 --> 00:02:43,867
Ting, get in the car.

46
00:02:47,988 --> 00:02:48,948
Drive safely, sir.

47
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:49,800
Alright.

48
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,348
Where are you headed? Hop in.

49
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:11,707
We're both here

50
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:14,228
being forced into marriage.

51
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,548
Get in.

52
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:27,788
Miss,

53
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:28,867
I'm home now.

54
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:30,027
Thank you so much.

55
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,147
Let me carry this up.

56
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:31,988
No need.

57
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,108
You've carried it

58
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:34,388
for me all the way.

59
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:35,508
Thank you so much.

60
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:36,948
It was nothing.

61
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:38,027
By the way, sir.

62
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:40,668
Are you in a rush
about the screenwriter consultation?

63
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,027
I just remembered
I have a screenwriter friend.

64
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,228
Want me to connect you?

65
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,348
Didn't I tell you?

66
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:47,828
After retiring,

67
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,627
I spent years writing this novel.

68
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:53,187
Then I adapted it into a movie script.

69
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:54,587
I submitted it

70
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:56,627
and waited endlessly for responses

71
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:58,108
that never came.

72
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:01,108
Then my grandson

73
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:03,627
took me to a new movie one day.

74
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:05,348
I watched it.

75
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:06,348
You know what?

76
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,788
The plot was

77
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,668
identical to my script.

78
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:12,548
It's been bothering me

79
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:14,307
for days.

80
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,228
Are you suggesting

81
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,867
they might have
infringed on your copyright?

82
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:20,908
Don't worry.

83
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:22,067
Though I can't personally

84
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,187
help with your lawsuit,

85
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:25,228
I'll connect you with Jun An's lawyers.

86
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:27,468
A lawsuit?

87
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:29,908
I need to think about this.

88
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:31,387
Alright.

89
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,187
Let's exchange WeChat contacts.

90
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,908
Feel free to text me

91
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:35,788
when you need help.

92
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:36,348
Alright.

93
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:36,867
Okay.

94
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:39,228
Done.

95
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:42,668
I'll head up now. Thank you.

96
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:43,507
Thanks.

97
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:44,228
- Bye, sir.
- Thanks.

98
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:45,028
Thank you.

99
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,468
I've only seen
this car's interior online.

100
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:50,988
It's my first ride.

101
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:51,747
So nice.

102
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,307
Stop being so dramatic.

103
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:56,187
A fourth-year lawyer
at Jun An earns decent money.

104
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:57,827
Forced marriage?

105
00:04:58,028 --> 00:04:59,867
Just grit your teeth and accept it.

106
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:01,908
You seem to like that lady, nodding

107
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:02,867
at everything she says.

108
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:04,387
Of course I like her,

109
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:06,108
but marriage is different.

110
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:08,788
Our situations differ, though.

111
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:10,827
You're having a marriage alliance.

112
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:12,267
I'm merely struggling.

113
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:14,427
To get married,

114
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:16,067
my parents sold their house.

115
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:17,827
We pooled money for a down payment

116
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,267
and got a bigger place in Daxing.

117
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:20,867
But she wants another house

118
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:22,267
because she can't

119
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:23,827
live with my parents.

120
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,028
So both families' burdens

121
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,267
fall on your shoulders?

122
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,867
No wonder you mentor us
while you're so busy.

123
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:33,947
I'll buy it

124
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,468
just to get married.

125
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,148
I didn't see or hear

126
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:39,108
anything.

127
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:39,827
Thank you.

128
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,148
Where to?

129
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,588
I'll get back to work for buying house.

130
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:45,588
Impressive.

131
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:49,267
(Jun An's free legal consultation)
Let me look into it.

132
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:50,548
Just call me anytime.

133
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:51,108
Alright.

134
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:55,867
We're not licensed lawyers yet.

135
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:57,348
And Jun An gets enough cases.

136
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,148
Why are you snatching clients?

137
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:00,067
Beibei.

138
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,348
Beibei, where are you?

139
00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:06,708
I'll let you play
the Good Samaritan this time.

140
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,067
Sure.

141
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:09,228
Ma'am.

142
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:11,507
Miss.

143
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,148
Can you help my daughter?

144
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:15,208
Your daughter?

145
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,028
Ma'am, calm down.

146
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:20,427
My colleague graduated
from a top foreign university.

147
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,348
He's amazing.

148
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,507
Tell him what you need.

149
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,788
Come on, how's that relevant?

150
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:24,427
What happened?

151
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,348
My daughter is missing.

152
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:27,187
How old is she?

153
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:33,348
This is your daughter?

154
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,187
My Beibei.

155
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:38,348
Don't be afraid.

156
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:39,708
Let's go.

157
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:41,788
Ma'am.

158
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:42,947
This is Beibei?

159
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:45,028
This is her. My daughter.

160
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:49,348
Thank you.

161
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:50,028
No problem.

162
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:51,148
You're so kind.

163
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:51,908
Now I'm relieved.

164
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:53,548
My Beibei.

165
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,747
Don't you run off again.

166
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:58,067
Young man.

167
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,627
Could you also look after my baby?

168
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:01,387
Your baby is...

169
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:02,387
That's it.

170
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,708
This is your baby?

171
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:04,148
Yeah.

172
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:04,867
No.

173
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,627
Not a dog. I'm allergic, Ma'am.

174
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:08,548
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:09,267
Just help out.

176
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:10,468
I can't, Ma'am.

177
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:11,747
Don't run off, young man.

178
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:12,827
Don't let it chase me.

179
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:13,827
- Help out.
- Please.

180
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:15,387
It's not that I don't want to help.

181
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,468
Why don't you

182
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,548
just find someone else, Ma'am?

183
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:19,867
Please help me.

184
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:22,148
Stop chasing me.

185
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:28,104
(Bai Xiao: Redo it!)

186
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:46,708
Hello.

187
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,947
Do you remember that uncle we met
at the legal consultation?

188
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:51,627
He said he couldn't reach you.

189
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:53,267
I have

190
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,627
an urgent task at hand.

191
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:55,747
Could you check with him?

192
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:57,640
It's tricky.

193
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,348
We actually spoke briefly.

194
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,067
I told him that the lawsuit doesn't meet

195
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,148
the access requirements.

196
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:05,187
We can't win.

197
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:06,228
Then he

198
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:07,588
got mad at me.

199
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,307
Anyone would get angry.

200
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:10,548
I think we should

201
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,827
first empathize with him

202
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:14,307
and then offer solutions.

203
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,187
He's an elderly man

204
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:17,827
who doesn't know much about the law.

205
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:19,228
He struggled all day

206
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,988
and mustered the courage
to ask for help.

207
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:22,627
You told him it won't work.

208
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:24,067
Who wouldn't be upset?

209
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:25,468
I do understand him.

210
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,827
But his novel,

211
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:29,788
or script, was never published.

212
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:31,468
What can I do?

213
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,627
You can check the documentation.

214
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:36,667
In China's judicial practice,

215
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:38,787
the plaintiff's
burden of proof for access

216
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,027
doesn't require absolute proof

217
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:41,228
that the defendant had

218
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,267
complete access to the plaintiff's work.

219
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,547
They just need to prove
that the defendant had

220
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,667
or could have accessed

221
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,387
the plaintiff's work.

222
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,027
Fine, even if that's the case,

223
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:53,348
when the court proceedings
actually begin,

224
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,867
what if you can't prove

225
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,588
that the director
or screenwriter ever accessed

226
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:58,468
his novel?

227
00:08:59,147 --> 00:08:59,787
First off,

228
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,867
neither of us is qualified
to handle this case.

229
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:02,667
Even if he entrusts

230
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,988
Jun An with representation,

231
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,627
we don't make the decision.

232
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,027
Besides, he's an elderly man.

233
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:09,867
He doesn't understand
legal technicalities.

234
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:11,267
Find a way to make sure

235
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,988
that he actually understands you.

236
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:15,507
Imagine if he were your family.

237
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,507
If you knew he couldn't understand,

238
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,027
would you talk to him like this?

239
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:21,027
Why does it matter

240
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:23,387
if he's my family?

241
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,507
I'd speak this way
to any elderly person.

242
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:27,547
Seniors and children alike.

243
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:28,627
We've both received

244
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,147
proper legal education.

245
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:32,867
Our first lesson
was about factual accuracy.

246
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:33,547
Right?

247
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,027
Forget it. This is pointless.

248
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:37,387
I'll wait for his call.

249
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:47,004
(Access requirement)

250
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:50,344
(Key factor in determining copyright
infringement The accused party had)

251
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:54,248
(the possibility of accessing
or had access to the original work.)

252
00:09:57,188 --> 00:09:57,588
Hello?

253
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,308
Sweetie, it's Mom.

254
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:01,468
Yes, darling.

255
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:02,828
I am back now.

256
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:06,267
But I need to stop by the office first

257
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:07,547
to grab some files.

258
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:11,948
Then I'll come straight home, okay?

259
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,627
Give me a kiss. Sweetie.

260
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:19,428
Alrighty then.

261
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:24,072
Why are you still here?

262
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:25,428
I'm redoing

263
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:27,068
the report as you requested.

264
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:30,627
Do you know why

265
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:32,627
I kept you here
despite the Warm Nest case?

266
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:40,147
I've mentored
several promising juniors before.

267
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,667
All top law school graduates,

268
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,627
dazzled by Jun An's prestige.

269
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:47,027
They articulated during interviews.

270
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,147
But all of them

271
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,108
let me down in practice.

272
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,907
Some couldn't handle the pressure

273
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:52,708
and quit.

274
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:55,708
You're usually quiet,

275
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:57,188
but proactive in execution.

276
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:59,267
When you spot opportunities,

277
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,188
you fight relentlessly to seize them.

278
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,188
I thought you were different.

279
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:12,147
I reviewed your research report.

280
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,387
It's crammed with legal statutes,

281
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:15,787
case studies, and analysis,

282
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,147
but lacks a definitive conclusion,

283
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:20,907
the very thing I needed most.

284
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:24,867
Besides, formatting is subpar.

285
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,468
Multiple glaring typos stand out.

286
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,547
You must understand this.

287
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:31,988
Clients may not grasp

288
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:35,027
the depth of your legal counsel,

289
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:37,027
but they'll instantly notice

290
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:38,547
every single typo.

291
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,708
And that's sufficient reason

292
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,907
to negate all your previous work.

293
00:11:44,147 --> 00:11:46,027
Client trust takes years to build,

294
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,027
but seconds to destroy.

295
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,747
If preventable

296
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:51,267
basic mistakes

297
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:53,428
cost their trust,

298
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:55,188
you'll need

299
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:56,867
twice the effort to recover

300
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:58,267
what's lost.

301
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:02,627
Ms. Bai.

302
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,588
I really gave my all.

303
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,667
I pulled an all-nighter for this.

304
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,068
Want me to applaud

305
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,468
your effort?

306
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:14,428
Every lawyer works hard.

307
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:15,348
Every one of them.

308
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:17,627
Without desirable results,

309
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:19,428
effort just becomes regret.

310
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:21,747
Sorry, Ms. Bai.

311
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,068
I failed this.

312
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,428
But I said I'd stay,

313
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,507
and I will.

314
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:30,108
Ren Jiatong.

315
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:32,027
After your bachelor's degree,

316
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,627
you interned at other firms.

317
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:36,027
Then you went for graduate studies.

318
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:37,228
You know perfectly well

319
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,228
that our profession

320
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:40,147
has no shortage of hard workers.

321
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:42,667
What's rare are leaders

322
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,068
who efficiently resolve complex issues.

323
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:46,547
As a lawyer,

324
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:48,188
you can work alone.

325
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,867
But if you want to advance
in our profession,

326
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,547
to go far and stay steady,

327
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:54,747
you must seek help and collaborate,

328
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:56,667
as well as build and lead teams.

329
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:57,588
Because someday,

330
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:58,507
you might

331
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,027
grow into a partner, right?

332
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,428
A partner requires two key abilities.

333
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,387
Professional expertise

334
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:04,787
and team management skills.

335
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:06,948
The task I assigned you

336
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:08,747
isn't something you can complete alone

337
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,468
through overtime or all-nighters.

338
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,547
Your solo attempt only forces me

339
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,188
to stay up fixing your mistakes.

340
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:19,267
I'm sorry, Ms. Bai.

341
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:20,747
Ren Jiatong,

342
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:23,588
even the most diligent
and outstanding one needs allies

343
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:24,308
and teammates.

344
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:26,027
Stop working alone.

345
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:27,708
My advice is simple.

346
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,787
Go home and rest.

347
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:30,348
Tomorrow morning,

348
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:31,428
find a teammate

349
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:32,708
to finish this task together.

350
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:33,308
Understood?

351
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:35,068
Yes.

352
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:37,267
Go home.

353
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:46,308
(Jiang Chen)
I asked

354
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,027
the uncle for all his submission emails

355
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:49,867
and one of them looks fishy.

356
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:56,428
Hello.

357
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:00,747
Want to team up on

358
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,228
Ms. Bai's medical dispute case?

359
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:02,747
Sure.

360
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,068
But...

361
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:05,068
See you tomorrow.

362
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:29,708
Morning.

363
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:30,787
You're early.

364
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:32,988
I've sent you the files.

365
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,240
Check them later. Ask me
if you have questions.

366
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:36,068
Okay.

367
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:40,267
Shouldn't you ask me questions?

368
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:41,507
You came to me for help.

369
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,308
I'll say it again. It's a collaboration.

370
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:03,400

Yu and A Hospital in Beijing)

Article 1225

374
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:16,867
we discussed?

375
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,627
Since mediators facilitated

376
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,907
the mutually agreed resolution,

377
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,188
the settlement stands.

378
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:25,787
Let's proceed.

379
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:40,228
The framework works,

380
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,027
but this...

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

382
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:46,747
Are you new trainee lawyers?

383
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:49,228
Yeah, we're...

384
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:50,547
Good day.

385
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,468
We're from the Talent Hunt Program.

386
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:53,507
I'm Ren Jiatong.

387
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,267
And I'm Jiang Chen.

388
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,308
I've heard of Talent Hunt Program.

389
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:58,428
Great opportunity.

390
00:15:59,108 --> 00:15:59,787
Very competitive.

391
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,468
We survived that back then.

392
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:03,147
Good luck in earning

393
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:04,147
an exciting offer.

394
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:05,828
Thank you.

395
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:06,547
Thank you.

396
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:07,867
Carry on.

397
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,228
Dinner time.

398
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:21,988
Takeout?

399
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:23,147
No thanks.

400
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,027
Even Wonder Woman needs to eat.

401
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,787
I hate choosing takeout.

402
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:30,627
Too many options.

403
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,708
Mr. Song recommended
a great Shunde restaurant downstairs.

404
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,667
Let's try it.

405
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:40,188
Order for yourself.
I have instant noodles.

406
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,188
At least get cup noodles.

407
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:44,188
Packaged ones are messy.

408
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:45,907
It tastes the same,

409
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:46,787
but twice the price.

410
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,907
For those planning to survive
the three-month

411
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,348
Talent Hunt Program,

412
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,988
that's bad budgeting.

413
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,468
Did you study law or accounting?

414
00:16:56,627 --> 00:16:58,188
Honestly, with me around, you won't

415
00:16:58,867 --> 00:16:59,948
last three months.

416
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:01,267
Rest assured.

417
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:02,267
I will win.

418
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,148
I admire ambitious rivals like you.

419
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,948
Without you,

420
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,067
this program wouldn't be so interesting.

421
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,827
But we're the same type.

422
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:14,388
We're both competitive.

423
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:15,148
So,

424
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,468
staying at Jun An is a done deal for me.

425
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:23,107
I believe in you.

426
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,547
Come back next year,

427
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:25,747
and you'll make it.

428
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:27,307
Jiatong.

429
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:29,388
Come next year, and I'll back you up.

430
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:39,496
(Jointly completed
by Ren Jiatong and Jiang Chen)

431
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:42,628
Done.

432
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:45,107
I'll buy you late-night snacks.

433
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:47,027
Are you kidding?

434
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:48,908
We just had dinner.

435
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:50,988
I just had instant noodles.

436
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:54,388
Didn't I tell you to order food?

437
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:55,507
You stubbornly wanted

438
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,827
to experience the life
of ordinary staff like us.

439
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:00,148
My fault then.

440
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,428
Have some milk.

441
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:06,988
A kid of your age
is usually off milk by now.

442
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:09,507
For protein supplement.

443
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:12,067
Thanks.

444
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:14,428
Packaged instant noodles won't do.

445
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,027
Forget three months.

446
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:17,468
You won't last thirty days.

447
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:22,344
Don't overthink it.

448
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:24,787
I'm just worried about my digestion.

449
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:25,988
That's why.

450
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:29,027
How did you even grow up like this?

451
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:29,908
I bet your dad

452
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,587
has tried to teach you how to speak.

453
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,267
I'm not

454
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:39,307
close to him.

455
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:41,988
So that never happened.

456
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:54,908
Right, the uncle

457
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:56,188
sent you those emails.

458
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:57,027
What did you find?

459
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:00,668
Wait.

460
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:01,948
Come and see.

461
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:07,787
He has sent emails

462
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:09,347
to many film companies

463
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:10,107
in the past.

464
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,347
One of them replied to him.

465
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:11,868
Look.

466
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:14,307
We will reply as soon as possible.

467
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:15,267
(Script submission, "When I Was Young")
Note the signature.

468
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:16,868
WD Film.

469
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,067
WD.

470
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:19,628
WD Film.

471
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,067
Isn't it the company he wants to sue?

472
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:22,948
Also, look at

473
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:24,267
this email address.

474
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,547
The first part

475
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,708
must be a person's name.

476
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:29,188
So I'm thinking.

477
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,587
If we find this person's name

478
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,388
in the movie credits,

479
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,027
we might be able to prove

480
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,347
that they had access
to that uncle's novel

481
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:37,948
or script.

482
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,148
I've glanced at that movie.

483
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,507
The end credits include

484
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:42,507
quite a few names.

485
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:43,428
Let's divide the work.

486
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:43,988
No need.

487
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:46,628
Ms. Bai might reply at any moment.

488
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:47,988
You keep an eye on the email.

489
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:48,988
I'll find this person.

490
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:49,747
If I find it,

491
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:51,307
I'll tell you right away, okay?

492
00:19:59,388 --> 00:19:59,948
Jiang Chen.

493
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,107
Last night on the phone,

494
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,388
I said it was pointless to talk to you.

495
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:07,107
I was too arbitrary.

496
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:10,827
We spoke on the phone?

497
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,388
I don't remember.

498
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,188
I'm off.

499
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:24,228
Thanks.

500
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:25,307
Oh please.

501
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,228
Don't treat every case as your own.

502
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:30,668
I'm not just trying to help you.

503
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:31,668
I actually want to

504
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:33,148
get involved in Ms. Bai's case.

505
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:09,908
You're back.

506
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:11,228
How did you get in?

507
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:13,587
I contacted the landlady

508
00:21:13,787 --> 00:21:15,027
and paid one month's rent.

509
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:17,067
So now, we're roommates.

510
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:19,228
I'm making noodles.

511
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:19,948
Want some?

512
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:22,609
The landlady said she had told you.

513
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:25,468
You...

514
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:26,428
I've eaten.

515
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,240
I just saw
the message from the landlady.

516
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:36,868
As roommates,

517
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:38,628
I hope we can establish three rules.

518
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:40,908
First, no laundries or cooking

519
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,267
after 11 PM.

520
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,388
Second, don't leave things

521
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:46,148
lying around in the common areas.

522
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:49,347
Third, we'll put two trash bins

523
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:50,307
in the bathroom.

524
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:56,428
Don't

525
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:57,587
worry too much.

526
00:21:58,228 --> 00:21:59,547
The landlady insisted on

527
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:01,027
three months' rent plus a deposit.

528
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,388
I bargained with her

529
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,628
and only paid one month's rent.

530
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,827
I'm not sure if I'll even
last a full month.

531
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:08,988
Why not?

532
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:14,428
I might crawl back home any day.

533
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:16,228
At Jun An, I finally see

534
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,827
why it's a crime

535
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:19,188
to talk someone

536
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:20,188
into law school.

537
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:22,587
You're all amazing.

538
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:24,468
I'm kind of losing it.

539
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,027
If you really want to leave,

540
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:29,827
why wait a month?

541
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:32,908
That's thousands for a month's rent.

542
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:34,468
Save it for something better.

543
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,827
You obviously don't want to leave.

544
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,067
But you keep talking about going home.

545
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:40,507
Do you want to leave

546
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,267
or are you fishing for sympathy?

547
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,107
Leave if you want to.

548
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:45,628
If not, quit the whining.

549
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:47,347
We're all just staff.

550
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:49,547
No one's got time to coddle you.

551
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:51,988
I should've

552
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:53,547
recorded this and posted it online.

553
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:54,988
It'd get more clicks than

554
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:55,827
the Warm Nest video.

555
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:57,787
Ren Jiatong,

556
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,267
why don't you start a channel?

557
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:01,347
Call it

558
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,587
"Sassy Lady Lawyer's Brutal Truths."

559
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:06,267
It'll go viral.

560
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:10,307
My noodles.

561
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:14,148
Smell amazing. Let me serve you a bowl.

562
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:18,228
I said I'm not hungry.

563
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:27,868
Guo Xiaoyu, you're a great cook.

564
00:23:29,228 --> 00:23:30,628
My boyfriend says the same.

565
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:33,228
He keeps complaining
that I can't cook for him

566
00:23:33,307 --> 00:23:36,008
due to long-distance relationship.
So his "happiness index" dropped.

567
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:37,827
He begs me to go home every day.

568
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,908
Why doesn't he do something about it?

569
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:43,547
If he hates it,

570
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,547
why doesn't he come to Beijing?

571
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:46,747
He's got legs.

572
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:50,188
True.

573
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:54,347
That's a surprisingly valid point.

574
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:57,468
I'll talk to him about this.

575
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:06,388
My baby is calling.

576
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:10,507
Don't forget to clean the living room.

577
00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:11,188
Got it.

578
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:20,072
(Bai Xiao: Good.)

579
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,228
(Ren Jiatong: Ms. Bai replied, "Good".)

580
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:33,908
(Jiang Chen: I found)

581
00:24:34,148 --> 00:24:35,587
(the name of that person.)

582
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:37,148
(He's the film's script supervisor.)

583
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:37,948
(Jiang Chen,)

584
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:39,628
(thanks for today.)

585
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:42,307
(It's the weekend.)

586
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:45,868
(Go home and rest.)

587
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:47,428
(I...)

588
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,336
(Ren Jiatong)

589
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:06,344
(Isabelle
Aesthetic and Plastic Surgery Hospital)

590
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:09,148
Sir,

591
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:10,827
I'm sending you

592
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:11,948
my legal advice

593
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,107
through a courier.

594
00:25:13,868 --> 00:25:14,228
Yeah.

595
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:15,628
Tell me when you get it.

596
00:25:15,668 --> 00:25:16,307
Thank you.

597
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:22,668
Bye, sir.

598
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:23,868
Jiang Chen.

599
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:25,188
Early again?

600
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:29,228
Last night, I rewatched the movie.

601
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,787
I found a line in dialect.

602
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:33,307
The uncle confirmed that

603
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:34,547
it was his hometown dialect.

604
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:35,587
His novel has

605
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,307
the exact same line.

606
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:38,747
But the key is

607
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:40,908
that the producers misunderstood

608
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:42,428
the line's true meaning.

609
00:25:42,587 --> 00:25:43,388
They misused it.

610
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:45,347
I compiled our findings and sent them

611
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:46,027
to him.

612
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:47,067
Great.

613
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:49,148
I also advised him

614
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,587
to explore avenues
beyond judicial processes to safeguard

615
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:52,267
his rights.

616
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:54,507
He can get someone to post it on Weibo

617
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:55,668
and use new media

618
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:57,188
to spread it.

619
00:25:57,507 --> 00:25:58,107
Why?

620
00:25:58,668 --> 00:26:00,587
Aren't you pushing an elder

621
00:26:00,587 --> 00:26:02,708
to pressure courts with public opinions?

622
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:05,787
That's a wild accusation.

623
00:26:06,228 --> 00:26:07,547
As future lawyers,

624
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:09,547
our goal is to solve problems
for the clients.

625
00:26:09,747 --> 00:26:10,988
Now we have solid evidence.

626
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:12,968
No sensationalism
or orchestrated narratives.

627
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:14,708
Jiang Chen, you're too dogmatic.

628
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:17,307
I-I'm dogmatic?

629
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:18,507
Jiatong.

630
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:21,288
Why didn't you wake me up?
I almost overslept.

631
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:23,988
- Morning.
- Morning.

632
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:25,864
What's wrong?

633
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:27,747
Nothing. Let's go.

634
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:30,148
We're having a meeting.

635
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:31,908
So early?

636
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:32,616
What's it about?

637
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:33,468
No idea.

638
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:35,428
But it's nothing trivial.

639
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:37,827
We need you

640
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:39,908
to assist with this case at hand.

641
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:41,228
Here are the basics.

642
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:44,988
Celebrity Ms. Xiao

643
00:26:45,107 --> 00:26:45,868
saw a poster

644
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:47,468
from a plastic surgery hospital,

645
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:48,827
and believes that

646
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:50,107
it's adapted from her image.

647
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:59,148
(Isabelle
Aesthetic and Plastic Surgery Hospital)

648
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:01,228
The hospital used this poster
without her consent.

649
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:03,468
While the hospital
didn't explicitly state

650
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:04,468
that the woman

651
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:05,347
in the poster

652
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:06,908
received their weight loss treatment.

653
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:08,507
Their use of this illustration

654
00:27:08,948 --> 00:27:10,428
is deliberately misleading,

655
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:12,067
suggesting that Ms. Xiao

656
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,468
received weight loss treatments

657
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:14,188
from them.

658
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:16,908
I'm a fan of her.

659
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,948
I've been following this.

660
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:21,388
It infuriated me.

661
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:25,067
But it's a cartoon,
not her actual photo.

662
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:26,388
Can we directly claim

663
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:28,428
that the hospital
violated her portrait rights?

664
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:29,747
Absolutely.

665
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:32,148
Even a cartoon adaptation

666
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,347
qualifies as her portrait.

667
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:37,067
We can pursue
a portrait rights infringement case.

668
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:39,547
But since the client approached us,

669
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:41,868
our focus shouldn't be on establishing

670
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,228
but winning the case.

671
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:45,948
Ms. Xiao

672
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:47,428
entrusted us to present

673
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:48,188
her case.

674
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:50,988
She wants to sue the hospital
for portrait rights violations.

675
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:54,148
The first round of Talent Hunt Program
will end in three days.

676
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:56,468
Mr. Zhuang approved this
as a practice that counts

677
00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:58,267
as your third assignment.

678
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,107
I'll email the materials shortly.

679
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:02,347
By this time tomorrow,

680
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,547
all of you will
present your case analyses.

681
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:11,908
Thank you.

682
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:16,388
Mr. Zhou.

683
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:17,908
Mr. Zhou.

684
00:28:18,507 --> 00:28:18,948
Yeah?

685
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:20,468
Speak.

686
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:22,908
Well,

687
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:25,827
I'm working hard,

688
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,307
but I always fall short somehow.

689
00:28:28,628 --> 00:28:30,228
Ren Jiatong immediately

690
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:31,908
grasped the key points immediately.

691
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,708
It's about winning

692
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:34,827
rather than establishing

693
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:35,708
the case.

694
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:38,708
I feel like I'm always slow to catch on.

695
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:41,267
Ren Jiatong is exceptional.

696
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:43,228
Her prior experience helps.

697
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:45,587
But don't be discouraged.
You're not bad.

698
00:28:46,787 --> 00:28:48,148
Right now, it seems

699
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:49,307
Ren Jiatong and Jiang Chen

700
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:50,948
are the top candidates among us.

701
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,188
If the Talent Hunt Program

702
00:28:53,188 --> 00:28:54,468
retains one person in the end,

703
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:56,388
it'll certainly be one of them.

704
00:28:58,228 --> 00:28:59,388
Does that mean

705
00:28:59,628 --> 00:29:01,708
I shouldn't even keep trying?

706
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:05,587
I understand your peer pressure.

707
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:07,668
It's worse for the more talented.

708
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,027
I was once in your shoes.

709
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,507
Competition, elimination, retention...

710
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:16,027
Among my peers of trainee lawyers,

711
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,267
I wasn't the most impressive.

712
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:19,868
Before joining Jun An,

713
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:21,388
I did other jobs for years.

714
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:22,827
Yet here I am.

715
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:24,228
Guess

716
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:26,587
why this program lasts three months.

717
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,507
It's a marathon.

718
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:32,148
Work hard

719
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:33,428
and you stand a chance.

720
00:29:33,948 --> 00:29:34,708
You've secured

721
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,307
opportunities from the lawyer pool

722
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:37,827
and earned 15 points.

723
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:39,388
That's a solid start.

724
00:29:42,228 --> 00:29:42,827
I see.

725
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:43,908
Thank you.

726
00:29:44,307 --> 00:29:45,948
I won't stay last forever.

727
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:47,948
Go for it.

728
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:50,148
Thank you.

729
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:57,267
While I'm gone,

730
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,988
(Tian Min, aged 30)
you've taken over as the mentor.

731
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:00,587
(Lawyer of Dispute Resolution Group 1)
Ms. Tian.

732
00:30:01,908 --> 00:30:03,240
Back from your maternity leave?

733
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:06,468
You haven't changed.

734
00:30:08,027 --> 00:30:10,468
Don't give us working moms
body image anxiety.

735
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:11,428
It's tough enough.

736
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:14,267
I've gained ten pounds.

737
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:16,267
Don't say you can tell.

738
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:17,428
I really can't tell.

739
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:18,827
You look amazing.

740
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,388
But it's only been two months.

741
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:22,428
You sure you got this?

742
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:23,747
You...

743
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:25,547
You workaholic. Just like Ms. Bai.

744
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:27,347
Come on.

745
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:28,988
Ms. Bai wouldn't let me work.

746
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,628
She told me to rest at home.

747
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:32,587
I was going crazy.

748
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:34,188
The kid is crying

749
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:35,747
and we're losing it.

750
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:39,468
Work's my only escape for peace.

751
00:30:43,228 --> 00:30:45,347
That young lady is a trainee lawyer?

752
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:49,148
She's feeling pressure comparing herself

753
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:50,388
to her peers.

754
00:30:52,428 --> 00:30:55,027
She should learn from you.

755
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,067
After all,

756
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:59,708
you thrived under my dominance.

757
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:01,587
You're

758
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:03,747
teasing me right after returning?

759
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:38,708
Mr. Zhuang heard that you're holding

760
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:39,628
a discussion today

761
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:40,787
and wants to sit in.

762
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:42,628
- Good day, Mr. Zhuang.
- Good day, Mr. Zhuang.

763
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:43,948
Hello.

764
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:45,547
Don't mind me.

765
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:48,787
Speak freely.

766
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:57,787
Legally speaking,

767
00:31:57,787 --> 00:32:00,388
portraiture hinges on identifiability.

768
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:03,228
If an image depicts features

769
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:04,347
that distinctly correlate

770
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:06,107
to a specific individual,

771
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:07,307
then that depiction

772
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:08,747
(View A: hinging on identifiability)
falls under China's legal

773
00:32:08,747 --> 00:32:10,228
(File lawsuit right away)
protections for portrait rights.

774
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,067
I agree.

775
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,827
You're right.

776
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,787
But while legally sound,

777
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:18,267
this alone won't

778
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,148
convince a judge in court.

779
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:21,507
We may need

780
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:22,747
(View B: Insufficient evidence)
stronger evidence.

781
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:24,868
Because

782
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:26,948
we can't be too dogmatic.

783
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,507
Jiang Chen is right.

784
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:40,507
If you can't agree on it,

785
00:32:40,547 --> 00:32:42,228
you can split into teams

786
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,708
for presentations.

787
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:45,107
Right?

788
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:45,587
Yeah.

789
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:47,668
As Mr. Zhuang said,

790
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:48,708
split up.

791
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,587
Draft a legal assessment

792
00:32:51,908 --> 00:32:53,428
for Ms. Xiao's case,

793
00:32:53,747 --> 00:32:56,948
evaluating the feasibility
of suing the hospital

794
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:58,628
for portrait rights infringement.

795
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:00,587
Present it tomorrow

796
00:33:00,988 --> 00:33:01,547
morning.

797
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:03,468
This is a team-based competition.

798
00:33:03,868 --> 00:33:04,587
Members of

799
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:06,668
the winning team get 20 points each.

800
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:07,547
Alright?

801
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:08,908
Got it.

802
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:10,280
Alright.

803
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:11,188
So...

804
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:12,628
That's it.

805
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:19,347
Ren Jiatong, here.

806
00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:21,228
Come on.

807
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:31,148
Jiatong, sit here.

808
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:36,547
Call me by my full name.

809
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:39,067
The nickname makes me

810
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:39,988
cringe.

811
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:43,027
Have some yogurt.

812
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,668
Why are you suddenly so kind?

813
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:50,668
Don't tell me your boyfriend is visiting

814
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:52,067
and staying with you.

815
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:52,868
Not happening.

816
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:54,307
No.

817
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:56,708
I didn't mean to upset you.

818
00:33:58,148 --> 00:33:59,188
I don't get it.

819
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:00,228
How did you upset me?

820
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:02,868
I stood by Jiang Chen

821
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:03,868
during the meeting.

822
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:05,388
It was nothing personal.

823
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:07,428
If you think having disagreements

824
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:08,988
means something personal,

825
00:34:09,268 --> 00:34:10,547
you shouldn't be a lawyer.

826
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:12,468
This is what we deal with.

827
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:16,107
Now I'm relieved.

828
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:19,748
I'm also relieved.

829
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:22,468
Thanks for the yogurt.

830
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:27,187
I've noticed something.

831
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:29,748
Are you afraid of owing others favors?

832
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:31,308
And you set boundaries.

833
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:33,828
That's why you keep everything separate

834
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:34,788
and never mix

835
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:35,988
your things with mine.

836
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,468
Every time I treat you to food,

837
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:39,667
you pay me afterward.

838
00:34:40,707 --> 00:34:41,868
You won't even accept

839
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,507
my yogurt without knowing the reason.

840
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:45,468
Am I right?

841
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:54,868
Detective Guo, you've got
such elaborate logic,

842
00:34:54,868 --> 00:34:55,988
just like Sherlock Holmes.

843
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,587
But once you're done analyzing me,

844
00:34:57,587 --> 00:34:59,908
use your superb investigative skills

845
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:02,587
to check if your food is sold out.

846
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:05,468
My Braised Chicken Rice!

847
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:10,388
You're right.

848
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:14,147
Sherlock Holmes,

849
00:35:14,868 --> 00:35:16,027
my boyfriend forever.

850
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:25,788
This seat is taken.

851
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:28,748
Ren Jiatong, I want to team up with you.

852
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:32,067
I agree with your approach.

853
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:33,948
Let's team up. I want to win.

854
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:44,587
Huang Yue.

855
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:45,948
Thank you.

856
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:48,027
- Ren Jiatong.
- Thanks.

857
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:49,908
Let's go on.

858
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:22,908
I'm still working.

859
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:24,268
I ranked last.

860
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:25,587
I must catch up this time.

861
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:28,388
And this time, Mr. Zhuang will listen

862
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:29,227
to our reports.

863
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,948
Those small assessments don't need

864
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:33,187
too much devotion.

865
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:34,627
You taught me that.

866
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:35,547
Be more mature.

867
00:36:35,547 --> 00:36:36,587
Find ways to win.

868
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:37,868
I have to go.

869
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:39,667
What's wrong?

870
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,067
Nothing.

871
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:48,067
Wait.

872
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:49,908
I'll order you a bubble tea.

873
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:52,587
I haven't thanked you for helping

874
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:53,428
with the translation.

875
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:54,268
It's my treat.

876
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:55,067
It's fine.

877
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:56,227
Let me order it.

878
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:00,507
Alright, Yue. That's enough.

879
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:02,868
I'm free this weekend.

880
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:03,988
End your work.

881
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:06,187
Come keep me company. I miss you.

882
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:08,507
We've always been like this.

883
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,587
I can only see him when he's free,

884
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:12,908
and I have to drop work.

885
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:14,388
I suddenly feel

886
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:16,627
like a pet he keeps.

887
00:37:23,147 --> 00:37:24,587
As an expert, I can tell that

888
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:25,868
he's not for you.

889
00:37:26,348 --> 00:37:27,627
Between a man and a career,

890
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:29,268
always choose the career.

891
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,027
Unless that guy

892
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:32,948
is as good as my Zhubao.

893
00:37:35,187 --> 00:37:36,027
Why are you

894
00:37:36,268 --> 00:37:37,027
still working?

895
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:37,908
It's dinner time.

896
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:41,348
I'm wondering
whether the original comic would

897
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:42,587
provide some evidence.

898
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:44,107
Original comic?

899
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:47,348
This art style looks familiar.

900
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:49,948
So I'm checking some anime websites

901
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:50,547
for clues.

902
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,728
(Comic website)

903
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:00,147
Guo Xiaoyu.

904
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:02,988
Have a minute?

905
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:03,748
Let's talk.

906
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:06,147
Go ahead. I have to go.

907
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:12,988
Are you in trouble

908
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:14,707
or facing some difficulty?

909
00:38:14,908 --> 00:38:15,587
No.

910
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:17,268
Then why are you avoiding me?

911
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:20,027
I'm not avoiding you.

912
00:38:21,388 --> 00:38:22,667
If you have any problems,

913
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,547
I can help you.

914
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:29,348
I just don't like being lied to,

915
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:32,468
especially by friends.

916
00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:35,627
I lied to you?

917
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,507
Whatever.

918
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:46,792
I don't intend to make friends anyway.

919
00:38:59,308 --> 00:39:00,187
I just got home.

920
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:19,464
(Guo Xiaoyu)

921
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:21,288
(Jiang Chen: Not bad, Xiaoyu.)

922
00:39:21,288 --> 00:39:23,304
(Li Ke: This is Mr. Zhuang's case.
Nail this and we're safe next round.)

923
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:26,248
(Guo Xiaoyu)

924
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:30,099
(Zhubao)

925
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:49,868
I need to check
my horoscope for this week

926
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:51,187
and my birth chart.

927
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:52,748
It's been so rough.

928
00:39:52,748 --> 00:39:54,227
I've been arguing with people.

929
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:56,627
You believe in that?

930
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:57,788
Of course.

931
00:39:57,948 --> 00:39:59,868
Theory guides practice.

932
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:02,667
Oh no.

933
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:05,067
My work will be turbulent this week.

934
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:07,388
Am I going to get eliminated

935
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:09,308
in this round?

936
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:14,632
Guo Xiaoyu hasn't arrived.

937
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:16,227
Ren Jiatong, you go first.

938
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:25,308
This comic

939
00:40:25,308 --> 00:40:27,187
was adopted by the hospital's poster.

940
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:28,227
Last night, I found

941
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:29,748
the source of this comic.

942
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:31,348
It was posted on a niche

943
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:32,308
anime-themed website.

944
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:33,868
The original work

945
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,587
is a fan-created content

946
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:36,788
based on Ms. Xiao.

947
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:39,067
This character is named

948
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:39,828
Xiaoxiao.

949
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:40,988
Same as Xiaoyu's approach.

950
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:43,348
Homophones of Ms. Xiao's surname.

951
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:45,667
The netizens all agreed

952
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:48,067
(This is definitely my queen.)
that it resembles Ms. Xiao.

953
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,428
We can use this to prove

954
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:52,227
that the hospital plagiarized the comic

955
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:54,067
and violated Ms. Xiao's portrait rights.

956
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:04,227
That concludes our team's presentation.

957
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:04,988
Thank you.

958
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:09,388
Well done.

959
00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:22,107
How could she do this?

960
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:24,507
You're being naive.

961
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:26,468
You're living with your competitor,

962
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,468
yet you casually

963
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:28,627
left your laptop there.

964
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:30,547
(Zhu Zhisheng, aged 23)
She's a top student

965
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:31,468
(Hangzhou Eawan Tech, R&D Dept)
with real work experience.

966
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:32,707
(Software Engineer)
You have no experience.

967
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:35,308
You're no match for her.

968
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:37,067
Now you see?

969
00:41:37,147 --> 00:41:38,707
There are no friends at work.

970
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:40,788
Jun An isn't for you either.

971
00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:48,788
I want to go home.

972
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:50,147
Great.

973
00:41:50,428 --> 00:41:50,748
Yes.

974
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:51,748
Come back now.

975
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:53,348
I'll ask for leave.

976
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:55,388
I'll come to Beijing to pick you up.

977
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:57,908
We'll have some fun
for a few days, okay?

978
00:41:59,067 --> 00:41:59,468
Okay.

979
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,187
Come soon. I miss you.

980
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:19,468
I'm sorry.

981
00:42:20,547 --> 00:42:22,147
I held our team back.

982
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,388
Xiaoyu, why didn't you

983
00:42:25,388 --> 00:42:26,308
confront them?

984
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,268
I was ready to slam the table.

985
00:42:31,388 --> 00:42:33,988
Actually, it's normal
to have the same idea.

986
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:34,707
Normal?

987
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:37,908
It's just a niche anime site.

988
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:39,388
No one outside the ACG community

989
00:42:39,388 --> 00:42:40,547
would know about it.

990
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,147
Had we known they'd cheat,

991
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:46,067
we should've presented first.

992
00:42:46,988 --> 00:42:48,348
Xiaoyu, what should we...

993
00:42:50,227 --> 00:42:51,468
Wait, what are you doing?

994
00:42:52,107 --> 00:42:53,468
The idea came from Guo Xiaoyu.

995
00:42:53,468 --> 00:42:54,667
She found the website too.

996
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:55,828
Why do you get to

997
00:42:55,828 --> 00:42:56,868
criticize her?

998
00:42:57,268 --> 00:42:58,908
What do you mean?

999
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:00,268
We're on the same team.

1000
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:02,107
I'm just showing solidarity.

1001
00:43:02,268 --> 00:43:03,507
But we have no proof

1002
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:04,547
to support this.

1003
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:05,988
And I don't think

1004
00:43:08,027 --> 00:43:09,348
Ren Jiatong would do that.

1005
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:15,976
(What does the Copyright Law protect?)

1006
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:17,386
(It protects concrete expressions,)

1007
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,436
(not abstract ideas.)

1008
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:19,576
(Copyright infringement)

1009
00:43:19,576 --> 00:43:21,326
(depends on the concrete,
original expression.)

1010
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:23,086
(The idea of "a prince seeking revenge")

1011
00:43:23,086 --> 00:43:24,486
(is not protected by the law.)

1012
00:43:24,486 --> 00:43:26,066
(But the dialogues and plot in "Hamlet")

1013
