I'm from Jun An. Jun An Law Firm.

30
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,530
There are suspicious noises
in our hallway.

31
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:42,769
Come check it out.

32
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,130
We're off duty.

33
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:46,010
Don't you have staff on duty?

34
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,769
Yan Fei?

35
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,530
Look at the state you're in.

36
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,530
No one would guess
you're Xingke's heiress.

37
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:47,570
Are you an alcoholic?

38
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,649
I've seen you drinking many times.

39
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,970
You usually seem so polished and mature.

40
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,130
How come you're so timid?

41
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,929
I am timid?

42
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:59,209
What if burglars break in?

43
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,489
The documents at Jun An

44
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:03,370
are all confidential.

45
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,169
Understood.

46
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:06,489
It's fine.

47
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,010
If there are intruders,
I'll protect you. I'm brave.

48
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,010
Didn't you submit your report?
It's almost midnight.

49
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,769
Why are you here?

50
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:16,969
What happened?

51
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:17,849
Mr. Zhou.

52
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,329
You're so kind

53
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,409
and righteous.

54
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,209
Don't pretend you didn't notice

55
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,730
I cheated and got outside help.

56
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,529
I promised I would never

57
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,649
rely on my family.

58
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,969
But today, I still asked my brother

59
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:35,409
and his friends for help.
So I don't want to go home.

60
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,329
I want to win.

61
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,089
My current ranking is low.

62
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,730
So I want to create

63
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,409
an irresistible proposal for Warm Nest.

64
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:46,449
Also,

65
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,649
I don't want Warm Nest to hold Jun An,

66
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,130
Jiang Chen, or you accountable.

67
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,730
I don't want you
and your girlfriend to break up.

68
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:54,922
- I want to help you.
- Help me?

69
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,329
Listen,

70
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:57,810
don't misunderstand.

71
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,050
It's just that I think

72
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,570
affectionate men aren't rare.

73
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,289
But devoted and principled

74
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:05,849
male lawyers like you

75
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:06,849
are exceptionally rare.

76
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,449
I just wanted

77
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:10,289
to protect endangered species.

78
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,209
I'm not as exceptional as you claim.

79
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,810
Yan Fei.

80
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,216
Thank you.

81
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,969
When you first joined Jun An,

82
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,289
I was biased toward you.

83
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,810
I was wrong.

84
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:27,490
Biased toward me?

85
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:28,610
Why?

86
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:31,610
Because my family kept calling the firm.

87
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,130
I was wrong.

88
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,289
After all, none of us can choose

89
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:38,089
our families.

90
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,370
You didn't choose

91
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,610
for your family
to be Jun An's biggest client.

92
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,089
But your family

93
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:44,490
loves you,

94
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,576
right?

95
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,529
Do you truly think so?

96
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,649
I assumed everyone wanted me

97
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,010
to quickly go through the motions

98
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,810
and leave.

99
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:53,370
Nonsense.

100
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,144
Okay.

101
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,690
I've confessed to you.

102
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,769
Report this to the senior lawyers.

103
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,930
I won't mind.

104
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:05,050
First of all,

105
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,849
you're drunk.

106
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,449
Your words aren't legally binding.

107
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,250
Second, trust Jun An's senior lawyers

108
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,209
to exercise sound judgment.

109
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:21,529
By the way,

110
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,529
shouldn't you be at dinner right now?

111
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,610
Why are you here?

112
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,010
You couldn't find her?

113
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,289
I found her.

114
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,649
That was

115
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,769
our final dinner together.

116
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,529
She said our time together was precious.

117
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,810
What is past is past.

118
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,400
She refused to stay together.

119
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,610
Want to drink?

120
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,170
It's funny.

121
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,490
I was dejected earlier.

122
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,649
But after you scared me,

123
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:18,170
I feel okay.

124
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,370
Happy weekend.

125
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,050
We take a weekend break.

126
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:47,821
(Are you okay?)

127
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:19,688
(Victim's family information)

128
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:34,089
(The financing idea
was indeed inspired by you.)

129
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:36,233
(But I did the concrete work.)

130
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,883
(Hope you won't be mad at me.)

131
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:38,985
(Thanks for the porridge.)

132
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,296
(Accept the transferred money.)

133
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,649
Can you handle it?

134
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,889
- Should I have your family get you?
- I'm almost home.

135
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:52,809
Keep your voice down.

136
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:53,970
Don't let my brother hear.

137
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,809
Thank you

138
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,610
for today.

139
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:02,289
Don't mention it.

140
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,529
Don't lose heart.

141
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,210
All the sad things will pass.

142
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:09,850
Tomorrow

143
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,289
will be a wonderful day.

144
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:13,850
Tomorrow?

145
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:16,040
What?

146
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:16,730
It's fine.

147
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,850
Be careful!

148
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,450
- Okay.
- Head back.

149
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,689
Bye! See you tomorrow.

150
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:33,649
Mr. Yan. He is Zhou Nian,

151
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,370
a fourth-year lawyer at Jun An,

152
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,809
also the mentor
for the Talent Hunt Program.

153
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,809
Another lawyer.

154
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:43,688
Yeah.

155
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,649
When Fei first joined Jun An,

156
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,090
I specifically called him.

157
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:50,370
He is quite clever.
He never presses Fei.

158
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:00,040
Drive.

159
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:27,809
Mr. Zhou, cheers! Drink up!

160
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,769
Yan Da, what's wrong with you?

161
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,409
How come you got so drunk?

162
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,049
Who did you drink with?

163
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:43,450
None of your business!

164
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,512
Hello?

165
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:03,569
That young lawyer...

166
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,689
Mr. Yan.

167
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:05,809
Should I talk with him?

168
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,649
Sure, do it first.

169
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:10,490
Check his background.

170
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:14,289
Even though Fei will leave Jun An soon,

171
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,330
she shouldn't associate
with questionable people.

172
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,850
Understood.

173
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,569
What's wrong?

174
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:37,529
What is it, Auntie?

175
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,769
My cousin is coming back?

176
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,130
Did you two argue again?

177
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:47,649
I don't care.

178
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,049
She's been abroad for years.

179
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:52,929
She never came back once.

180
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:55,970
She must've forgotten about me.

181
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,090
You are the same. You're ungrateful too.

182
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,130
Can't you understand your mom?

183
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,130
Was she wrong
to ask you to live with your dad?

184
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:07,169
She only cares about you.

185
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,889
You think she's after some money?

186
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:12,744
You think...

187
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,409
Forget it. I won't say more.

188
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,610
Mothers are often blamed,

189
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,409
regardless of what they do.

190
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,850
I know she has it hard.

191
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,970
So do you.

192
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,409
I understand.

193
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:35,850
Well,

194
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,610
you're more sensible than your cousin.

195
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,130
If only she were like you,

196
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,450
willing to come back
and build a life here.

197
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:46,330
How about

198
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,689
you talk to her sometime?

199
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,368
Okay.

200
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,637
(The points and rankings for this round
will be announced tomorrow morning.)

201
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:00,301
(All Talent Hunt Program candidates,)

202
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,664
(gather in the multi-function hall
at 2 PM.)

203
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:06,024
(From: Talent Hunt Program work group)

204
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:03,529
For this round,

205
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:04,649
you all performed well.

206
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:06,490
I know after spending some time

207
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,569
together, your team spirit soared.

208
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,289
I've also heard you get along well
outside work.

209
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,169
But this program is a competition.

210
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:14,344
Therefore,

211
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:16,330
scores and rankings still apply.

212
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,330
I'll now announce this round's scores.

213
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:23,409
In the 30-point tier,

214
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:25,289
two people.

215
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,130
Yan Fei.

216
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:28,490
Ren Jiatong.

217
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,689
In the 20-point tier, two people.

218
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,440
Guo Xiaoyu.

219
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:36,264
Huang Yue.

220
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,809
In the 10-point tier, one person.

221
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:43,112
Li Ke.

222
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,730
Jiang Chen.

223
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,409
The reason you scored zero this round

224
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,490
is clear to you, right?

225
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,632
Ms. Bai.

226
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:03,496
Mr. Zhou.

227
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,490
For this round,

228
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:05,352
Jiang Chen

229
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,289
and I are at the bottom.

230
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:08,040
Then...

231
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:10,569
Listen,

232
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,649
after discussions among the mentors,

233
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,610
the third-round assessment
has no eliminations.

234
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,289
Everyone performed well these two weeks.

235
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,049
You all advance to the next round.

236
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:36,392
Alright.

237
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,049
Only 20 minutes to celebrate.

238
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,090
Then go back to work immediately.

239
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,049
(Huang Yue: I'm staying this month.)
Though no one is eliminated this round,

240
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:44,649
the next round will have cuts.

241
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,769
(You withdrew a message.)
Two people might be eliminated.

242
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,529
Be mentally prepared.

243
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,850
Ms. Bai, you're scaring us again.

244
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,610
Sounds like I'm joking?

245
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:10,970
Awesome!

246
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,984
(Talent Hunt Program Candidates

This place

255
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,929
is perfect for group dinners.

256
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,688
What?

257
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,224
(Ren Jiatong: Feeling down
for being last?)

258
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,720
(Ren Jiatong: Smile,
and try harder next time.)

259
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,409
(Jiang Chen: It's no big deal.
I'll make up the points next time.)

260
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,529
If we still haven't decided

261
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:46,850
where to go by now,

262
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,929
we should just head home.

263
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:49,370
No.

264
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,024
Jiang Chen.

265
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:53,529
I'm good with anything.

266
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,490
I'll follow you.

267
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,649
Jiatong, and you?

268
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,720
(Jiang Chen: What do you say?
Joining them?)

269
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:01,490
I'm okay.

270
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,690
Murder mystery?

271
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,170
Karaoke?

272
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,776
Escape room?

273
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,529
What do you say?

274
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,650
A new one just opened

275
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,609
right next to our firm.

276
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,450
I've had it bookmarked for long.

277
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,329
(My older guy: Come home early tonight.)
Let me find it.

278
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,490
Yue, will you go to escape room?

279
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,776
Yes!

280
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:30,890
It's a big day.

281
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,809
We must celebrate.

282
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,170
Today, I'm determined

283
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:36,289
to have real fun with you.

284
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,650
Why does it

285
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,089
sound like a farewell speech?

286
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,369
Don't be emotional.

287
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,529
I promise if I find something fun,

288
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,769
you'll be the first I invite.

289
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,768
Deal.

290
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:49,960
Mr. Zhou,

291
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,529
are you free tonight?

292
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,650
How about you join us?

293
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,049
I'll pass.

294
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,289
I've been focusing on my health lately.

295
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,490
Since mentoring you all,

296
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,450
I've got butterflies

297
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:00,289
in my stomach.

298
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,809
Let's safeguard your health

299
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,450
together.

300
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,410
Fei, are you coming?

301
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,010
I'll pass.

302
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,930
Have fun.

303
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,210
I thought you loved escape rooms?

304
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,336
Congratulations.

305
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:39,609
On what?

306
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,730
On scraping second place

307
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,609
by using resources of my family

308
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:46,529
and professional investors?

309
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,089
- You care so much about rankings?
- Absolutely.

310
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:51,930
My scores aren't bad.

311
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,129
I'm excellent.

312
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,210
Why should I lose?

313
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:56,809
I always thought

314
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,609
people ignored my abilities

315
00:18:58,609 --> 00:18:59,976
because of my family background.

316
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,490
But at Jun An,

317
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,410
I've never ranked first.

318
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,210
Even my overall score now

319
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,450
is lower than Ren Jiatong's.

320
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:10,089
Relax.

321
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,529
A pretty girl like you

322
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,210
shouldn't obsess over rankings.

323
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:19,010
Mr. Zhou,

324
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,970
I'm not some little girl.

325
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,200
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:28,010
It's just that nowadays,

327
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:30,369
those with better options

328
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:34,049
don't need such a tough path.

329
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,289
But if this path

330
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,769
is truly your choice,

331
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,529
don't let minor setbacks discourage you

332
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,170
and make you quit early.

333
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,089
This industry shatters the fragile ones.

334
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,690
You look down on me too, don't you?

335
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:49,809
No, I don't.

336
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:52,809
As your mentor,

337
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:55,529
I think you're outstanding.

338
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,490
You've put in genuine hard work.

339
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:00,648
You said you never worked overtime,

340
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,529
but the jobs

341
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,289
given to you

342
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,650
were done
by putting in extra hours after work.

343
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:09,992
So why would just the ranking
of one round make you question yourself?

344
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:12,552
With a good family background,

345
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,490
you can seek help from professionals.

346
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:16,450
Is that a bad thing?

347
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,536
No.

348
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,129
To become a top partner as a lawyer,

349
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,529
resource integration skills
are essential.

350
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,129
If I had those advantages,

351
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,369
to be serious,

352
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:29,529
I'd often ask for help.

353
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,329
Did you recently

354
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:35,089
take some management training courses?

355
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,010
The carrot and stick approach

356
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,049
is outdated, isn't it?

357
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:40,650
Outdated?

358
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,849
Does it work?

359
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,096
Thanks.

360
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,289
However,

361
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:52,609
there's still a crucial issue.

362
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:55,289
Ask yourself.

363
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:57,129
Why did you

364
00:20:58,369 --> 00:20:59,369
join Jun An?

365
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,529
For better rankings?

366
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:05,289
To defy your brother?

367
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,609
Or something else?

368
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,569
Have you truly wanted to be a lawyer?

369
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:15,930
If you can't find an answer to this,

370
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,129
it'll be hard for you to stay here.

371
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:47,210
The escape room you picked
is horror-themed.

372
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,250
Non-player characters
will appear anytime.

373
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,329
There are solo missions during the game.

374
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,690
If anything happens, signal
the camera immediately.

375
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:57,490
Horror-themed?

376
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:00,104
We booked too late.
It was the only option left.

377
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:03,089
Before starting,

378
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,849
can we check the fire safety equipment
and the emergency exits,

379
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:07,690
and eliminate other safety hazards?

380
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,210
Is this

381
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,730
the liability waiver we'll sign later?

382
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,329
If I suggest revisions,

383
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:15,089
will it be fine?

384
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:18,089
Now, I understand

385
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:20,168
why service industries
dislike serving lawyers.

386
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,529
Though I studied law,

387
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:22,769
I understand.

388
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,849
This protects both parties.

389
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:26,450
As the staff mentioned,

390
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,289
non-player characters
will appear anytime.

391
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,089
If any accident occurred,

392
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:31,010
posing a danger,

393
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,289
who would be to blame?

394
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,210
Jiang Chen, are you rambling

395
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,250
because you're scared?

396
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:36,410
Of course not.

397
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,129
I'm a staunch materialist.

398
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:40,049
Supernatural stuff doesn't frighten me.

399
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,450
Then you lead the way.

400
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:43,176
No way.

401
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,569
There's a combination lock.

402
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,089
Shouldn't we

403
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:18,529
find clues in this room

404
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:19,809
to crack this 4-digit code?

405
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,129
Then we can get out.

406
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,089
Who painted this?

407
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:28,210
Any clues?

408
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:29,129
It's Durer.

409
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:33,089
Good.

410
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,930
You two are all-round students.

411
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,970
I don't know about art.

412
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,329
But I know this copyright case.

413
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:42,609
His signature was unique.

414
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:43,208
Look,

415
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,930
he combined his initials

416
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,849
into this monogram.

417
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:47,849
It attracted many imitators,

418
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,369
so he sued them in court

419
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:50,609
to protect his copyright.

420
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,072
No one dared to imitate again.

421
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,809
You knew this too?

422
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,129
I saw the original in New York once.

423
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,609
It left a deep impression.

424
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,170
Impressive.

425
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,529
This painting seems incomplete.

426
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,410
What are you doing here?

427
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,250
I got scared.

428
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,849
This is the Relics Management Office.

429
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,210
Everyone,

430
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,970
you all look like smart people.

431
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,120
Come on,

432
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,450
let's play a game.

433
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:26,849
You've got three minutes.

434
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:29,529
If you can't get out of here,

435
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,730
then you'll stay here forever.

436
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:34,250
No way!

437
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:35,609
We compete at the law firm.

438
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,609
We'll do it again at an escape room?

439
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,569
He said
it was a horror-themed escape room,

440
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:41,250
but never said
anyone would get eliminated.

441
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,529
So I totally wasted my money!

442
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,569
Two and a half minutes left!
Find the clues!

443
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,210
One part of the code should be 34.

444
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,450
Look at this four-by-four grid.

445
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,809
Aren't two numbers missing?

446
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,250
I just calculated.

447
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,250
Every row and column,

448
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,089
including the diagonals,
all add up to 34.

449
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,809
So we need to find two numbers

450
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,609
that meet these conditions to fill in.

451
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:00,129
Exactly.

452
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,170
The two empty spaces are...

453
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:04,010
15 and 14.

454
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,049
That matches the year
the painting was created.

455
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:07,690
But the sum is 34.

456
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:09,809
So it's a magic square.

457
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,170
If you're both so good at math,

458
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,369
why did you study law?

459
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,569
Focus on finding clues!

460
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,329
One minute left!

461
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,250
Could it be 42?

462
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,010
Look at this.

463
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,129
Isn't it like the treasure map
from The Deer and the Cauldron,

464
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:28,328
Sutra of Forty-two Chapters?

465
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,529
Count to see if there are 42 pieces.

466
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:32,010
That's such a stretch!

467
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,490
We're almost out of time!

468
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:36,450
It is 42.

469
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:39,080
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

470
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,970
The ultimate answer
to life, the universe,

471
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,170
and everything is 42!

472
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,569
Ten seconds left!

473
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:05,672
Quick!

474
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,369
Wait for me!

475
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,170
Wait for me!

476
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,112
Wait up!

477
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,289
Stop!

478
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:13,890
Listen,

479
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,049
your business

480
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,410
has a safety obligation.

481
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:17,369
You're professional,

482
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:18,369
but stop scaring me.

483
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,129
If you do it again,

484
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,089
and anything happens,

485
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:24,210
you'll be liable for compensation.

486
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:09,170
Again!

487
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:10,890
It's you again!

488
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,849
You move pretty quickly.

489
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,329
Don't take advantage of me.

490
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:50,210
Why are you here?

491
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:53,529
What do you think?

492
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,809
Unlock me!

493
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,650
It's fine.

494
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,490
Don't be scared.

495
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,336
Relax.

496
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,296
It's fake!

497
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,089
Are you guys okay?

498
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:26,410
- I-I'm handcuffed!
- Let me go!

499
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:27,129
I'm handcuffed.

500
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:29,369
Let go!

501
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:30,250
I can't.

502
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:35,624
Try this.

503
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:36,369
Yeah!

504
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:37,289
From below!

505
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:37,896
Well,

506
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,890
I really can't get out right now.

507
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,809
Move your hand like this.

508
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,529
No, yes! Right from the inside!

509
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,170
What are you doing?

510
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,289
Are they showing PDA?

511
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:06,730
So,

512
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:07,970
let's go eat?

513
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:11,730
I should head back.

514
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,369
Got some work to finish.

515
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,490
- I'll never come again!
- I've got stuff too.

516
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:15,656
I'll go get changed.

517
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,450
- Never come again!
- Everyone's busy, huh?

518
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,609
I'll never come again.

519
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,690
Never again.

520
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:22,450
Never.

521
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:23,240
Xiaoyu.

522
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:24,849
Don't rush off later.

523
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:25,928
I'll buy you dinner.

524
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,170
Pick expensive food.

525
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:29,369
Did you strike gold?

526
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:30,930
Are you coming or not?

527
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:33,049
Sure, why not?

528
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:34,890
I don't want to go home anyway.

529
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,369
What's wrong?

530
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:39,490
Go get changed.

531
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,609
I'll take you somewhere.

532
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:48,809
This is the expensive restaurant
you recommend?

533
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:50,529
Yeah, of course it is.

534
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:51,809
Every time I come to see it,

535
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,369
I must bring food and drinks.

536
00:29:53,569 --> 00:29:55,010
And now the treats it eats

537
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,529
cost more than my regular meals.

538
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,690
Come feel it.

539
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,129
It's so soft, cuddly, and well-behaved.

540
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:04,129
It's adorable.

541
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:06,289
Let's eat right here.

542
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:09,089
Little puppy,

543
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:10,129
go ahead and eat.

544
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,930
There's something I need to tell you.

545
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,170
Oh god, this kind of opening

546
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,569
usually means bad news.

547
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:19,010
Don't be nervous.

548
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,250
This is actually good news.

549
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,930
At least, I think it's good.

550
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,529
Definitely not bad news anyway.

551
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,450
What is it really?

552
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,089
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

553
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:28,890
No, we've been good lately.

554
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:30,849
Actually,

555
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:32,690
though we used to fight constantly

556
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:33,960
and even broke up once,

557
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,089
I can still feel

558
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:36,369
he's always cared about me.

559
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:37,650
He's helped me so much too.

560
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,250
Isn't that great?

561
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,329
That does sound positive.

562
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:44,730
But something bothers me.

563
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:47,250
Like, he always says

564
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:50,049
that even after working at Jun An
for seven or eight years,

565
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,369
I'd only become

566
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,890
a slightly better-paid employee.

567
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,650
He says my annual salary won't

568
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,809
match his small project's earnings.

569
00:30:57,129 --> 00:30:57,809
I think

570
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,450
while we're financially unequal now,

571
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,250
I'm still working hard.

572
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,049
He insists

573
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,129
I should focus my energy on him

574
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,010
and be more attentive.

575
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,049
He even says that after I marry him,

576
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:11,210
I'll have to quit my job

577
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,730
and focus entirely on our home.

578
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,410
Otherwise, with both busy,

579
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:17,529
having kids would be impossible.

580
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,529
Why do guys always think like this?

581
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,809
No matter what they earn,

582
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,089
they ask women

583
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,609
to quit jobs to focus on family.

584
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,529
They never consider

585
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:27,890
how insecure that makes us feel.

586
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,890
If feelings change someday,

587
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,289
they keep money and careers,

588
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,328
but what do we have?

589
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,490
Only a child!

590
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:34,289
That's unfair!

591
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:37,529
Yet I agreed.

592
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,849
Because he proposed last night.

593
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,250
After all our time together,

594
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,056
that was his first mention of marriage.

595
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,170
I honestly thought

596
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,450
he'd never remarry in his lifetime.

597
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,410
So his decision for me

598
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:54,930
really surprised me.

599
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,369
So,

600
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:57,089
what about Jun An?

601
00:31:57,369 --> 00:31:58,609
You'd give up this job?

602
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,369
I'm thrilled
about making the next round.

603
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,010
I really want to stay at Jun An.

604
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:06,010
But marrying him

605
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,049
is a long-held dream.

606
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:09,490
I want to try it.

607
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,450
I admit it's partly vanity,

608
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,329
but is vanity always wrong?

609
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,690
I don't steal, just work honestly.

610
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,129
I marry the one I love

611
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,650
with a clear conscience.

612
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:21,960
Right?

613
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,809
Since you've thought it through,

614
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:27,930
what else can I say?

615
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:32,369
You're the only one I've told.

616
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,170
I need your blessing, Xiaoyu.

617
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:36,569
Among our group,

618
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:38,369
only you and I are in relationships.

619
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,129
You understand me, right?

620
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:49,730
I wish you happiness.

621
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:52,329
I hope you'll be happy.

622
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,569
Is everyone here?

623
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:07,730
Working on the Warm Nest case,

624
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,809
none of us slept well.

625
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:11,049
But no one's late on a weekend?

626
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,450
We wouldn't dare.

627
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:13,930
Have some water.

628
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,129
The community legal outreach

629
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:19,089
is a good thing.

630
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:21,210
We're definitely eager to get ahead.

631
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,289
Also, during my graduate studies,

632
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:24,010
I'd heard

633
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,089
that you nearly did pro bono work
every month

634
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:28,089
during your internship at the firm.

635
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:29,730
Strong leaders have no weak teams.

636
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,410
We must follow your example.

637
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,650
Come on. Head back now.

638
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,529
Don't flatter me.

639
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,010
I've been there.

640
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,609
I know exactly what's on your minds.

641
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,490
Wanting to earn more points is fine.

642
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,769
But remember this.

643
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,930
Legal consultation
is a long-standing tradition.

644
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,490
It started back with Mr. Zhuang.

645
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,250
Ms. Bai and Mr. Song participated.

646
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,970
So treat this seriously.

647
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,690
Don't tarnish Jun An's reputation.

648
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:51,609
Therefore,

649
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,210
give it your proper attention.

650
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,410
Never brush off anyone

651
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,650
who seeks your advice.

652
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:57,010
Don't worry.

653
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,129
I've got experience.

654
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,010
Our university did legal outreach

655
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,210
at middle schools before.

656
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:01,992
It was successful.

657
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:03,569
I even received

658
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:05,512
the Most Approachable Award.

659
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,209
If there are no other questions,

660
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,810
let's depart at 9:00 AM.

661
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,330
Okay.

662
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:11,976
Got it.

663
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,080
(Guo Xiaoyu: Jiang Chen, Ren Jiatong,
you two did pro bono work.)

664
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,040
(Do you have any experience to share?)
(From: Talent Hunt Program Group)

665
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,256
(Huang Yue:
I'd like to ask for advice too.)

666
00:34:45,256 --> 00:34:46,184
(Li Ke: Please share your insights.)

667
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,016
(Jiang Chen: We'll talk later.)

668
00:34:47,016 --> 00:34:48,232
(Ren Jiatong: We'll talk later.)

669
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:50,370
Yan Da.

670
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,729
Yan Da.

671
00:34:57,569 --> 00:34:58,850
This outfit is quite cute.

672
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:01,064
It reminds me of you as a child.

673
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,649
But you were chubbier back then.

674
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,249
Now, you're too thin.

675
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,850
Why didn't I know

676
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,770
about our firm's

677
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,810
pro bono work?

678
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,890
Why did you meddle?

679
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:16,410
You were so drunk last night.

680
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:18,689
Can't you just rest at home?

681
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,209
Can you stop controlling me?

682
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:22,888
Fei.

683
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:24,649
You want

684
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:25,930
to prove yourself.

685
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:27,609
I understand that.

686
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,664
But as a child of the Yan family,

687
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,169
you don't need to work that hard.

688
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,689
I've already spoken to your leader.

689
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,330
You mean Mr. Zhuang?

690
00:35:40,249 --> 00:35:41,450
Or one of the senior partners?

691
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,970
I just don't get it.

692
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:46,370
What's so great about being a lawyer?

693
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:48,089
Working like a dog every day.

694
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:49,410
Forcing smiles

695
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:51,249
in front of difficult clients.

696
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:53,850
Top two Red Circle Firms?

697
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,729
It's still just the service industry.

698
00:35:58,129 --> 00:35:59,649
Why be the service provider

699
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:01,330
when you could be the client?

700
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,089
Yes, Mr. Yan.

701
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:05,770
Being the client has made you

702
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,410
feel entitled to parent me, hasn't it?

703
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,552
Fei.

704
00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:09,649
I know you.

705
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:11,649
You rarely ask for my help.

706
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,089
But this time,

707
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,649
you asked me to secure Eddie's funding
for Warm Nest.

708
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:18,810
I don't care

709
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,089
to know what happened.

710
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:21,890
But I won't tolerate anyone

711
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,850
exploiting my sister's kindness

712
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:25,370
and our family's resources

713
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:26,689
to realize their own goal.

714
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:29,089
So after this round,

715
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,129
leave Jun An

716
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,770
gracefully.

717
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,129
Yan Da, I'm telling you now.

718
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,930
I love defying you.

719
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,169
I never planned to stay long at Jun An.

720
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:44,370
But now,

721
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,689
I'm staying for sure.

722
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,129
(Jun An Law Carnival)
Thank you, you look lovely.

723
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,330
Bye-bye.

724
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,000
Bye-bye.

725
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,472
Fei.

726
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,810
Come on.

727
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,890
Why didn't you tell me?

728
00:37:07,912 --> 00:37:08,689
(Pro Bono Legal Aid)

729
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:09,320
Where are they?

730
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,850
What's with your outfit?

731
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,810
Jiang Chen and Ren Jiatong

732
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,169
are helping a madam move things.

733
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:15,850
Huang Yue and Li Ke
are playing with kids.

734
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:17,320
We just finished a legal play.

735
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:18,770
I wore this Hanfu

736
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,689
to draw more people over.

737
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,649
What are you talking about?

738
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:25,970
What's that about the legal play?

739
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,209
- The play is...
- Yan Fei

740
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:28,890
Help me.

741
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:30,810
See you later.

742
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:34,410
Come and look.

743
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:36,370
Jun An's free legal consultation.

744
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:37,410
Completely free.

745
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,729
The community sent some water.

746
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:48,729
As you can see, besides me...

747
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:49,576
Right?

748
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:50,248
I can't move.

749
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,850
Help me carry some.

750
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,450
Mr. Zhou.

751
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,689
Your acting could use some work.

752
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,169
You're pretending to be helpless
to give me a way out?

753
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,890
But these props are terrible.

754
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,890
I'll carry two cases later.

755
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:06,609
You came all this way.
You must be thirsty.

756
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:08,890
Since you know

757
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,649
I came all the way here,

758
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,410
why wasn't I included in this event?

759
00:38:12,649 --> 00:38:13,450
I did email you.

760
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:15,649
Right, and I replied to that email.

761
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,249
But you guys made a separate group.

762
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:18,330
I wasn't in that group.

763
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,529
May I ask why?

764
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:22,729
I made a mistake.

765
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:25,089
Since you're here,
let me brief you on the job.

766
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:26,729
Take a look.

767
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,609
Typically,

768
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:31,049
people who seek legal advice here

769
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,089
are mostly residents of this community.

770
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:34,729
Rarely major cases.

771
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,249
Just everyday domestic disputes.

772
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,249
Some trivial matters

773
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,169
you never met.

774
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:42,056
The money they've lost
might be less than your bag's worth.

775
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,330
But to them,

776
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,490
it could represent
half a lifetime of savings,

777
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,249
or their retirement fund,
even life-saving money.

778
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:50,689
You've been talking in circles

779
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,370
without badmouthing my brother

780
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:54,370
or trying to drive a wedge between us.

781
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,290
You're a good person.

782
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,609
After we drank together last time,

783
00:38:57,609 --> 00:38:59,010
I thought we'd become friends.

784
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,249
Turns out it was all one-sided.

785
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:03,490
You won't offend Xingke's CEO

786
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,450
to protect your legal career.

787
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,129
That's very lawyer-like. Very proper.

788
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,010
So today, just watch carefully

789
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:10,890
how well I handle this consultation.

790
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:32,010
It's gotten chubby.

791
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,010
Yeah, definitely.

792
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,450
It has a big stomach.

793
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,209
Seems even chubbier than last time.

794
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:39,290
Absolutely.

795
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,049
Looks nice.

796
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,490
It eats the noodles

797
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:44,850
that customers can't finish.

798
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:46,810
It became much chubbier.

799
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,930
I'm going to cook for you.

800
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:50,770
Thanks.

801
00:40:04,456 --> 00:40:05,649
Why are you here alone?

802
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:06,952
Where's Xiaoyu?

803
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:08,970
Xiaoyu met a girl

804
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,649
who's into Hanfu culture.

805
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,450
Got called away by her later.

806
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,290
That's all I know.

807
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,344
Acting all mysterious.

808
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,089
So I came by myself.

809
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,970
I want to eat noodles.

810
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,930
Noodles are ready!

811
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:21,608
Thank you.

812
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,049
Thanks.

813
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:24,649
Glad you like to eat them.

814
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:26,010
If you want,

815
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,609
just message me on WeChat.

816
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,810
I'll cook early.

817
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,490
Once you arrive,

818
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,609
you can eat then.

819
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,432
Thanks.

820
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:32,729
Enjoy your meal.

821
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,089
How did you know?

822
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:47,010
We've eaten together many times.

823
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,008
I know your preferences.

824
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:49,330
You put chili oil

825
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,609
in everything.

826
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,450
Same with coffee,
you only have Americanos, nothing else.

827
00:40:53,729 --> 00:40:54,728
Chugging cup after cup.

828
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,729
Actually,
spiciness gives you a sense of pain,

829
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:58,696
not a sense of taste.

830
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,249
Are you into strong flavors?

831
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:02,129
Or do you actually enjoy that pain?

832
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:04,370
You notice such small details.

833
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,770
If I didn't know you so well,

834
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,272
I'd think you had a crush on me.

835
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:15,240
What?

836
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,649
To be frank, bashful boys

837
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:20,529
are not popular now.

838
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:24,290
Why are you blushing?

839
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,450
Are you crushing on me?

840
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,609
I'm not blushing.

841
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,330
Did Guo Xiaoyu possess you?

842
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,089
Or have you

843
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:31,810
taken an interest in my hobby

844
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,609
of observing people?

845
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:34,664
Also,

846
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:36,529
usually, skilled hunters

847
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:38,049
disguise themselves as prey.

848
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:38,890
Watch yourself.

849
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,609
Are you saying you want to be my prey?

850
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:44,330
You're insane.

851
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,392
Water.

852
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:51,970
The other day,

853
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:54,010
I passed by your desk

854
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:56,129
and saw a file on your computer.

855
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:57,729
It wasn't a Jun An case.

856
00:41:58,689 --> 00:41:59,368
I'm telling you,

857
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:00,890
we're in a competition.

858
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:02,810
You have to focus.

859
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:06,490
That?

860
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,930
That's from an old friend of my dad's.

861
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,370
He helped our family.

862
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,129
He just needs some legal advice.

863
00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:13,010
I want to help.

864
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:15,729
Aren't you worried I'll tell on you?

865
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,920
If you wanted to,
you wouldn't have said all this.

866
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,569
Listen,

867
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,890
I'm not bringing this up as leverage

868
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,890
for the competition

869
00:42:26,529 --> 00:42:27,850
or to accuse you of anything.

870
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,529
We're competing now.

871
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:32,049
I need you to focus and give your all.

872
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,529
Your rival is right before you.

873
00:42:33,729 --> 00:42:35,410
Even though you give all of yourself,

874
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,129
I doubt you could beat me,

875
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,824
let alone when you're distracted.

876
00:42:39,129 --> 00:42:40,049
You underestimate me?

877
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,104
Fine.

878
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,169
Starting today,

879
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,129
I'll take you seriously.

880
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,209
Bitter girls

881
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:53,169
aren't popular either.

882
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,049
You're a quick learner.

883
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,529
Learn to take care of yourself.

884
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:58,410
Shut down your computer
when leaving your desk.

885
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,704
Don't get emotional.

886
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:03,569
I hate braised eggs.

887
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:14,344
(Noodles)

888
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,936
(The core value of the pro bono work.)

889
00:43:16,936 --> 00:43:18,216
(Answer: The pro bono work
aims to safeguard public interests)

890
00:43:18,216 --> 00:43:19,656
(and the rights of vulnerable groups.)

891
00:43:19,656 --> 00:43:21,416
(It involves nonprofit legal assistance
and activities provided by diverse entities.)

892
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:23,048
(Essentially, it redirects legal resources
toward the public interest,)

893
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:24,776
(filling the legal twilight gap unaddressed
by conventional legal services.)

894
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:26,536
(This embodies
crucial legal professional ethics.)

895
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:28,072
(It also serves as an indispensable mechanism
for a society governed by law.)
