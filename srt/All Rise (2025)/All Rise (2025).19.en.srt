There's a meeting soon?

Mr. Zhuang's.

30
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,141
You need this room?

31
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,381
No, no.

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,060
How's your injury?

33
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:17,620
It's healed up.

34
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,861
I came to bribe you.

35
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,261
Hey, watch your conduct.

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,940
Seems like someone's skating

37
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,141
close to the legal edge.

38
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:28,981
You're being partial.

39
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,541
You took Li Ke's coffee.

40
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,220
But mine? Suddenly, it's inappropriate?

41
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,900
Why's that?

42
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:35,821
I saw you

43
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,261
eating at lunch with Li Ke today.

44
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,940
Help your junior out and help me too?

45
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,900
Both Li Ke and Ren Jiatong
are on probation.

46
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,141
Someone's got to cover
Ms. Bai's workload.

47
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:46,981
Could I be the one?

48
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,180
Thank you.

49
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,381
Call it opportunistic if you want.

50
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,261
Or say I'm just hustling
for opportunities.

51
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,740
I don't really care
about others' opinions.

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,861
I just want this chance.

53
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:07,940
I'll take this.

54
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:08,904
Appreciate it.

55
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:11,261
But to be fair,

56
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:12,821
I can't help you.

57
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,821
Though I won't stop you

58
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,701
from emailing Ms. Bai

59
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,101
to fight for that shot, right?

60
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,381
Thank you.

61
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,101
Understood.

62
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,101
How's Ren Jiatong?

63
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:44,101
She was already asleep when I got back.

64
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,301
Let her get some rest.

65
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,180
She's tired.

66
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,421
I came for you, not her.

67
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:50,701
For me?

68
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,660
I just got off the phone with Li Ke.

69
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,660
He's not in great shape.

70
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:01,180
I ran into him earlier.

71
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,620
He smiled and said he was fine.

72
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:05,141
But I could see

73
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:06,541
he was really hurting inside.

74
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,660
This is about their future here.

75
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,740
Nobody would take this lightly.

76
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,660
So what do we do?

77
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
Help them find evidence.

78
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,941
"Help them"?

79
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:25,660
Hesitant?

80
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,701
To be honest,

81
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,448
yeah, I am.

82
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,021
I've been at the bottom this round.

83
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:40,581
I-I genuinely worry for them.

84
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,941
I see how upset they are.

85
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,501
Their pain weighs on me too.

86
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:45,621
But...

87
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,501
I can't help thinking,

88
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,821
what if this is my lucky break?

89
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,701
The thought crosses my mind.

90
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,340
Just maybe...

91
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,660
if one of them leaves,

92
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,900
could I make the cut then?

93
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:04,821
It is brave

94
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,780
for you

95
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,100
to confess that.

96
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,340
No matter how close we are,

97
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,821
this is still a competition.

98
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,141
Some win, some lose.

99
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:18,581
I've had similar thoughts myself.

100
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,100
I'm not brave enough to admit it.

101
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:21,576
It's fine.

102
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,860
Any inclination?

103
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,340
Want Ren Jiatong or Li Ke to stay?

104
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,980
No inclination.

105
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,501
No preset expectations either.

106
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,220
See, in the legal profession,

107
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:36,420
ambiguity is the worst.

108
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,821
So I won't accept anyone leaving

109
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,860
without clear justification.

110
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,141
Helping them is the least I can do.

111
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,100
Besides,

112
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:51,660
we should be responsible
for our clients.

113
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,181
Remember the Warm Nest case?

114
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,061
I was so principled

115
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,340
and wouldn't apologize.

116
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,501
But then it hit me.

117
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Who else do we serve but our clients?

118
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,304
Let's go.

119
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:09,061
Back to the firm to find the truth.

120
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,941
Let me ask my boyfriend for help.

121
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,741
Are you back with Zhubao?

122
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,381
I've only ever had one boyfriend,

123
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:19,381
Holmes.

124
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:20,008
AKA...

125
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:21,416
Sherlock.

126
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,021
So Ren Jiatong thought

127
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,980
she shredded the original document?

128
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:32,821
I think we should reconstruct

129
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:33,501
the scene first.

130
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,381
At that moment,

131
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:38,900
this evidence box was on this side
of the surveillance blind spot.

132
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,381
Ren Jiatong was standing
right here at the time.

133
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,581
Li Ke was here,

134
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,660
sorting through

135
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,980
the papers he was about to shred.

136
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,021
Between him and the evidence box

137
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,021
was Ren Jiatong.

138
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,021
Logically,

139
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,141
he couldn't easily

140
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,300
grab the original document.

141
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:53,860
But if Ren Jiatong
was here, she'd be farthest

142
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,941
from the shredder.

143
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,136
Right?

144
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:56,860
Yes.

145
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,540
But if Li Ke wanted
the original document,

146
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,141
he'd need to go

147
00:06:59,381 --> 00:06:59,941
to the back.

148
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,021
Correct.

149
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,780
So based on this explanation,

150
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:05,141
one person was close
to the box, easy to grab.

151
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,460
The other, near the shredder,
simple to destroy.

152
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,540
But positions alone
don't prove anything.

153
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:13,141
We don't know what else happened

154
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,381
in this blind spot.

155
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,100
Also,

156
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,581
was the original document in there?

157
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:27,660
I can brainstorm with you.

158
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,261
After all, I was there.

159
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,660
I want to find evidence
to clear my name.

160
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,104
Okay?

161
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:41,660
I'll stand where Ren Jiatong was.

162
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,860
You stand where you were.

163
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:43,701
- OK.
- Jiang Chen, observe.

164
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:44,780
Got it.

165
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,061
Anyway, Ren Jiatong was

166
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,741
getting the photocopied documents

167
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,900
ready for binding.

168
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,300
Meanwhile, I was dealing
with these waste files.

169
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:56,980
Where was the original document
she was binding?

170
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:58,021
To her right side.

171
00:07:58,941 --> 00:07:59,860
All our documents

172
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,780
were put together.

173
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,381
New and old.

174
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,501
All put together?

175
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,821
Is it possible

176
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,300
that the two documents got mixed up

177
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,381
and then discarded?

178
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:07,261
I don't think so.

179
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,100
Because we were

180
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,701
organized with the arrangement.

181
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:13,340
I'll keep going.

182
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,821
What if the document...?

183
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,181
It scared me.

184
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,381
Luckily, it's not open yet.

185
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:23,624
(Mr. Lin)

186
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:32,776
(Letter Regarding Demanding
Share Repurchase)

187
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
What if...

188
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,861
this document and...

189
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,232
Li Ke.

190
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:40,900
And then?

191
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:08,968
(Letter Regarding Demanding
Share Repurchase)

192
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
Then probably,

193
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:32,540
everything was placed roughly here.

194
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:37,820
As for the rest, I...

195
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:40,101
don't remember clearly.

196
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,420
Maybe you can help recall.

197
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,168
I...

198
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,381
I'm unwell. I need to use the restroom.

199
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,520
Sis.

200
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,780
I think I messed up.

201
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:13,900
I...

202
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,461
promised you I'd stay till the end.

203
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:18,940
But I'm exhausted now.

204
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,300
I can't hold on much longer.

205
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,341
What should I do?

206
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:44,232
Come in.

207
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,621
Ms. Bai.

208
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,580
Jiang Chen and Guo Xiaoyu
came to me earlier.

209
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,580
They reenacted

210
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,900
their theory about how the letter

211
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,021
went missing.

212
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,341
I think

213
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,981
I need to report this situation to you.

214
00:10:59,101 --> 00:10:59,861
Li Ke just left

215
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,621
my office five minutes ago.

216
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:03,780
Li Ke? What did he say?

217
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,240
Ms. Bai.

218
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:09,221
What I just told you

219
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:11,060
is exactly what happened.

220
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,700
I think

221
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,540
I need to take responsibility for this.

222
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:19,780
Please sit.

223
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:23,272
Sit down.

224
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:30,021
Li Ke.

225
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,700
I suggest

226
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:35,180
you wait until the review meeting.

227
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,981
Ms. Bai, I know you're worried

228
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,180
that I'll regret it.

229
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,900
But before coming to your office,

230
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,300
I've thought for a long time.

231
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:47,820
I was afraid.

232
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,741
Telling the truth

233
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,101
really requires courage.

234
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,660
I'm not that selfless.

235
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,180
But I...

236
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,461
I just got a call from my sister.

237
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,700
All along,

238
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,981
I thought getting

239
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:04,900
Jun An's offer

240
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,580
was my sister's greatest wish.

241
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,861
So I had to achieve it for her

242
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,861
to make her proud of me.

243
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,060
But she just told me

244
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,261
her biggest wish

245
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,900
is to hope

246
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,221
I live according to my own wishes.

247
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,060
Jun An isn't attractive to you,

248
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,700
is it?

249
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:27,080
It is.

250
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,861
I really like Jun An.

251
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,700
I like the people here too.

252
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:34,540
Although I haven't won much,

253
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,300
at least I've won before.

254
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:39,780
I'm confident. I'm not bad at this.

255
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:43,940
But liking something is one thing.

256
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,981
I truly don't know

257
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,981
if staying here as a lawyer

258
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:52,101
is what I really want for my future.

259
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,621
Also, I need

260
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,981
to apologize to you.

261
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:02,021
This is your case.

262
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:04,060
The missing demand letter

263
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,981
must have caused
you significant trouble.

264
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,780
You didn't say anything

265
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,060
because you didn't want to pressure us.

266
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,261
But I can't pretend to be unaware.

267
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
This is my job.

268
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
I've apologized
to the client and resolved it.

269
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:21,180
As the lead attorney,

270
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:23,501
I'm responsible for the client.

271
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:25,221
Precisely because it's your work,

272
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,180
I can't let you pay

273
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,420
for my mistake.

274
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,141
I'm responsible for this.

275
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,480
Ms. Bai.

276
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,261
My college mentor told me

277
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,341
that in actual law firm work,

278
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,820
it's truly harder for women
to get opportunities.

279
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,221
(Women reaching your position)

280
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:48,580
(must have given more
than male lawyers.)

281
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:52,300
(They say law schools have
many female students now.)

282
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:54,180
(But looking at law firms today,)

283
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,101
(female partners)

284
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,341
(are proportionally fewer than men.)

285
00:13:57,981 --> 00:13:58,981
(Are they incompetent?)

286
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,780
(No.)

287
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,381
(They're just in a harder position.)

288
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:05,580
(So I cannot)

289
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,180
(let you take the blame for my mistake.)

290
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:08,861
And I can't let Ren Jiatong,

291
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,381
who'll likely become

292
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,180
an outstanding female lawyer someday,

293
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:13,981
be held back

294
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:15,141
by what I did.

295
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,141
My mistake is my mistake.

296
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,060
I won't avoid it.

297
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:23,461
Although I don't know

298
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,060
what I'll enjoy doing in the future,

299
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
one thing I know for sure

300
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,621
is that I refuse
to become someone I hate.

301
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,341
Li Ke,

302
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,741
thank you for being honest
with me today.

303
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:01,021
Li Ke.

304
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,900
Why not make your final decision
after Mr. Song returns

305
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:05,261
for the review meeting?

306
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,141
Didn't we agree you'd just see me off?

307
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:09,420
We're worried

308
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,060
that it's an impulsive decision.

309
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:12,580
No need.

310
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:13,861
He's decided.

311
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,360
Mr. Zhou.

312
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,221
I know what you said to Ms. Bai.

313
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:19,528
Well done.

314
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:21,741
I'm not pretending to be noble

315
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,300
or sacrificial.

316
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,940
I am truly not.

317
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,621
Besides taking responsibility,

318
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,101
I'm honestly exhausted.

319
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,700
I don't know about you guys,

320
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:31,261
but these past months,

321
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:34,060
my hair's been thinning from stress.

322
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,660
And I'm so tired

323
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:36,981
that I've gained weight.

324
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:37,700
Fatigue bloat.

325
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:39,060
My pants are getting tight.

326
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,501
When I first came,

327
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:41,580
I loved socializing.

328
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,741
Now, I'm so drained

329
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:44,180
that I don't want to talk.

330
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

331
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,300
Perhaps this is fate.

332
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,741
Without your words,

333
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,501
I wouldn't know whether this was my wish

334
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:53,381
or my sister's.

335
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,461
Take care then.

336
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,060
I'm leaving.

337
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,456
Li Ke.

338
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,501
Whatever you do next,

339
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,780
I'm here if you need help.

340
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,056
Absolutely.

341
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:11,741
You are my own senior.

342
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:16,840
Go for it.

343
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:20,141
Keep fighting.

344
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:36,900
Li Ke.

345
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,381
You came specifically to see me off?

346
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,060
You can't leave like this.

347
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,501
We haven't clarified it yet.

348
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,101
I thought you'd be happy about staying.

349
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:51,501
Of course I want to stay.

350
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:52,900
But not like this.

351
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,700
I drank that night.

352
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,741
I can't recall where I put
the demand letter.

353
00:16:58,221 --> 00:16:59,540
So I'm partly responsible too.

354
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,300
Don't go easy on me.

355
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,021
I'm not going easy on you.

356
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:04,380
I'm not that noble.

357
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,860
Then why?

358
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:08,140
Because I genuinely
remembered what happened.

359
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:10,780
I was very hesitant

360
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:11,981
about speaking up.

361
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,540
I'm only human.

362
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,421
I'm selfish too.

363
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:15,901
It'd be a secret if unsaid.

364
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,981
But we law students

365
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,140
have a duty to the truth, don't we?

366
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,820
Honestly, I've been exhausted lately.

367
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,221
This situation

368
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,540
gives me a dignified way out.

369
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:28,701
That's fine.

370
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:32,221
It's been two months since we met.

371
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,941
Maybe we never became friends.

372
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,181
But I'll remember
what you said that day.

373
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,661
I know you meant every word.

374
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,380
I was wrong.

375
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,780
Not just us.

376
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,300
Others want to stay too.

377
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:47,741
Each has their reasons.

378
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:49,981
I was just too afraid of losing

379
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,380
and never considered how they felt.

380
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,540
Like Yan Fei.

381
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:55,860
She needs to prove
herself to her family.

382
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,620
Jiang Chen wants
to escape his father's shadow.

383
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:01,021
Guo Xiaoyu's ex-boyfriend has made her

384
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:02,580
determined to make her mark in Beijing.

385
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:03,701
Then Huang Yue.

386
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,140
Before her marriage,

387
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,620
she's searching for purpose.

388
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,300
Let alone you.

389
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:10,540
Only me.

390
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:14,181
I alone didn't know what I truly wanted.

391
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:16,461
My earlier competitiveness

392
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,181
was just to let my sister see me win,

393
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,300
so she'd be proud.

394
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,820
I didn't want her to think

395
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,300
her years of investing in me

396
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,620
meant nothing

397
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,140
or that her own brother

398
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,181
wasn't good enough

399
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,540
and finally let her down.

400
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,221
Anyway,

401
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,580
we've come far together.

402
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,952
Li Ke.

403
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:37,461
Are you sure?

404
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:38,661
Really leaving?

405
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,421
I'm a bit luckier than you.

406
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:42,461
Ren Jiatong.

407
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:44,701
Most of the time,

408
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:46,300
many things

409
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,060
aren't what we'd choose,

410
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:49,820
but given by our families.

411
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,540
So I think,

412
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:53,741
don't shoulder family matters

413
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,340
as your personal burden.

414
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:02,380
I... Don't be nervous.

415
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:05,221
Just sharing my perspective casually.

416
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:06,181
I'll leave.

417
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:07,560
Li Ke.

418
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,380
Whether you practice law or not,

419
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:13,860
I can see

420
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,741
you genuinely love this profession.

421
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,501
Thank you.

422
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:30,741
I remember my first day at Jun An.

423
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,021
You were the first one I met.

424
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,181
Now, on my last day at Jun An,

425
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,421
you're the last to see me off.

426
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:41,256
Good.

427
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,461
Your future is bright.

428
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:54,901
Till we meet again.

429
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:19,540
The email came.

430
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,400
(Fifth Round Results)

431
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,168
(Dear interns: The fifth round is over.)

432
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:25,032
(Many thanks for your dedication.)

433
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:26,012
(Scoreboard of the Fifth Round)

434
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:27,240
(Eliminated: Wang Lu)

435
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,104
(Eliminated: Huang Yue)

436
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:29,096
(Eliminated: Li Ke)

437
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:30,056
(1st Place: Jiang Chen,
Total Points: 125)

438
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:31,016
(1st Place: Ren Jiatong,
Total Points: 125)

439
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:31,816
(2nd Place: Yan Fei, Total Points: 120)

440
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:32,808
(3rd Place: Guo Xiaoyu,
Total Points: 110)

441
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,520
Everyone.

442
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,981
The fifth round

443
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,421
ends today.

444
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:41,981
Li Ke is eliminated.

445
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,140
So in the email,

446
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,741
only the four of you received rankings.

447
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,580
Two-thirds of the match have passed.

448
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:48,380
Next, two more will be eliminated

449
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:49,540
among you.

450
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:51,688
Keep fighting.

451
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,661
Mr. Zhou.

452
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:55,701
So...

453
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,300
Now that Li Ke is gone,

454
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,100
do you need help with his workload?

455
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,160
Okay.

456
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,300
Mr. Zhou, should we pick a new partner

457
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,140
for Ms. Bai's trip?

458
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:05,820
I discussed it with Ms. Bai.

459
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,340
The results will be sent to you.

460
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,820
Ms. Bai, I also emailed you

461
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,221
to apply for the business trip.

462
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,261
But you ultimately chose Ren Jiatong.

463
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,620
May I ask why?

464
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,181
I'm just wondering.

465
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:29,261
Do you consider me inferior to her?

466
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,181
You're this round's top performer.

467
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:32,780
Is that answer important to you?

468
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,736
Yes.

469
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,820
But opportunities matter more to me.

470
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:38,421
Without delaying work progress,

471
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,501
I still want this assignment with you.

472
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,060
And more opportunities later.

473
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,981
Moreover, I've always believed

474
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:45,221
among our group,

475
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,021
I possess every skill they have

476
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:49,060
and additional skills they lack.

477
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,661
Like what?

478
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,780
For example,
I can bring new possibilities

479
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,981
to Jun An's business.

480
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:57,501
So you're here to keep
promoting yourself?

481
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,440
Yes.

482
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,461
I love boxing.

483
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:01,701
Someone once told me

484
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,261
the most compelling aspect of boxing is

485
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:05,780
that unless the boxer gives up,

486
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,100
even at the final moment,

487
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,701
they still can fight for victory.

488
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:10,501
When I first joined Jun An,

489
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:11,820
maybe I wasn't that proactive.

490
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:13,221
But I now understand

491
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,741
great lawyers need competitive drive.

492
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,501
Well, it's not the final round yet.

493
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,720
Ms. Bai.

494
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,421
Do I have a chance?

495
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,421
Excellent.

496
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,701
Few people barge into my office

497
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,620
and demand opportunities this way.

498
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,221
I admire boldness.

499
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,340
But this case involves

500
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,100
a heavy workload.

501
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,140
And tight deadlines.

502
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,981
Ren Jiatong is more familiar

503
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,100
with our team's operations.

504
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,741
So my decision stands.

505
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:46,120
I understand.

506
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:47,300
I'll head out.

507
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:50,060
Don't be upset.

508
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,501
I see your potential.

509
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,380
Remember what you just told me.

510
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,340
Be a great boxer.

511
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:57,800
Keep pushing.

512
00:22:59,021 --> 00:22:59,580
Thank you.

513
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:17,832
Yan Fei.

514
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,380
How do you know I'm here?

515
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,741
When you're upset,

516
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:27,540
you like sitting in the car for a while.

517
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,580
I've seen it before.

518
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,661
What's up?

519
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:34,701
I have a feeling.

520
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,461
You may want to hit
the boxing gym today.

521
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,540
Can I come too?

522
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,461
My resume hides an unusual skill.

523
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,300
Number one punching bag
in Daxing District, Beijing.

524
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,100
Master Zhou,
your prediction missed today.

525
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm not going to the gym.

526
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:49,981
Whatever, just take me with you.

527
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,461
It's rush hour.

528
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:53,896
Alright.

529
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:55,860
But one condition.

530
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:56,820
No comforting me.

531
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:57,928
No comfort.

532
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,701
The stars here are stunning.

533
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,580
You practically drove me back

534
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,021
to the suburbs where I grew up.

535
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,300
I gotta show you something

536
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,501
you can't see in the CBD.

537
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,661
Your childhood was quite charmed.

538
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:36,981
Now, they are not

539
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,181
as beautiful as I remember.

540
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,380
But these stars in my heart

541
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,421
will never fade.

542
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:43,624
See that one?

543
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,060
The brightest one.

544
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,181
That's Venus.

545
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:48,380
In my childhood astronomy club,

546
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,501
my teacher said

547
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:52,060
Venus was the goddess

548
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:53,461
of love and beauty.

549
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,261
However dark the night,

550
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,221
with love and beauty in your eyes,

551
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,461
you could always see
Venus by looking up.

552
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,941
I was impressed.

553
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,701
So whenever life gets hard,

554
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:04,820
I come up here

555
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:05,860
and watch them.

556
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,421
Very Kantian,

557
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,221
very therapeutic.

558
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:12,300
But this isn't about Venus.

559
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,941
What are you trying to say to me?

560
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,261
As we agreed today,

561
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:15,860
no comforting.

562
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,221
I'm not comforting you.

563
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:18,820
This isn't a foul.

564
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,580
Who is the Kant you mentioned?

565
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,181
Our colleague?

566
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,461
Making me laugh is a foul.

567
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:26,696
No teasing then.

568
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,300
Ms. Bai praised me today.

569
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:35,300
But it was that formal, textbook praise,

570
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:37,860
which makes me feel

571
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,860
it's only because of
my family connections.

572
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:41,501
Even Ms. Bai

573
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,181
keeps handling me

574
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,021
with kid gloves

575
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,421
and avoids crossing me.

576
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:49,000
She's scolded Ren Jiatong.

577
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:50,701
She'd never do that to me.

578
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:53,701
Because for clever people like Ms. Bai,

579
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:55,060
extra courtesy

580
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:56,741
means you're kept at a distance.

581
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:01,981
You either feel looked down on

582
00:26:01,981 --> 00:26:03,661
or excessively coddled.

583
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,221
Do others fixate more
on your background,

584
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:08,021
or do you fixate more on it yourself?

585
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,021
I can't just ignore it.

586
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:14,340
Actually, I've long since realized

587
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,100
I'm like a game character

588
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,860
following preset algorithms,

589
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,820
where every step has to unfold

590
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,901
with rigid precision.

591
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,060
When I was a kid, whatever happened,

592
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,181
my parents would say,

593
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:27,901
"That's not for a girl

594
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,701
to worry about."

595
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,421
I couldn't learn

596
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:33,380
rough sports like soccer or basketball.

597
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,860
Only ballet was deemed suitable.

598
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,941
Then growing up?

599
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:39,741
Studying abroad meant finance, business,

600
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:40,620
or law.

601
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,340
Then gilding my resume
at Red Circle Firms

602
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:46,221
before getting nepotically hired

603
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:47,780
as our family company's Legal Director.

604
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,741
Then marrying some family friend's son,

605
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,981
popping out perfect kids

606
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:54,860
whose lives follow

607
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,780
this same rigid script.

608
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,140
I can't even complain about it.

609
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:00,981
Because people would say,

610
00:27:00,981 --> 00:27:02,261
"She's so dramatic."

611
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:04,661
Don't deny it.

612
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,140
You think it too.

613
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:09,620
But I really want to be a great lawyer.

614
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,661
What I see

615
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:14,981
is you getting closer to becoming one.

616
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:16,181
You told me,

617
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:17,860
"Since Ren Jiatong
and Li Ke are pending,

618
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:18,620
I'll step up."

619
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,181
Then you told Ms. Bai

620
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,140
you bring unique advantages others lack.

621
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:24,380
That shows you've fully grasped

622
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,421
what makes you formidable

623
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,340
and wielded it strategically.

624
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:30,060
That's exactly

625
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,100
what excellent lawyers do.

626
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,620
This isn't flattery.

627
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,981
You really have good taste.

628
00:27:36,741 --> 00:27:37,860
Ms. Bai isn't placating you.

629
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:40,661
She's the case lead.

630
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,421
Her staffing choice

631
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:44,140
isn't about raw talent.

632
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:46,221
It's about tactical efficiency

633
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:49,021
during this critical window.

634
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:51,741
I know the theory.

635
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:52,461
But I still...

636
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:53,192
Resentment?

637
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:55,340
Your current struggle proves

638
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,461
how well your family

639
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:58,221
has shielded you.

640
00:27:58,901 --> 00:27:59,528
Yan Fei.

641
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:00,901
If you trust me,

642
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:03,580
and you want to be a good lawyer now,

643
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:04,860
what you need to do

644
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,021
is certainly not to question
how others see you,

645
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,100
but to learn how to deal with

646
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,741
times when things don't go your way.

647
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:11,880
Like...

648
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,540
when a case isn't going well,

649
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,421
or when you need

650
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:17,860
to find a way to calm
the upset client and gain their trust.

651
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,820
When effort outweighs return,

652
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,421
or when the value of life
and your sense of justice

653
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:23,340
aren't fulfilled.

654
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,780
When you're too busy

655
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,941
and your family resents it.

656
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:27,060
Just too many situations.

657
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,261
Learn to deal with these moments,

658
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:31,580
and you'll truly understand

659
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,140
the toughest parts of being a lawyer

660
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:34,344
and how to get

661
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,421
one step closer to being a good lawyer.

662
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:40,221
I promise

663
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:42,312
when I'm back,

664
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,661
I'll be sure

665
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:45,941
to share with you all the experiences

666
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,741
about the trial.

667
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,536
Mr. Zhou,

668
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,421
you've been so kind to me.

669
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,620
Do you like me?

670
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:08,776
I...

671
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:13,021
Well, of course, I like you.

672
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,060
But it's the same
as how I feel about Li Ke,

673
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,221
Guo Xiaoyu, Jiang Chen, and the others.

674
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,780
I-I know you're very responsible

675
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,580
and reliable,

676
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,421
but the things you've done for me

677
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:31,780
have surely gone
beyond what a mentor should do.

678
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,461
Maybe it's because when I see you all,

679
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,100
it's like seeing my old self.

680
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,021
When I made mistakes,
felt lost and down,

681
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,780
I wanted someone to encourage me.

682
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,021
So my kindness

683
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,100
to you is my way
of making up for that old me.

684
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,501
Have you been studying
psychology recently?

685
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,421
It's late.

686
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:04,540
Go home early.

687
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:06,261
My home is nearby.

688
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:06,941
I'll go myself.

689
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,461
I'll drive you home.

690
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,300
No, no, no need.

691
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,820
I was just saying it casually.

692
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,580
You don't have to.

693
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,340
I just want to walk and watch the stars.

694
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:15,540
Are you running away?

695
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,181
I'm not.

696
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:19,340
Making me laugh is a foul.

697
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,181
I'm not doing that.

698
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:21,576
Drive safely.

699
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:02,024
(Guo Xiaoyu typing: Mr. Song.)

700
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:08,489
(Mentor, emergency backup needed.)

701
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:11,237
(Could you send some work my way?)

702
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,312
(Urgent research case. Who's in?)

703
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:23,484
(Me, me.)

704
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,513
(It's for Yiaiwan.)

705
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:40,901
Hello, Mr. Song.

706
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,421
Xiaoyu, it's like this.

707
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,941
The project I just mentioned

708
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,620
is about an AI model

709
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,580
Yiaiwan is developing.

710
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,981
Their legal department

711
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:51,421
wants us to help avoid legal risks

712
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:52,741
in the user agreement.

713
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:54,181
I understand you.

714
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,221
You want more points,

715
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,140
but you seem to lack
the experience in this area...

716
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:00,620
Mr. Song, I understand.

717
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,701
I don't have that much legal experience,

718
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,741
but I'm from Hangzhou,

719
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:07,021
and I recently visited
Yiaiwan's headquarters.

720
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,501
I feel like I might

721
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:09,901
understand the company a bit better

722
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:11,981
than my peers.

723
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,620
Plus, I heard from Zhubao...

724
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,620
Zhu Zhisheng mentioned

725
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,100
he wrote code for this model.

726
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:17,941
So,

727
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:20,100
I might have a better understanding

728
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,380
of its basic logic.

729
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:22,421
Also,

730
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:23,340
in the past,

731
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:25,181
during graphic and video production,

732
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:26,461
I used many kinds

733
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:27,181
of AI software.

734
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,820
Mr. Song,

735
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,501
I really want this opportunity.

736
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,780
I want to earn points for myself.

737
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,860
I don't want to be last again.

738
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,384
Alright,

739
00:32:41,741 --> 00:32:43,100
give it a try first.

740
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,221
Offer a legal opinion
as soon as possible for me

741
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,060
to review.

742
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:48,488
Okay?

743
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,461
Okay, thank you, Mr. Song.

744
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,168
Come on.

745
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,736
(Aunt)

746
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:46,888
What?

747
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,421
Startled to see me sitting here?

748
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,100
Are you

749
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,060
avoiding me?

750
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,860
I know your concerns.

751
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:56,380
The next round is two out of four.

752
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:59,021
You worry if Yan Fei
wins the next round,

753
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,620
one of us will leave?

754
00:34:03,701 --> 00:34:04,981
I'm gonna tell Guo Xiaoyu

755
00:34:05,221 --> 00:34:06,501
you don't see her as a rival.

756
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,461
With your trip tomorrow,

757
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:11,901
why are you still here?

758
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,140
To get familiar with the case files.

759
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,140
Honestly, I'm fine.

760
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,901
Ms. Bai and Mr. Zhou have it tougher.

761
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:20,421
They say they started
working right after arrival.

762
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:21,672
Also,

763
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,901
I'm not avoiding you.

764
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,421
You're gonna bring these materials?

765
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,620
Digital files are convenient,

766
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,381
but physical documents
are better in court.

767
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,060
When all case files are

768
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,821
logically organized right before you,

769
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,501
no matter what happens,

770
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:37,620
you can handle anything.

771
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,060
I have full confidence in Ms. Bai,

772
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:42,740
but over-preparing never hurts.

773
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,180
Besides, I've studied

774
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,341
Ms. Bai's trial recordings.

775
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:46,620
She prefers physical copies.

776
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,501
I even want to make a mind map.

777
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:51,880
Tired?

778
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,501
Not at all.

779
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:55,981
The financial scale
of this case is huge.

780
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,580
This is my first major case.

781
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,821
Kinda exciting.

782
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,060
People might think

783
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,821
you're some criminal mastermind.

784
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:09,021
Getting thrilled
about litigation numbers?

785
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,660
So you studied Ms. Bai's methods?

786
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:13,580
How'd you do it?

787
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,861
She rarely takes me on a business trip.

788
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,781
I must understand
my supervisor's preferences.

789
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,088
You?

790
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,260
Why not go back?

791
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,580
I just finished work.

792
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:29,140
Here for some space.

793
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,620
What's wrong?

794
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:32,821
Nah.

795
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,861
Do you know?

796
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,501
Your brows furrow every time you stress.

797
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,220
Relax.

798
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:42,120
Smile.

799
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:44,620
Frowning causes creases.

800
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,140
When I frowned as a kid, my dad would

801
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,140
do this.

802
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,660
Tell me to smile.

803
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,941
And I'd smile.

804
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,140
I'm used to it.

805
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:00,981
It works.

806
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:02,504
Useful.

807
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:18,981
You heard my stories last time.

808
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,781
Can I hear yours?

809
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:22,421
We had drinks.

810
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,501
We have unlimited snacks.

811
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,220
My mom...

812
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,461
She...

813
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:33,821
learned that my dad and I

814
00:36:33,821 --> 00:36:35,700
met here once.

815
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:38,140
Wanting me back in Chongqing.

816
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:41,740
She's been contacting me nonstop lately.

817
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:43,660
Way too often.

818
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:45,740
Understandable.

819
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,941
Your dad's offer

820
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:47,461
is definitely

821
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:48,580
better than Jun An's.

822
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,260
What's this?

823
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,660
We're competing right now.

824
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:53,180
Talking me out of the race?

825
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,540
Well then,

826
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,968
stay, and beat me.

827
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,580
I will definitely stay.

828
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
That confident?

829
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Yet afraid of her calls?

830
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:08,781
Don't call me out.

831
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:16,540
I...

832
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,861
I don't want to rely on my dad.

833
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,941
I won't go to Chongqing.

834
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:20,660
I don't want

835
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,301
my mom to feel upset either.

836
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,381
I don't want to hurt either one.

837
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:25,700
So for now, I'll avoid it.

838
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,540
Maybe while I'm avoiding it,

839
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,861
the problem will solve itself.

840
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,580
Well said.

841
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,421
Avoidance isn't shameful.

842
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:40,540
And it works.

843
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:42,740
From now on, tell any client:

844
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:44,981
When trouble comes, avoid it first.

845
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,901
Don't bother lawyers.

846
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,981
If they must, go to Ren Jiatong.

847
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,700
But never bother Mr. Jiang.

848
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,100
No rambling.

849
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:55,100
Get to work now.

850
00:37:58,728 --> 00:38:00,904
♪Believe and understand♪

851
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,040

♪Just one desire♪

857
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:22,301
Mr. Zhou.

858
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:28,904
I'll handle it.

859
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,180
What's so heavy?

860
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,501
I learned you and Ms. Bai
worked nonstop for days.

861
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:34,941
I wanted to help you,

862
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,100
so I printed

863
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,461
all the documents needed.

864
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:39,140
They're organized
sequentially and bound.

865
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,220
Okay.

866
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,808
Thank you.

867
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,312
Let's go.

868
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,140
I'll do this.

869
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:44,981
Ms. Tian's kid

870
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,620
was hospitalized with acute pneumonia.

871
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,660
Ms. Bai let her go home.

872
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,421
We planned

873
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:49,540
to get a fourth-year lawyer.

874
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,220
But he's tied up with another case.

875
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:52,136
No time.

876
00:38:52,461 --> 00:38:53,700
Ms. Bai said you assisted her

877
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,660
in the case's prep work.

878
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:55,861
So you're reassigned.

879
00:38:55,861 --> 00:38:56,700
Only the three of us.

880
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,861
I'm ready to start anytime.

881
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:00,540
Good. Take an hour.

882
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,620
Settle in and rest.

883
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,060
Then regroup in Ms. Bai's room.

884
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,328
Got it.

885
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,821
I just need to drop my bags.

886
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,660
The first business trip

887
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,660
is new and exciting.

888
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,941
I was the same.

889
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,660
But I suggest

890
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,501
you get some rest.

891
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,060
From now on, our sleep time

892
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,461
will be counted in minutes.

893
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:17,540
Don't worry, Mr. Zhou.

894
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
I'm good at staying up.

895
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,580
Stocked up on coffee and Red Bull.

896
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,620
It's only three days. No sleep needed.

897
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:23,781
Alright.

898
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:24,341
I'm here.

899
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,960
Here.

900
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:29,461
Five minutes is all I need.

901
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,301
So many documents.

902
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:42,421
I thought we'd prepared everything

903
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,781
at the firm.

904
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:44,861
These are bank records

905
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:46,140
we requested earlier.

906
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,301
Covering all plaintiffs, defendants,

907
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:49,301
and involved companies.

908
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,821
Full account details.

909
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,941
The court just granted
our review request.

910
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:55,781
We finally got approval.

911
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:57,301
We must comb through everything

912
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:58,461
before the court.

913
00:39:58,901 --> 00:39:59,740
Look for any evidence

914
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,381
that supports our defense strategy.

915
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,781
Select favorable evidence

916
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:03,740
for cross-examination

917
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:05,220
and make charts and PPT

918
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:05,981
for the court.

919
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,660
Well?

920
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,180
Regretting your caffeine supply yet?

921
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:12,540
For a lawyer,

922
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,620
perfect court performances

923
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:16,540
require unimaginable prep work.

924
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:17,700
Even if you think

925
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,620
you're fully prepared,

926
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,381
unexpected challenges

927
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:22,580
will always surface.

928
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,032
Don't worry.

929
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,341
We'll solve them.

930
00:40:28,981 --> 00:40:29,941
While organizing,

931
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,461
remember our defense approach.

932
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,501
Focus specifically

933
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:33,981
on key individuals

934
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:36,021
and critical time periods.

935
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,140
Efficiency matters,

936
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:38,220
but never overlook

937
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,381
any potential advantage.

938
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:43,580
(Bank Records)

939
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,540
(Beijing Industrial Co., Ltd.)
(We've divided tasks.)

940
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,220
(I handle the defendants' bank records.)

941
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,501
(Ren Jiatong handles)

942
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,501
(the plaintiffs'.)

943
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,140
(First, extract relevant sections.)

944
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,140
(Then cross-reference.)

945
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:52,104

mentioned this entry.

Compared to that,

975
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:55,821

the counterparty to fulfill)
