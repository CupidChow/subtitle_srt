(Ren Jiatong 1, Jiang Chen 1)

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,281
I didn't edit the presentation.
Ms. Bai did it.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,320
Ms. Bai?

30
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,080
When you sent it to me,

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,841
I was asleep.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,001
I sent it at 3 AM.

33
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,841
We must be here by 7 AM.

34
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:10,561
Didn't Ms. Bai sleep?

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,760
She must be exhausted.
She spent all day in court.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,336
Now, she has to handle the family.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
But Ms. Bai didn't scold me once today.

38
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,121
She appreciated my hard work.

39
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:25,720
Doesn't it feel worse
if she doesn't scold you?

40
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,480
It means she is teaching you.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,961

(Serving the People with Fair Justice)

43
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:34,361
Many people say she's strict.

44
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,081
Actually, she just takes work seriously,

45
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,361
not against anyone.

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,801
Work is the most important thing to her.

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,160
No matter how tired,
she never slacks off.

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,521
If I'd been more diligent,

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,480
Ms. Bai could get two hours of sleep.

50
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,561
Stop feeling guilty.

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,290
You're a newcomer.
It's normal to be inexperienced.

52
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,801
If anyone's to blame, it should be me.
I should have edited it.

53
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,360
Ms. Bai's child had a fever last night.

54
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:01,561
Remember when she

55
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:02,801
took a long call last night?

56
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:07,040
It was from the nanny.
She must've been worried.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,584
And she stayed up late working.

61
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:41,401
Are you working overtime?

62
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,561
Any problem with me working overtime?

63
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,320
I've never seen you
at the firm this late.

64
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:51,200
Am I really that lazy?

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,160
Why are you here at this hour?

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,841
Working overtime for Mr. Song?

67
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,640
When is your project wrapping up?

68
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm just wrapping things up now.

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,920
I'll rejoin Ms. Bai's team next week.
How about you?

70
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:03,600
Any plans?

71
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:05,896
Me?

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,841
I used to oppose my brother.

73
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,681
He assigned me to Mr. Zhuang's team.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,681
I wanted to join Mr. Song's team.

75
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:17,601
But he suddenly changed his attitude.

76
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:18,801
No clue what got into him.

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,064
He supports me in joining
Mr. Song's team.

78
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,921
But I'm also interested

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,200
in Ms. Bai's case.

80
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,280
Someone is tutoring you. Who's so nice?

81
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:31,560
Look.

82
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:32,760

83
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,161
Miss Yan,

84
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,320
your skills of changing
the topic are terrible.

85
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,601
I knew you are working overtime

86
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,960
for the sake of someone.

87
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:45,801
Let's talk.

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,624
Sure.

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,840
Let's talk.

90
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:51,041
We can talk

91
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,561
about Ren Jiatong
getting a cold last time.

92
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,921
Oh, it's a meteor shower.

93
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,320
So many shooting stars.

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,241
Isn't Mr. Song looking for you?

95
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,640
He had important things to do and left.

96
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,041
I'm with Niuniu at the hospital.

97
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,921
Don't worry.

98
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,561
Thank you for this.

99
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:19,161
The nanny sprained her ankle.

100
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,601
I...

101
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,320
Don't mention it.

102
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm happy that you
thought of me first when you

103
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:26,561
needed help.

104
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:28,776
Alright.

105
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,041
I'll treat you to dinner when I'm back.

106
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:31,921
Okay.

107
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm hanging up.

108
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:35,001
I'm with Niuniu. Focus on your work.

109
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,200
Come back early.

110
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,040
Ms. Bai.

111
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,152
It's cold. Don't catch a chill.

112
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,200
Mr. Song specifically asked me

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,481
to bring you a scarf
since your neck is bothering you.

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,912
Okay.

115
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:53,384
Thank you.

116
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:55,176
Ms. Bai.

117
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:57,361
I apologize to you.

118
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,481
For what?

119
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:02,960
Rest assured,

120
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,921
I'll stay up all night if needed.

121
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:06,640
What happened last night
won't happen again.

122
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,241
You haven't fully recovered yet.

123
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't stay up late.

124
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:16,840
Health is part of your competitive edge.

125
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:18,640
Moreover,

126
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,640
if your mother knows you're sick,

127
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:22,001
she will worry.

128
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,041
Unable to help at all,

129
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,320
she'd feel even worse.

130
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,161
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

131
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,721
Don't worry.

132
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,481
Niuniu will definitely recover soon.

133
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,280
This time,

134
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:38,801
we're sure to win.

135

(Jiang Chen: Two voice messages)

137
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:02,280
When a person always delays

138
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,760
in replying to you, does it mean
this person doesn't like you?

139
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,640
Not really.

140
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,280
Maybe he did reply,

141
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:09,121
but his phone swallowed it.

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
Something is going on?

143
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,840
Let me help you analyze this.

144
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,001
Which guy is it?

145
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:20,681
I actually asked him

146
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
if he likes me.

147
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:23,280
What did he say?

148
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,481
He said he does like me,

149
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:27,880
but it's the kind

150
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
of care and affection
toward a younger sibling.

151
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:32,840
Not romantic feelings at all.

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,320
He had a girlfriend before,

153
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,601
and she must be quite different from me.

154
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:38,960
She is really nice

155
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,161
and quite good-looking.

156
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,768
They had been together for years.

157
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,840
Though they're broken up now...

158
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:46,801
What am I even saying?

159
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,681
Anyway, I regret it now.

160
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:50,520
I shouldn't ask him.

161
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,161
You like him.

162
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:53,601
I don't know whether he likes you.

163
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:54,840
But you definitely like him.

164
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Impossible.

165
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,601
Answering so quickly is suspicious.

166
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,481
I wouldn't fall for a lawyer.

167
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,681
A male lawyer.

168
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,161
Miss Yan.

169
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,041
Anyway, it's someone I shouldn't like.

170
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,681
Now I've confessed

171
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:11,760
and embarrassed myself.

172
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:13,481
Jiang Chen, listen,

173
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,440
if you spill this,

174
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,561
I'll hit you.

175
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,361
Smile.

176
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,041
Why? That's so cheesy.

177
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:22,361
I'll send you this photo.

178
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:23,481
Then,

179
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,280
you'll post it on Moments later.

180
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
Any caption is okay.

181
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,280
Make sure only he can see it.

182
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:29,121
I believe

183
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,880
that if this guy truly
has feelings for you

184
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,960
or likes you,

185
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,201
he will respond.

186
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Really?

187
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,441
Of course.

188
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:37,680
Like cross-examination.

189
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,121
What're you thinking?
Have you thought about it?

190
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,961
If not, what are you dwelling on?

191
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,121
But if you have,

192
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,520
delete that post.

193
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:48,392
Okay.

194
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,216
I'm posting it.

195
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,456
(Me in his eyes)

196
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,361
The takeout.

197
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:53,441
Thanks.

198
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:07,080
Got it.

199
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,040
I see.

200
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:12,841
Ms. Bai, how's Niuniu doing?

201
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,424
- Her fever has gone down.
- That's a relief.

202
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,441
We have a court tomorrow,

203
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,441
so no one should stay up late tonight.

204
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:22,640
Zhou Nian, I reviewed your part.

205
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,520
No issues there.

206
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:24,800
Head back and sleep.

207
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,121
I'll check Ren Jiatong's part later.

208
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:28,296
Alright.

209
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,361
Sure.

210
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:30,800
Ms. Bai, rest early once you finish.

211
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:35,880
Mr. Zhou, aren't you eating?

212
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,808
I won't.

213
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,664
I'm going back.
I'm tired and I will sleep.

214
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:58,001
Ms. Bai,

215
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,481
this part...

216
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:00,361
Take a break.

217
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:01,880
Eat something right now.

218
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,448
What's wrong?

219
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,241
Promise you won't get mad.

220
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,280
These high-calorie snacks

221
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:22,680
don't really fit your persona.

222
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,400
What persona?

223
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,361
The elite professional woman

224
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,121
who often has light salads
and healthy meals every single day.

225
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,752
Low in fat, filling, and healthy.

226
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,800
You've watched many short videos

227
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,321
with outdated stereotypes.

228
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,040
Career women are also emotional.

229
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,160
Under great pressure,

230
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,361
I crave spicy, sweet,
and high-calorie food.

231
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,520
It helps lift my mood.

232
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,201
That makes sense.

233
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,280
It's never too late for regrets.

234
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:50,160
But if you

235
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,680
insist on labeling me,

236
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,680
it would be like this.

237
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,121
I take immense pride in my career.

238
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,721
But I'm not a good mother.

239
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,400
Niuniu will understand
when she grows up.

240
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,361
You have no choice.

241
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,961
But I still feel guilty.

242
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:07,121
I love my child deeply.

243
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:08,361
Yet I also love my work.

244
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:09,721
What can I do?

245
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:10,800
24 hours in a day.

246
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,441
So I split it,

247
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,721
half for work, and half for my child.

248
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,760
But the half for my child
is not sufficient.

249
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,560
Actually, I have no choice.

250
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,040
Realistically speaking,

251
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,160
as a single mom,

252
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,121
I have to

253
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,280
handle things alone

254
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
and support my family.

255
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,520
Personally,

256
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:32,680
I feel I can fulfill
my potential and feel a sense

257
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,841
of accomplishment at work.

258
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,640
It truly lights me up.

259
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,321
Mothers

260
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,160
always worry about their kids.

261
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,201
Every time I leave Niuniu for work,

262
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:45,040
I'll wrestle with overwhelming guilt

263
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,280
for a long time.

264
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,280
Ms. Bai.

265
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,760
You're already doing great.

266
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,680
It's incredibly tough
for women to build careers.

267
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,160
I'm luckier than most.

268
00:12:58,721 --> 00:12:59,441
I have

269
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:00,640
an incredible nanny

270
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,680
who's been very helpful.

271
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:02,760
Even so,

272
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,400
it's been a bumpy road.

273
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,841
Every mother shares the same struggle.

274
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,361
There's always something to worry about.

275
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:13,520
This is my reality, Tian Min's reality,

276
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,400
and I'm sure your mother's too.

277
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:26,481
Don't worry. We're here for you.

278
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:27,920
Okay?

279
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,601
We have put our hearts into this.

280
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:32,001
But why don't we have positive results?

281
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,201
But the first verdict
isn't finalized yet.

282
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,560
We can cling to the hope.

283
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,920
Based on this week's
court proceedings, the hope is slim.

284
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,241
Ms. Bai wants
to prepare the family mentally

285
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,280
for that possibility.

286
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,800
This is the reality of our profession.

287
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:50,800
You work so hard

288
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,280
and still face disappointment.

289
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,481
Ms. Bai seems different from usual.

290
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,961
She often

291
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:00,280
compares our role
to doctors in hospitals.

292
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:01,760
We give our best,

293
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,481
but results aren't always good.

294
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,040
However,

295
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,520
walking clients through the process

296
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:10,400
to provide dignity and support

297
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:11,640
matters too.

298
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:19,361
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

299
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,400
Let's go.

300
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,481
Submit all required documents
once we return,

301
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,800
and start prepping the second appeal.

302
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,560
Okay.

303
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:00,744
Come in.

304
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,520
Mr. Song, did you receive the draft

305
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,481
of my legal opinion?

306
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:08,081
Yes, I'm reviewing it.

307
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,128
Come on in.

308
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,481
So, how's my draft?

309
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,760
Perfect timing.

310
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,160
Tell me about your thoughts first.

311
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,280
Here are my thoughts.

312
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:23,481
First, I utilized AI

313
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:24,560
with its chat function

314
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,361
to understand

315
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:26,680
how AI works.

316
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,520
Next, I conducted thorough research

317
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,920
on China's regulatory framework,
landmark court rulings,

318
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,601
and extensive international legislation

319
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,201
and judicial literature on AI.

320
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:36,280
Finally,
I drafted the initial legal opinion.

321
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:39,601
Then I mainly proposed
the following suggestions.

322
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:40,880
First,

323
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:43,321
assigning users the rights
to outcomes generated by AI,

324
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:44,961
such as pictures,

325
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,361
music, videos,

326
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,680
and other creations.

327
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
Yiaiwan does not
claim ownership of these.

328
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,640
Second...

329
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,040
Hold on. The rest
of your opinion is good.

330
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,560
About the first point,
what is your rationale?

331
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,121
Why advise Yiaiwan to waive its rights?

332
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,361
Mr. Song, indeed, I advise Yiaiwan

333
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,601
not to assert rights
over user-generated content.

334
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,321
This seems not to benefit our client,

335
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,721
but after thorough market research,

336
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:08,961
I reached this conclusion.

337
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:09,800
I believe

338
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,640
that if Yiaiwan offers this concession,

339
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,081
after launching their model,

340
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:13,760
it will create

341
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:15,280
a strong user acquisition advantage.

342
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,560
Commercially speaking,

343
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,961
this benefits Yiaiwan.

344
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,121
This is a business decision,

345
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:22,760
so I explicitly stated
in the legal opinion

346
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,001
that Yiaiwan must

347
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:25,560
carefully weigh this

348
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:26,560
against their goals.

349
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,280
Honestly,

350
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,241
on this matter,

351
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:32,961
our thinking aligns perfectly.

352
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,481
Besides, you included
supporting materials. I'm impressed.

353
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,361
Really?

354
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,880
Thank you.

355
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:41,160
How time flies.

356
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,800
Remember when you

357
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,400
used to cry and demand to leave?

358
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,760
You are more capable now.

359
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:47,081
I was concerned

360
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:50,481
your past relationship
might affect your work for Yiaiwan.

361
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,121
But aren't you the one who taught us

362
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,361
to leverage every possible advantage?

363
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:57,081
As the ex-girlfriend

364
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:59,520
of an employee of Yiaiwan,

365
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:02,640
I found this task quite difficult.

366
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:05,241
But as a trainee of Jun An,

367
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:08,001
it becomes my competitive edge

368
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,320
and my trump card.

369
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,360
As the former heartthrob of Jun An,

370
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,336
you are still leveraging your good
looks to navigate the legal world.

371
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,161
So even if I am ex-girlfriend
of an employee of Yiaiwan,

372
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:19,800
it's still serviceable!

373
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:21,120
Watch your language.

374
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,520
Former heartthrob?

375
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,752
No,

376
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,681
you're currently the most handsome man!

377
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,681
Alright.

378
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:28,441
- The best!
- Alright.

379
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:31,481
Remember, don't mention me

380
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,001
when you cause troubles.

381
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,961
Mr. Song,

382
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,760
so for this round,

383
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,161
can I get some bonus points?

384
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,912
Sure.

385
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,120
Definitely.

386
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:47,641
Thank you.

387
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,600
You're back.

388
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,401
You didn't go home?

389
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,241
I'm working overtime.

390
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:02,320
Xiaoyu and I
will have late-night snacks.

391
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,120
Maybe join us?

392
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,881
I'll pass.

393
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,520
I have documents to organize.
I'll email them to you once done.

394
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:12,120
Okay. Thanks.

395
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:21,576
Mr. Zhou.

396
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,001
What did you text me the other day?

397
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:27,921
You messaged me on WeChat,

398
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,161
but retracted it immediately.

399
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,401
I'm really curious about what it is.

400
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,441
It was nothing.

401
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,641
I retracted a misdirected text.

402
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,681
Then why come straight to the office

403
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:39,681
instead of home

404
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,921
to organize some files
unimportant to you?

405
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:43,840
I promised I would.

406
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:47,320
Shouldn't I keep my promises?

407
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:48,760
I am a lawyer.

408
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
You're a lawyer,

409
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,441
but you're not my lawyer.

410
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,840
I am...

411
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,681
I'm your mentor.

412
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:09,032
Yan Fei.

413
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,481
I don't want to feel awkward

414
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,120
at work.

415
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,240
Okay.

416
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,001
I'm going.

417
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:06,056
Xie,

418
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,721
did you see my colleague?

419
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:09,192
A pretty girl with long hair.

420
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,401
No, I didn't.

421
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:33,641
Did you find her?

422
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,161
She drove off. I forgot.

423
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,840
The one just now?

424
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,840
Why bother yourself?

425
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,600
She drives such a nice car.

426
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,840
Why would she need an umbrella?

427
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,360
Yan Fei, you asked me out.

428
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,481
I've waited almost 20 minutes.

429
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:18,721
Are you coming or not?

430
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,800
Almost there. Three minutes at most.

431
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:23,760
Wait.

432
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:24,760
Drive slowly.

433
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:26,481
I'll wait another 20 minutes.

434
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,520
Two minutes forty-seven seconds.
Under three minutes.

435
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,480
Are you sure
you didn't break any traffic laws?

436
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:42,921
I study law.

437
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:44,520
How could I break it?

438
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,721
I drove within speed limits
the whole time.

439
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:47,840
I'm a professional.

440
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,560
Just drink. Quit the chatter.

441
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,401
You're acting like those experts

442
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,201
testing legal boundaries.

443
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,600
What's going on?

444
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,320
You're a fitness buff.

445
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,040
Calling me for late-night snacks

446
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,201
is weird enough.

447
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:04,001
What happened?

448
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:05,224
Come on.

449
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,481
Your relationship counselor is ready.

450
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,120
My shoulder is ready.

451
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
Tissues are plentiful.

452
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,481
Beer or liquor? Your choice.

453
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,376
Today,

454
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:16,080
I'm all in for you.

455
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:18,440
Ridiculous.

456
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,040
Speeding, drinking,

457
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,681
seeing friends and staying silent

458
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,641
means you broke up.

459
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,600
I've got a designated driver.

460
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
Now, we drink.

461
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,600
No talking. Shut up.

462
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:32,441
Deal?

463
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:33,992
Deal.

464
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,681
Let me pour for you.

465
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:43,320
Don't tell me

466
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,760
you just went all out
confessing to someone?

467
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:46,641
I didn't.

468
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,560
You actually confessed?

469
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:54,161
What's done is done.

470
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,760
The embarrassment is real.

471
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,736
Wait,

472
00:22:58,641 --> 00:22:59,240
you...

473
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,641
Who even

474
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,560
confesses nowadays?

475
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:04,360
Keep it ambiguous

476
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:06,001
and use a strategy.

477
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:08,681
When he pushes, pull back.
When he retreats, advance.

478
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:10,441
You're charging ahead alone,

479
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:12,001
so he just keeps retreating.

480
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:14,088
Wait,

481
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,441
but then again,

482
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:18,441
why would he retreat
if you're proactive?

483
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:19,401
Is he stupid?

484
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,040
I can't tell which of us is more stupid.

485
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,401
He joined me in boxing workouts.

486
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:30,320
We watched the stars
on the Fifth Ring Road at night.

487
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,520
If that doesn't mean affection,

488
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,681
what does it mean?

489
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,161
Are we even
in the same Talent Hunt Program?

490
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,040
You had time to watch the stars?

491
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:43,848
Drink.

492
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,080
Let me process.

493
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,201
So here's the deal.

494
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,040
This guy is into you,

495
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,760
but plays hard to get.

496
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,161
But you like him, being curious
about his real thoughts.

497
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,288
Right?

498
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,600
There are plenty of guys
like this online.

499
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:03,280
For instance, they're
trying to gaslight you.

500
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:05,040
They know you're wealthy,

501
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,040
setting a trap for you.

502
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
You can't be serious.

503
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,641
Stop. He's not that kind of guy.

504
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,721
In that case,

505
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,721
it's simpler.

506
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,800
If he likes you but rejects you,

507
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:18,641
there's only one explanation.

508
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
There must be a reason

509
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,881
you can't be together.

510
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,161
For example,

511
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,961
family background,

512
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:26,881
income differences,

513
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
or long-distance issues.

514
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:39,241
Never mind the reason.

515
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,840
Anyway, it's in the past.

516
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,928
I'll move on.

517
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,001
From now on, we're just colleagues.

518
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,161
Colleagues?

519
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,120
Don't tell me it's...

520
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,600
How could he do that?

521
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:00,721
What about Jiatong?

522
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:03,840
Ren Jiatong? Why hasn't she come?

523
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,441
They should be...

524
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,120
They're back by now.

525
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,840
Well,

526
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:12,760
don't call her here.

527
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,961
Why not?

528
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:16,001
I'll call her now.

529
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:18,792
I'll call.

530
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,104
I'll do it.

531
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:31,961
Hello, Jiatong?

532
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,080
Are you back?

533
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,224
Okay.

534
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,001
Well,

535
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,120
I'm having dinner out with Yan Fei.

536
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,120
She invited you to join us.

537
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,560
You just got back from a business trip
and must be exhausted.

538
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,760
You couldn't come, right?

539
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,401
I'm fine, not too tired.

540
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,840
I slept during the flight.

541
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,880
Xiaoyu, my phone's out of power.
I'll call back later.

542
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:08,961
What's wrong?

543
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,001
I sent you so many messages,
and you never replied.

544
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:15,481
Out of power.

545
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,641
How could you block me then?

546
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:19,600
I saw you speaking on a call.

547
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,320
Did I do something wrong?
Are you mad at me?

548
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,241
If you need to reach me, call me

549
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,241
or use office software.

550
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,641
Between colleagues,

551
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:31,800
that's sufficient.

552
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:52,296
Why are you following me?

553
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,721
You didn't respond
to my WeChat messages.

554
00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:57,161
I asked when you'd arrive,

555
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:58,120
and you blocked me.

556
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,161
I reread our chat history so many times,

557
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,760
but still couldn't find the problem.

558
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,840
I tried hard to get close to Mr. Zhou

559
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,520
just to find out

560
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,001
when your flight actually landed.

561
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,080
I didn't pick you up at the airport
as I worried they might misunderstand.

562
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:12,441
So I waited outside your home instead.

563
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,320
But then you just said

564
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:16,201
that we're just colleagues

565
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:17,441
and dismissed me.

566
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:19,520
What exactly do you want?

567
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,800
I'm sick.

568
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:25,921
I feel terrible.

569
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:33,080
What's wrong with you?

570
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:35,840
I have no appetite.

571
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,441
I can't sleep well.

572
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,600
Even get random nausea and cramps.

573
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,001
It's like

574
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,961
I have a cold. Probably stomach flu.

575
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:45,992
Get to the point.
What did the doctor say?

576
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,961
The doctor said

577
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,320
this illness is

578
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,520
hard to cure.

579
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,881
Unless...

580
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:57,320
Unless what?

581
00:27:57,961 --> 00:27:58,921
Unless the person

582
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:00,560
I've been missing

583
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,401
comes back soon

584
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,040
and

585
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,520
kisses me.

586
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:06,696
That should...

587
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:12,201
Did Yan Fei and Guo Xiaoyu
ask you out to dinner?

588
00:28:12,681 --> 00:28:13,520
How did you know?

589
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,120
Yan Fei invited me too.

590
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:16,481
We're very close now.

591
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,520
I help her when she's in trouble.

592
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:21,560
Honestly, I didn't expect

593
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,241
that someone like Yan Fei

594
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:24,560
who is so smart,

595
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,120
righteous,

596
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,721
and straightforward

597
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:29,512
would have problems too.

598
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,600
So, out of my gentleman's instincts,

599
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:35,560
I decided...

600
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,800
You must've seen
Yan Fei's social media post.

601
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,360
If I keep praising her, will you finally

602
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,681
get mad?

603
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:43,681
So you did this on purpose?

604
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,441
It was indeed my mistake.

605
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,800
I apologize to you.

606
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,760
I shouldn't have allowed it
to take photos with others.

607
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,040
But

608
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,641
you're definitely mistaking me.

609
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,881
Give me a chance to explain.

610
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,800
You're unfairly casting me aside

611
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,360
and nearly killing me.

612
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:08,648
So you should make it up to me.

613
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,360
You still have free time

614
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,280
to watch dramas?

615
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:14,721
And let's be clear. Who makes it up?

616
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,001
I'll make it up to you.
I made a mistake.

617
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,528
How about this?

618
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,161
Tell Guo Xiaoyu that you won't

619
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:21,961
make it to dinner.

620
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:23,401
We'll eat alone.

621
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:26,280
I'll explain the whole story to you.

622
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,721
Show me some sympathy.

623
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,681
I've had no appetite for days.

624
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:32,641
Shouldn't you eat with me?

625
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:34,201
Listen up.

626
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,401
Glib men

627
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:36,201
lose pursuers.

628
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,881
You pursue me?

629
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:39,040
Since when?

630
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,520
Go eat. Stop being childish.

631
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:45,161
Your phone.

632
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,800
When did you pursue me?

633
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Low-alcohol cinnamon rock sugar.

634
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:56,584
It helps you sleep.

635
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,681
It tastes good.

636
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,400
It tastes good.

637
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,681
So you didn't realize

638
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:11,681
that Yan Fei's post
was only visible to Mr. Zhou?

639
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:14,280
I thought she just blocked us,

640
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,840
but forgot to block senior lawyers.

641
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:17,360
That's entirely possible.

642
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,800
No wonder people say

643
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,401
that

644
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:25,080
people in love are slow

645
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,161
on the uptake.

646
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
How is Yan Fei?

647
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,201
Not good.

648
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,481
Otherwise,
she wouldn't ask us out for drinks.

649
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:41,401
I saw that photo

650
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,241
because Zhou Nian stared at it

651
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,520
for a while. He even lost appetite.

652
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,080
He definitely likes Yan Fei.

653
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,472
Then,

654
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:53,520
Mr. Zhou probably has his own concerns.

655
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:56,441
Does he feel the gap
between him and Yan Fei is huge

656
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:57,280
in every aspect?

657
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,280
That's why...

658
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,241
There's a huge gap between us too.

659
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:01,681
I don't think so.

660
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:02,681
We're both young

661
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:03,721
and capable.

662
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,401
And we're both good-looking.

663
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,201
I believe we're definitely

664
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,401
visual representatives
of Talent Hunt Program.

665
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,360
I'm slightly less attractive than you.

666
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,320
You have a father who is a lawyer.

667
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,961
I have a father with a criminal record.

668
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,280
If I were your friend,

669
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,641
acting on a lawyer's instinct,

670
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,760
I'd advise you to stop.

671
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,641
Dating a lawyer

672
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:26,161
and getting risk alerts?

673
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:36,401
I can't control

674
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,241
who our fathers are.

675
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,881
But I can choose who I love.

676
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:42,760
I'm serious.

677
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,600
I hope you are the same, Ren Jiatong.

678
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:06,520
Why stare at me?

679
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,481
You only had two drinks.

680
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,040
Don't pretend to be drunk.

681
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,040
I think you're beautiful.

682
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,401
I want to watch you a bit longer.

683
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:16,040
Aren't you curious

684
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,641
about what we did on this trip?

685
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,520
I am curious.
If you tell me, I'll listen.

686
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,481
I've learned so much from Ms. Bai.

687
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:28,040
Even when I didn't perform well,

688
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,520
she didn't criticize me at all.

689
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,001
Instead, she taught me how to do it.

690
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:33,241
You know what?

691
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:34,721
Privately,

692
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:36,560
she relieves stress by eating junk food.

693
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:39,040
It's really adorable.

694
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,744
Ren Jiatong.

695
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:13,360
I really want to know

696
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:15,401
if you are serious.

697
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,560
Is this answer important?

698
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:23,688
Yes.

699
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:25,760
It matters to me.

700
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:30,241

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,200
Ms. Bai.

761
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,841
I've outlined the key facts of the case.

762
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,881
The evidence shows that when they met,

763
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,481
the guy gave Xia Jun

764
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:41,921
a large tennis bag.

765
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,120
During their internal investigation,

766
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,640
they claimed it was filled with cash

767
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:46,680
of two million yuan.

768
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,680
The evidence appears solid.

769
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:50,441
But there's no direct proof

770
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,361
that can prove

771
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:53,040
that the tennis bag our client held

772
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,120
actually contained money.

773
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:56,040
This could be our breakthrough point.

774
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,481
Go find Ren Jiatong and the others.

775
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:01,160
Recheck Xia Jun's
internal investigation report

776
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,361
and go through details.
Then we'll meet to discuss our strategy.

777
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,816
Come in.

778
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,776
Ms. Bai.

779
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,376
You're busy?

780
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,240
It's fine.

781
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,120
I just wanted to chat briefly.

782
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:13,961
We're done.

783
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,040
Ms. Bai, Mr. Song.

784
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,921
I'm getting out.

785
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:29,281
Ms. Bai.

786
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:32,040
The case on the corporate

787
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,441
control dispute we handled together?

788
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,321
The one three years ago?

789
00:38:38,504 --> 00:38:40,040
Right, three years ago.

790
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,240
And here's another case.

791
00:38:43,761 --> 00:38:46,120
When did we handle the insurance case?

792
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:47,841
Five years ago.

793
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:51,520
You have such a good memory.

794
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:53,921
You still remember these cases.

795
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,961
Mr. Song.

796
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:01,040
You're feeling nostalgic today.

797
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,001
That's not like you.

798
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,080
Aren't you the one always looking ahead

799
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
and forgetting the past quickly?

800
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,321
Right.

801
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,120
You're right.

802
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:12,801
We should move on from the past quickly.

803
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,720
Reminiscing about the past

804
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:17,321
isn't great at our age.

805
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,001
Stop.

806
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:20,200
At our age? What do you mean?

807
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,560
Sorry, I misspoke.

808
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,600
Exactly, I meant for my age group.

809
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:26,761
I take that back.

810
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:29,361
Lovely flowers.

811
00:39:30,881 --> 00:39:31,520
From Gao Lang.

812
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:32,936
Gao Lang?

813
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:37,441
So Gao Lang visited you earlier?

814
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,441
He's a key client.

815
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,801
Stay connected.

816
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,160
Sure, we do.

817
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:49,640
These flowers

818
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,961
look nice yet are fragile.

819
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,841
They won't

820
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,208
last a few days.

821
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:22,481
Had a meeting with Mr. Song?

822
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:23,640
Yes.

823
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,680
I just did a handover.

824
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:26,481
What about you? What kept you busy?

825
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:28,321
I just had a meeting with Ms. Bai.

826
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:34,680
I can show you the meeting notes later.

827
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,361
Sure, I have interesting notes too.

828
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,481
We can share them later.

829
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,001
I'll go grab some water.

830
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:43,200
Okay, stay safe.

831
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:45,560
No, not that,

832
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,801
drink more water.

833
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:55,560
Jiatong.

834
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:56,680
Jiang Chen.

835
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,200
Juicy gossip.

836
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,104
Hurry!

837
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,344
Have you heard?

838
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,560
The client Ms. Bai just met with

839
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:23,720
is her ex-boyfriend.

840
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,680
And that guy came to see Ms. Bai

841
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:27,441
to help his current girlfriend.

842
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:28,921
What?

843
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,401
I didn't know about this in our team.

844
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:32,240
But you knew first?

845
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:33,881
Be serious.

846
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:36,120
Ms. Bai and Mr. Song?

847
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,001
An ex?

848
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,481
Just think it over.

849
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:39,520
Jiang Chen.

850
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:42,200
Get your logic straight, Guo Xiaoyu.

851
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,600
I don't understand

852
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,720
your noncontinuous sentence structures.

853
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,841
I just saw a quite handsome man

854
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,560
waiting for Ms. Bai.

855
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:53,841
Ms. Bai seemed familiar with him.

856
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:55,361
That guy even gave her flowers.

857
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,720
How handsome?

858
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,921
I confirm it.

859
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,401
Extremely handsome.

860
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:04,488
Wait.

861
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,640
What do you guys mean?

862
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,040
No way he's more handsome than my idol.

863
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,441
Whose side are you even on?

864
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:14,200
I'm so furious!

865
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,720
How could he come to Ms. Bai

866
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,881
for his current girlfriend?

867
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,921
What's wrong with these men?

868
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:20,160
Are they all heartless?

869
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,720
Maybe you should add a prerequisite

870
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,361
to your conclusion.

871
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,600
Let's be more rigorous.

872
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:29,001
Don't target the innocent.

873
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:36,600
I'm being quite rigorous.

874
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,001
I didn't misjudge any bad man.

875
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,600
I'm just so mad.

876
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:48,160
I don't think
Ms. Bai will take this case.

877
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,961
It's generous
that she didn't kick him out.

878
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,841
If I hear any fighting noise later

879
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:52,801
from Ms. Bai's office,

880
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:53,640
I'll be the first one

881
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:55,120
to rush in and hit that guy.

882
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:56,441
I'll go with a broom.

883
00:42:58,001 --> 00:42:58,632
Deal.

884
00:42:58,801 --> 00:42:59,841
If a fight starts later,

885
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:00,640
I'll back you up.

886
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:02,801
But my gut feeling is

887
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,281
Ms. Bai will take the case.

888
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,240
I also think so.

889
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:08,961
Ms. Bai doesn't
let emotions affect her work.

890
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:10,640
I bet you 100 yuan.

891
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,401
She won't take it.

892
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:14,120
Just wait and see.
