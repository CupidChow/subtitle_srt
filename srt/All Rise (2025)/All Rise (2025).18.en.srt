37
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,649
You sent it to

Ms. Bai hates voice messages.

51
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,810
Inefficient and unprofessional.

52
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,489
And you sent three in a row.

53
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,929

When we apply for arbitration

57
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,329
of share repurchase,

58
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,530
we should name

59
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,729
(Arbitration Target)
Hong Da as the respondent.

60
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:28,370
Otherwise, as per the Company Law,

61
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:31,290
National Court Conference Minutes
on Civil and Commercial Trials etc.,

62
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,410
we may fail to meet the client's demands

63
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,209
if capital reduction occurs.

64
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,169
(Property Preservation)
My approach

65
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:39,329
aligns with Ren Jiatong's.

66
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,329
And at the same time,

67
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,370
we should file for

68
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,570
asset preservation
to freeze Hong Da's assets.

69
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,850
Otherwise, we could win

70
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,810
but end up with nothing to collect.

71
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,584
(Property Preservation)
Thank you.

72
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,370
Ren Jiatong
and Yan Fei's ideas are both solid.

73
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,690
They noted the inability

74
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:01,889
to directly demand

75
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:04,010
stock repurchase from the new company.

76
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,889
But you should also notice that

77
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,090
the repurchase price

78
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,169
stipulated

79
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,769
in the contract far exceeds

80
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,769
what our client paid

81
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,489
when establishing the new company.

82
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:15,090
Even in commercial arbitration,

83
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,769
it's unlikely to be fully upheld.

84
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,889
Therefore,

85
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,769
keep following up on this point.

86
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,889
Alright, it's late.

87
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,649
Let's talk...

88
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:29,384
Mr. Zhou.

89
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:30,969
My turn.

90
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,810
I won't take much time.

91
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,960
(Property Preservation)

92
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:56,250
(Key contract clauses)

93
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,730
I noticed that the contract

94
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:58,690
also grants

95
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,170
a drag-along right if the new company

96
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:02,289
underperforms.

97
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,880
(Drag-along right)

98
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,512
(A provision that allows
a majority or key shareholder)

99
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:06,344
(to force minority shareholders)

100
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:07,912
(to join in the sale of the company to
a third party, under the same terms.)

101
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:08,840
(The minority shareholders
are to comply.)

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,570
(Thus, this right is mandatory
for them.)

103
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,889
So I suggest we advise our client

104
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,610
to exercise the drag-along right

105
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:15,649
to sell both its own

106
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,810
(Hong Da, Client)
and Hong Da's shares

107
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,810
(Mandatory Equity Transfer)
in the new company

108
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,616
(Equity Transfer)
to Xin Jian Ye,

109
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:21,128
(Xin Jian Ye)

110
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:23,370
(Critical Supply Chain Component)
which has previously expressed interest

111
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,610
(Enforce Co-Transfer)
in acquiring a larger stake.

112
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,209
(Hong Da loses control)
Should Hong Da refuse to comply,

113
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:31,769
we would then initiate arbitration
to enforce the drag-along clause.

114
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,250
Interesting.

115
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,329
Compared to Ren Jiatong and Yan Fei's

116
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,370
direct approach
to demand share repurchase,

117
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,209
your solution seems

118
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,250
more indirect.

119
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,409
Yeah, that's why I didn't

120
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,849
pursue the approach

121
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:47,529
with the drag-along right.

122
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,810
(Drag-along right)

123
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,408
I believe

124
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,730
although the drag-along approach

125
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,329
may seem to be less direct,

126
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,170
it allows the client

127
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,409
to receive funds faster.

128
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,930
Our client can achieve equity transfer

129
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,849
without waiting for arbitration.

130
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:03,969
Ultimately,

131
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:05,490
(Prompt Payment)
a prompt receipt

132
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,329
of satisfactory payment

133
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,449
is the client's core need.

134
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:12,250
Plus, payments via this approach

135
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,889
avoid arbitration-ordered reductions.

136
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,810
(Unaffected by arbitration reduction)
It addresses

137
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,730
the concern raised by

138
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,170
Mr. Zhou, Ren Jiatong, and Yan Fei.

139
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:22,248
(Arbitral reduction)

140
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,208
(Upon a party's request,)

141
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,200
(the arbitral tribunal
exercises its discretion)

142
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,256
(to appropriately reduce
an excessive or unreasonable sum)

143
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:26,170
(based on statutory law
and the principle of fairness.)

144
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,329
There's something I don't understand.

145
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,170
Our client company

146
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,649
has already transferred
its shares to Xin Jian Ye

147
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,730
and received the payment.

148
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,490
Why are we initiating arbitration,

149
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,529
demanding the drag-along
of Hong Da's shares?

150
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,409
Apart from the payment

151
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,370
made by Xin Jian Ye,

152
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,050
we want to secure

153
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,529
a settlement payment
from Hong Da for our client.

154
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:46,250
(Settlement payment)

155
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,730
If arbitration upholds
the drag-along right clause,

156
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:49,690
that would mean

157
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,170
Hong Da loses control

158
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,370
over the new company.

159
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,209
And that new company happens to be

160
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,610
the apparel supply chain business.

161
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,490
Although it hasn't met targets
in the last two years,

162
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,690
it's crucial for companies

163
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,329
in the apparel industry, like Hong Da

164
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,409
and Xin Jian Ye.

165
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:05,690
This is why

166
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,250
Xin Jian Ye is trying to

167
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,930
hold a larger stake in the new company.

168
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,050
And this is what Hong Da

169
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,329
can't possibly accept.

170
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:15,250
Therefore,

171
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,490
I believe Hong Da

172
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,849
will seek a settlement,

173
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,969
and request our client

174
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,209
not to exercise the drag-along right.

175
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,289
At that time, we can secure

176
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:25,849
a settlement payment for our client.

177
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,329
Yeah, not just the settlement payment.

178
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,889
Hong Da might also agree

179
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,889
to our client's original proposal

180
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:35,050
and repurchase the shares
our client holds in the new company.

181
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,529
The drag-along right

182
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,690
is Hong Da's true fear.

183
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,449
Someone is so eager to defend

184
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:42,849
his junior colleague.

185
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,089
Ren Jiatong and Yan Fei suggest

186
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,329
we directly demand

187
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,570
compensation and repurchase
through arbitration.

188
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,289
But Li Ke has chosen to

189
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,570
advance the transfer

190
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:04,010
while adopting
"Litigation to Drive Negotiation"

191
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,050
as a pressure tactic

192
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:08,209
to prompt negotiation and compensation.

193
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,490
I believe this will

194
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,969
resolve the issue more efficiently.

195
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,570
Good idea.

196
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,889
After discussion,

197
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,370
we've decided
to award the points to Li Ke.

198
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:25,690
And you can go on

199
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,170
a business trip with Ms. Bai.

200
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,064
Congrats.

201
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,090
Li Ke is not bad.

202
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:48,730
Indeed.

203
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,736
Mr. Zhuang.

204
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:50,792
Ms. Bai.

205
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:52,409
Mr. Zhou.

206
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,056
Well,

207
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,809
my sister sent me some fresh walnuts.

208
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,049
They're really nice.

209
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,370
It would be hard to crack them open

210
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,529
so she went ahead

211
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,730
and did it one by one.

212
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,809
I'll bring you some.

213
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,730
Your sister is so thoughtful.

214
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:09,130
She deserves some credit

215
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:10,490
for your great proposal.

216
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,409
She worked hard to crack them open

217
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,330
one by one.

218
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,130
We'll definitely enjoy them.

219
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:17,409
Thank you.

220
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,010
Thank your sister for me.

221
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,970
Thank you.

222
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:54,632
(Review notes)

223
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:07,720
(Is it done? How was it?)

224
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:11,592
(I. Case objectives)

225
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:14,664
(My approach was to secure
the share transfer...)

226
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:18,600
(Review notes)

227
00:10:35,816 --> 00:10:36,520
Come in.

228
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:38,632
Ms. Bai.

229
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,769
I found a pen in the conference room.

230
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,929
I think it's yours.

231
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:43,130
Did you leave it behind?

232
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,289
It is mine. Thank you.

233
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,010
I've been looking for it.

234
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,370
Right,

235
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,210
the meeting's over.

236
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,330
What were you doing there?

237
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,330
I drafted a review note

238
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,529
and emailed it to you.

239
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,850
I'd welcome your feedback

240
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,090
if you have time.

241
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,889
Feels awful to lose, huh?

242
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,010
Yeah.

243
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,289
It's not the first time,

244
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,569
but I still don't like it.

245
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,330
What if I tell you that you'll

246
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:15,929
get used to it

247
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:16,769
after a while?

248
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,929
I will never get used to it.

249
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:22,649
I don't think

250
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,769
you'd like an apprentice
who admits defeat.

251
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,610
I'm just one of
your supervising lawyers.

252
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,049
The apprenticeship

253
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:31,649
comes down to fate.

254
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:37,970
Sit down, let's talk.

255
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,169
It was

256
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,569
a competition between you three.

257
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,689
But it seems you've focused

258
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:47,970
only on Yan Fei.

259
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,032
Why?

260
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,250
I think you know very well

261
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,490
that the Talent Hunt Program candidates

262
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:55,450
are all competent.

263
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,809
In the past few months, you've been

264
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:58,529
working hard.

265
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,889
You believe you can win
with your expertise

266
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,970
and abilities.

267
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,450
But Yan Fei

268
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,610
is a unique opponent.

269
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:07,210
Because deep down,

270
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,010
you feel she possesses something

271
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:11,730
that no amount of hard work

272
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,210
can ever give you.

273
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,090
You hate to lose to her.

274
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,809
That's why you poured

275
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,490
all your focus on her alone

276
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:19,809
and overlooked Li Ke.

277
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,370
Am I right?

278
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,090
Good. Recognizing the problem

279
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,409
means you've taken a step forward.

280
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,250
Never underestimate any opponent

281
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,010
and never overestimate one either.

282
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,664
Come on.

283
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:39,330
Walnuts.

284
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,370
- Thanks.
- They're tasty.

285
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,569
I heard that

286
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,970
you killed it today.

287
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:45,569
Shouldn't you treat us?

288
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,769
Check the group chat. Bubble teas on me.

289
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:48,689
- Go ahead.
- Already done.

290
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,490
Alright.

291
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,529
But I'm interviewing

292
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:52,769
someone with Jiang Chen.

293
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,370
Leave the bubble tea on my desk.

294
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,809
I want your winning aura.

295
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:56,409
No problem.

296
00:12:58,289 --> 00:12:59,010
Jiang Chen,

297
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,450
Mr. Hu is waiting.

298
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,010
I'll revise my review notes.

299
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,864
Ms. Bai,

300
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,010
thank you for your advice.

301
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:12,929
It's nothing.

302
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,450
Just consider it my thanks
for finding my pen.

303
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,809
This pen must be very special to you.

304
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,769
A friend gave it to me.

305
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,569
Out of everyone at Jun An,

306
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,889
I'm the one who found

307
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:28,970
such an important pen.

308
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:29,970
That's fate.

309
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:32,210
Thank you, mentor.

310
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,224
Ren Jiatong.

311
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:41,970
Here.

312
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,049
Walnuts from home.

313
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:43,929
Super good.

314
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:44,889
Freshly shelled.

315
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:45,409
Here.

316
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,920
Thanks.

317
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:50,049
I learned a lot today.

318
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,889
Your performance is inspiring.

319
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:55,409
I'm flattered.

320
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:56,610
I don't even know

321
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,730
what to say now.

322
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,024
Have a seat.

323
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:29,370
We're here

324
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,850
to learn about

325
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,010
your business operations with

326
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,010
your subsidiaries.

327
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:34,824
(Beijing Zhong Yuan)
So...

328
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,889
We operate fully within the law,

329
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,769
pay all the taxes,

330
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,010
(and fulfill
all corporate responsibilities.)

331
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,409
(We've been long established.)

332
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,456
Besides,

333
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,049
our company deeply cares

334
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,970
for our employees.

335
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,409
We've also received honorary titles like

336
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,809
Outstanding Taxpaying Enterprise

337
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,569
(and Customer Satisfaction Enterprise.)

338
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,850
(These awards)

339
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,649
(are displayed on our honor wall.)

340
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,728
(2023 Tian Yu Software
Outstanding Taxpaying Enterprise)

341
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:10,376
Mr. Hu,

342
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,330
while reviewing Zhong Yuan's

343
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,929
business contracts yesterday,

344
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,250
I discovered an addendum.

345
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,850
But it conflicts

346
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,210
with the terms of

347
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,130
the main contract.

348
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,569
So, I suspect this is a dual contract.

349
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,130
Zhong Yuan intended to conceal this fact

350
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,450
and has been showing us

351
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,529
the public version,

352
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,010
but they made a mistake
when handing in the files

353
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:31,289
and submitted the addendum,

354
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,689
which is the private contract.

355
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,010
The addendum was buried

356
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,409
within that stack of files.

357
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,689
They assumed we wouldn't

358
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:37,649
go through all of them.

359
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,970
Yet I managed to dig it out.

360
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:44,610
I'll include this

361
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,250
in the due diligence report

362
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,169
and flag the risks to our client.

363
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:49,480
Mr. Hu.

364
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,569
I took a photo of this certificate

365
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:52,569
during our visit

366
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,330
at Zhong Yuan that day.

367
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,169
Please take a look.

368
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:57,169
(Outstanding Taxpaying Enterprise)
It shows that

369
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:58,809
Tian Yu was once a municipal-level

370
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,529
outstanding taxpayer.

371
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,049
So it was a lie when Zhong Yuan

372
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,409
said it was a shell company

373
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:04,689
that had no business dealings

374
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:05,929
with them.

375
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,649
Yeah.

376
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,929
Without substantial income,

377
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,490
there wouldn't be significant taxes.

378
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,010
Those liars.

379
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,130
Impressive.

380
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,610
No wonder Mr. Song recommended you.

381
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:15,769
Impressive new talent.

382
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,610
Really?

383
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,569
Please tell Mr. Song

384
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:19,970
that exact praise in person.

385
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:21,330
Please.

386
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:22,450
Bubble tea on me.

387
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:23,330
Don't worry.

388
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,010
If Mr. Song doesn't credit your team,

389
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,130
I'll appeal to him.

390
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:28,569
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

391
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:35,250
Small world.

392
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:38,689
Why are you here?

393
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,450
You challenged me to spar

394
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,330
and recommended this gym and coach.

395
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,112
Did you forget?

396
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,330
Bring it on.

397
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:47,610
No, winning you

398
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:48,730
would be dishonorable.

399
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,850
Come on, it's nothing shameful to lose.

400
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,569
Want a headgear?

401
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,210
Why would I need that?

402
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:56,289
Do you need one?

403
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,889
At the firm, you're my supervisor.

404
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,330
But at the gym,

405
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,689
I'm your senior.

406
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,624
Fine.

407
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:04,584
Senior.

408
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:06,690
Looking forward to your guidance.

409
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,056
(Fight Club)

410
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:35,569
Senior.

411
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,450
Your training hasn't paid off.

412
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,920
Your nose is bleeding.

413
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:26,440
Thanks.

414
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,529
That was brutal.

415
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,849
That punch of yours

416
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,170
nearly cost me my civil capacity.

417
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:37,289
Because you didn't wear headgear.

418
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,650
Alright.

419
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,410
It's my fault.

420
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,650
I'm sorry.

421
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,450
I was desperate to win.

422
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,049
Here at the gym or at the firm?

423
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:48,690
Both.

424
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,490
I just don't get it.

425
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,089
I've pushed myself to absolute limits.

426
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,289
Yet I always fall just short.

427
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,569
Where am I lacking?

428
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,170
I really don't get it.

429
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,329
Nowhere.

430
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,569
I know

431
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:05,569
people are polite to me at the firm

432
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:07,250
because of my family background.

433
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,809
I bet you think

434
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,890
I'm just a spoiled heiress

435
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,970
with nothing but money and tantrums.

436
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,170
If I must describe you,

437
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:19,010
you're passionate, brilliant,

438
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,410
and fearlessly principled.

439
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:23,129
You're impressive.

440
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,010
You've never considered quitting.

441
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,289
From my perspective,

442
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:29,089
you performed exceptionally this time.

443
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,690
A setback or two

444
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,609
doesn't matter.

445
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,730
That's the beauty

446
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,329
of boxing, too.

447
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,730
As long as the fighter

448
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:37,089
can still get back up,

449
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,450
they have a chance to win.

450
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:41,730
Really?

451
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,769
Yeah.

452
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:44,569
Zhou?

453
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:46,472
Coach.

454
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:47,690
Why are you here today?

455
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:49,730
I thought you'd only come

456
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,490
on Thursday.

457
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,410
Isn't it Wednesday?

458
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,769
I have work tomorrow.

459
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:56,329
Go ahead, coach.

460
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,250
I can practice alone.

461
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,410
Did you come to keep me company?

462
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:16,010
And you let me punch you on purpose?

463
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,250
The coach shared the video
in the boxing group.

464
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:21,289
You were training too hard.

465
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,329
So I came here.

466
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,129
Did my brother

467
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,289
tell you to do that?

468
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:30,890
Whenever Xingke's heiress feels down,

469
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,490
the supervising lawyers must
clear their schedule to cheer her up.

470
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,010
How much do you charge?

471
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,690
I'm your supervising lawyer.

472
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,010
I am held responsible

473
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,010
if you're upset

474
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,329
during work.

475
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,490
This applies

476
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,410
to every single

477
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,809
one of you.

478
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,010
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

479
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,410
You're a decent guy.

480
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,690
How come your ex never tried

481
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,129
to review your relationship?

482
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,289
I'm a single workaholic

483
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:02,490
consumed by work.

484
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:04,250
I've devoted myself to Jun An.

485
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,890
All I review right now

486
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,049
are case files.

487
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,450
Wordplay? That's a fine.

488
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:10,930
You can't fine me.

489
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:12,650
You're quite decent too.

490
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,129
I bet you held back on that punch.

491
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,970
Or I'd be lying on the floor.

492
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,529
I am

493
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,609
hot-tempered and sharp-tongued.

494
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:22,569
I know that.

495
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,129
But I've never met anyone

496
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:25,010
like you

497
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:27,289
who never gets angry at my words.

498
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,450
Plus, you always show up

499
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,250
when needed.

500
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,210
So you're decent, too.

501
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:35,080
Alright.

502
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,456
I'm off.

503
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:38,049
Want a ride?

504
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,624
No need.

505
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,930
I'm going back to the firm.
I'm only walking you to your car.

506
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:46,184
Bye.

507
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,730
I've been looking for you.
There you are.

508
00:21:59,410 --> 00:21:59,930
What's wrong?

509
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,450
Could I borrow the original copy

510
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,450
of the demand letter?

511
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,129
The log says you have it.

512
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:05,930
I need to copy it.

513
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:06,970
It's here.

514
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,809
Take it yourself.

515
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:08,569
I made copies.

516
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,049
I'm shredding these papers.

517
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:17,736
Got a cold?

518
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:19,970
It's fine. No fever. Nothing serious.

519
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,628
(Shareholder

520
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,160
Here.

521
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,289
Drink this when it cools.

522
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,450
It's great for early symptoms.

523
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:38,849
Thanks.

524
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:42,170
You didn't get a bubble tea

525
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,329
this afternoon.

526
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,490
Consider this a substitute.

527
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:48,936
(Repurchase of Shares)

528
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:53,450
It's my sister.

529
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,248
Hey, sis.

530
00:22:59,049 --> 00:22:59,970
Yeah, I got them.

531
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,250
I shared the walnuts with my colleagues.

532
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:06,890
Mr. Zhuang praised you today.

533
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,569
Okay.

534
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:11,450
Sis, I'm at the office.

535
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,010
Call you after work.

536
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:14,664
Okay.

537
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,730
I know.

538
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,010
Alright, bye.

539
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:24,569
You two are really close.

540
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,089
Yeah, she's amazing.

541
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,010
Being a lawyer

542
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,650
was always her dream.

543
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,650
Did she study law too?

544
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,049
Not really.

545
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,690
But she loved the legal dramas

546
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,170
of Hong Kong, China.

547
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,490
The lawyers' outfits in court

548
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,410
were impressive.

549
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,809
She covered her pencil case

550
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:44,250
with stickers of those shows.

551
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,769
But she started working at a young age

552
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:47,890
to support my education

553
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,129
and raise her kids.

554
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,970
She signed me up

555
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:51,890
for this program.

556
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:53,450
No wonder

557
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,609
you're so caring.

558
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:56,930
You learned that from her.

559
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,369
Life has been hard on her.

560
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:00,809
Whenever her child

561
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,049
got sick,

562
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,490
she'd stay up around the clock.

563
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:05,410
I didn't think of it at first.

564
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:06,569
But then, I realized

565
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:08,329
that we must have some medicine on hand.

566
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,450
You're pretty amazing.

567
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,809
You notice details others miss.

568
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:14,730
Your proposal

569
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:16,450
was truly outstanding.

570
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:19,410
Are you okay?

571
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:21,049
You're praising me again.

572
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,210
Should I post about this?

573
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:24,450
Visible only

574
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,450
to Jiang Chen.

575
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:29,480
(Mr. Lin)

576
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,160
Oh no!

577
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:38,809
Sorry, I wasted it.

578
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:39,650
It's okay.

579
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,769
Answer the call.

580
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:41,410
I got this.

581
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,129
Sorry.

582
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:42,632
It's fine.

583
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,369
Hello, Mr. Lin.

584
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,289
I've put

585
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:58,490
the original file back.

586
00:24:58,809 --> 00:24:59,930
I'll head home now.

587
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,849
I'll stay.

588
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,569
What's wrong?

589
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,809
You seem off

590
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:06,730
since that call.

591
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,256
It's nothing.

592
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:10,728
Alright then.

593
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,288
Ren Jiatong.

594
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,849
I know why you want to win.

595
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:17,809
I can relate.

596
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:26,250
I didn't get your bubble tea today.

597
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:27,970
But thank you

598
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:28,776
for the walnuts.

599
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,609
Thank your sister too.

600
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,010
Take some medicine.

601
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,890
I'm leaving. Bye.

602
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,490
♪You said tonight's
moonlight is so beautiful♪

603
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:08,849
♪I said yes it is♪

604
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,089
How do you know I'm here?

605
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:19,490
You didn't reply to my text.

606
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,010
Your things are still there.

607
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,369
So you didn't leave.

608
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,890
So I thought that you might

609
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:25,849
be here.

610
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,792
I was right.

611
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:29,769
Drink with me

612
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:30,690
since you're here.

613
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,450
So unconstrained.

614
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,010
But it's only 5% alcohol.

615
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,410
Trying to get drunk or not?

616
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:40,730
I want to get drunk,

617
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:42,450
but I have work tomorrow.

618
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:44,930
I have review notes to write.

619
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,609
So many things to do.

620
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:47,890
I can't let myself get drunk.

621
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:50,210
Relax, I'll drink with you.

622
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:05,970
Ms. Bai said that

623
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:07,890
I feel inferior because of Yan Fei.

624
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:09,569
She's only partly right.

625
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,010
The person I envy is you.

626
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:16,168
Me?

627
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,010
I envy you for having a lawyer father.

628
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,536
Seriously.

629
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:24,690
You can do anything you want.

630
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,250
But I can't.

631
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,329
Remember when you asked me

632
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:33,170
about the side job I got outside Jun An?

633
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:34,250
You told me it was

634
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,170
your dad's friend.

635
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,890
Not just a friend.

636
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:40,650
He's our creditor.

637
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,129
My dad was indebted to his dad

638
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,450
and couldn't repay.

639
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,250
So I have to pay up.

640
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,329
I suspected a little, but

641
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,250
I didn't expect...

642
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:57,529
That it was so bad.

643
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,690
Let the seniors
handle their own problems.

644
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,569
You don't need to carry

645
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:05,569
such a heavy burden.

646
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,490
But it was my dad's wish.

647
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,010
He died eight years ago.

648
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,450
This is the only thing

649
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:18,329
I can do for him.

650
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,289
I'm afraid that one day,

651
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,329
all traces will be gone
as if he never existed

652
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,529
in this world.

653
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,890
No way.

654
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:31,129
As long as those who love him remain,

655
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,930
he will never vanish.

656
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:34,569
You

657
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,289
and your mom won't let him fade away.

658
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,410
Remember me.

659
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,312
Right?

660
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,930
My mom?

661
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:49,289
She remarried.

662
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,129
Just now I received

663
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,529
a call from her current husband.

664
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,129
He's actually not a bad person.

665
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:55,769
But we

666
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,490
hardly ever speak.

667
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,970
Can you believe it?

668
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,490
Someone who never calls me

669
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,450
just told me

670
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,010
to call my mom when I'm free.

671
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,809
I always ignore her calls.

672
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:11,289
So she's worried.

673
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,210
She hasn't been well lately.

674
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:15,210
It's absurd.

675
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,049
That's why you're upset today?

676
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,609
I'm not sure.

677
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,650
But I have this feeling,

678
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:30,690
you know?

679
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,490
It's like

680
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,890
everyone has rushed ahead.

681
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:38,369
Only my dad and I are stuck in the past.

682
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,609
I'm scared

683
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:45,849
I'll be homeless.

684
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,104
No way.

685
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:52,520
You have me.

686
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:56,970
I'm with you.

687
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,010
It's late.

688
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:06,930
Let's head back.

689
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,450
Thank you

690
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,930
for keeping me company.

691
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,849
Don't overthink it. Get some rest.

692
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,049
Jiang Chen,

693
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:35,450
I want to fight to the end.

694
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:41,129
I understand.

695
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,210
Thank you.

696
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:52,456
Good night.

697
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:16,730
(A key file)

698
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,170
(is missing in the Hong Da case.)

699
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:18,970
Ren Jiatong,

700
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:20,129
were you the last

701
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:21,609
to handle the original demand letter?

702
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,170
Aside from me, Li Ke also accessed it.

703
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:28,849
I was the one
who borrowed the original copy.

704
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,210
After I scanned it,

705
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,129
Ren Jiatong also took it to make a copy.

706
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:33,730
There were many documents.

707
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,569
I counted them all and put them back

708
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:36,849
in the evidence box.

709
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:38,849
Then I left.

710
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:42,170
Ren Jiatong stayed in the office.

711
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:45,490
S-She was the last to leave.

712
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:48,089
I didn't touch that file again, though.

713
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,569
Should we check
the surveillance footage?

714
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:51,464
Yeah,

715
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,450
let's check it.

716
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:53,970
We did that.

717
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,730
But they placed the evidence box

718
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,690
in a blind spot

719
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,329
yesterday.

720
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,930
Since there is no surveillance footage,

721
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,170
we must report to

722
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,010
the Talent Hunt Program overseers.

723
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,250
Mr. Zhuang, Mr. Song, and I

724
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,369
will come up with

725
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,010
a solution.

726
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:14,809
For now,

727
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,650
you're on hold.

728
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,769
During this period,

729
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,369
don't take on any tasks.

730
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,089
What happened?

731
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,609
The demand letter

732
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,569
of the Hong Da case is missing.

733
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,809
Ren Jiatong and I
were the last to handle it.

734
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:53,250
Only you two were here last night.

735
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,369
Evidence doesn't vanish into thin air.

736
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,650
It's either you or...

737
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:00,650
So they're trying

738
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,730
to determine
which one of you is accountable.

739
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:19,752
Jiang Chen.

740
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:21,529
I saw you returning

741
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:22,209
when I left.

742
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,490
Ren Jiatong was

743
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,529
the last to leave, right?

744
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,450
Stop speculating.

745
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,049
Let's try to help

746
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:37,810
after work.

747
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:00,850
Jiatong, take it easy.

748
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:02,330
All these top talents

749
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,810
have seen everything at Jun An.

750
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,410
They will find out the truth.

751
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:09,249
What's wrong? You okay?

752
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:10,490
Do me a favor.

753
00:35:10,729 --> 00:35:11,330
Stand here.

754
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,930
I want to recreate
what happened that night.

755
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:14,920
Got it.

756
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:21,249
Could it be that

757
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,930
someone opened the window last night?

758
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:24,330
Maybe the wind

759
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,689
blew the paper to the ground.

760
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,450
How could the file just vanish?

761
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:37,490
You think it got shredded by accident?

762
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,649
Li Ke was closer to the shredder.

763
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,089
He did it?

764
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,209
It could also have been me.

765
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,010
I got distracted answering a call.

766
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:56,729
Not a great call, either.

767
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:58,649
Then I came back to work.

768
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:00,330
If I had taken the papers

769
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,129
unconsciously over to the shredder,

770
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:03,169
it's totally possible.

771
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:05,569
But I don't remember.

772
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:07,209
Also,

773
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:09,490
I drank last night.

774
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:12,290
Of course, I want to prove it wasn't me.

775
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,169
But it can't be Li Ke.

776
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,169
He wouldn't lie.

777
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,689
You're having a fever.

778
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:29,529
Either way, we need evidence.

779
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:31,249
I have to find proof.

780
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:32,330
You're unwell.

781
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,569
You should go home and rest.

782
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:40,520
(Jiang Chen)

783
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:42,088
Hello.

784
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,490
Xiaoyu.

785
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,609
Are you with Ren Jiatong?

786
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,609
Where are you?

787
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,930
I'm in the print room

788
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:49,770
with Jiatong.

789
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:55,049
I know you're under pressure

790
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:56,249
to prove your innocence.

791
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,450
But you have a fever.

792
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,810
Health comes first, right?

793
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:00,490
Ms. Bai said you shouldn't

794
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,410
do anything

795
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,370
during this period.

796
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,609
Just go home and rest.

797
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:04,850
I'll keep an eye on Ms. Bai

798
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,970
and Mr. Zhou, okay?

799
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:08,290
What's the point of that?

800
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:10,569
I have to find the evidence

801
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:12,169
and prove my innocence.

802
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,850
Nothing anyone says will help.

803
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,536
Ms. Bai.

804
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:19,649
Ren Jiatong has a fever

805
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:20,930
but she refuses to rest.

806
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,649
Failing to rest when needed

807
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:25,370
is stupider than slacking off.

808
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,089
I'm really fine.

809
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:28,968
I won't keep a disobedient trainee.

810
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,376
I'll listen.

811
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,129
I'll go home now.

812
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,129
Let's see a doctor.

813
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,729
No need. I'll just take some medicine.

814
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,169
It's not the end of the world.

815
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,850
Take a short break.

816
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,450
It's going to be fine.

817
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:36,410
Stop comforting me.

818
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:37,410
I can handle this.

819
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,490
I wouldn't bother comforting you.

820
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,609
Someone asked me to ease your mind

821
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:44,729
and get you home safely.

822
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:46,850
Thank Guo Xiaoyu for me.

823
00:38:47,689 --> 00:38:48,890
She's much younger than me,

824
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,089
yet she's taking care of me.

825
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,450
I'm a bit embarrassed.

826
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:56,410
She's not the only one
who cares about you.

827
00:38:58,529 --> 00:38:59,169
Thank you too.

828
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,432
Right,

829
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:05,129
did Ms. Bai tell you how long

830
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:06,410
you'll have to wait?

831
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,569
She said she'd discuss it
with Mr. Zhuang and Mr. Song.

832
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,850
Mr. Song will be back in two days.

833
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,930
The results for this round
will be announced then.

834
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:18,089
I've never seen you so flustered before.

835
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,490
Because I'm not sure

836
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,490
if it was my mistake.

837
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,249
Even if it was,

838
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:32,970
it wasn't intentional.

839
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,609
I hate this powerless feeling.

840
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,689
Ever since my dad died,

841
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:39,649
I've told myself

842
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,089
never to put myself

843
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,569
in such a passive situation again.

844
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,609
So no matter what happens,

845
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,890
I try my best to keep my life and work

846
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:49,729
under my control.

847
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:50,890
But...

848
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,689
But

849
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,970
you're human, not a god.

850
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:55,010
Don't push yourself so hard.

851
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:15,890
We're here.

852
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,890
Take some medicine and sleep tight.

853
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:20,249
It might be a brand new day tomorrow.

854
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:21,729
Thank you.

855
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:38,770
(Yan Fei to Jiang Chen)

856
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,729
Mission accomplished.

857
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,770
But you're not

858
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,370
on her thank-you list.

859
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:47,528
Mr. Zhou.

860
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:54,770
Mr. Zhou.

861
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,970
Can you just tell me

862
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:01,450
how the firm will handle this matter?

863
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:03,784
Li Ke.

864
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,049
Be honest with me.

865
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,850
What happened?

866
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:12,370
Mr. Zhou.

867
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:14,450
I didn't do it. You know me.

868
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,609
I'd never do that.

869
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:16,209
It wasn't me.

870
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:17,290
I don't know

871
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,169
how it disappeared.

872
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:19,249
Calm down.

873
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,450
This is indeed a serious matter.

874
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:23,290
Original copies

875
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,129
must never be lost, regardless

876
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,529
of their significance.

877
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:29,410
Or we lose the client's trust.
It's the bottom line.

878
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,609
I understand, Mr. Zhou.

879
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,729
But I finally got a win.

880
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:34,089
I'd be in first place.

881
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:35,290
I've never been number one.

882
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,649
It's my moment.

883
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:37,890
Please help me, okay?

884
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,049
First,

885
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:39,850
there's no evidence.

886
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,410
Second,

887
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:42,209
as your supervising lawyer,

888
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,609
I can't make any promises.

889
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,490
I'm just scared that
if something happens,

890
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:54,930
my sister will be disappointed.

891
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:57,490
I don't want her to have any regrets.

892
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:58,632
What about you?

893
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:02,569
You don't want her to have regrets.

894
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,089
What about you?

895
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,490
Is this your sister's dream or yours?

896
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:11,609
Is there a difference?

897
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:13,930
She told me to be a lawyer

898
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,089
when I was still in college.

899
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,810
So joining a Red Circle Firm

900
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,330
became my sole ambition.

901
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:21,370
Her dream is my dream.

902
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,088
Alright.

903
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,290
Then find a way to stay.

904
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:27,569
Mr. Zhou.

905
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:29,490
Do you trust me?

906
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:33,850
I only trust facts.

907
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,488
Li Ke.

908
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:42,890
Lawyers meet

909
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,529
all kinds of people.

910
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:47,209
No matter what,

911
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,569
the best thing we can offer them

912
00:42:49,729 --> 00:42:50,770
is never pity.

913
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:54,010
We do our absolute best

914
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,729
to help them.

915
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,770
I promised our mentor

916
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:58,569
to look out for you.

917
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:59,569
I want you to stay.

918
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:01,490
But all I can say

919
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:03,609
is find evidence

920
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:05,810
to defend yourself.

921
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,176
Understand?

922
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:14,450
Understood.

923
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,000
(What is
"Litigation to Drive Negotiation"?)

924
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,536
(It's a strategy where you
file a lawsuit or initiate arbitration)

925
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:20,200
(to push the resolution
through negotiation.)

926
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,992
(The goal isn't to fight
to the bitter end,)

927
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:23,560
(but to use legal action as a means of)

928
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,000
(applying pressure
and creating bargaining chips.)

929
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,664
(The ultimate aim
is to drive a more favorable)

930
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:28,028
(and efficient negotiated settlement.)
