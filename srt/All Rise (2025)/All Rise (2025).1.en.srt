189
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,061
You're the law student.

190
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,860
Check what this means!

191
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,380
These people rented my apartment,

192
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,221
and now they refuse to pay?

193
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:37,860
Exactly!

194
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,380
How dare they cheat us?

195
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,181
I hereby formally declare.

196
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,620
- Before understanding the issues,
- I'm not afraid!

197
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:46,740
if anyone...

198
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,140
I've only read about this in textbooks

199
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,260
- and never seen real cases.
- ...damages our company's reputation,

200
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:52,140
we will

201
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:53,941
take legal action.

202
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:57,260
We'll pursue all legal liabilities.

203
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,301
Everyone involved in this disturbance

204
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,421
will face compensation demands

205
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,500
and potential imprisonment.

206
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,821
- What?
- Well...

207
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,101
Let me see that.

208
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,821
They owe us money!

209
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:19,660
Show me that legal statement.

210
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:20,552
Fine.

211
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,581
I'll show you.

212
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,941
Let this young lady examine it

213
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,020
and educate you.

214
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:26,981
Read it aloud.

215
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,260
In this case,

216
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:32,981
as the apartment lessee,

217
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,701
I'll draft a formal response.

218
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:40,740
Will this work?

219
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:48,101
What is this?

220
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:48,740
I don't know.

221
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:54,472
(Reply letter)

222
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:58,061
Your party has
committed breach of contract.

223
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,860
This formal notice demands

224
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:02,461
immediate rectification of violations.

225
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,061
Failure to comply will

226
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,581
result in all available legal measures

227
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:07,140
to hold you accountable.

228
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:08,020
That's it.

229
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,221
- Well done!
- Well done!

230
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:09,928
Excellent.

231
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
She knows the law!

232
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,221
Impressive. We've got an expert here

233
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:15,701
with commanding presence!

234
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,061
Let me remind you.

235
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,500
If you haven't forgotten

236
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,981
what you learned at Law School,

237
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:23,221
handwritten letters hold legal validity.

238
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,701
- Well done!
- Well done!

239
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:29,620
Wait, young lady!

240
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,620
Which law school did you graduate from?

241
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,660
Playing lawyer here?

242
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,140
Law School at Jingbei University.
I work at Jun An Law Firm.

243
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,101
It's Jun An.

244
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,061
Any more questions?

245
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,620
Jun An?

246
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,421
Let's go in.

247
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:43,061
Wait.

248
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,380
Everyone, listen!

249
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,301
Is Jun An famous?

250
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,581
Jun An is one of the top law firms.

251
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,620
I also work there.

252
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:54,941
She also works there.

253
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:56,701
- So we have hope to defend our rights.
- She's

254
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,061
Ren Jiatong.

255
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,221
Ren Jiatong.

256
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:01,500
Ren Jiatong.

257
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,900
Hello.

258
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
Could you help me check

259
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,540
my landlord's contact information?

260
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,140
I live in Wanjia Garden.

261
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,860
Building 13, Unit 2, Apartment 602.

262
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,061
Okay, I'll help you check.

263
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:17,640
Found it.

264
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,301
Thanks.

265
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,461
Yes.

266
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:28,780
I'll take a call.

267
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:30,020
Go ahead.

268
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:30,941
Hello?

269
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,821
Who's this?

270
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,424
Hello?

271
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:38,221
Hello, madam.

272
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,301
I'm the tenant of your house.

273
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,000
You changed the locks
without telling me.

274
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:46,301
But even as the owner,

275
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,341
without the tenant's consent,

276
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,821
you forcibly entered the house,

277
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,701
which is suspected of illegal intrusion.

278
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,941
It violates the Law on Security
Administration Punishments or Criminal Law.

279
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,020
Once I call the police,

280
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,301
at least, you'll get fined.

281
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,461
At worse, you might even
be detained or imprisoned.

282
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,461
Please give me the key.

283
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
According to the law,

284
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,981
a landlord has no right
to evict tenants.

285
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:08,500
Tenants have the right, under the lease,

286
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,260
to continue living.

287
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Hold on.

288
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,960
(Law School at Haryald University)

289
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,540
Hello, Miss Ren.

290
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:32,860
I'm Jiang Chen.

291
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,101
This is my aunt.

292
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:42,981
It's the contract between my aunt

293
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:43,821
and Warm Nest.

294
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:45,860
It's essentially a sublease agreement.

295
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,461
That is to say,

296
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:48,740
my aunt leased her property

297
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,900
to Warm Nest Apartments

298
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,981
which then subleased it to you.

299
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:54,821
Neither of you has
a direct contract relationship,

300
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:56,140
so you have no right

301
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,900
to demand my aunt

302
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,500
to ensure your continued tenancy.

303
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:00,181
Since you acknowledge

304
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:02,301
there's no contract
between me and the landlord,

305
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:03,981
then based on
the relativity of contracts,

306
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,540
the landlord also has no right

307
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,380
to evict me based on Warm Nest's failure

308
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,941
to pay the rent.

309
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:10,461
But you need to note

310
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,101
that my aunt is now

311
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,260
not basing her request to vacate
on the contract,

312
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,380
but on her rights as a property owner

313
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,341
to ask you to leave.

314
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,061
If your legal knowledge

315
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:21,101
hasn't been forgotten,

316
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,020
you should remember

317
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,301
that property ownership rights
are absolute.

318
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:28,421
(Are property rights absolute? Yes.)

319
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,581
At least as of today,

320
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:31,821
your aunt hasn't terminated the contract

321
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:33,061
with Warm Nest.

322
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:35,181
So my lease with Warm Nest Apartments

323
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:35,900
is still valid.

324
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,341
I still have the right
to legally occupy this rental.

325
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,581
I understand.

326
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:40,461
- But...
- Chen,

327
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,260
call your dad.

328
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:43,941
His Ruocheng Law Firm

329
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,461
is not any worse than Jun An.

330
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,421
If it doesn't work,

331
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,701
we'll go to court.

332
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,380
We also have lawyers.

333
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,020
I don't recommend
going the litigation route.

334
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,341
The time and financial costs
are very high.

335
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:04,821
Actually, you two can negotiate.

336
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,581
I don't know if you're willing.

337
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:09,821
You pay another month's rent.

338
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:11,821
You let her stay for another month.

339
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,461
You can both keep an eye on

340
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:14,421
how things develop.

341
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:17,981
Alright.

342
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:20,341
I'll listen to you.

343
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,061
This whole night has been exhausting.

344
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:29,581
What about you?

345
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:32,461
Do you accept my proposal?

346
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:36,072
Deal.

347
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:42,728
Miss Ren.

348
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,140
You work at Jun An, right?

349
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:47,701
We'll meet again.

350
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:13,941
What's going on with you?

351
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,860
Why didn't you answer my calls?

352
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,941
I just want to ask when is your payday.

353
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:22,380
Don't let creditors come knocking again.

354
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,821
Don't make Mr. Lin unhappy.

355
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,581
I'm not scolding you.

356
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,061
You had a stable job before,

357
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:28,221
but you insisted on quitting.

358
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,581
Who knows if you'll stay this time.

359
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,260
This is your dad's fault.

360
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,660
Just pay back the money
as soon as possible.

361
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,620
Only then can we live properly.

362
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,296

I'll start tomorrow morning.)

00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:04,701
If you're not,

376
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:05,540
I will

377
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,100
(Dad)
call the hotel to wake you!

378
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,688
(Jiang Chen)

379
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:44,936
(Miss Ren.)

380
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,701
You work at Jun An, right?

381
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:48,901
We'll meet again.

382
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,701
Yan Da, will you ever stop?

383
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,221
I got three calls already this morning

384
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:12,260
from Lawyer Xu who worked with Xingke,

385
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,661
Lawyer Li claiming to be your friend,

386
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
and a receptionist waiting downstairs.

387
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,100
When did you meet many Jun An people?

388
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,260
More friends watching over you
eases my mind.

389
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,861
You are my little sister.

390
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:24,661
If anyone bullies you, it should be me.

391
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,901
No outsiders can do that.

392
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,540
Oh, come off it!

393
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,861
Don't interfere. Bye!

394
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,421
Hey?

395
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:34,540
Fei, are you okay?

396
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:37,621
What's wrong with you?

397
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:39,780
Watch the road!

398
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,661
Didn't see my signal?

399
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:41,580
I had right of way.

400
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,780
Even so, watch the road.

401
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,780
Why didn't you yield?

402
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,780
Call the cops.

403
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:45,621
No more talking.

404
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,701
You're not leaving.

405
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,381
Sure.

406
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,941
You're in a hurry?

407
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:50,500
You can't go.

408
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,820
Are you hurt?

409
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,901
Are you alright?

410
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:04,020
Help your wife into
my car. I'll take you.

411
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,300
We were carpooling. Not my wife.

412
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:07,981
I'm on my way to work.

413
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,100
It really hurts.

414
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,381
Hand me your phone.

415
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,260
Don't be scared.

416
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:15,340
Follow me.

417
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,260
Thanks.

418
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,621
Lend a hand here!

419
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,981
She's not your wife,
but couldn't you be a helper?

420
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,060
No one's stopping you doing good deeds,

421
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,861
but I'm an unrelated single man.

422
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:25,500
Helping her?

423
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,381
If something happens,
how could I explain?

424
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,580
Relax.

425
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,500
I study law.

426
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,740
I'll handle the explanations.

427
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:32,260
Actually,

428
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,701
I happen to study law too.

429
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:38,221
Unbelievable.

430
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,780
Don't panic.

431
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,181
Get out of the car.

432
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:43,181
Let's go.

433
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,540
We'll be there soon.

434
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,260
Easy now.

435
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,221
Good morning.

436
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:08,100
I'm Zhou Nian,

437
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:09,500
a fourth-year lawyer here.

438
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:10,760
(Zhou Nian, 30, M&A Group 2)

439
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,780
I'm responsible

440
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,780
for group assignments.

441
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:15,300
Consider me your mentor.

442
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,421
Feel free to approach me anytime.

443
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,540
Follow me, please.

444
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,941
Jun An Law Firm,

445
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,540
established in the early 1990s,

446
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,621
is one of top Red Circle Firms.

447
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,661
The program is

448
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,060
a big competition

449
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,661
organized by Director Zhuang Xin.

450
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,060
It's also

451
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,861
the eighth program
in our 30-year history.

452
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:34,621
You all managed to stand out

453
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:35,500
and join the program.

454
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:37,780
This is your chance.

455
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,740
The entire program lasts three months.

456
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,901
(Mission)
It's divided into seven rounds.

457
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,701
Each round has one or multiple missions.

458
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,941
Points will accumulate.

459
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,820
Each round, we'll eliminate
the lowest performers based on points.

460
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,580
With total score
across all rounds tallied,

461
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,181
final offers will be determined
by final rankings and scores.

462
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,901
Besides,

463
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,820
we'll be combining

464
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,141
team system and lawyer pool,
a dual-track system.

465
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:04,421
Beyond formal assignments,

466
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,461
(Office, Bai Xiao)
you can earn points

467
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:07,580
from the lawyer pool.

468
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,461
These will be your workstations.

469
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,141
For three months, you're all candidates.

470
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:15,060
Only the ultimate winners

471
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:17,181
will secure full-time internships

472
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:17,981
along with bonus.

473
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,461
You'll have a handsome salary

474
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,540
and mentorship

475
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,221
from partners.

476
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:22,740
However,

477
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,621
only one or two spots exist.

478
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,440
Therefore,

479
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,340
from the moment you entered Jun An,

480
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,780
you became competitors.

481
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:32,780
One final reminder,

482
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,661
this isn't a learning environment.

483
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,661
You must prove

484
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,060
that you're exactly who Jun An needs.

485
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,540
Best of the best.

486
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,100
Starting today,

487
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:44,181
your primary daily focus should be

488
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:47,020
simple survival in this program.

489
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,941
Are you all ready?

490
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,384
(Talent Hunt Program)

491
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:04,136
(Jun An Law Firm)

492
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:07,576
(Red Circle Firms,)

493
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:09,536
(known as a colloquial term,)

494
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:10,836
(refer to the top law firms)

495
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,128
(in China's legal service industry.)

496
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:17,384
Hello.

497
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:18,540
I have a question.

498
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,141
What are the team system
and lawyer pool?

499
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:23,020
I don't get it.

500
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,981
The team system means

501
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:28,540
if you survive the elimination rounds,

502
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:29,540
lawyers will draft you.

503
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:30,500
Then,

504
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,060
you'll join their practice group,

505
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,340
working directly under them.

506
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:35,141
The lawyer pool means

507
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,981
we're firm-wide interns.

508
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:38,941
Any lawyer can put us

509
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,461
to work.

510
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,221
We'll be worked to death!

511
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,901
Red Circle Firms are famous
for brutal hours

512
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,260
and fat paychecks.

513
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,221
They grind lawyers down.

514
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,100
Take litigation lawyers.

515
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:54,181
If they leave by 10:00 PM,

516
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:55,661
it's considered early.

517
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,060
Non-litigation lawyers

518
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:58,820
are basically on standby.

519
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:01,421
If you can't handle it, just leave.

520
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:05,701
I'm a professional. I'm used to it.

521
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:09,416
Thank you.

522
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,288
Mr. Zhuang,

523
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:15,740
the list of lawyers qualifying

524
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,500
for limited equity partnership

525
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,260
via three-year revenue benchmarks
is in your inbox.

526
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:21,621
After committee consultation,

527
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,740
preliminary review is set
for next month.

528
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,901
I've cleared your schedule

529
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:26,792
for that timeframe.

530
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:27,336
Additionally,

531
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:28,941
Warm Nest Apartments' legal director

532
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:30,260
suddenly came this morning.

533
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:31,941
He requests us

534
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:33,500
as their new retained counsel

535
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,100
to lead settlement negotiations.

536
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,901
He requested Ms. Bai's involvement.

537
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,461
Please welcome Director Zhuang Xin,

538
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:41,941
our founding partner.

539
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:45,960
Everyone.

540
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:46,901
Good morning.

541
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:47,820
Sit down.

542
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,552
Sit.

543
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,221
As a founding partner,

544
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,861
Mr. Zhuang has championed

545
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:55,941
this talent development initiative.

546
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,064
(Zhuang Xin, 53,
Director of Jun An Law Firm)

547
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:57,981
We'll now begin

548
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:00,060
with one-minute self-introductions.

549
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:01,500
Volunteers?

550
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll go.

551
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:06,120
Go ahead.

552
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:11,260
Hello, I'm Guo Xiaoyu.

553
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,141
I have diverse hobbies.

554
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,701
I love photography and Hanfu culture.

555
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm a weeb, in fact.

556
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,500
I'm also a total milk tea addict.

557
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,060
So whenever you want milk tea,

558
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,340
just feel free

559
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:29,100
to place group orders with me.

560
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,820
At school, teachers

561
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:32,820
and classmates

562
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,260
love teaming up with me.

563
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:37,820
My biggest strength is,

564
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,340
I'm thick-skinned yet resilient.

565
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,100
Most troubles fade away

566
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,540
after I have a good cry.

567
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:44,580
As long as I want,

568
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,740
I can stay happy every single day.

569
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,780
Thank you.

570
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,820
Good.

571
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,221
One question.

572
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,901
What's a weeb?

573
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,020
I don't know either.

574
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,408
Well...

575
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:04,616
Please.

576
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:07,141
I'm Wang Lu.

577
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,648
(Wang Lu, 25, Law School at Huaqing University)
I previously interned at Jun An.

578
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:09,580
(Third-year combined bachelor's
and master's student)

579
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,701
This program is so good.

580
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,701
So I applied to transfer
from regular internship

581
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:15,221
to the program candidate.

582
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,181
My advantage over others

583
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,701
is my prior experience here.

584
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,941
After all, I've worked here for months,

585
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:22,421
so feel free to ask me

586
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:23,381
any questions.

587
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:34,540
Hello, sir.

588
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:35,740
I'm Li Ke.

589
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,981
It's L I, Li,

590
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:38,740
and K E, Ke.

591
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,740
I consider myself

592
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:47,780
experienced in practical work

593
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,580
and academically competent.

594
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,100
I interned

595
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,181
at the Provincial High People's Court

596
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:56,421
and got involved in
university-level research projects.

597
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:58,580
Also,

598
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,901
I am

599
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,060
an alumnus of Lawyer Zhou Nian.

600
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:08,300
Li Ke, don't get cocky.

601
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:10,440
Sit.

602
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,141
I've reviewed your resumes.

603
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:20,621
You're not the best.

604
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,861
One female candidate here

605
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:24,981
interned at the Supreme Court
as undergrad

606
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,181
and published solo-authored paper

607
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,820
in core journal during grad school.

608
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,540
Who's this superstar?

609
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:33,736
Ren Jiatong.

610
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,340
Holy moly!

611
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:41,621
Very impressive.

612
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,740
Mr. Zhuang.

613
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,661
Pardon the interruption.

614
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,260
Mr. Zhuang, I've confirmed

615
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,500
that Ren Jiatong
impersonated our lawyer.

616
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,780
She's a Talent Hunt Program candidate,

617
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,901
not on official roster.

618
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,020
That's why she was missed.

619
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,461
Last night,

620
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:06,221
someone posed as your lawyer.

621
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,500
We verified it overnight.

622
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,701
There's no such lawyer at Jun An

623
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:12,141
Mr. Zhuang, we're sincere

624
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:13,740
about switching to Jun An.

625
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:14,901
But with this incident,

626
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:16,060
you need to give us

627
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:18,020
a proper explanation.

628
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,260
How will we handle this?

629
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:21,661
Okay, got it.

630
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,661
You may leave.

631
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,912
Okay.

632
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,580
Proceed.

633
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,060
Esteemed lawyers and candidates,

634
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,941
I'm Jiang Chen, studying at
Law School of Haryald.

635
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,300
I once interned at
Latham Simpson Law Firm in the US.

636
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,820
He's truly impressive.

637
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,820
Latham Simpson Law Firm

638
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,780
is known as the nerd crusher

639
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,500
and only accepts top six law grads.

640
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,100
I hear Mr. Zhuang favors him.

641
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:47,580
During interview, he said,

642
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:48,901
"This is our guy."

643
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,060
Through this program,

644
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,981
I hope to find

645
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,461
worthy rivals

646
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:55,141
and true friends.

647
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,461
Mr. Zhuang, pardon me.

648
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,500
I'm late.

649
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,020
Your brother called me this morning.

650
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,060
He said you did a good deed

651
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,300
on your way to work.

652
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:12,552
Right?

653
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,320
No big deal.

654
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:14,461
Have a seat.

655
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,621
Find a spot.

656
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,340
So you are

657
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,981
a lawyer from Jun An.

658
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,740
Hello, I'm Ren Jiatong.
I graduated from Jingbei University.

659
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:49,861
Mr. Zhou.

660
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,141
Mr. Zhou.

661
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:52,820
Could you tell me

662
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,421
the ranking from this interview?

663
00:29:58,221 --> 00:29:59,100
Guo Xiaoyu.

664
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:01,221
Last place.

665
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,376
Mr. Zhuang.

666
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,661
Jiang Chen.

667
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,941
I'm thrilled to join the program.

668
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,141
I wonder if you have time

669
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:12,141
to have dinner with us?

670
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:14,981
I've scheduled a dinner with a client.

671
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,941
He's got some nerve.

672
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:19,221
He dares to ask Mr. Zhuang out directly.

673
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:21,576
How about this?

674
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:23,060
Let me know

675
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,381
if you're free tomorrow.

676
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,580
I should be available

677
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,701
all day tomorrow.

678
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:27,740
I'm not sure yet

679
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,901
about my exact schedule.

680
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,500
Well, review your work plan.

681
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,981
Call me when it's convenient.

682
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:32,941
Thank you.

683
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:33,704
Alright.

684
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,340
His Ruocheng Law Firm

685
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,901
is not any worse than Jun An.

686
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,820
If it doesn't work,

687
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,100
we'll go to court.

688
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:44,820
We also have lawyers.

689
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:49,414
(Jiang Ruocheng)

690
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,364
(Jiang Ruocheng's Profile)

691
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:52,141
(Ruocheng Law Firm)

692
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,820
Lawyer Ren Jiatong

693
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,240
at Jun An.

694
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,461
Glad to see you. Just call me Jiang.

695
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,020
I hope you'll
keep yesterday's matter confidential.

696
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:14,100
I don't owe you confidentiality.

697
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:17,260
If you agree to keep quiet,

698
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,461
(Jiang Ruocheng)
I'll keep this a secret too.

699
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:23,540
Impressive.

700
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,181
I don't know where you found this,

701
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,260
but I can be quiet,

702
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:29,500
provided that this ends here.

703
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:32,260
Deal.

704
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,740
A Haryald elite should know

705
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,661
oral agreements
hold legal weight, right?

706
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,981
An agreement

707
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:42,181
is an agreement.

708
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:46,600
(Ren Jiatong)

709
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,701
I've prepared small gifts for everyone.

710
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,941
Hope you'll like them.

711
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:54,981
Thank you.

712
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:57,901
Guo Xiaoyu.

713
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,176
Thanks.

714
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:02,580
The decorations on your desk are cute.

715
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:05,901
I doubt

716
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:08,020
if they and I can

717
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,941
survive this week.

718
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,264
Go for it!

719
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:16,040
Huang Yue.

720
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,160
Thank you.

721
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,461
Ren Jiatong.

722
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:20,456
Thanks.

723
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,260
Jiang Chen.

724
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,808
Thank you.

725
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:26,941
Li Ke.

726
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:27,540
Thanks.

727
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:33,960
(Xingke Group)

728
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:35,580
Xingke Group?

729
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:38,568
Wang Lu.

730
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,288
Thank you.

731
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:45,896
Yan Fei.

732
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,020
Sorry about earlier.

733
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
I had urgent business

734
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,340
so I left.

735
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,701
Is that pregnant woman okay?

736
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,181
Don't worry.

737
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,421
The pregnant woman is fine.

738
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,060
But I learned from you

739
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,260
what makes an excellent lawyer

740
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,300
and how to mitigate risks.

741
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,060
Yan Fei.

742
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,421
I reject your accusation.

743
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:13,060
First, I couldn't help objectively.

744
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,632
Second, humans are unpredictable.

745
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,701
If she blamed me for the injury

746
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,661
and sued for damages,

747
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:18,500
I'd defend myself.

748
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:19,421
Finally,

749
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,381
this morning was crucial for me.

750
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:22,941
Had I taken her to hospital,

751
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:24,740
it could've ruined my career.

752
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:26,901
I might become the first one eliminated,

753
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:27,861
losing this offer.

754
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:28,740
I refuse.

755
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,060
This your license plate?

756
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,421
Your phone number?

757
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,740
How did you get my number?

758
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,901
You recited it yourself.

759
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:51,976
Hello?

760
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,060
I'm taking your wife to the hospital.

761
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,300

764
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,941
Is it hard to memorize?

765
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,300
I remember your license plate
and phone number.

766
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:06,661
Once I finish my work,

767
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,821
I'll contact you and the hospital

768
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:10,620
to know the pregnant woman's condition.

769
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:11,861
As lawyers,

770
00:34:11,861 --> 00:34:12,461
we must

771
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:14,020
distinguish the priority of matters.

772
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,700
I just want to say

773
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:17,580
that besides avoiding risks,

774
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,700
recording crucial information promptly

775
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,861
and making sound decisions are also

776
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,421
essential qualities of a good lawyer.

777
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,261

778

783

793
