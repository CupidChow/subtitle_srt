Jiatong.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,416
Look.

30
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,350
He Fan said online

31
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,791
Ms. Bai used improper persuasive
and aggressive questioning,

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,071
causing her excessive mental stress
and fainting.

33
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:06,591
I'm so pissed off!

34
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,328
(Bai Xiao used coercion and persuasion,)
All the comments below attack Ms. Bai.

35
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:08,910
(caused me excessive mental stress)

36
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,711
(and symptoms of hallucination.)
How could this happen?

37
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:10,591
(I even fainted from mental stress.)
I'm furious.

38
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,431
Even Ms. Bai can be cyberbullied.

39
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,910
Then,

40
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,711
I might as well pack up and go home.

41
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,711
(If your home needs support,)

42
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:24,311
(just ask.)

43
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:25,391
Remember to call me.

44
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:26,472
Remember.

45
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,070
Jun An trains lawyers.

46
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,790
Not robots.

47
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,720
Jiatong.

48
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:33,736
Jiatong.

49
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,470
I should've accompanied

50
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:39,470
Ms. Bai there.

51
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:47,784
(Jiatong, I saw this online.)

52
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:50,472
(Why does it say she's your mentor?)

53
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:53,448
(Didn't you say
she wasn't coaching your competition?)

54
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:55,528
(Jiatong, you mustn't have
any contact with her.)

55
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,350
Had breakfast yet?

56
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:58,831
I got an extra sandwich.

57
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,670
No, thank you.

58
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:01,230
No appetite.

59
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,910
- Worried about your mom?
- Worried about Ms. Bai.

60
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:08,031
I am, too.

61
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:10,190
But there's always a way.

62
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:12,470
Large-scale online bullying of a lawyer

63
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,871
often relates to their case.

64
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:14,991
Or...

65
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,711
relates to some interests.

66
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:19,910
I considered Eddie.

67
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,271
But could there be others?

68
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,431
You suspect Ms. Bai?

69
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,670
I won't suspect anyone

70
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,230
without proof.

71
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,510
Has Ms. Bai arrived?

72
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,470
I'm absolutely furious.

73
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,831
Why is being a lawyer so hard nowadays?

74
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:40,271
Besides occupational hazards
like lumbar strain,

75
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:41,871
Insomnia and anxiety,

76
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:43,431
we have to endure cyberbullying too?

77
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,510
I've never seen

78
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,151
such a dedicated professional before.

79
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:48,151
If even she has to endure this,

80
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:48,950
my faith

81
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,790
in justice will completely collapse.

82
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,190
When we caused trouble before,

83
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,991
Ms. Bai might've said harsh things.

84
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,391
But she always had our backs.

85
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,271
So now, we must stay calm
and pull ourselves together.

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,111
I looked at this Weibo post.

87
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,991
Although there are

88
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,391
indeed many cyberbullies,

89
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,311
the top comment supports Ms. Bai.

90
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:08,936
Look.

91
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,190
They're releasing more.

92
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:22,071
Step one,

93
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,711
at 2 AM,

94
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,751
leak info when everyone's asleep.

95
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,790
This prevents Jun An
from reacting in time.

96
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,071
Step two,

97
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,550
deliberately plant
opposing paid commenters

98
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,591
to argue in the comments.

99
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,071
One side calls Ms. Bai a killer lawyer.

100
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,391
The other says online information

101
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,550
is 80% rumor.

102
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,910
Just for attention and traffic.

103
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,071
Step three,

104
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,031
show evidence when dissed.

105
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,031
Release round two.

106
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,391
Based on my years

107
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,990
of internet surfing experience,

108
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,751
there's only one truth.

109
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:53,352
What?

110
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,031
Someone's deliberately setting this up.

111
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,550
Targeting Ms. Bai.

112
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,191
But why?

113
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:04,910
Whatever the reason,

114
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:05,790
anyway,

115
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,751
I think we should

116
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:07,751
report our suspicions

117
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,511
to the firm.

118
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:10,071
We can't let Ms. Bai be bullied.

119
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:20,136
Ms. Bai.

120
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:22,888
Ms. Bai.

121
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,631
We're investigating who's behind this.

122
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,391
Ms. Bai.

123
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,591
I checked some IP addresses.

124
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:30,591
No discernible pattern.

125
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,990
I've submitted
a complaint to the website,

126
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,470
demanding removal of the video

127
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,910
and banning the main accounts.

128
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,310
Please authorize me.

129
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,408
May I?

130
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,624
Sure.

131
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,951
Thank you.

132
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,310
But

133
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,790
don't let this interfere with

134
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,511
your real work.

135
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,550
Should we just sit back and do nothing,

136
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,310
and let them keep spreading
lies and slandering you?

137
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,391
Twisting the truth,

138
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,310
no principles,

139
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:55,550
only after profit,

140
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:56,391
acting unreasonably,

141
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:57,230
aiding the wicked,

142
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,711
double-dipping...

143
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,031
In all my years as a lawyer,

144
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:02,870
I've heard insults

145
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:04,550
like these and more.

146
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:06,350
If I broke down crying

147
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,391
just because of these,

148
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,470
neglected my real work,

149
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,951
and wasted time on these people,

150
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,071
I might as well
go home and retire early.

151
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,990
Still, thank you all.

152
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:16,990
A reminder for you.

153
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,751
This is your final round.

154
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:20,904
Come on.

155
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,391
No wonder even my role model
couldn't win her over.

156
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,144
Impressive.

157
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:49,608
Come in.

158
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,031
Perfect timing.

159
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,550
Could you spare some of that premium tea

160
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,670
you hoard?

161
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:03,470
I remember you only
drink coffee, never tea.

162
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,790
Back in college,

163
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,151
you always teased me

164
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,350
about my old-man hobby.

165
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,711
Earlier, I overheard Xiaoyu
complaining in the pantry.

166
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,071
She said

167
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:13,751
her exhausting work

168
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:16,511
was probably caused
by that bitter Americano.

169
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,031
That makes sense to me.

170
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,031
Besides, you look

171
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:21,990
quite refreshed after drinking tea.

172
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,310
So I want to try it too.

173
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,271
I'll bring you some later.

174
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,951
By the way, Lucy mentioned

175
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,271
you had two client meetings
scheduled today,

176
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,271
but both were
suddenly canceled by phone.

177
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,591
You don't seem bothered by it.

178
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:37,768
That's normal.

179
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,271
This isn't the first time.

180
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,271
Why not take this chance

181
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,031
to take a break?

182
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,751
Leave the work to me.

183
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:47,071
It's been too long

184
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,230
since you took your girl out.

185
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,591
Use this opportunity

186
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,670
to unwind.

187
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,191
Why are you worrying like those kids?

188
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:55,751
Are you really okay?

189
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:56,872
Yes.

190
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,631
If those people saw you now,

191
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,391
they'd be furious.

192
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,870
Your attitude is admirable.

193
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:07,191
No anger phase.

194
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,470
Just calm.

195
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:10,670
To be honest,

196
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,110
I am pretty angry.

197
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,670
Their slander this time

198
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,031
lacks any creativity.

199
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,151
A few years ago, the rumors

200
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,951
were like,

201
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,031
I had an affair
with a corporate executive,

202
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,151
and left my ex-husband with nothing.

203
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:30,751
And I yelled at clients.

204
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,351
The craziest one.

205
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,830
I was keeping a colleague from the firm.

206
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,310
So dramatic and scandalous.

207
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,550
This time, it's just boring nonsense.

208
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,710
"Keeping a colleague." I like it.

209
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,710
If you need that, I'm available.

210
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,710
Thanks a lot.

211
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:53,288
Alright.

212
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:56,991
Enough jokes. Let's talk business.

213
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,310
We should've done that sooner.

214
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,271
Come.

215
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,031
Walking in pretending to comfort me.

216
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,031
Procedures must be followed.

217
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,670
I reviewed Eddie's records
since joining.

218
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:08,471
(Jiang Yutai)

219
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:10,391
(Asia-Pacific Business Director)
He seems quite driven.

220
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,511
He and Yan Da
are indeed childhood friends.

221
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:14,550
They've gotten along well
these past few years.

222
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,991
But competition might change that.

223
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:19,710
Xingke is a leader
in China's chip industry.

224
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,790
Recently,

225
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:22,310
they've actively expanded overseas.

226
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,310
They're the biggest global rival

227
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,430
to the foreign company Eddie worked for.

228
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,590
Recently,

229
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,070
they've taken APAC share
from Eddie's company.

230
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,430
So the company's competitive motivation

231
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:33,550
makes sense.

232
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,471
But it seems incomplete.

233
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:36,776
Incomplete?

234
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,710
And I've also uncovered something.

235
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,670
The Legal Director of this company

236
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,830
is my old friend.

237
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,152
Ms. Bai.

238
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:51,910
Given your current situation,

239
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:54,631
you should keep these old friends away.

240
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,151
Maintain some distance from them.

241
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,991
I think you're right.

242
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,751
We're old friends, too.

243
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:02,031
How could I be the same?

244
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,190
These flowers

245
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:06,351
are sugarcoated bullets.

246
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:06,991
Unreliable.

247
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,056
Fine.

248
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,790
Out of everyone in this world,

249
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,710
you're the most reliable one, Mr. Song.

250
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:15,511
I never give sugarcoated bullets.

251
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:16,631
What I offer is genuine.

252
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,991
If I ever find out
who's spreading dirt about you,

253
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,391
I'll make sure they learn

254
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:21,430
what real consequences

255
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,871
feel like.

256
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,830
That's some dangerous talk.

257
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,670
You're in non-litigation.

258
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,871
Stop dancing on the edge
of criminal offenses

259
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,070
with reckless testing.

260
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:31,670
Got it?

261
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,190
Enough.

262
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,351
Stop teasing me, will you?

263
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:36,790
To business.

264
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,511
I have a tennis buddy,

265
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:39,391
an industry contact

266
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,910
of Eddie and Yan Da.

267
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,070
We'll eat tomorrow.

268
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,111
You got time?

269
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,792
Yes.

270
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:55,430
All still here.

271
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:56,670
Still working?

272
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:00,430
Don't stay up too late tonight.

273
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,031
Understood, Ms. Bai.

274
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:08,936
Ms. Bai.

275
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:14,888
Thanks.

276
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,511
What's so funny?

277
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:25,960
Here.

278
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,190
I have one too?

279
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,910
Get some calcium.

280
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,351
Still investigating
who planned the leak?

281
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,550
Absolutely.

282
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,830
The internet isn't lawless territory.

283
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,910
If they're unaware,

284
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,590
I'll find them
and educate them properly.

285
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,670
Ms. Bai said she didn't need help.

286
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:44,471
She just

287
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,031
doesn't want to trouble us.

288
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:49,151
Is projecting

289
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,991
our own ideas
onto our superior appropriate?

290
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:54,991
Ms. Bai has
such extensive work experience.

291
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,031
If we can see something,

292
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,070
she can likely see much more.

293
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:01,511
Honestly, I trust her completely.

294
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,550
Ms. Bai is our superior,

295
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,310
but she's also a working woman

296
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,231
and a single mother.

297
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,511
During her work and parenting,

298
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,710
she's surely faced countless challenges.

299
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:14,351
She's long been accustomed
to bearing things alone.

300
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:15,631
She's tough,

301
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:17,151
so she doesn't ask for help.

302
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,590
But she still needs it.

303
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,904
Jiatong.

304
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,751
Just like you before,

305
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,471
claiming you didn't need friends.

306
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,271
But the more I got to know you,

307
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,991
the more I realized
you're warm-hearted inside.

308
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,871
Be honest.

309
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,190
Don't you need me?

310
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,430
Don't you need Yan Fei or Jiang Chen?

311
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:41,511
Plus, didn't I recently gather everyone

312
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,871
to help that young girl together?

313
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,151
I believe people should stick together.

314
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,710
Strong people need to share the load.

315
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:48,776
Do you agree?

316
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:57,471
Hey?

317
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:03,944
Ms. Bai.

318
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:09,710
What is it?

319
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:11,631
Ms. Bai.

320
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,631
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:15,151
I took on He Fan's case,

322
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:16,070
but I didn't show up.

323
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,950
Now, you're being misunderstood.

324
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,430
How is your mother now?

325
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,830
Nothing serious.

326
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,031
Just some mobility issues.

327
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:29,830
She'll be fine.

328
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,368
That's good.

329
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,871
You should make time
to visit her more often.

330
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,790
If that's all,

331
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,991
head back to work.

332
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,310
Let's go.

333
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,751
Let me buy you a drink.

334
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,304
Ms. Bai.

335
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,631
I have another question.

336
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,016
Go ahead.

337
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,871
After you saw the post,

338
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:23,670
was there even for a moment

339
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:26,710
that you believed He Fan did faint?

340
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:28,790
For example,

341
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,751
maybe you said something,

342
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,550
or she genuinely had
poor psychological resilience.

343
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:35,400
Ms. Bai.

344
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:37,790
Are you truly 100% confident?

345
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:39,950
What are you trying to ask me?

346
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:45,231
Do you remember,

347
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:47,351
years ago, you handled

348
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:48,511
a construction accident case?

349
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:51,151
You represented the project client,

350
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,151
while the person involved,

351
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,950
the head of the construction company,

352
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,471
was called Ren Ping.

353
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,511
He was my father.

354
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,670
You spoke with my father back then

355
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,031
about the compensation settlement.

356
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,871
But after that discussion,

357
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:12,391
he died of a sudden heart attack.

358
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:16,631
You were the last person he saw.

359
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,950
I remember.

360
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:22,830
So he was your father.

361
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:27,670
So you think

362
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:30,710
your father's death was because of me?

363
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,590
I studied law too.

364
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,070
I understand your job.

365
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,430
But honestly,

366
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,310
these two things are too coincidental.

367
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,151
It's hard for me not
to connect them and wonder.

368
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,151
On one hand,
I've worked closely with you

369
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:49,670
and spent three months together.

370
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,751
You've taught me so much.

371
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:54,910
I have strong trust
and admiration for you.

372
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:56,631
But at the same time,

373
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:00,950
I can't shake off

374
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,550
this unsettling feeling inside me.

375
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,670
He was my father.

376
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,271
I can't be purely rational.

377
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,830
I don't want to keep guessing.

378
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,631
I want to ask you directly.

379
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,670
I appreciate your honesty.

380
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:22,670
How did you know

381
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,590
that I was the last person
your father saw?

382
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:30,391
When my dad was rushed to the hospital,

383
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,190
I saw you there.

384
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,031
Later, my mom told me

385
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,111
that after my dad talked with you,

386
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,231
his heart felt unwell.

387
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,471
Finally, he didn't survive.

388
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:49,031
Did your mother tell you this herself?

389
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,111
Your mom really

390
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,631
has had it tough.

391
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,416
Ms. Bai.

392
00:16:57,991 --> 00:16:58,910
No matter what you say,

393
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,550
I'll believe it all.

394
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:03,670
No matter what others say,

395
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:05,751
you're my career role model.

396
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:08,031
I really want to keep working with you.

397
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:12,191
But I truly need to ask you,

398
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,350
was it really you?

399
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,991
I just want

400
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:20,630
to hear an answer from you directly.

401
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,350
This question.

402
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:27,031
I can't answer.

403
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:35,150
(Relationship Web)

404
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,110
This is the relationship web I compiled.

405
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,590
See if you have anything to add.

406
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,128
Miss Yan.

407
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:17,128
Thank you.

408
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,464
Well?

409
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:20,991
How have you been lately?

410
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,671
Not good. I've been bullied.

411
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:24,870
Who dares bully you?

412
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,630
Many people want to resign.

413
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,110
In every department.

414
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,471
Some even want entire teams to leave.

415
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,390
Don't worry.

416
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,231
Don't worry.

417
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:35,310
Let's handle this together.

418
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,790
Or I'll talk to Xingke's legal team

419
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,031
and HR department.

420
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:39,790
See what we can do.

421
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:41,830
Or I...

422
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,231
Let me think.

423
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,031
Just kidding.

424
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,751
That situation did exist before,

425
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:51,711
but it's much better now.

426
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,150
After all, I'm pretty capable myself.

427
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,390
I've done a lot these days.

428
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:02,110
The biggest headache now

429
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,031
is Eddie.

430
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,431
At this crucial moment,

431
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,711
how can a grown man just vanish?

432
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:09,031
There must be a problem.

433
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:11,630
Plus, he's really close with Yan Da.

434
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,751
Why would he want to harm him?

435
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:16,110
I just can't get it.

436
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,390
Want to go unwind at our usual spot?

437
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,431
Thanks for lending me your shoulder

438
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,511
last time.

439
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,928
Not at all.

440
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,870
I know you've been tired lately.

441
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,590
You know what?

442
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:42,390
I'm actually dependable too.

443
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,110
Girls like us who have trained
in ballet since childhood

444
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,630
have incredibly strong backs.

445
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,830
Even though

446
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,630
some things happened at home recently

447
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:53,790
really threw me off at first.

448
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,911
But don't think

449
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,751
that I can only rely on you.

450
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,911
Sometimes,

451
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:01,031
we can actually lean on each other.

452
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:02,110
Or when you're the one

453
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,350
who needs support,

454
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:05,431
you can lean on me.

455
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:06,728
Got it?

456
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:08,310
I trust you.

457
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:09,864
Next time.

458
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,991
Ever since you brought
me here to see the stars,

459
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:19,590
I've actually come alone many times,

460
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:22,390
though none were as lovely.

461
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:25,070
Whenever you want to come,

462
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:26,711
I'll come with you.

463
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,424
Really?

464
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:29,320
I mean it.

465
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:33,350
Let me tell you.

466
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:35,550
I only recognize one constellation.

467
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:37,110
That's Orion.

468
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,271
I can't tell any others.

469
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,951
But it's okay.

470
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:44,991
The stars are what's magical.

471
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:50,590
Don't dismiss them just
because they're tiny specks of light.

472
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,991
Behind that glitter,

473
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,431
there are cosmic wonders unfolding.

474
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,671
So, it's

475
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,751
quite romantic.

476
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:03,951
Remember when you last

477
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,150
told me about Venus, the goddess?

478
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:08,630
She had this lover,

479
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:09,550
the god of war.

480
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:11,711
They had a son together later,

481
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,191
Cupid.

482
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,711
God of love.

483
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,110
The goddess of love and beauty

484
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:19,751
and the warrior god

485
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,070
gave birth to love.

486
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,310
So the stars and myths

487
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,590
have been showing us all along

488
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,110
that love is beautiful,

489
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:29,431
but it carries inherent ferocity

490
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,110
and can wound people.

491
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,751
So Mr. Zhou,

492
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,350
when loving someone,

493
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:42,671
should we sometimes

494
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:44,870
set aside
that careful cost-benefit analysis

495
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:46,150
and fear of pain?

496
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,630
Sure, we lawyers

497
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,031
treat risk assessment
and tradeoff calculations

498
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,870
as professional reflexes.

499
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,390
That's why loving and lawyering

500
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,630
are fundamentally at odds.

501
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,728
Right?

502
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:16,870
Perhaps.

503
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:18,696
I guess so.

504
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:42,120
(Bai Xiao, He Fan)

505
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:45,288
(Yan Da, Xingke CEO
Eddie, Airuiqi APAC Business Director)

506
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,048
(Yan Da's girlfriend, Zhang Xiaomei
Eddie persuaded Zhang to go abroad)

507
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:48,584
(Bai Xiao represents Yan Da)

508
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:49,608
(He Fan, Yan Da's assistant)

509
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:51,240
(Eddie introduced He Fan)

510
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,751
Step out. There's something.

511
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:03,951
What is it?

512
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,191
About Ms. Bai.

513
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:06,070
I'll tell you.

514
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:23,870
So you asked me out for this?

515
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:27,110
Since we joined Jun An,

516
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,870
very few people

517
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,790
have ever gotten under your skin.

518
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,991
Ms. Bai is among them.

519
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,511
When she passed
our conference room earlier,

520
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,951
your whole expression shifted.

521
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:36,136
What's going on?

522
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,231
This mess started partly because of me.

523
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,271
I should monitor
how my supervisor is reacting.

524
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,590
I want that job offer.

525
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,550
Did Guo Xiaoyu rub off on you?

526
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,512
Her idol is Holmes.

527
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,456
You read detective novels too,

528
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:54,728
but you need to work on
your detective skills.

529
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:56,951
You're really okay?

530
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,630
You've been staring
at that whiteboard all day.

531
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,671
Overworked?

532
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:02,590
Office life

533
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:03,790
drives people crazy.

534
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,830
So what'd you find?

535
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:07,870
At this exact moment,

536
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,310
in an organized and premeditated manner,

537
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:11,870
aiming at Ms. Bai's professionalism.

538
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:13,991
What's their underlying motive?

539
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,830
If it's connected to Eddie,

540
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,671
then how did he bribe He Fan?

541
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,911
I scrolled through countless comments.

542
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,671
Many people hinted

543
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,271
Ms. Bai had done similar things.

544
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:25,431
So vivid and detailed.

545
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,870
Like it's their personal experience.

546
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:27,830
Those...

547
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,471
In short,

548
00:24:36,271 --> 00:24:37,150
I've always felt

549
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:39,350
they're targeting Ms. Bai.

550
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:40,310
And the mastermind

551
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,231
knows Ms. Bai well.

552
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,991
I don't know if I can uncover it.

553
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:45,671
But I have to try.

554
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,830
That's passionate.

555
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,550
Just like Guo Xiaoyu.

556
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:51,390
I'm calm.

557
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,630
But you were right.

558
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,671
Ms. Bai is different for me.

559
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:58,630
At first,

560
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:01,150
I both admired and feared her.

561
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,150
Gradually, she taught me so much.

562
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,511
She mentored, scolded
and transformed me.

563
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:09,870
During our business trip,

564
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,751
I felt I discovered another side of her.

565
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:14,310
It even gave me the illusion

566
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,390
that she wasn't just my boss or mentor.

567
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,350
She could also be my friend.

568
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:21,991
Or a comrade-in-arms.

569
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,630
In short, that feeling.

570
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:27,110
Hard to describe.

571
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,790
I'm envious.

572
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:33,231
That word has never applied to me.

573
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,511
So you want to find the truth for her.

574
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,830
It's for her.

575
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:41,231
And for me.

576
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:44,870
Because I need an answer.

577
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:46,110
Perhaps this answer

578
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:47,110
means nothing

579
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,070
to others anymore.

580
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,790
But for me,

581
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:51,751
it's crucial.

582
00:25:56,252 --> 00:26:01,128
(Bai Xiao, Ren Jiatong,
Ren's mother, Ren Ping?)

583
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,951
What answer?

584
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:13,032
(Ren Ping, accident)

585
00:26:13,116 --> 00:26:14,600
(Ren Ping, death)

586
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:18,056
(Scaffold Collapse Causes Mass Injuries)

587
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:19,016
(Contractor Under Investigation)

588
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:24,936
(Scaffolding suddenly collapsed.)

589
00:26:24,936 --> 00:26:25,832
(Initial findings suggest
substandard materials.)

590
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:27,144
(The public expects the truth
and compensation.)

591
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,000
(Meanwhile,
the project's client contacted)

592
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,792
(Lawyers Wang Qin
and Bai Xiao from Manyida.)

593
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:42,344
(Lawyers Wang Qin
and Bai Xiao from Manyida.)

594
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,440
Hello.

595
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,784
My son.

596
00:27:03,951 --> 00:27:04,552
Can we talk?

597
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,870
You fought

598
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,991
with your girlfriend again?

599
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:09,951
A few days ago,

600
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:11,951
(Moments: Jiang Chen shared I'm Sorry)
you shared a song

601
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,310
on Moments late at night.

602
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,830
That cryptic one.

603
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,070
Without any lyrics at all.

604
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:17,671
Utterly depressing.

605
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,630
Then the next morning,

606
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,031
(Jiang Chen: Going all out)
you posted

607
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:22,550
a group work photo of you guys.

608
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,110
Looking all lively and cheerful.

609
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,431
So you made up then.

610
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,880
Not bad.

611
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,271
You know

612
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,870
it's bad to let your girlfriend
stay mad too long.

613
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,790
Not hopeless.

614
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,271
In relationships,

615
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,630
you can't let anger linger overnight.

616
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,310
Understand?

617
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,390
For someone your age,

618
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,350
you're way too nosy.

619
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,991
Besides, that music I shared
is called post-rock.

620
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:48,471
It's a genre.

621
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,671
You probably don't listen to it often.

622
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:53,751
Hey, kid, stop talking back to me.

623
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:56,104
Go on.

624
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,431
What happened to that girl?

625
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,991
How did you figure that out?

626
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:03,431
Normally,

627
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:05,870
you'd never call me.

628
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,150
Actually, I already have some leads.

629
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,231
It's just that...

630
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,310
Could I borrow some
of your valuable time to help me

631
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:18,070
sort it out?

632
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,550
Absolutely!

633
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:22,031
As long as you're willing,

634
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,390
we two can

635
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:25,150
stay up all night if needed.

636
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,584
Alright.

637
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,336
I'll start from the beginning.

638
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,191
Stop making

639
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:44,231
these round trips.

640
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:47,110
The high-speed train takes hours.

641
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:49,830
It's exhausting.

642
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:51,431
It's fine, Mom.

643
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,191
Stop fussing for now.

644
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,590
Come talk with me.

645
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,696
Done drinking.

646
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:11,310
Were you listening to me?

647
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,951
You don't have any contact
with that female lawyer?

648
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:17,064
No.

649
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,271
No?

650
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,231
Since you were little,
whenever you lied,

651
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,751
you've avoided eye contact.

652
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,431
You take after your dad.

653
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:28,031
Kind-hearted.

654
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:29,310
Capable.

655
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,390
Thoughtful and meticulous.

656
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,350
I'm genuinely afraid you'll be deceived.

657
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:35,870
Listen to me.

658
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:38,671
Nothing good will come from that woman.

659
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,671
Mom.

660
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,231
Ms. Bai is a genuinely good person.

661
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,790
She has contacts here from handling

662
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,431
a hospital case.

663
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:47,790
And she asked them
for help and moved you

664
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:48,911
to this quiet ward.

665
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,390
I also asked her about my dad's case.

666
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:52,630
She said nothing.

667
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:56,031
Be careful.

668
00:29:56,031 --> 00:29:56,630
Hold on.

669
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:58,671
How can you be so naive?

670
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,390
You asked her about your dad.

671
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,550
Do you think she'd still

672
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,911
let you get this job?

673
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,630
Why couldn't you just wait

674
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,070
until the competition

675
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,110
was over?

676
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,070
You wouldn't listen to me.

677
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,216
You...

678
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:13,192
Mom.

679
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,191
She isn't that kind of person.

680
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,511
Hello? Xiaoyu?

681
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,431
Jiatong, they've released more.

682
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,991
An audio recording
of Ms. Bai pressing He Fan.

683
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:32,711
Look.

684
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,191
The timeline of the previous footage

685
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,350
basically aligns with this audio.

686
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,870
But the video is really blurry.

687
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,231
Impossible to read the lips.

688
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,310
So people would mistakenly believe

689
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:43,231
that this audio

690
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:44,830
is the original sound from that footage.

691
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:46,231
But...

692
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,511
This glass of water.

693
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,991
Empty just a second ago.

694
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:53,070
Full the next second?

695
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,231
Exactly.

696
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:56,271
I had been watching
this video over and over.

697
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,431
I already realized it was edited.

698
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,231
But I couldn't figure out
why they cut it

699
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,191
until this audio was released today.

700
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:03,991
I think

701
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,390
it was to make this audio
match the visuals.

702
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,991
They seriously think we're pushovers.

703
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,471
How could they be so malicious?

704
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:11,471
Why go to such lengths

705
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:12,550
to frame Ms. Bai?

706
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:14,191
You rushed back in such a hurry.

707
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,271
Is your mom okay?

708
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,751
Mr. Lin is taking care of her.

709
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:21,431
I even suspect

710
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:23,231
this audio might have been edited too.

711
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:24,991
Let me think.

712
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,070
I think we should get

713
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,471
a voiceprint identification expert.

714
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,951
I think Mr. Lin works in that field.

715
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:36,630
I'll make a call and ask.

716
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:40,911
But I just don't understand.

717
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,310
He Fan

718
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,951
is clearly under Xingke's watch.

719
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,511
Who keeps leaking this information?

720
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:47,671
Eddie?

721
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,630
But why would Eddie

722
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,951
keep targeting Ms. Bai?

723
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,751
I'll get you hot water.

724
00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:03,550
And some snacks, please.

725
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,760
And also...

726
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,928
(Bai Xiao, He Fan)

727
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,680
You okay?

728
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,870
Mr. Lin said he'd look into it for me.

729
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:21,870
I meant, are you okay?

730
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,431
After going home,

731
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,911
you seem completely off.

732
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,231
Is it related to your dad's old case?

733
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,271
You looked into my dad's case.

734
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:41,384
(Ren Ping, Bai Xiao)

735
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,590
That's what you are really after.

736
00:32:44,951 --> 00:32:46,431
You suspect your dad's death

737
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,711
and He Fan's collapse

738
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,511
both relate to Ms. Bai.

739
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,110
What else did you find?

740
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,191
Judging by your look,

741
00:32:53,191 --> 00:32:53,991
I guessed right.

742
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,511
Drop it please.

743
00:32:58,951 --> 00:32:59,790
I need to remind you.

744
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:01,431
In your dad's case back then,

745
00:33:01,471 --> 00:33:02,830
Ms. Bai wasn't the only lawyer.

746
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,150
She had a partner.

747
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:08,191
The Legal Director

748
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:09,550
of Xingke Group's rival company.

749
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,350
(Wang Qing, Asia-Pacific Legal Director)
Wang Qing.

750
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,070
I checked his background.

751
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:14,671
His educational institutions
and prior work experience

752
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,191
are nearly identical to those
of Ms. Bai's former partner,

753
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,471
Wang Qin.

754
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:22,070
You suspect they're one person?

755
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:25,431
So now this Wang Qing
is targeting Ms. Bai

756
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,711
and bringing up
my father's case in the comments

757
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,390
because Wang Qin knew Ms. Bai back then.

758
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,630
Then why is this Lawyer Wang involved?

759
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:36,070
You could take the photo

760
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,231
and ask Ms. Bai tomorrow.

761
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:38,911
You'll understand why.

762
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:42,031
We're still in the assessment phase.

763
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:43,550
You discovered this.

764
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:44,711
Why won't you go?

765
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,288
(Ren Ping)

766
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,790
You didn't mention it
in front of Guo Xiaoyu.

767
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:58,671
You're trying to protect my privacy.

768
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,790
I don't want you to feel burdened.

769
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,310
I know your father's case

770
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,390
means a lot to you.

771
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,751
But it's from your parents' generation.

772
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:09,031
Don't carry this weight with you.

773
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,630
I know you and your father were close.

774
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,391
You can't let it go

775
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,871
and want to shoulder
this responsibility.

776
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:17,951
But I want to tell you.

777
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,110
While love can empower you,

778
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,710
in some situations,

779
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,750
it can become chains that hold you back.

780
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,630
If he knew you carried

781
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,550
this heavy burden every single day,

782
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:35,070
he would feel heartbroken.

783
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,550
It's Mr. Lin.

784
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:50,070
He says this audio clip is fake.

785
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:51,391
Generated by AI.

786
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:54,110
I'll compile it and report to Ms. Bai.

787
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,590
(Wang Qing's Profile)
The opposing company's lawyer.

788
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,391
Wang Qing.

789
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,831
Jiang Chen and I suspect

790
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:03,951
that the leaker wasn't Eddie,

791
00:35:04,031 --> 00:35:04,550
but him.

792
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:06,871
Or that he conspired with Eddie.

793
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,511
Explain your reasoning.

794
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,550
This theory hinges on one premise.

795
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,710
That lawyer Wang,

796
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,550
who worked with you on my father's case,

797
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,951
and this Wang Qing are one person.

798
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,750
Ms. Bai, is it him?

799
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:19,400
Yes.

800
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,670
He changed his name after I resigned.

801
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,710
That's it.

802
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:25,710
I've been reviewing the comments.

803
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,791
Many accounts were newly created.

804
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:30,031
All the comments accuse you

805
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,471
of driving someone
to death in my father's case.

806
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,791
I suspect

807
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:37,550
they are hired
by an insider to manipulate

808
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,471
public opinion.

809
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,871
I'll carefully consider your findings.

810
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:50,431
I have more to tell you.

811
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:54,871
I want to apologize.

812
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,351
Why apologize to me?

813
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:01,230
My previous questions were

814
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,190
highly unprofessional.

815
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,991
First, I questioned your professional
integrity. It's disrespectful.

816
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:07,311
Second, as someone

817
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:08,590
pursuing this profession,

818
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,110
I know public perception

819
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,110
is often misguided.

820
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:13,070
But I posed those very questions to you,

821
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,391
disrespecting myself.

822
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,831
I hope you'll forgive me.

823
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:20,511
It's fine.

824
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,190
I don't care what you think,

825
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,031
nor will it affect
my evaluation of your work.

826
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,670
How's your mother's recovery?

827
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:32,031
Progressing well.

828
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:35,431
Thanks to your help arranging wards.

829
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,184
Good to hear.

830
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:39,368
That's all.

831
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:40,550
Go to work.

832
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,808
(Yan Fei)

833
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,272
Hello.

834
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,808
Go ahead.

835
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,710
Zhang Xiaomei just contacted Yan Fei

836
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,991
and sent her a photo.

837
00:37:12,991 --> 00:37:13,670
Everyone, look.

838
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,792
(Zhang Xiaomei's Selfie)

839
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,911
This was taken by Zhang Xiaomei
days before Yan Da's accident

840
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,831
while accompanying him abroad.

841
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,670
The notebook on the table appears

842
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,431
to be Xingke's commemorative edition.

843
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,110
On our first day here,

844
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,871
didn't Yan Fei distribute
these to everyone?

845
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,630
Yes, this exact design.

846
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,550
But the notebook in the photo

847
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,911
has yellow and white alternating pages.

848
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,670
You're right.

849
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:35,871
Notice here.

850
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,431
This suggests someone
secretly swapped it.

851
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,110
The evidence held by local police

852
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,670
is pale yellow inner pages.

853
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,991
Someone inside
must have slipped in secretly

854
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:45,831
and replaced this pure white notebook

855
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:46,871
with a white-yellow one.

856
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:47,511
This way,

857
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:49,511
they could mix in
those pale yellow inner pages

858
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:50,088
as evidence.

859
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,392
(Wang Qing)

860
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:58,190
Tian, Zhou.

861
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:00,150
Please assign the remaining tasks.

862
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,351
Ms. Tian.

863
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,951
Could it be Eddie
who ordered He Fan to do it?

864
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,391
I heard from Ms. Bai

865
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,031
that Yan Fei spoke with He Fan.

866
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:14,670
He Fan refused to admit anything.

867
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:16,911
She just said Ms. Bai

868
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,431
pushed her

869
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,351
into anxiety.

870
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:20,871
How can she be like this?

871
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:23,110
Fei must feel so frustrated.

872
00:38:44,431 --> 00:38:45,032
Still busy?

873
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:46,710
I just met Zhang Xiaomei.

874
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:47,991
We talked again.

875
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,550
She did post

876
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,311
that photo on social media,

877
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,991
but later, after Yan Da
lost contact with her,

878
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:55,630
she deleted that photo.

879
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,911
Eddie probably saw it.

880
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,431
He kept egging her on to go abroad

881
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,710
and kept her from me.

882
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:06,511
I might go to Hangzhou this weekend.

883
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,200
Oh?

884
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,351
It's Hangzhou's most beautiful season.

885
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,391
Business trip?

886
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:14,391
Sort of.

887
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:19,976
Okay.

888
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:23,230
Good luck.

889
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:25,160
Same to you.

Location: Lvlin Building)

(your flight from Beijing to Hangzhou)

894
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:10,311
You had Yan Fei go
to talk to He Fan, didn't you?

895
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:11,710
That way,

896
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,311
He Fan would pass the message to them.

897
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:15,230
You know me well.

898
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:18,351
My old friend finally contacted me.

899
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,031
Wang couldn't hold back anymore.
What did he say?

900
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:22,951
A five-minute call.

901
00:40:22,951 --> 00:40:24,351
He spent four-thirty on nostalgia,

902
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,710
only to casually mention
at the very end,

903
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,590
"We've been in this field so long.

904
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:30,630
Work matters are never easy.

905
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,630
You and I both know how it is."

906
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,871
Then he chuckled and hung up.

907
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,670
How cunning.

908
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,791
He did this to avoid leaving evidence.

909
00:40:42,471 --> 00:40:43,311
He never handles

910
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,991
the leaks personally.

911
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:47,150
I know him.

912
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:48,951
He and Eddie

913
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:50,431
were likely ordered by their company.

914
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,511
I represent Xingke,

915
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,791
so they slander and defame me

916
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:54,750
to make me step down

917
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:56,590
and stall Yan Da.

918
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,431
And they can use it as a reason

919
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,911
to fire Eddie,
who never delivers results.

920
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,070
So usually,

921
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:04,190
they provoke and egg Eddie on.

922
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:05,630
Makes sense.

923
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:07,431
You're so clever.

924
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,471
Because this is his favorite tactic.

925
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,031
Even now, he is

926
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:12,791
the legal head
of a famous overseas company.

927
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,791
Some things never change.

928
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:16,590
Just like he knows me well too.

929
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:18,110
So his every exposure of me

930
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,311
mixes truth and lies.

931
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,150
Really, offend anyone

932
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,070
but a lawyer.

933
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,871
They're ruthless.

934
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,750
I'm not. I'm a good person.

935
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:35,110
But the worst off now is Eddie.

936
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:36,190
He's a worker

937
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,791
who can be sacrificed anytime.

938
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,270

venting on social media,

940
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:43,351
saying they work hard every day

941
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,750
with no time, no friends,

942
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:45,951
no romance, no health.

943
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:47,550
Half their salary goes to rent,

944
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,871
the other half to commuting.

945
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:50,951
After barely making it past 30,

946
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:53,270
the company's layoff awaits.

947
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,110
Honestly, though they
forgot to block me,

948
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,070
it really

949
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:58,590
resonated with me.

950
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,110
Haven't we all endured this?

951
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:00,968
Yes.

952
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,590
Wang Qing must be the same.

953
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,230
He smeared me,

954
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:06,791
probably hoping
we'd stop after finding Eddie

955
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:07,991
and not investigate him.

956
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,911
After years of working for capital,

957
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:10,911
he knows very well

958
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:12,110
if something goes wrong,

959
00:42:12,391 --> 00:42:13,670
a big overseas company like this

960
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,831
would never protect him.

961
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:16,351
Most likely,

962
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:18,230
they'd fire him just like Eddie.

963
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,031
Getting in my car? Where's yours?

964
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,590
This morning,

965
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,431
I assessed

966
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,710
my blood alcohol level.

967
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,150
Not safe to drive.

968
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:30,630
The alcohol from last night

969
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,031
still hasn't worn off?

970
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:32,991
Age slows

971
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:33,672
metabolism.

972
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:35,070
I miss your girl.

973
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,720
Get in now.

974
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:53,256
(Respect Original Work)

975
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:54,120
(1.347 million)

976
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:57,416
(Hanfu is cultural memory.)

977
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:57,992
(Safeguard our cultural dignity!)

978
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:58,664
(Let's support her.)

979
00:43:00,392 --> 00:43:01,288
(Xiaoyu, your courage
makes us all proud.)

980
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:02,152
(Originality sustains culture.)

981
00:43:02,152 --> 00:43:03,016
(Brave to stand up
for Hanfu at her age.)

982
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:04,936
(You make us all proud.)

983
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:07,048
(We adults must protect her!)

984
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:08,040
(Originality sustains culture.)

985
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,744
(Cultural plagiarism
disrespects creators.)

986
00:43:08,744 --> 00:43:09,416
(We hope the brand handles this fairly.)

987
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:10,408
(Hanfu is part of Chinese culture.)

988
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:11,176
(We're angered.)

989
00:43:11,176 --> 00:43:12,040
(Friends in the Hanfu community.)

990
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,352
(Your courage and persistence
make us all proud.)

991
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:14,888
(Not just for her, but for all who love
and respect traditional culture.)

992
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:18,152
(Reputation Rights Infringement)

993
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:20,616
(Answer: Infringement
that lowers others' social standing)

994
00:43:20,616 --> 00:43:23,112
(through insults or defamation.)

995
00:43:23,112 --> 00:43:25,544
(The core element is harming
the victim's social reputation)

996
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:27,848
