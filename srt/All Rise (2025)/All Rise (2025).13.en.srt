29
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,050
By the way, I also heard
from their people

30
00:01:58,089 --> 00:01:59,889
Zhu Zhisheng's mother has not,

31
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,650
to this day, hired a lawyer.

32
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,329
These demands she's making

33
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,369
were negotiated directly
with the company.

34
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:06,633
Impressive, huh?

35
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,010
Leveraging the IPO timing
for compensation.

36
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:11,889
She proposed it herself?

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,449
No lawyer involved?

38
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:17,410
Never underestimate a mother's strength.

39
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,336
(Ren Jiatong: I've arrived in Hangzhou.)

40
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:33,576
(Here's the hotel location. Let's meet.)

41
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,370
She asked you what she should do?

42
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,690
I explained
the work-related injury claim process

43
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,530
to her thoroughly.

44
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,209
I also highlighted

45
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,410
some key points

46
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,410
for labor dispute negotiations
with employers.

47
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,169
It was on our way to the hospital.

48
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:53,649
I didn't know Jun An

49
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:54,850
would represent Yiaiwan.

50
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,010
That's all?

51
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,810
I can't recall any more details.

52
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:08,729
Learning Zhubao was in a coma

53
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:09,769
made my hands tremble.

54
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,690
My mind was completely chaotic.

55
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:13,889
Jiatong.

56
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,169
Have I caused trouble?

57
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,090
Does anyone else besides you two know?

58
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:22,209
I immediately told Mr. Zhou

59
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,329
about our relationship

60
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,209
and told him I was currently in Hangzhou

61
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,729
and that I'd recuse myself.

62
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,090
But I didn't dare tell Mr. Zhou

63
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,850
that I gave Ms. Wang

64
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,090
legal advice.

65
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,729
What you told her

66
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,449
were just standard legal suggestions.

67
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:39,169
And you never participated

68
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,049
in the Jun An topic.

69
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,850
So it's alright.

70
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,290
But from now on,

71
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,130
you shouldn't discuss this with anyone.

72
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:46,850
I'll keep it secret too.

73
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,530
In just two days,

74
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,889
you look much thinner already.

75
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,810
All those fasts never worked before,

76
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,329
but sleeplessness does the trick.

77
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:07,690
Get some sleep now.

78
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,810
Your body will break down otherwise.

79
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,290
Jiatong.

80
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,410
I can't sleep.

81
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,370
Just lie here with me.

82
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,089
Can we talk a bit?

83
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,730
Zhubao isn't the first employee

84
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,209
to collapse at Yiaiwan.

85
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:36,649
Recently,

86
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,849
several former employees' families

87
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,130
have contacted Ms. Wang.

88
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,610
That's how we learned

89
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,769
that over a year ago,

90
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,490
an identical case occurred.

91
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:52,610
Jiatong.

92
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,170
Do you still believe
it's all coincidence?

93
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,409
I'm honestly starting to doubt it.

94
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,529
Even though I'm recused from this case,

95
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,490
what about the future?

96
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,449
If I practice law

97
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,730
and face conflicts

98
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,329
between justice and client interests,

99
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,010
should I force myself

100
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,889
to abandon my original ideals

101
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:23,409
and convince myself

102
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,730
client interests must come first?

103
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,529
Not that Yiaiwan is definitely at fault.

104
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,209
I have no proof.

105
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:36,969
But Jiatong,

106
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,209
what about you?

107
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,529
If you were Zhubao

108
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,529
or that employee's family,

109
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,089
seeing your loved one like this,

110
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,849
could you stay rational?

111
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:02,889
(Emergency)

112
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:03,690
Family member?

113
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,010
Patient's jacket.

114
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:16,552
(Estazolam Tablets)

115
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:30,529
Jiatong.

116
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:34,449
Are you asleep?

117
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:38,024
(Jiang Chen
to Ren Jiatong)

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,937
(Thank you for feeding it for me.)

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,033
(I was just passing by.)

120
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:02,984
(The shopkeeper told me
you went there every day.)

121
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:09,385
(I won't feed it tomorrow anyway.)

122
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,272
(It eats too much. I can't afford it.)

123
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,585
(Come back and take over.)

124
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:17,929
(It just told me it misses you.)

125
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,169
I'm an intern from Yiaiwan R&D.

126
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,250
Mr. Zhou is meeting
with our department head.

127
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,370
He instructed us to give you this.

128
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,850
Zhu's recent clock-in/out records.

129
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,049
I'll email the digital version shortly.

130
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:45,450
Thank you.

131
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:48,250
Xiaojing.

132
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,769
I heard you people provided a copy

133
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:52,850
for Zhu Zhisheng's mother.

134
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,929
Was it this one?

135
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,769
I wasn't there then,

136
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,210
so I don't know specifics.

137
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,289
But based on your knowledge,

138
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,450
did your colleagues give
his mother a hard time?

139
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,450
Like intentionally delaying documents?

140
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,850
Impossible. We're all colleagues.

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,610
How could that be?

142
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,610
Well.

143
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,569
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

144
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,330
Right, let's swap WeChat IDs.

145
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,809
Contact me whenever.

146
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,600
Okay.

147
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,169
You know Zhu Zhisheng, right?

148
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:23,610
Of course, we're in the same department.

149
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,289
We did team-building events.

150
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:26,809
But...

151
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,090
we're not close.

152
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,689
We'll contact you if needed.

153
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:35,210
I'll leave.

154
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:49,289
Zhu Zhisheng was found
unconscious in the company garage.

155
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,169
It happened around 10 PM.

156
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,490
But that day's clock-out record

157
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,569
showed he left the office at 7 PM.

158
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,450
He was gone for three hours.

159
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,649
And his car didn't move.

160
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,569
Meaning he couldn't have gone far.

161
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,929
Perhaps in the complex.

162
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,970
From his start date till now,

163
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,689
it's been nearly six months.

164
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,689
But he worked overtime almost every day.

165
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,289
The earliest he'd leave was past 10 PM.

166
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,210
He genuinely worked hard.

167
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,169
I heard from Guo Xiaoyu earlier

168
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,929
that he'd work extremely late

169
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,529
and then go home and video-call her.

170
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,450
At least, he didn't lie
to Guo Xiaoyu about that.

171
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,649
But these past two weeks,

172
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,610
he's been leaving around 8 PM.

173
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,169
Then returning around 10 PM.

174
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:30,330
But his mother told Guo Xiaoyu

175
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:32,610
he usually worked until 11 or 12 PM

176
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,370
before coming home,

177
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,529
and that when she went
for the clock-in records,

178
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,370
she got stonewalled.

179
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,090
Why would Zhu's mother

180
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,809
lie to Guo Xiaoyu?

181
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,049
And why did she

182
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,929
insist on private negotiations

183
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:43,970
instead of formal claims?

184
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,569
We could suggest Mr. Zhou.

185
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,330
Have her make an offer directly.

186
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,010
You're hoping her proposal reveals

187
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,610
her true intentions.

188
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,049
See if she's seeking huge compensation

189
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,330
by hiding something.

190
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:57,850
Smart.

191
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,529
But one thing's certain.

192
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:00,889
These two weeks coincide

193
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,370
with Xiaoyu and Zhu Zhisheng's cold war.

194
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,610
During those three hours
after clocking out,

195
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,130
he might've done something

196
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,850
with someone.

197
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:13,289
Weibo.

198
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:15,144
(Quiet Woods: Sunny day.)

199
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:21,330
Almost done.

200
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,970
Thank you.

201
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,450
No, I should say thank you.

202
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,529
A little sleepy.

203
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,090
Inside the complex,

204
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,730
any standout cafes you'd recommend?

205
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,544
This one?

206
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,090
This...

207
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:52,850
I'm not too sure.

208
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,169
I haven't visited.

209
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:57,689
Reviews say

210
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,809
it's the highest-rated cafe here.

211
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,090
Really?

212
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:06,250
Excuse me.

213
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,649
Hello, Xiaoyu.

214
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:08,850
Jiatong.

215
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,049
Zhubao just got rushed
to emergency care.

216
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,970
What should I do?

217
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,490
Didn't you say this approach would work?

218
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:20,450
Don't worry.

219
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,049
I'll definitely handle this for you.

220
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:23,210
Since we've set this up,

221
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,809
it'll be fine.

222
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,730
On your end...

223
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,610
Family of Bed 1,

224
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,049
buy a cream to prevent bedsores.

225
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:28,490
Okay, I'll get it shortly.

226
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,152
(Esazolam Tablets:
Sedative, sleeping pills.)

227
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:38,696
(Primarily used to treat
anxiety and insomnia)

228
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:39,464
(and also tension, fear,
epilepsy and seizures.)

229
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,552
(Esazolam Tablets:
Sedative, sleeping pills.)

230
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,320
(Primarily used to treat
anxiety and insomnia)

231
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,120
(and also tension, fear,
epilepsy and seizures.)

232
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:48,769
Xiaoyu.

233
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,889
Since you work at that firm,

234
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,210
couldn't you reason
with your supervisor?

235
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,330
This endless delay without compensation

236
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,689
is downright immoral.

237
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,569
Ms. Wang, I don't know
how to tell you this.

238
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,809
But Jun An

239
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,330
isn't the unethical firm you imagine.

240
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:06,250
You need a professional lawyer

241
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:06,850
to help you.

242
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,809
Aren't you studying law?

243
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:09,889
Yes.

244
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,889
I am. But Ms. Wang,

245
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,610
my position is extremely awkward.

246
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,689
I can't offer you any advice.

247
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:18,330
And I can't

248
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,689
get involved in this matter.

249
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,610
Xiaoyu.

250
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,289
You're a good kid.

251
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,330
You've been together for many years.

252
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,569
He's in such a state now.

253
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:27,929
You can't just abandon him.

254
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,730
Xiaoyu.

255
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:30,970
What's wrong?

256
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:32,210
Just my usual stomachache.

257
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:35,409
Give the barrier cream to her.

258
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:39,689
Ms. Wang, this is for Zhubao.

259
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,130
Well.

260
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,569
I-I-I'll take my colleague
to the emergency room.

261
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:44,929
Xiaoyu.

262
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:46,330
Xiaoyu.

263
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,169
Thanks for helping me out earlier.

264
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,450
You acted so convincingly.

265
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,289
But her coming to you this time

266
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:00,450
is not simple.

267
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:01,970
I know.

268
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,610
She never mentioned Jun An before.

269
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,409
But I trust Ms. Wang.

270
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,090
She was our Chinese teacher.

271
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,610
I think she's just extremely anxious.

272
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:12,689
So she wants to get information from me.

273
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,330
Yiaiwan avoids
official work injury status

274
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,210
because it'd hurt
the company's reputation too much.

275
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:22,409
Big companies often
avoid acknowledging it.

276
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,130
Especially since Yiaiwan
has IPO plans now.

277
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,169
It could draw
regulatory scrutiny easily.

278
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:28,730
Moreover,

279
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:31,169
the company will pay
part of the compensation.

280
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,330
But Ms. Wang refuses

281
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,450
to get compensated
through official channels.

282
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:37,929
She wants a private payout.

283
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,730
Don't you find that suspicious?

284
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:42,929
But

285
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,769
Zhu Zhisheng's collapse this time

286
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,649
hit Ms. Wang incredibly hard.

287
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:48,809
I've asked her.

288
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,289
The treatment costs are sky-high.

289
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,370
She's completely panicked.

290
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:53,929
The insurance may not cover it.

291
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:54,970
Moreover,

292
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,169
the work injury process
is so complicated.

293
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,210
No wonder she's confused.

294
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,090
Is Zhu Zhisheng alright?

295
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,090
I just spoke to him.

296
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,049
He seemed conscious.

297
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,130
He'll wake up for sure.

298
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:12,049
Don't worry.

299
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,210
We can handle this.

300
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,490
We have procedures for this.

301
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:18,210
What's wrong?

302
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:20,328
Nothing.

303
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,289
These past few days,

304
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:24,330
have Zhu Zhisheng's relatives
come to help?

305
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,409
No, Ms. Wang's been running around

306
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:29,090
all alone.

307
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,649
I haven't seen anyone else.

308
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:32,610
She's beyond exhausted.

309
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,090
You too.

310
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:35,490
Go home and get sleep later.

311
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,169
Jiatong.

312
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:39,769
Can I stay at your place

313
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,210
one more night?

314
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,689
I didn't tell my parents I came here.

315
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,250
I didn't want them to worry.

316
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,250
Jiatong.

317
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,649
You're so thoughtful with me.

318
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,130
I'm actually not used to it.

319
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,169
If you get sick,

320
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,090
I'll miss your cooking back in Beijing.

321
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,809
Keep pretending you're tough.

322
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,090
I know

323
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,010
you've already considered me a friend.

324
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:18,920
Jiatong.

325
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:19,889
Thank you.

326
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:21,490
And Yan Fei too.

327
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:24,289
I know you both came to Hangzhou

328
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:25,090
just for me.

329
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,330
Not just me in my family,

330
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,490
even my parents are only children.

331
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:32,970
This time,

332
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,450
I finally know

333
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,049
what having an elder sister is like.

334
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:38,250
You two.

335
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:39,809
One,

336
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:41,689
tough-talker with a soft heart,

337
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,610
and the other,

338
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:44,689
passionately loyal.

339
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:45,689
And Yue,

340
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,169
she messages me daily

341
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,330
to cheer me up.

342
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,049
Honestly, after joining Jun An,

343
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,010
my biggest gain was you all.

344
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:04,809
I asked people at the cafe.

345
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,769
Listen,

346
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:06,369
that night,

347
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,329
Zhu Zhisheng
was definitely with that woman.

348
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,769
But surveillance stopped.

349
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,250
They described a girl

350
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,809
with a round face and a sweet smile.

351
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:15,329
It must be that intern, Xiaojing.

352
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,170
Her conversation with me seemed odd.

353
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,529
After you left today,

354
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,170
I asked Mr. Zhou to check

355
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,450
the department's clock-in data

356
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,809
over the past half-month.

357
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,129
That girl's post-work comings and goings

358
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,450
match Zhu Zhisheng's

359
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,970
almost exactly.

360
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,049
What a scumbag.

361
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:31,368
By the way.

362
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,049
I'm sending you her selfie
from social media.

363
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,490
Check it out at the cafe if you can.

364
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,730
Has Guo Xiaoyu been told?

365
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:41,930
Not yet.

366
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,129
It's too much pressure.

367
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,049
She's already torn between both sides.

368
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:47,930
It's been hard enough.

369
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:49,970
How's she now?

370
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,769
She's asleep.

371
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,690
Let's tell her

372
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,930
after this blows over.

373
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:00,129
Alright.

374
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,650
Please help take care of her.

375
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,289
Not going back?

376
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,769
You work this late.

377
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,210
How could I leave early?

378
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,170
Hangzhou is lovely.

379
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,344
Mr. Zhou.

380
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,970
Is the suggestion

381
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,289
Ren Jiatong and I proposed okay?

382
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,010
I just talked

383
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,450
to Zhu's mother with Yiaiwan.

384
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,650
We asked her to submit
a compensation proposal.

385
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:40,930
She sent it immediately.

386
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,849
How is it? A ridiculous demand?

387
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,200
No.

388
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,529
The amount she requested

389
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,010
is only slightly higher

390
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,369
than the work injury claim amount

391
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,210
we estimated.

392
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,049
"Only slightly higher"?

393
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,170
Then why the banner protests

394
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,369
and disturbances?

395
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:58,450
She refused to file for work injury.

396
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,970
Does she know

397
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,450
Zhu Zhisheng's coma

398
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,809
wasn't actually caused by overtime work?

399
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,049
So she's pushing for extra compensation

400
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,250
before Yiaiwan's IPO?

401
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,809
It's entirely possible.

402
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,970
What actually caused his coma?

403
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:15,410
What was he really doing

404
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,529
during those three hours?

405
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:19,289
Could he have a major health issue?

406
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:21,769
Guo Xiaoyu shouldn't be with him.

407
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,690
Why so worked up

408
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,450
about urging her breakup?

409
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,329
That two-timer
doesn't deserve Guo Xiaoyu.

410
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,010
And he kept pressuring her
to return to Hangzhou.

411
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,569
What's so great about Hangzhou anyway?

412
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,210
Once this matter is resolved,

413
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,529
I'll take her straight back.

414
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,609
The osmanthus smells good.

415
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,568
Take a whiff.

416
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,392
Smells good.

417
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,329
Osmanthus wine tastes even better.

418
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:26,210
Our housekeeper brews it often.

419
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:27,890
Layering osmanthus blossoms.

420
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,369
Then a layer of rock sugar.

421
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,490
Finally filled with baijiu.

422
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,730
Actually, Hangzhou

423
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:51,849
is growing on me.

424
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,529
I see.

425
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,369
This place is a bar at night.

426
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,289
Zhu Zhisheng might
drink here that night.

427
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:20,690
What?

428
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:21,890
Go find evidence.

429
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,384
(If there's something)

430
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:43,337
(you're unsure whether to do,)

431
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:45,058
(what would you do?)

432
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:51,625
(Indecision isn't like you.)

433
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,384
Hello?

434
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:02,690
How is Guo Xiaoyu?

435
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,690
You know already?

436
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,450
You and Yan Fei were in the pantry,

437
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,369
acting all mysterious.

438
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,170
Guo Xiaoyu took a sudden leave.

439
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:12,849
And Yiaiwan is in Hangzhou.

440
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:14,690
Put these pieces together.

441
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,450
Plenty of possibilities emerge.

442
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,170
I asked a friend at Yiaiwan.

443
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,010
Just an inquiry.

444
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:21,730
I got the whole story instantly.

445
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,289
She's been tired these days.

446
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:25,650
She barely slept at all.

447
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,210
You're not much better.

448
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,930
Even your voice sounds drained.

449
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,970
Didn't you take care of yourself well?

450
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:33,970
What about you?

451
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,849
How are things lately?

452
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:37,704
Remember that goal you set?

453
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:40,450
The three of us
are busy with Min's case.

454
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,010
We'll probably pull
an all-nighter today.

455
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,369
You need to take care of yourself.

456
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,609
Today,

457
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,450
I saw Zhu Zhisheng

458
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,490
lying in the ICU.

459
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:52,410
He's our age.

460
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,930
Just like us,

461
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:56,690
he works all night every single day.

462
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,490
But...

463
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:08,049
Sorry, I lost control
of my emotions today.

464
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,450
Losing control just means
you're flesh and blood.

465
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,450
If you didn't react to anything,

466
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,289
it'd be terrifying.

467
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:21,890
Do you want to discuss it?

468
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:23,849
About what?

469
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,970
Whatever is making you hesitate.

470
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,970
It actually needs close attention.

471
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,049
Indulge my curiosity?

472
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,650
Well,

473
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,450
I have a friend

474
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:40,890
whom I really care about.

475
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,289
I discovered something

476
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,010
about her.

477
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:47,970
If I speak up,

478
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,529
it could hurt her.

479
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,650
But if I don't,

480
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,650
she might get into trouble.

481
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,730
I don't know what to do.

482
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:02,529
I can't give you more details.

483
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,369
That's the gist of it.

484
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,384
Understood.

485
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:06,730
I won't ask further.

486
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,890
This is rare.

487
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,970
You used to act without hesitation.

488
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:13,450
Just like a lion

489
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,569
ready to hunt at any moment.

490
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:17,730
Lying quietly in wait,

491
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,210
seizing the perfect chance

492
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,529
with a swift, precise strike.

493
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:21,690
But

494
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,890
this time you're hesitating?

495
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,730
Hard to believe.

496
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,289
I recall you once said

497
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,049
I was the type who'd do
anything to achieve my goals.

498
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,168
No.

499
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:34,210
You're someone

500
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,089
who knows exactly what they want.

501
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:39,609
Thank you.

502
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:40,968
Jiang Chen.

503
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,650
I'm very happy

504
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:47,369
that I'm your first call
when trouble hits.

505
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:53,650
Are you at the hotel?

506
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,529
I'm sitting in the garden.

507
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:57,864
Look up.

508
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,010
Using Jiang Chen's advice,

509
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:11,890
I found sales contacts

510
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,170
for the defendant company.

511
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,930
I added them on WeChat and talked

512
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:16,289
until they slipped up.

513
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:17,210
Their company

514
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,289
is inside this building.

515
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:19,569
His strategy worked.

516
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:21,490
I sent you all those chat logs,

517
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,170
and cross-referencing took forever.

518
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,129
Still no exact location.

519
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:26,369
No worries.

520
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:27,089
We're here.

521
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,010
Worst case,

522
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,490
we knock on every door.

523
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:30,490
We'll find proof.

524
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:31,930
No need for that.

525
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:33,369
Check the directory.

526
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,329
Ask the front desk.

527
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,609
Me, the property office.

528
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,569
Share any key evidence
in the group chat.

529
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,480
(TSA
Rights Guardian)

530
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,336
(Beijing Ke Xin Trading Co., Ltd.)

531
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,730
The defendant's company's name

532
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,089
is Beijing Fei Chang Ke Xin
Trading Co., Ltd.

533
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:58,769
This directory lists
something like "Ke Xin",

534
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,010
but I bet

535
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,129
it's the same company.

536
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,250
2301.

537
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:05,672
Hello.

538
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:06,490
Hello.

539
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,210
We chatted on WeChat earlier

540
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,129
about our company.

541
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,690
One moment, I'll get you some water.

542
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:22,760
Excuse me.

543
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:24,369
I'm from the company

544
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:25,970
Fei Chang Ke Xin on the 23rd floor.

545
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,210
I need a parking permit.

546
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:28,609
Is this the right place?

547
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:29,448
(Wanshi Tower Service Center)
Yes.

548
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:31,089
Fill out this registration form.

549
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:32,104
Thank you.

551
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:46,890
Great, thank you.

552
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,496
Not at all.

553
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,089
Zhu's mom called
our boss today, and guess

554
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:57,930
what she said?

555
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:58,849
What?

556
00:27:59,250 --> 00:27:59,890
Let me show you.

557
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:02,490
Pushing employees

558
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,089
to physical collapse is nothing new

559
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,089
for your company.

560
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,529
Pay compensation.

561
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:07,569
Or...

562
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,490
I'll team up
with other employees and families

563
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:11,049
and blow this up big time.

564
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:12,849
I'll derail your IPO.

565
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:13,769
Her exact words.

566
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:14,809
IPO?

567
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:16,849
How did she know?

568
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,089
Our key tech department staff

569
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:20,010
was only just told.

570
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:21,650
Just a retired teacher.

571
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,809
How'd she get such info?

572
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,490
Who knows? Let's go.

573
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,609
(I explained
the work-related injury claim process)

574
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:36,569
(to her thoroughly.)

575
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,650
I also highlighted some key points

576
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,730
for labor dispute negotiations
with employers.

577
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,690
It was on our way to the hospital.

578
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,890
I didn't know Jun An

579
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,170
would represent Yiaiwan.

580
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,250
Mr. Zhou.

581
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,490
There was a themed party
at the bar that night.

582
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,089
All attendees were regular patrons.

583
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,809
The bartender there

584
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,010
took lots of pictures.

585
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,049
Including some of Zhu.

586
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:03,930
I compiled those photos and evidence

587
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,529
and sent everything to your email.

588
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,930
Do you want to say something to me?

589
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,089
It might be

590
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,930
inappropriate for me to say it.

591
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:20,170
Well...

592
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,089
Well...

593
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,369
About

594
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:25,089
your personal connection
with Guo Xiaoyu.

595
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,568
Just...

596
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:30,250
Lawyer through and through.

597
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,129
One sentence needs 100 qualifiers.

598
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:34,730
And pre-written disclaimers.

599
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,010
Terrified of misspeaking.

600
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,650
Are you asking me

601
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,490
if being so close to Guo Xiaoyu

602
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,970
means my actions will hurt her?

603
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:46,690
Not something
you should ask professionally.

604
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:48,089
So

605
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,369
is this concern for me?

606
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,769
If now's bad, I'll come back later.

607
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,129
We're done. Come in.

608
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:05,849
Mr. Zhou.

609
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,049
Yesterday, in the hospital,

610
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:09,170
I saw Zhu Zhisheng's mom

611
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,450
with an ambulance chaser
loitering in the hospital.

612
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,250
I think that ambulance chaser is

613
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:14,930
behind her timing

614
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,730
(Ambulance chaser)
during Yiaiwan's IPO.

615
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:22,569
Ambulance chasers
hunt hospital patients.

616
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,210
They promise claim assistance,

617
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,650
then fabricate evidence

618
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,529
to extort huge insurance payouts

619
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,129
before pocketing most

620
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:29,849
of the settlement.

621
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:30,730
I know.

622
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,609
Hospital visit?

623
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:37,369
But I didn't meet or speak

624
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,529
with Zhu Zhisheng's mother

625
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:40,089
or any other relatives.

626
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:42,809
That ambulance chaser issue.

627
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:44,529
I'll discuss it with Yiaiwan.

628
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,730
But I should warn you.

629
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,410
After years in law,

630
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,170
you see humanity's extremes.

631
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,890
Drive is good,

632
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,650
but protect yourself first.

633
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:56,609
Understood.

634
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:57,896
Also,

635
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:00,329
I accidentally saw

636
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:03,089
sedative sleeping pills
by Zhu Zhisheng's bedside.

637
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,490
So

638
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,529
his coma is probably related to that.

639
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:09,769
So now Zhu Zhisheng's coma

640
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:11,769
probably has nothing
to do with Yiaiwan, right?

641
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:12,890
The medicine

642
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,369
is at most a possible
contributing factor to the coma.

643
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,010
But what if he drank too?

644
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,529
Drinking?

645
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:26,289
(Yan Fei
to Ren Jiatong)

646
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:26,952
Mr. Zhou.

647
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,930
Will Yiaiwan still compensate him?

648
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:31,970
What's your point?

649
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,170
This might not be
a direct workplace injury,

650
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,490
but we checked his clock-ins.

651
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,569
He was grinding overtime constantly.

652
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:40,609
Moreover,

653
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,089
those pills

654
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,650
were likely due to work stress.

655
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,089
Giving zero compensation

656
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:49,170
would be brutal for young employees.

657
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:55,816
I'm sorry.

658
00:31:58,129 --> 00:31:59,210
I shouldn't have said that.

659
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:02,410
No apologies.

660
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:04,210
Emotionally,

661
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,490
I understand your words.

662
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,890
And I appreciate your passion.

663
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:10,089
But,

664
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,289
this isn't the right occasion

665
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,890
nor the right time for those words.

666
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,016
Understood?

667
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,769
Understood.

668
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,289
I won't say such things

669
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:20,450
in professional settings.

670
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:24,129
I'll go to that bartender again

671
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:24,809
to find out more

672
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,289
about Zhu Zhisheng's medication.

673
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:28,329
I'll go too.

674
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:36,049
Those words...

675
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,250
Even if you care about Guo Xiaoyu,

676
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,010
you wouldn't voice it professionally.

677
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,648
Right?

678
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:41,650
What's with you?

679
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:49,512
(Emergency)

680
00:32:52,648 --> 00:32:54,344
(Esazolam Tablets:
Sedative, sleeping pills.)

681
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:55,816
(Primarily used to treat
anxiety and insomnia)

682
00:32:55,816 --> 00:32:57,192
(and also tension, fear,
epilepsy and seizures.)

683
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:03,809
I was remembering someone
and something from the past.

684
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:07,289
I knew someone who,

685
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,250
during stressful times, couldn't sleep

686
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:12,730
and took similar medication.

687
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:23,369
How did you discover

688
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,010
Zhu Zhisheng drank before collapsing?

689
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:26,690
Though I quit drinking,

690
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,529
I'm still highly sensitive to alcohol.

691
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,049
And I have a sommelier license,

692
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,890
so I connected well with that bartender.

693
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:34,730
It was only two days ago,

694
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,769
during a big party night.

695
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,849
Hard to forget easily.

696
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:39,329
Why didn't you tell me
during our call last night?

697
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,210
You didn't mention
anything to me either.

698
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:47,970
I didn't tell you because...

699
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,329
I'm not using this to compete

700
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:54,210
against you.

701
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,289
But I am.

702
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:04,289
Since the moment I came to Hangzhou.

703
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,729
I want to win. I won't deny it.

704
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,970
But exposing the scumbag
who hurt my friend

705
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,450
matters just as much to me.

706
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,169
If Zhu doesn't get compensated,

707
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,169
he deserves it.

708
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:24,569
This isn't about you.

709
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:26,729
He hurt Guo Xiaoyu first.

710
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:27,609
I won't allow

711
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,249
my friend to feel torn in the middle

712
00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:30,890
after being betrayed.

713
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:33,330
Once I show her proof

714
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,089
of his infidelity,

715
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,290
she won't be conflicted.

716
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:36,729
How can she handle that?

717
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,569
Telling her now will devastate her.

718
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:39,810
But even if it's painful,

719
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,810
it's temporary.

720
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,850
Better than her naively
going to the hospital daily,

721
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,569
spending money and energy.

722
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,010
After we settle Zhu Zhisheng's matter,

723
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:48,249
we'll take her back.

724
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,089
But we can't decide for Guo Xiaoyu

725
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,529
which pain cuts deeper.

726
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:53,450
We aren't her.

727
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,209
Don't you know
how desperately she wants him

728
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:57,209
to wake up?

729
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:59,890
You're being contradictory.

730
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:01,410
Which side are you even on?

731
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:03,890
You uncovered
Zhu Zhisheng's sedative use.

732
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,609
I found evidence of his drinking.

733
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,529
We were cooperating well.

734
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:09,649
You think I'm harming Guo Xiaoyu.

735
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,330
And you?

736
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,010
Xiaoyu.

737
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,010
Why?

738
00:35:27,129 --> 00:35:27,720
Jiatong.

739
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:30,609
You came to the hospital yesterday.

740
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,169
Was it to see me or gather evidence?

741
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:37,770
You saw it yesterday.

742
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:39,169
He's suffering.

743
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,490
And Ms. Wang,

744
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,930
who raised her son
alone through hardship.

745
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:44,970
Now, her only child is in a coma.

746
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,330
Yiaiwan offers no response.

747
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:48,370
For days, only a department lead visited

748
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,129
and stayed for just 15 minutes.

749
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,010
She wants an explanation.

750
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,049
What's wrong with that?

751
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,850
Why push them further?

752
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,649
Guo Xiaoyu.

753
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,209
Zhu Zhisheng did cheat.

754
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,209
If you doubt it,

755
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:04,689
we both have proof.

756
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,569
You two

757
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:10,770
knew all along?

758
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,330
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

759
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,410
Now that you know the truth,

760
00:36:18,649 --> 00:36:20,010
stop letting them deceive you.

761
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:24,810
Yan Fei, I know you mean well.

762
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,450
I don't want
to hold you back from your work.

763
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:31,850
But now, Zhubao and Ms. Wang

764
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,330
are completely cornered.

765
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:36,450
Guo Xiaoyu, get a grip.

766
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,129
He cheated first and hurt you.

767
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,569
I despise these kinds
of scumbags more than anything.

768
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,330
Besides, this is the truth.

769
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,209
We haven't wrongfully accused him.

770
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,850
Did this relationship
scramble your brain?

771
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,209
This relationship

772
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,049
lost its meaning

773
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:52,450
the moment he cheated.

774
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,850
After the hurt of betrayal,

775
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:02,169
a relationship loses all meaning.

776
00:37:03,129 --> 00:37:04,010
What about us then?

777
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,770
I snuck home this morning
while my parents were at work

778
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,370
to cook this for you two.

779
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:29,529
You both came all the way
to Hangzhou for me.

780
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,370
That warms my heart deeply.

781
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,290
But I also feel incredibly sorry.

782
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,370
Jiatong.

783
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,810
What I told you last night

784
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,010
came straight from my heart.

785
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,649
I truly see you both as my sisters.

786
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:51,810
Xiaoyu.

787
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,450
Xiaoyu.

788
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,689
Xiaoyu, wait up.

789
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,448
(Zhu Zhisheng's Collapse Claim)
Xiaoyu

790
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,290
(Mrs. Zhu says Guo Xiaoyu shared company info.)
Yiaiwan's legal department

791
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,529
received documents
from Zhu Zhisheng's mother.

792
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:10,689
She says you told her

793
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,010
about Yiaiwan's upcoming IPO.

794
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:14,049
It's probably that ambulance chaser.

795
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,330
He might have told Zhu's mother

796
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,330
to frame you.

797
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:18,970
Ms. Wang wouldn't say that.

798
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,770
Could there be a misunderstanding?

799
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,290
She also claims

800
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,049
Jun An sent Zhu Zhisheng's girlfriend

801
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:31,490
to negotiate with her

802
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:32,689
to cover up

803
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:34,689
Yiaiwan's forcing overtime
on Zhu Zhisheng

804
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:35,569
to avoid paying.

805
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:36,890
Ms. Wang,

806
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:38,890
if Zhu Zhisheng's case

807
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,569
is recognized as a work injury,

808
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,010
he can claim workers' compensation.

809
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,529
They sent over dashcam footage
and this photo.

810
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:03,848
(Let's have a call
after your meeting, Ren Jiatong.)

811
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,169
The calmer Ms. Bai sounds,

812
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,330
the scarier.

813
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,209
Ms. Bai is worried about you two.

814
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:11,529
During our online meeting,

815
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:12,490
she told Mr. Zhuang

816
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,689
Guo Xiaoyu was unaware then.

817
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,850
Her legal advice in the car was given

818
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,209
before our meeting started.

819
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,569
It was just general legal counsel,

820
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,049
not reflecting Jun An.

821
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:22,810
Mr. Song also defended you,

822
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,370
saying you reported the conflict

823
00:39:24,649 --> 00:39:25,450
and stayed clear.

824
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,410
But I never reported to Mr. Song.

825
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,609
You reported to me,

826
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,770
and I told Mr. Song.

827
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,290
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

828
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,970
I was overwhelmed that day.

829
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,049
Your timely reminder saved me.

830
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,600
Mr. Zhou,

831
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:41,249
is this photo the biggest headache?

832
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:46,209
But we've never discussed
this matter with Zhu Zhisheng's mother.

833
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,010
I believe you.

834
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,010
But photos can
be interpreted too broadly.

835
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,930
Prepare yourselves mentally

836
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,370
for potential trouble.

837
00:39:58,649 --> 00:39:59,810
I'll talk to Ms. Wang.

838
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:01,290
She did this because she felt

839
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:01,850
cornered.

840
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,770
She's not a bad person.

841
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:04,330
And you still trust her?

842
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,450
If you go,

843
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,129
what if she records you again?

844
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:10,984
Mr. Zhou,

845
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,490
let's go to the hospital

846
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:13,930
and talk to Zhu's mother.

847
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,450
If Guo Xiaoyu had known
about Zhu's cheating earlier

848
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,129
and dumped him,

849
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:25,049
she and Ren Jiatong
wouldn't be in this mess.

850
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:26,290
Are you alright?

851
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:27,810
Perfectly fine.

852
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:29,729
Zhu Zhisheng means nothing to me.

853
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:32,089
I just genuinely hate scumbags like him.

854
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:33,930
So you take boxing lessons

855
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:35,450
to beat up scumbags.

856
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:37,490
Yes, I want to take down
every single one I see.

857
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,410
I sense your killer vibe.

858
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,850
No need to be scared.

859
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:42,689
You're such a rare gem of a man.

860
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:43,649
And a lawyer.

861
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,930
Seriously, this might be
the world's ninth wonder.

862
00:40:46,129 --> 00:40:46,850
A good man.

863
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:47,912
Me?

864
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:54,609
Ms. Wang.

865
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,330
We're lawyers from Jun An.

866
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:57,410
Here to see him.

867
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,770
I've already sent my demands to you.

868
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,209
Unless you agree

869
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,456
to pay,

870
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:05,410
don't come back.

871
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:07,209
Ms. Wang.

872
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:09,330
Xiaoyu worries about you.

873
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:14,529
The diagnosis is out.

874
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:16,129
Cerebral hemorrhage caused by impact.

875
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:17,850
Yiaiwan owes me an explanation.

876
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:21,032
He collapsed at the office
after working overtime.

877
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:22,504
He's been unconscious.

878
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:25,224
What if his medical bills exceed

879
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,010
insurance coverage later?

880
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,209
My son's current situation

881
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,370
is entirely Yiaiwan's fault.

882
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,129
Sorry, Ms. Bai.

883
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:54,529
This was all my negligence.

884
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,490
It won't happen again.

885
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:05,896
Okay.

886
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:06,970
Understood, Ms. Bai.

887
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,360
(Jiang Chen
to Ren Jiatong)

888
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:18,729

889
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,450
What's wrong?

890
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:28,890
I'm sorry.

891
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,089
Huang Yue just told me everything.

892
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:35,890
Jiang Chen said you hesitated for ages.

893
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:38,649
Then Ms. Wang pressured you.

894
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,689
You worried it would affect me,

895
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:42,770
so you handed over the evidence.

896
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:45,010
I misunderstood you before.

897
00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:46,249
I'm sorry.

898
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,810
I'm not mad at you.

899
00:42:49,729 --> 00:42:51,049
My fault for not telling you.

900
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,290
Actually, his mother knew too.

901
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,649
She just kept it from us.

902
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,290
It's probably my mistake.

903
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,609
If I hadn't called you to the hospital,

904
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,370
none of this would've happened.

905
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:04,410
And you wouldn't be involved.

906
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,129
Aren't you two hungry?

907
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:09,209
If you keep apologizing,

908
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:10,169
the food will get cold.
