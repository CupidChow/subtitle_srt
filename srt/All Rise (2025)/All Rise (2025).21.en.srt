(Guo Xiaoyu 3, Yan Fei 2)

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,864
(Ren Jiatong 1, Jiang Chen 1)

28
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:55,688
Have you heard?

29
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:57,787
The client Ms. Bai just met with

30
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,227
is her ex-boyfriend.

31
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:01,186
And this guy came to see Ms. Bai

32
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:02,986
to help his current girlfriend.

33
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,067
I'm so furious!

34
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:06,986
What's wrong with these men?

35
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,186
Are they all heartless?

36
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,746
Maybe you should add a prerequisite

37
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:14,387
to your conclusion.

38
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,786
Let's be more rigorous.

39
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:16,946
Don't target the innocent.

40
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:24,488
I'm being quite rigorous.

41
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,987
I didn't misjudge any bad man.

42
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:33,626
I'm just so mad.

43
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,186
I don't think
Ms. Bai will take this case.

44
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:38,027
It's generous
that she didn't kick him out.

45
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:40,587
But my gut feeling is
Ms. Bai will take the case.

46
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,587
I also think so.

47
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,346
Ms. Bai doesn't
let emotions affect her work.

48
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,666
This isn't about emotions.

49
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,987
It's about basic self-respect.

50
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:49,946
Think about it.

51
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,147
Since her divorce,

52
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,466
he's the only boyfriend
Ms. Bai has ever acknowledged.

53
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,147
She almost committed to him.

54
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:57,387
I don't know exactly why

55
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,307
they broke up later,

56
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:00,987
but I'd guess that in Ms. Bai's heart,

57
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:03,107
he probably meant more than my idol.

58
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:06,626
I bet you 100 yuan. She won't take it.

59
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,506
What are you discussing?
Not at your desk

60
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:17,387
and already slacking?

61
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:19,346
Let me say something here.

62
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:22,027
Ms. Bai has taken on the bribery case

63
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,746
involving Xia Jun at Mr. Gao's request.

64
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:25,626
I'll send you

65
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,267
case files and assignments shortly.

66
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:29,107
Get familiar with the case immediately.

67
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:30,027
Finish it promptly.

68
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,186
But

69
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:32,707
their connections are tangled,

70
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:33,626
being coworkers,

71
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:34,666
client and contractor,

72
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,267
and exes. It's complicated.

73
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:36,906
Enough.

74
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:38,666
Ms. Guo,

75
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:40,147
we're a Red Circle Firm,

76
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,147
not a matchmaker.

77
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:43,387
Stop analyzing relationships.

78
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:44,666
Okay.

79
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:45,946
Keep work as work

80
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:46,946
and love as love.

81
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:48,267
Don't mix the two.

82
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:51,626
Guo Xiaoyu, Ren Jiatong,
go find Ms. Tian.

83
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:53,267
Meet the client with her

84
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:54,506
and get more case details.

85
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:57,267
Jiang Chen, Yan Fei,
send me the key points

86
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,792
from Xia Jun's internal report soon.

87
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,466
Mr. Zhou, she might get
some urgent work to do.

88
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,387
Get back to work.

89
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:14,312
Give me 100 yuan.

90
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:14,867
Shut up.

91
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:39,426
Yan Fei,

92
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,507
no rush on your report.
Tomorrow is fine.

93
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:44,507
Okay.

94
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,312
(When are you coming back?)

95
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,666
Here. Have some water.

96
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,786
Your girlfriend didn't
come train with you?

97
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:17,106
Not my girlfriend.

98
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:18,426
We are colleagues.

99
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,106
I just met Xia Jun with Guo Xiaoyu.

100
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:37,346
She admitted recommending introduction

101
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:39,666
of the outsourcing software company
at their request,

102
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,587
but denied bribery.

103
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:41,866
But they insisted

104
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,627
they gave her
two million cash personally,

105
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,306
with times, locations, and witnesses.

106
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,306
Their internal investigation report

107
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,747
listed several locations where they met,

108
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,986
including a seafood restaurant
and a pub.

109
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:54,507
But Xia Jun claimed she has
severe seafood allergy.

110
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:56,507
She'd never meet
at a seafood restaurant.

111
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:58,627
So they're probably lying.

112
00:06:59,387 --> 00:06:59,986
I'm on it.

113
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:02,666
I'll visit

114
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:03,627
all those places

115
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,587
and see if I'd have any chance

116
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:06,546
to check footage.

117
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:08,546
I'll update you if I find anything.

118
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,027
Okay.

119
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:15,080
Have you eaten?

120
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:17,587
Xiaoyu is cooking.

121
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:19,587
I'm also hungry.

122
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:28,226
It depends on your performance.
If you find solid evidence,

123
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,440
we'll save you a bite
for a midnight snack.

124
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,986
What if I can't find anything?

125
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:38,866
Then I'll be merciful

126
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:40,387
and grab some with you.

127
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:42,546
Deal.

128
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,584
Jiatong, noodles are ready.

129
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,027
Talk later.

130
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:50,147
Who is it?

131
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:53,747
Jiang Chen.

132
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,707
I've updated them

133
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:56,947
with today's information.

134
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:57,906
Yan Fei hasn't replied.

135
00:07:57,906 --> 00:07:59,187
Jiang Chen called me back.

136
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:04,707
He didn't say anything else?

137
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:08,106
No.

138
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:16,906
Jiatong,

139
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:20,507
we're best friends.

140
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:23,786
There's something I have to tell you.

141
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:26,947
What is it?

142
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:27,747
So mysterious.

143
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:32,546
I think

144
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,946
Yan Fei and Jiang Chen have
something going on.

145
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:41,267
What could be going on?

146
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:42,826
What else could it possibly be?

147
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,186
Are you an idiot? Think about it.

148
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,027
How we obsess over couples?

149
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:48,666
We examine every little detail
with a magnifying glass.

150
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,467
At the slightest hint,

151
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,027
we'll imagine an entire love story.

152
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:53,027
Listen.

153
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:53,747
Lately,

154
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,546
whenever I post on Moments,

155
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:56,586
Jiang Chen likes it.

156
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,066
He never liked my posts before.

157
00:08:58,867 --> 00:08:59,586
Do you know why?

158
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:00,946
Why?

159
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:02,987
I bet

160
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:06,027
it's because I'm close friends
with Yan Fei.

161
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,387
This is all way too suspicious.

162
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:12,347
Last time, I posted our group photo.

163
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:13,507
He liked it again,

164
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,467
just because Yan Fei was standing
in the middle.

165
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,107
I didn't want to tell you any of this.

166
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:22,946
I'm just afraid

167
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:24,786
you would get hurt.

168
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:27,906
How could I possibly get hurt?

169
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:32,586
Alright. Good that you're
taking this well.

170
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:34,867
Don't blame Yan Fei.

171
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,467
Blame that fool Jiang Chen.

172
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:37,666
Listen.

173
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,267
Guys can change their feelings
in an instant.

174
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,747
You think you are close,

175
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:42,987
yet suddenly, he changes.

176
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:45,946
Several days ago,

177
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,786
I saw an image on Yiaiwan's

178
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:48,586
beta testing site.

179
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,627
Though anonymously posted,

180
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:51,906
it must be Zhu Zhisheng's work.

181
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,306
Look at this username.

182
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:55,867
Rain1016.

183
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:57,666
That's my birthday.

184
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,107
When he made this image,

185
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,107
he must have been daydreaming
about our future.

186
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:08,387
Xiaoyu,

187
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,066
you haven't moved on from Zhu Zhisheng?

188
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:16,186
Honestly, I don't know.

189
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,267
Since I returned from Hangzhou,

190
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:20,666
I keep telling myself daily

191
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,586
that I must let it go.

192
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:24,666
He's just some guy.

193
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,946
Just four years of relationship.

194
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,867
No big deal, right?

195
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,306
I don't care at all.

196
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:31,747
I'll totally forget it.

197
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:34,627
But sometimes,

198
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:36,306
with just a random song,

199
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:38,147
a familiar scent,

200
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:40,306
or even certain clothes,

201
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:42,107
just by seeing it,

202
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:44,027
my heart hurts badly like it's been

203
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:44,867
punctured.

204
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:48,066
But when I saw that image recently,

205
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,706
I suddenly realized

206
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:54,747
maybe dating is just like
playing video games.

207
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:56,627
Sometimes you play for hours,

208
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:58,666
but forget to save progress.

209
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:01,066
All that hard-earned gear disappears.

210
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:02,987
Or even worse,

211
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:04,107
you lose your account.

212
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:05,786
Tell me.

213
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:07,387
In cases like that,

214
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,586
does that make it all pointless?

215
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,306
Definitely not.

216
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,627
Because I truly experienced

217
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,387
the highs and lows during gameplay.

218
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:20,786
Those feelings

219
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:22,906
aren't tied to anyone else.

220
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:24,426
They belong to me alone.

221
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,627
I just want to tell you.

222
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:28,507
Jiatong,

223
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:30,906
whatever we go through,

224
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,586
let's never lose faith in love.

225
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,627
Xiaoyu, you're amazing.

226
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:40,906
Jiatong,

227
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:43,627
this is the first time
you hugged me first.

228
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:54,186
If you're feeling down,

229
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,227
it's okay.

230
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,426
Talk to me. I understand.

231
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:03,147
Okay.

232
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,066
Earlier, Guo Xiaoyu was

233
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,747
having serious analysis.

234
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:13,826
I'm torn

235
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,546
about whether to tell her or not.

236
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:18,987
I'm also afraid that someday

237
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,227
she'll find out and be mad.

238
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:21,627
Oh, no!

239
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:24,426
I think I missed the best time
to confess.

240
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:25,747
So what now?

241
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,066
How about going for leniency now?

242
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:29,987
Well, there's another way.

243
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:31,227
What is it?

244
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,227
We can just stop all contact.

245
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:40,107
Ren Jiatong, you...
Good thing you're not a judge.

246
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,906
You'd cause so many
wrongful convictions.

247
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,426
I can't even imagine.

248
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:44,706
What did I do?

249
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:46,227
You're sacrificing me.

250
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:47,306
I won't accept it.

251
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:48,306
I'm innocent.

252
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:49,627
I want to appeal.

253
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:51,586
Alright, alright.

254
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:53,267
I restore your innocence.

255
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:55,706
That's more like it.

256
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,867
Should we do something for Mr. Zhou

257
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:01,107
and Yan Fei?

258
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,147
Since you brought it up,

259
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,387
you must have a plan.

260
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:05,227
Tell me.

261
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:06,747
I have no plan.

262
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:08,826
How could I have a plan
for their romance?

263
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,107
But I do have invited Mr. Zhou

264
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:12,027
to investigate later.

265
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,107
I'll see how he's doing then.

266
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:16,347
If he's completely heartless,

267
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,586
let's just drop it.

268
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:19,666
Yan Fei is so proud.

269
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,384
She'd feel bad
if we kept bringing it up.

270
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:22,826
You sure know Yan Fei well.

271
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:28,906
Who spilled the vinegar?

272
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:30,627
Smells jealous in here!

273
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:33,306
Just go!

274
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:33,987
And then?

275
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:35,227
Come right back.

276
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:37,507
Got it!

277
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:52,546
Just off work?

278
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:54,107
Mr. Song,

279
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,147
working this late too?

280
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:58,027
Are you settling back in

281
00:13:58,387 --> 00:13:58,906
with Ms. Bai?

282
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:01,186
It's manageable.

283
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:02,426
I've been supporting Ms. Bai

284
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,306
with that new case.

285
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,387
Ms. Bai mentioned it to me.

286
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:09,347
How's it going?

287
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:10,946
Mr. Zhou and I plan

288
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:11,987
to inspect those locations

289
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:13,066
listed in the internal

290
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,666
investigation report,

291
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:16,347
and look for potential clues.

292
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:18,728
Haven't eaten yet?

293
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,987
Grab something downstairs on your way,

294
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:22,666
and eat a bit.

295
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:24,347
Health comes first.

296
00:14:25,227 --> 00:14:26,267
Also, let me remind you.

297
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:29,066
Ms. Bai takes this case seriously.

298
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,592
If there's anything,
report to her immediately.

299
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:34,627
I heard...

300
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:37,027
I just heard

301
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:37,867
that this case

302
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,507
was brought by Ms. Bai's ex-boyfriend.

303
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,147
And it's actually
for his current girlfriend.

304
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:45,960
The relationships are too complicated.

305
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:47,867
We were just talking this afternoon

306
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:49,906
that he's treating Ms. Bai
way too casually.

307
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:51,387
It's also awkward for us.

308
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:53,387
Actually, I think it shows

309
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:54,546
Ms. Bai has great judgment.

310
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:55,706
She saw him right.

311
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:57,666
He came to Jun An for Ms. Bai.

312
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,107
It shows that he thinks

313
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:00,786
Ms. Bai is the best lawyer.

314
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,666
Though feelings may fade,

315
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:05,227
admiration and respect

316
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:06,586
endure.

317
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:08,706
You're brilliant, Mr. Song.

318
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,627
You know Ms. Bai,

319
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:12,347
and opponents too.

320
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:14,946
Who told you we're opponents?

321
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:16,147
Let me remind you.

322
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,387
At our law firm,

323
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:19,706
we already have a gossip expert,
Guo Xiaoyu.

324
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:20,586
Stay away.

325
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:30,666
Mr. Song,

326
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,826
does our firm really have the rule

327
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,027
that colleagues can't date each other?

328
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:38,507
I'm just being nosy.

329
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:43,048
Here's the thing.

330
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,027
At our firm,

331
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:46,747
we genuinely discourage

332
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:49,147
developing overly complicated
emotional relationships.

333
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:50,826
But personally,

334
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:52,507
I don't encourage young people

335
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:54,107
to do things they'll regret.

336
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,066
If you did something regrettable,

337
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,627
would you tell her?

338
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:03,186
We're all adults.

339
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:04,507
Some things go

340
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:05,786
without saying.

341
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:06,987
We both know.

342
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:11,107
Legally speaking,

343
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:13,267
the intent means the internal intent

344
00:16:13,387 --> 00:16:14,987
must combine with external expression.

345
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,027
Internal intents
without external expression

346
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,147
have no legal effect.

347
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,306
So I think

348
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,306
that unspoken emotions

349
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:23,586
aren't necessarily known.

350
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,867
I'm here, Mr. Song. See you tomorrow.

351
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,066
Mr. Zhou.

352
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:53,387
I'm so sorry.

353
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:54,706
Beijing's traffic is just...

354
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:55,467
It's fine.

355
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:56,786
I've seen the footage.

356
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:58,066
And I recorded it.

357
00:16:58,507 --> 00:16:59,586
- I'll send it to you.
- Okay.

358
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:01,666
When I finish the report,

359
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,267
I'll send it to you and Ms. Bai.

360
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:13,146
- Treat you to dinner?
- What about the report?

361
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:14,826
Dinner matters more.

362
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:15,866
I'm hungry.

363
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:17,947
I've been meaning to find time

364
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:18,907
to tell you a story

365
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:22,146
about Moments and a certain hand.

366
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,626
You asked for it.

367
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:29,707
♪Tears fall♪

368
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:32,187
♪Emotions scattered♪

369
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:38,546
Mr. Zhou, what's going on with us?

370
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:40,907
How did we both get stuck in romance?

371
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:43,427
You're my mentor.

372
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:45,066
It's your duty to explain.

373
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:49,306
Learning from me? Don't ask me.

374
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:51,546
When it comes to romance,

375
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:52,826
I'm completely clueless.

376
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:54,467
Fine.

377
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:57,146
Then you should tell me

378
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:58,707
when things started with Yan Fei.

379
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:02,747
Nothing started.

380
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:09,146
I don't know

381
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:10,467
when I started liking her.

382
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:12,667
At first, I thought she was

383
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,106
kind of a spoiled rich girl.

384
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:17,786
Her family is a client of Jun An.

385
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:19,626
I couldn't offend her.

386
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:20,826
So I was polite.

387
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:23,187
But gradually, I realized

388
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,747
she's actually a very kind

389
00:18:25,987 --> 00:18:27,066
and warm-hearted girl.

390
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:29,187
She's straightforward.

391
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,146
But she genuinely helps
when people need her.

392
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:37,747
I don't even know if this counts

393
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:40,306
as liking her.

394
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,227
But she really is

395
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:44,066
different.

396
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:45,146
Different?

397
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:46,747
That's not liking.

398
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,066
That's love. Definitely love.

399
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:51,586
Whatever it is,

400
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,146
I have to suppress the feelings.

401
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:57,507
Because as of this moment,

402
00:18:57,866 --> 00:18:59,027
I'm still your mentor.

403
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,027
If my feelings for her

404
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:02,826
cause even

405
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,227
the slightest bias in my heart,

406
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:07,427
that would be unfair to all of you.

407
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:10,546
If we got together,

408
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:13,707
and I revealed anything
intentionally or accidentally,

409
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:15,306
or if I paid her too much

410
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:16,707
attention

411
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:18,786
and affected the program's fairness,

412
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:20,306
I would betray

413
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,586
Mr. Zhuang, Mr. Song,
and Ms. Bai's trust in me.

414
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,456
It would also betray my profession.

415
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:26,386
So I have to be professional.

416
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,667
What about
after the Talent Hunt Program ends?

417
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:35,146
I haven't thought about it.

418
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,947
Mr. Song just told me

419
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,747
we should not have regrets.

420
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,747
You should stand firm when necessary.

421
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:48,467
I think he's right.

422
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:51,866
I know what you mean.

423
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:53,586
But Chen,

424
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:57,187
the gap between my family

425
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,227
and hers,

426
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,424
I'm not exaggerating,

427
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:03,066
is like the Mariana Trench

428
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,786
to Mount Everest.

429
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:07,227
Nonsense.

430
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:08,947
Who even cares
about these things nowadays?

431
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:10,866
At least, Yan Fei

432
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,546
would never care about stuff like that.

433
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,467
Then what would her parents think?

434
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:17,626
Freedom in dating

435
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:18,786
and marriage

436
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,306
is protected by law.

437
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:23,346
Besides the law, there's also
human connection.

438
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:26,467
We're humans first,

439
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:28,306
and then lawyers.

440
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:31,667
Hey, check the message.

441
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,066
You didn't reply to my message.

442
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:35,346
How much longer for your report?

443
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:38,507
I'm outside. I haven't checked my phone.

444
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:40,427
I'll send it to you later.

445
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:41,707
Within an hour.

446
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:44,106
Okay, take care then.

447
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:47,866
Why do I hear trucks from your side?

448
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:48,586
Where are you?

449
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,546
Outside the Fifth Ring Road, stargazing.

450
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,027
It's too overcast today.

451
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:54,786
Nothing visible.

452
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,306
But five big trucks
have already passed by.

453
00:20:58,427 --> 00:20:59,747
I'm covered in dust.

454
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,866
No stars tonight.

455
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:04,360
Because the one who
accompanied you didn't come.

456
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:08,346
I joined the astronomy club as a kid.

457
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,507
Besides, I've got a whole
telescope setup at home.

458
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,626
Can't I just come stargazing alone?

459
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:14,667
Of course.

460
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:16,306
I just wanted to tell you

461
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:18,507
just the other day,

462
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:22,066
I witnessed a certain lawyer

463
00:21:22,427 --> 00:21:24,146
holding his phone,

464
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:25,467
scrolling through

465
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:27,907
someone's Moments,

466
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:29,987
zooming in and out.

467
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,507
That was way more interesting
than stargazing.

468
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:33,626
Really?

469
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:35,707
Who was it?

470
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:40,747
You want the report?

471
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,187
I'll deliver it now.

472
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,306
Then at least,
after the Talent Hunt Program,

473
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,626
you should tell Yan Fei how you feel.

474
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,907
Holding back like this can't be right.

475
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:57,546
She doesn't need to know.

476
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:58,707
She has the right to know!

477
00:21:59,386 --> 00:21:59,866
What then?

478
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,227
There's a huge gap between our families.

479
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:05,507
Telling her would only cause her stress.

480
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:06,786
What if her family approves?

481
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:07,626
Even if they do,

482
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:11,586
our working relationship,
the family gap,

483
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,306
my wish to work in Hangzhou,

484
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:15,306
and her vision for her future,

485
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:17,267
all these practical issues

486
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:19,146
would become problems for us.

487
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:20,667
I am

488
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:23,907
a man about to turn thirty.

489
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:25,826
My family's just ordinary.

490
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:28,066
In my life,

491
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:31,626
romance can only be a very small part.

492
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:32,267
I want to,

493
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:33,586
but I just can't.

494
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,546
I need to work hard.

495
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:36,947
I owe it to my family,

496
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:38,306
to myself,

497
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:39,586
and even more to her, right?

498
00:22:40,306 --> 00:22:41,866
Besides, as a seasoned lawyer,

499
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:43,907
my years of professional training
prevent me

500
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:47,987
from acting rashly. I have to identify
potential risks early,

501
00:22:48,027 --> 00:22:49,106
warn clients,

502
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,707
and prevent problems
before a contract starts.

503
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:53,586
I even draft disclaimers for myself.

504
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:54,747
So I know better than anyone,

505
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:58,066
if something carries excessive risks,

506
00:22:58,707 --> 00:22:59,866
it's best not to start it.

507
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:14,066
I disagree.

508
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:18,586
You said it yourself.

509
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:21,146
We're humans first, then lawyers.

510
00:23:21,427 --> 00:23:23,346
But what you just said is the contrary.

511
00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:29,386
But last night, someone else

512
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:30,507
said the same thing to me.

513
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:33,626
What I said earlier

514
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:35,427
only applies to myself.

515
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,546
Everyone has different circumstances.

516
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:41,467
I do agree with Mr. Song.

517
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:44,786
If we can fix regrets now,

518
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:47,866
don't let it happen.

519
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:01,306
What's going on?

520
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:03,346
Why call me down so late?

521
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:07,586
Why do we look like

522
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:09,066
spies meeting in secret?

523
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:10,947
Oh, please.

524
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,106
James Bond

525
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:13,386
drives Aston Martins.

526
00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:15,427
He's surrounded by luxury goods

527
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:16,467
and beautiful women.

528
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,146
We're just

529
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:19,427
well-dressed

530
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:20,306
CBD workers.

531
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,027
Anyway, fancy cars and beauties

532
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,066
don't really interest me.

533
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:27,306
I've got you.

534
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:31,346
Come. I'll take you somewhere.

535
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:41,386
I Just saw your post.

536
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:43,306
Did Yan Fei find you?

537
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:46,427
I told her

538
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:48,947
Mr. Zhou kept looking
at that photo repeatedly.

539
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,987
He clearly cares a lot.

540
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:52,106
I bet she was happy to hear that.

541
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:53,866
She didn't say it outright,

542
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:55,987
but she used sending
reports as an excuse

543
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,586
to ask about Mr. Zhou indirectly.

544
00:24:58,507 --> 00:24:59,626
Then she left happily.

545
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:02,306
But if she knew

546
00:25:02,306 --> 00:25:03,866
what Mr. Zhou just told you,

547
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:05,866
she'd be upset for days.

548
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,227
But

549
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:09,546
Mr. Zhou has it tough too.

550
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:11,187
It's really not easy.

551
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:13,146
But

552
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,386
I'm thinking

553
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:16,267
choosing

554
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,586
to let go after weighing the pros

555
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:20,907
and cons mean the one just

556
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:22,987
doesn't love enough.

557
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:27,586
I get Mr. Zhou though.

558
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:29,947
If a relationship

559
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:32,306
traps both in difficulty,

560
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,106
then letting go early is also love.

561
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:38,626
No point clinging to something doomed.

562
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:41,507
But until the very end,

563
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:42,947
who really knows the outcome?

564
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:44,987
I think this way,

565
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:45,866
or either way around,

566
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:46,947
but it's all just guessing.

567
00:25:47,507 --> 00:25:49,066
Just like we work on a case.

568
00:25:49,586 --> 00:25:50,346
You might think

569
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:50,987
you'll

570
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:52,546
lose for sure,

571
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:54,907
but you still go all out.

572
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:58,467
Shouldn't love get the same effort?

573
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,826
Mr. Song didn't say it outright,

574
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:04,667
but I sense he regrets it.

575
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:07,267
We can't repeat
the older generation's mistakes,

576
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:08,786
never communicating,

577
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:09,987
bottling everything up,

578
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:11,146
assuming others

579
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:13,066
will magically

580
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,306
understand them,

581
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,227
and missing everything.

582
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:21,947
I called you out tonight

583
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:24,546
because I thought hard on the way back.

584
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:25,507
I believe

585
00:26:26,747 --> 00:26:28,747
if I leave Jun An
and don't go back to Chongqing,

586
00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:30,786
I have other options.

587
00:26:31,427 --> 00:26:32,306
What do you mean?

588
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:38,306
I'm considering dropping out
of the Talent Hunt Program.

589
00:26:40,187 --> 00:26:40,866
I think you might

590
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:41,826
need this offer more.

591
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:45,306
Jiang Chen,

592
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:47,146
are you pitying me?

593
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:49,707
You think I can't

594
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:50,267
earn it myself

595
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:51,146
unless you step aside?

596
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:53,427
No! I just thought

597
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,346
this might be better for us.

598
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,826
Don't get mad.

599
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:57,947
I'm not mad.

600
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,346
Leave if you want.

601
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:02,227
But if you're doing this for me,

602
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:03,306
I won't take it.

603
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:05,066
Don't misunderstand.

604
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,346
I haven't decided anything yet.

605
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:08,306
And I never said

606
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:10,386
I'm only doing this for you.

607
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:12,346
I'm just discussing it with you.

608
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,747
Don't normal couples
discuss things together?

609
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,386
First, we're not dating.

610
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:20,467
At most, we kissed once.

611
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:22,786
Whether you call it impulse
due to being drunk

612
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:24,947
or being stressful and lonely,

613
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:26,187
that's up to you.

614
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:28,546
Besides, I don't need you
to give it to me.

615
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:30,626
Even if you go all out,

616
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:32,488
you still might not defeat me.

617
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:34,586
What are you saying?

618
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,066
What do you mean we are not dating?

619
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:38,306
I'm not targeting you.

620
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:40,346
I'm just not interested in love.

621
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:44,667
Especially if it means
you are sacrificing for me.

622
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,546
I can't bear that.

623
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,146
Ren Jiatong, what are you so afraid of?

624
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:53,346
What... What can't you face?

625
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:54,546
Why are you so

626
00:27:55,227 --> 00:27:57,146
afraid to admit your own feelings?

627
00:27:57,146 --> 00:27:58,907
You act cold,

628
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:00,546
giving off a standoffish vibe.

629
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,187
Do you think that's cool?

630
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:03,227
Or will it protect you?

631
00:28:03,227 --> 00:28:03,947
No.

632
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:06,306
Right now, you're being cowardly.

633
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:08,467
You're afraid of getting hurt.

634
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,947
So you refuse to love.

635
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:12,667
You're afraid of carrying
others' expectations.

636
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:13,306
So you just

637
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:15,306
never open your heart to anyone.

638
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:16,947
Am I right?

639
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:18,546
You're right.

640
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:20,826
In my heart,

641
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:22,626
all that love is pointless.

642
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:25,626
I'd rather spend that time
drafting more reports,

643
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:26,826
or reading more papers

644
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,747
to secure my spot

645
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:29,707
and get that offer.

646
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:33,786
Let's get things straight now.

647
00:28:34,027 --> 00:28:34,907
No more trouble later.

648
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:36,866
It's good.

649
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:40,947
What do you mean?

650
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:45,507
Did I make you feel troubled?

651
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:48,146
Are you serious?

652
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:50,786
You want us to have nothing
but rivalry from now on?

653
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:55,187
I'm serious.

654
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:08,146
Hello?

655
00:30:10,947 --> 00:30:11,386
Yan Fei?

656
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:20,947
I'll be right there. Don't panic.

657
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:22,792
Send me your location.

658
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:27,346
What's with your brother?

659
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,672
Not answering calls,
nowhere to be found.

660
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:31,586
If he wants to break up,

661
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:32,947
he should just say so.

662
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:34,346
Is it so hard to be blunt?

663
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,507
I don't believe he can hide forever.

664
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:39,826
So you were actually trying
to ambush my brother?

665
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:41,586
But since my car was restricted today

666
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:42,707
and I drove his car instead,

667
00:30:42,786 --> 00:30:44,386
you accidentally ended up cornering me?

668
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:46,947
We're both women.

669
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:49,747
I'm sure you understand this situation.

670
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,008
We've been together for over six months.

671
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:54,106
Look.

672
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:57,907
This is the photo your brother and I
took abroad.

673
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:00,586
Everything was fine
when he dropped me at the airport.

674
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:02,667
It's been days now.

675
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:04,106
No reply

676
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:05,066
to texts or calls.

677
00:31:05,427 --> 00:31:06,106
What's the deal?

678
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:08,346
But I can't reach him either right now.

679
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:10,626
I just called his assistant.

680
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:12,947
She said something important came up.

681
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:13,507
I also think

682
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,507
he's definitely tied up
with something critical.

683
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,187
Maybe just wait a bit longer?

684
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:18,267
Just excuses.

685
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,707
What could be so urgent
he can't even text back?

686
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:24,667
I don't care. He owes me an explanation.

687
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:26,227
I'll break up with him,

688
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,586
but not by being dumped unknowingly.

689
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:32,866
Do you have specific demands?

690
00:31:33,907 --> 00:31:34,632
Two million.

691
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:39,346
A hundred thousand.

692
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:40,346
Not a cent more.

693
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:42,586
But give him three more days.

694
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:43,626
When he's back,

695
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:45,066
you two sort everything out.

696
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,346
Yan Da isn't the person you think he is.

697
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:49,106
He's my brother. I know him.

698
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:50,306
He must be swamped

699
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:51,866
by something important.

700
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:53,747
As for his work,

701
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:54,907
I honestly don't know much.

702
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:56,306
I called his assistant.

703
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:57,306
She was evasive too.

704
00:31:58,267 --> 00:32:00,427
This hundred thousand is your own money?

705
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:01,747
I have credit cards,

706
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:03,626
but little cash on hand.

707
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:04,826
That's the best I can do.

708
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:07,027
But after you take the money,

709
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:08,267
sign an agreement with me.

710
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,386
You must promise not to tell anyone

711
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:11,786
about your relationship.

712
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:13,546
Also, those pictures

713
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:14,346
and chat records.

714
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:16,826
Everything waits until he comes back.

715
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:20,507
I won't sign. And I won't
take your money.

716
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:21,866
But don't worry.

717
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:24,626
Hearing what you just said,
I agree to three days.

718
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:25,507
After three days,

719
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:27,786
if your brother
still vanishes like this,

720
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:28,586
not even you,

721
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:29,786
nor ten blood sisters

722
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:31,027
could save him.

723
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:35,027
I understand.

724
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,227
But let me say something.

725
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:40,626
Money can't fix everything.

726
00:32:41,187 --> 00:32:43,507
Sometimes, it just creates
more problems.

727
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:48,866
But

728
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,146
you're decent.

729
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:53,386
In my opinion, Yan Da
should call you brother.

730
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:07,586
What now?

731
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:09,987
Another round?

732
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:11,066
Come on.

733
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:12,586
Two of the same, please.

734
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:16,907
Thanks.

735
00:33:19,546 --> 00:33:20,947
What? Your brother isn't back yet,

736
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:22,027
and you're handling this?

737
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:25,346
I've been dumped like that before.

738
00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:27,907
That's why I get her heartbreak.

739
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,947
Helping her feel better is worth it.

740
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,427
Besides, I think

741
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:35,027
that girl genuinely cares
about my brother.

742
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:36,507
Her demanding money

743
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:37,747
was just to force him out.

744
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:39,707
She showed me their photos together

745
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:40,987
and chat records

746
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,467
My brother even kept

747
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,786
liking her posts

748
00:33:43,786 --> 00:33:45,027
from his secret account.

749
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,826
Can't blame her for getting obsessed.

750
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:48,907
If that's the case, your brother's

751
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,227
totally at fault here.

752
00:33:51,586 --> 00:33:52,346
Exactly.

753
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:53,747
He's unreasonable.

754
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:56,546
He won't even break up properly.

755
00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:57,386
Let me tell you.

756
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:59,187
The scariest thing in dating
is a breakup

757
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:00,267
with no explanation.

758
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:01,866
A vanished person

759
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:04,346
doesn't just ruin your relationship.

760
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,707
He crushes your faith in love

761
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:07,786
and your self-confidence.

762
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:09,427
You'll doubt

763
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:11,066
if you do anything wrong

764
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:12,987
and fail anything,

765
00:34:13,347 --> 00:34:14,787
or you are

766
00:34:14,827 --> 00:34:15,987
too ugly or fat

767
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:18,546
to get a proper goodbye?

768
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:22,987
Just rambling.

769
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,387
Actually,

770
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:27,947
even clean breakups

771
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,586
may still hurt.

772
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:32,427
You'll get hurt

773
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,507
if he leaves too ruthlessly.

774
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,827
Get hurt if he moves on too fast.

775
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:39,947
If he finds someone new quickly,

776
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,507
you hurt more. Being hurt
is unavoidable.

777
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:47,987
Teachers graded us back in school.

778
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:49,427
Later,

779
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:51,987
as interns, mentors graded us.

780
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:53,947
If we become lawyers in the future,

781
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:55,947
clients become our graders.

782
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:57,347
Love has no grades,

783
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:58,787
no standard answer,

784
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,027
and no standards.

785
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:01,787
We've memorized endless laws,

786
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:02,787
but show me one

787
00:35:03,507 --> 00:35:04,467
that dictates

788
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:06,507
exactly when

789
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,787
the right words

790
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,586
or the perfect action exist?

791
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,226
Impossible.

792
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,907
Statutes only show risks

793
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,467
we might encounter.

794
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:20,666
I'll bet with you.

795
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,507
Look at our firm's partners,

796
00:35:22,507 --> 00:35:23,507
every one of them,

797
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:24,787
with mid-levels included.

798
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:27,546
They may have been artistic when young,

799
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,106
but asking them to pursue a love

800
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:30,746
without counting the cost now

801
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,106
is nearly impossible.

802
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:35,186
As long as we work hard enough,

803
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,307
even Earth could wander.

804
00:35:36,307 --> 00:35:37,947
The Trisolarans were even defeated.

805
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:40,787
But the professional instinct
engraved in their bones

806
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:41,827
is undefeatable.

807
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:42,787
Miss Yan, look at you.

808
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,507
How many male lawyers broke your hearts

809
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:48,106
to make you become this bitter?

810
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:50,626
You're teasing me?

811
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,507
How about you and Ren Jiatong?

812
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:55,546
Not great.

813
00:35:57,347 --> 00:35:59,746
Flirting all day at the firm.

814
00:35:59,787 --> 00:36:01,226
Guo Xiaoyu might not notice,

815
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:03,266
but I see everything clearly!

816
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:04,706
You think you're smart.

817
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,226
I guess Holmes is a also a bad guy,

818
00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:09,066
moving on to a new girlfriend so fast.

819
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:11,266
Suit yourself then.

820
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:20,027
(Ren Jiatong, what are you
so afraid of?)

821
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:22,907
What can't you face?

822
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:24,106
Why are you so afraid

823
00:38:24,787 --> 00:38:26,706
to admit your own feelings?

824
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:27,467
(You act cold.)

825
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:28,907
(Right now, you're being cowardly.)

826
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,066
You're afraid of getting hurt.

827
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:32,546
So you refuse to love.

828
00:38:33,387 --> 00:38:35,266
You're afraid of carrying
others' expectations.

829
00:38:35,307 --> 00:38:35,907
so you just

830
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:37,907
never open your heart to anyone.

831
00:38:40,746 --> 00:38:42,146
(Let's get things straight now.)

832
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,432
(No more trouble later.)

833
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:45,266
It's fine.

834
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:46,907
What do you mean?

835
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,467
Did I make you feel troubled?

836
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,712
(Body warmer)

837
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:13,864
(Body warmer, brown sugar)

838
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,001
(Body warmer and brown sugar
on the table. Note first hotpot date.)

839
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:17,832
(You may need it recently.)

840
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,027
Post it if you want.

841
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:36,947
Be proactive when pursuing a girl.

842
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:40,467
Are you lecturing me now?

843
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:47,706
What if right now,

844
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,546
that lawyer you set to "only he can see"

845
00:39:51,947 --> 00:39:53,146
came back

846
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:55,546
and chased you hard, would you

847
00:39:55,987 --> 00:39:56,626
say yes?

848
00:39:58,706 --> 00:40:00,347
How crazy would I have

849
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:02,467
to be chased by a male lawyer?

850
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:05,106
What do you mean?

851
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:06,907
Also,

852
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:11,146
he won't make any moves.

853
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,546
For a lawyer,

854
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,146
disclaimers are everything.

855
00:40:16,387 --> 00:40:17,907
He has safety boundary

856
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,307
and future plan.

857
00:40:20,987 --> 00:40:22,586
A senior told me

858
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,507
if you date with a lawyer,

859
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:26,507
you must be in his plan.

860
00:40:27,066 --> 00:40:28,186
Then you'll be in his heart.

861
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:31,867
I was once in his heart,

862
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:34,467
but his plan

863
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:36,186
doesn't include me.

864
00:40:39,387 --> 00:40:40,146
Don't comfort me.

865
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:43,347
It is enough to realize
I'm in his heart.

866
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:45,467
He liked me once.

867
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:47,746
I genuinely felt it.

868
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:49,307
No misunderstanding

869
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:50,907
or illusion.

870
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:54,186
He's too scared to move forward.

871
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:57,266
And I know exactly why.

872
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:02,226
To you.

873
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:04,907
You're a hero.

874
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:06,266
Don't toast to me.

875
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:09,307
To Jun An Law Firm,
and the Talent Hunt Program.

876
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:13,546
To forever rational and clear-headed

877
00:41:14,186 --> 00:41:14,947
lawyers.

878
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,266
I won't toast for last one. You drink.

879
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:47,266
What's going on with you two?

880
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:49,427
My brother's romantic mess.

881
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:50,666
I may not handle it,

882
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:51,907
so I asked Jiang Chen for help.

883
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:54,507
Who knew she'd betray my trust
and keep a trick

884
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:55,307
up her sleeve.

885
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:56,347
I shouldn't help her.

886
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,307
Make her delete it

887
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,626
while the reposts are low!

888
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:01,146
She literally posted

889
00:42:01,507 --> 00:42:03,626
Xingke's second princess
got someone to threaten her.

890
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:06,106
This'll blow up into another scandal!

891
00:42:07,586 --> 00:42:08,586
Playing this trick

892
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,186
means talking won't work.

893
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,266
She forces my brother to show up.

894
00:42:12,387 --> 00:42:13,387
I can't let him show up.

895
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:14,186
Pointless.

896
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:14,867
Where is he?

897
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:16,626
Overseas.

898
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:18,507
Haven't reached him these days.

899
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:20,027
But my family said

900
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:21,146
he's returning soon.

901
00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:22,827
You'd better hurry!

902
00:42:22,827 --> 00:42:24,027
Or the mess with Jiang Chen...

903
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:26,467
You two will

904
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:28,106
definitely get spun

905
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:29,546
into eight hundred gossip versions.

906
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:30,867
Stop thinking.

907
00:42:31,307 --> 00:42:32,467
We were misunderstood.

908
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:42,027
Everyone, meeting in the room
in ten minutes.

909
00:42:42,746 --> 00:42:43,146
Mr. Zhou,

910
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:45,066
Guo Xiaoyu and I compiled a report

911
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:46,626
about the tennis bag in footage.

912
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:48,226
We found issues and emailed you.

913
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,507
Okay, I'll review it.

914
00:43:15,368 --> 00:43:19,578
(A lawyer's mindset: Disclaimers
Answer: It's self-protection.)

915
00:43:19,578 --> 00:43:24,318
(Especially in practice, lawyers should
keep evidence when giving legal advice.)

916
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,880
(Standardize communication and define
boundaries to avoid legal risks.)
