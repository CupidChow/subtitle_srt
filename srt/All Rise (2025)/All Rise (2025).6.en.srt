27
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,768
(Guo Xiaoyu 3,
Jiang Chen 2, Ren Jiatong 1)

28
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:58,184
Come in.

29
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:00,712
Mr. Song.

30
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:04,618
Sorry to disturb you.

31
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,538
I'm here to plead for Ren Jiatong.

32
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,577
I know she was wrong
to submit the report late.

33
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:12,978
But I've seen how hard she works.

34
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:14,858
She can sacrifice everything

35
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:15,698
for work.

36
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:17,737
So I believe

37
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,897
there must be some mistake.

38
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:22,017
I hope we can follow

39
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:24,107
the principle of valuing talents

40
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:25,337
and not eliminate her.

41
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:27,418
Rules are rules.

42
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:28,818
I understand.

43
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:30,337
In the previous round,

44
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:31,617
I earned myself

45
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:32,737
an extra chance.

46
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:34,098
Now I want to give it

47
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:35,218
to Ren Jiatong.

48
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:36,978
I hope you and Ms. Bai

49
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,258
will review her report.

50
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:44,577
May I ask

51
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,818
why you're pleading for Ren Jiatong?

52
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:49,258
She's your biggest competitor.

53
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,258
If she leaves,

54
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:53,138
you should be celebrating.

55
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:57,378
Yet you're rushing to defend her.

56
00:02:58,098 --> 00:02:58,777
Does this mean

57
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,017
our offer from the program

58
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:03,098
isn't that appealing to you?

59
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,258
I do want it.

60
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:06,337
I want it very much.

61
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:07,897
And I'm confident

62
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:09,218
I'll win eventually.

63
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,057
Ren Jiatong might lose to me

64
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,418
in one of the upcoming rounds

65
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:14,538
and leave.

66
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:17,337
But the reason I'm pleading for her

67
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:18,858
is that through this program,

68
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:20,297
I've met many good competitors.

69
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:22,698
Ren Jiatong is one of them.

70
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:24,057
While I want to win,

71
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,858
I want to defeat her fair and square

72
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,777
in a competition.

73
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:31,577
Moreover, I think Jun An

74
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:33,577
values nurturing young talents

75
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,698
with time and effort.

76
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:38,538
It shouldn't dismiss someone
for one mistake.

77
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:41,978
I've reviewed it.

78
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,378
Your argument

79
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:46,497
was quite persuasive.

80
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:48,337
What you said

81
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,858
will be considered.

82
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:52,138
Thank you.

83
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:01,938
What's wrong?

84
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:05,017
What happened?

85
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,098
I just saw you

86
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,138
chasing Ren Jiatong
to Mr. Song's office.

87
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,698
Are you repeating
Mr. Song and Ms. Bai's...?

88
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:13,457
Of course not.

89
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:14,017
Mistake?

90
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:15,418
You shut up.

91
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:16,458
You're cooking up stories.

92
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:18,497
What's that look?

93
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:19,297
Let me tell you,

94
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,297
there's no my type at our law firm.

95
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:23,858
No ideal type for you?

96
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,937
Right. The only one close to my type

97
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:27,338
might be Guo Xiaoyu.

98
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:27,898
Guo Xiaoyu?

99
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,697
Wait. No, she's close,

100
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:30,418
just acceptable.

101
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:31,697
But she already has a boyfriend.

102
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:33,098
I mean

103
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,497
there's absolutely nothing
between me and Ren Jiatong.

104
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:38,458
Explain this.

105
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:40,898
What do you mean by "acceptable"?

106
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:49,658
Wait, I didn't mean...

107
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,257
It's out!

108
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:21,458
Finally released.

127
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,809
Your report has sparked

128
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:53,850
controversy among mentors.

129
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:55,689
In terms of content quality,

130
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,410
you and Wang Lu
are tied for first place.

131
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,552
But due to late submission,
you receive no points.

132
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,489
Currently, Huang Yue, and Guo Xiaoyu,

133
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,169
and you are tied for last place.

134
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,970

one of the three

136
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,609

137
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,570

have differing opinions.

138
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,249
You performed well
in the portrait rights case.

139
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,850
Huang Yue secured
two lawyer pool assignments.

140
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,689
Ren Jiatong's report
was exceptionally good.

141

After lengthy discussions

142
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,010
this afternoon,

143
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,570
the mentors decided

144
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,010
to give you three an oral exam
tomorrow morning.

145
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:36,530
Hi, Mom.

146
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,129
Jiatong.

147
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,450
How's work been lately?

148
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,330
Mom, about the surgery fee,

149
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:45,609
I transferred you 30,000,

150
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,570
but they only received half.

151
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,010
Where's the rest?

152
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:55,330
I was just temporarily short on cash.

153
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,249
So I kept...

154
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,090
What's wrong?

155
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:00,369
They harassed you again?

156
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,129
They're total bloodsuckers!

157
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,090
Mom!

158
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,570
Who's the real bloodsucker?

159
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,289
I took online loans to get that money.

160
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,090
You spent it without even telling me?

161
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,530
Don't blame me.

162
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,530
You should

163
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,369
blame your dad.

164
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,650
What about him?

165
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,609
Don't bring him up.

166
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:20,689
What about him?

167
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,609
The lawyers

168
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:23,289
they hired pressed your dad to death,

169
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,689
so I became like this.

170
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,090
I can't even spend my own money.

171
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:29,570
Your dad's pride destroyed him!

172
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,889
Dad bears responsibility too.

173
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,090
You can't just blame the lawyers.

174
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,249
Their lawyers pressured him

175
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:37,930
to death.

176
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:39,690
If I had any choice,

177
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,170
I'd never let you be a lawyer!

178
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,129
All my life,

179
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,330
I've hated lawyers!

180
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,450
Ren Jiatong, relax.

181
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,970
Today's assessment topic

182
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,889
is whether Ms. Tan
should take the endorsement

183
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:14,889
from a legal viewpoint.

184
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,889
If you're ready,

185
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,690
we'll start.

186
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,009
I'm ready.

187
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,009
Good. Present your analysis.

188
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:25,489
I agree

189
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:27,050
that these gummy products

190
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,450
have no quality issues

191
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,009
and meet all manufacturing

192
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:32,409
qualification requirements.

193
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:33,609
But your report states

194
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:34,850
that we shouldn't recommend

195
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,690
the Q Candy series endorsement.

196
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:37,210
Why?

197
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,009
Q Candy series targets children,

198
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,170
and their ads claim

199
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,050
the products can

200
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,369
enhance children's memory.

201
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,649
However, I believe

202
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:49,170
there are two legal risks.

203
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,489
First, the Advertising Law stipulates

204
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:52,810
that endorsers can only

205
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,889
promote products
they've personally used.

206
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,009
Ms. Tan is single

207
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,050
with no children,

208
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,330
making it impossible

209
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,369
to genuinely test
the claimed memory benefits.

210
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,210
This risks regulatory violation

211
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,050
under the Advertising Law.

212
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,690
Second, this product

213
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,769
may break health supplement regulations.

214
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,369
The Advertising Law

215
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,009
prohibits health supplements

216
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,690
from using celebrity endorsements.

217
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,690
If it's not a health supplement,

218
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:22,930
isn't that fine?

219
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,330
Correct.

220
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,889
The Q Candy series
isn't classified as such.

221
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:28,330
I verified the information

222
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,609
on the website of State Administration

223
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,609
for Market Regulation.

224
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,129
But the core issue is,

225
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:36,009
the memory improvement function
it claims

226
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,609
falls under the health functions
for dietary supplements.

227
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,210
This product isn't classified
as a dietary supplement

228
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,970
yet it's illegally
claiming health benefits.

229
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:45,810
This makes it highly likely

230
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,330
to be deemed as false advertising.

231
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:49,210
If it's ruled as false advertising,

232
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,170
then Ms. Tan, as the endorser,

233
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,290
would face
severe administrative penalties.

234
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,769
The previous lawyer handling this case

235
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,290
identified this critical flaw

236
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,729
and promptly informed the client
of the legal risks.

237
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,729
The client was very satisfied
with the outcome.

238
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,210
Thank you.

239
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,249
Let me check.

240
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,048
Go ahead.

241
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,009
Did I say something wrong?

242
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,570
You may leave.

243
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:50,504
How did it go?

244
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,649
What did they say?

245
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,769
They just asked me to leave.

246
00:11:58,889 --> 00:11:59,649
I'll wait for news.

247
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:17,409
Guo Xiaoyu.

248
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,409
I didn't mean to ignore you last night.

249
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,330
I just didn't know what to say.

250
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:25,450
I understand.

251
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,810
I'm not blaming you.

252
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,290
I'm not as capable as the rest of you.

253
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:32,850
Don't worry.

254
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:34,649
Even if I leave,

255
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,450
I won't give up on becoming a lawyer.

256
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,050
You might not leave.

257
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,450
Ms. Bai didn't seem pleased

258
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,210
with my performance just now.

259
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,769
Wang Lu, come in for a moment.

260
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,528
Have a seat.

261
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:35,336
Wang Lu.

262
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,369
I called you in

263
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:38,930
for your due diligence report.

264
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,690
We have questions for you.

265
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:46,489
Are you familiar

266
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,529
with the SAMR'S website?

267
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,249
Ren Jiatong said
that she got information

268
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:55,609
through this website

269
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,416
to verify that the Q Candy series

270
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,016
lacks dietary supplement certification.

271
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:00,489
Your report also mentions

272
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:01,704
the same conclusion.

273
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,090
But the website you cited

274
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,529
belongs to
the Food and Drug Administration.

275
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,249
If I'm not mistaken,

276
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,970
after the SAMR was established,

277
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,649
the FDA was dissolved.

278
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:17,448
All data migrated
to the current SAMR website.

279
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:20,249
Any explanations?

280
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,690
I...

281
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,330
Had you actually visited the website

282
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,249
while preparing this report,

283
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:31,970
you would have noticed

284
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:34,889
the webpage is no longer functional.

285
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,009
Now, what's your explanation for this?

286
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,744
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:59,528
The website reference

288
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,330
wasn't my original research.

289
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:04,290
This conclusion

290
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,210
was adapted

291
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,210
from previous case from the lead lawyer.

292
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,529
Unaware of
the administrative reorganization,

293
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:12,889
I just copied the old reference.

294
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:15,330
So you're admitting

295
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,729
you had prior access to this case?

296
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,729
When I just joined Jun An,

297
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,529
the firm organized training sessions
for junior lawyers

298
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,570
and interns.

299
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,009
The lead lawyer on this case

300
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:30,290
conducted our training.

301
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,170
He shared this case with us

302
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:33,729
and I memorized it.

303
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,769
When given this assessment task,

304
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,529
I immediately recognized the approach.

305
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,649
Yet you failed
to disclose this advantage.

306
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:47,529
I desired to win.

307
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,450
Your failing

308
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,609
lies in plagiarizing another's work

309
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:53,170
without proper attribution.

310
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,690
Prior exposure by sheer coincidence

311
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,050
wouldn't be an issue.

312
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,009
You can use it

313
00:15:59,009 --> 00:15:59,690
to do better.

314
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:04,456
But you crossed the lines.

315
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,784
Your desire to win is admirable.

316
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,489
But as legal professionals,

317
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,970
we uphold justice

318
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,970
and respect established rules

319
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:14,889
through actions, not just words.

320
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,649
So, Wang Lu,

321
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,529
your scores are invalid.

322
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:31,944
Mr. Zhuang.

323
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,850
If I get eliminated
from the Talent Hunt Program,

324
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,090
can I revert to being a regular intern

325
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,249
and continue my internship
with my original team?

326
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,330
Wang Lu.

327
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:52,005
I explained your situation

328
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,330
to your mentor lawyer.

329
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,009
He sent me a message.

330
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,050
Let me read it here.

331
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:02,609
Mr. Zhuang.

332
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:06,010
During Wang Lu's internship,

333
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,010
he consistently did well.

334
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,050
All senior lawyers who worked with him

335
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,449
have praised him.

336
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,209
In this program assessment,

337
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,290
Wang Lu's actions were indeed improper.

338
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,649
But I believe

339
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,929
there's a fundamental difference
from outright cheating.

340
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,609
Mr. Zhuang, please don't think
I'm showing favoritism.

341
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:29,609
As seasoned lawyers, we all understand

342
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,090
that learning
from senior colleagues' experience

343
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,649
is inherent to our profession.

344
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,730
It's how generations of newcomers

345
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,290
strive to improve.

346
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,050
While we can't deny

347
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,609
that Wang Lu's concealment this time

348
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:44,290
compromised the assessment's fairness,

349
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,129
Jun An is a firm

350
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,730
that invests in young talent

351
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,730
and nurtures growth.

352
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,810
We don't completely dismiss someone

353
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:53,330
for a single mistake.

354
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,649
Therefore, I boldly request

355
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:59,889
that if Wang Lu gets eliminated
from the Talent Hunt Program,

356
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,609
Jun An could give him another chance.

357
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:03,490
Let him know

358
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,530
Jun An won't give up on him.

359
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,169
Our team members

360
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,689
still welcome his return.

361
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,010
Thank you all
for your tolerance and guidance.

362
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,409
However, I've always been someone

363
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,889
who pursued personal excellence

364
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:38,770
without regard for others.

365
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,850
Today, Jun An taught me a lesson.

366
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:44,129
I'll remember forever.

367
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,290
I will

368
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,969
take responsibility for my mistake.

369
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,400
I've decided to leave.

370
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,928
Regarding the three of you
staying or leaving,

371
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:35,770
after the discussions,

372
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,575
Mr. Zhuang has decided all three of you

373
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,090
go into the next round.

374
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,850
The one eliminated

375
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:49,320
is Wang Lu.

376
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,290
Wang Lu?

377
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:54,889
What happened?

378
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,250
He had heard of this case

379
00:19:57,449 --> 00:19:58,969
before the competition began.

380
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,649
Since he failed to report it,

381
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,090
his competition results are voided.

382
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,530
His scores are invalidated
and he's leaving?

383
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,810
Your round isn't over yet.

384
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,344
There's grouping.

385
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,129
Mr. Zhou, how will grouping work?

386
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:22,090
Another assessment?

387
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:23,050
No assessments.

388
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,969
It's like choosing graduate advisors,

389
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,010
mutual selection.

390
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,250
Thanks.

391
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:30,369
Remember
to fill out the preference form.

392
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,530
Results will be emailed Sunday night.

393
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:36,209
Mutual selection?
What if Mr. Song doesn't choose me?

394
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:38,649
You already know whom you choose?

395
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:41,449
Mr. Zhou,

396
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,969
are there any restrictions?

397
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,850
No formal restrictions.

398
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:48,490
Ms. Tian, come.

399
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,250
Let me introduce her.

400
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:52,730
This is

401
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,730
a fourth-year lawyer Tian Min.

402
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,912
From Ms. Bai's team.

403
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,544
- Hello, Ms. Tian.
- Hello, Ms. Tian.

404
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:58,449
- Hello, Ms. Tian.
- Hello, Ms. Tian.

405
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,090
Hello, guys.

406
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:01,810
Regarding the restrictions,

407
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,889
there aren't any.

408
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,090
But the unspoken limit would be

409
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,369
that Ms. Bai's team

410
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,090
has very few intern spots annually.

411
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,090
It's not officially stated,

412
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,090
but they accept
only one new member per year.

413
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,850
Right, Ms. Tian?

414
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,530
In my four years at Jun An,

415
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,969
our team has taken
only one newcomer annually.

416
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:24,209
But I haven't confirmed with Ms. Bai yet

417
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:26,090
about that rule for this year.

418
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:27,850
- What about Mr. Song?
- What about Mr. Zhuang?

419
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,969
Mr. Song and Mr. Zhuang

420
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,330
have no specific rules.

421
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,969
But the principle is
quality over quantity.

422
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,449
So if you already

423
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:37,090
have a clear choice in mind,

424
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,689
you should showcase yourselves
around them.

425
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:40,570
Trust me.

426
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,730
Got it. Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

427
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:48,090
Let's go.

428
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,129
Bye-bye, Mr. Zhou.

429
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,010
Wang Lu.

430
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,880
Want to grab lunch together?

431
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,449
At the restaurant downstairs.

432
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:10,129
Yeah, great food.

433
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:12,850
You guys go ahead.

434
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:13,969
I'll go later.

435
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,689
Are you coming back up afterward?

436
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:21,050
Probably not.

437
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:28,330
How about we go down first

438
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,288
and save you a seat?

439
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,504
We'll order your favorites.

440
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,816
Come down quickly.

441
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:34,728
Okay.

442
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,609
Alright, let's head out.

443
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:39,409
Come on.

444
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:40,680
Come on.

445
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:41,928
Let's go.

446
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,688
Go.

447
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:52,552
Come down soon.

448
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,416
See you later.

449
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,810
Wang Lu is actually leaving?

450
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,609
This feels awful.

451
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:17,889
Look at the bright side.

452
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:19,730
Every competition
has winners and losers.

453
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,889
If he didn't leave,

454
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:22,730
you'd be the one leaving.

455
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,689
Focus on

456
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:27,810
how to choose your mentor

457
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,889
who can help you stay.

458
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:30,770
I'll choose Mr. Song.

459
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:31,944
What about you?

460
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:34,530
I'm set on Mr. Zhuang.

461
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:36,010
Don't compete with me.

462
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,290
I'm still undecided.

463
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,530
But I won't pick Ms. Bai for sure.

464
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,250
I'm afraid of her.

465
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,649
Fei, what about you?

466
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,850
Me?

467
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:49,730
It doesn't matter who I choose.

468
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:53,810
- What about you?
- Ms. Bai.

469
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,770
I've never done
any dispute resolution case.

470
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,449
Want to try it.

471
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,304
Are you crazy?

472
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:01,288
All your non-litigation experience

473
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:02,792
from the US firm counts for nothing?

474
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:03,609
Switching fields?

475
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,290
The fun is in trying new things.

476
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,169
I wouldn't even dare think like that.

477
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,664
Choosing to be a lawyer
over a civil servant

478
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:12,290
is my biggest rebellion ever.

479
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,889
My whole family,

480
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:15,490
especially my parents, are furious.

481
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,192
Only my sister supports me.

482
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,920
I can't lose. I must play safe.

483
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:21,352
Jiang Chen, you're picking Ms. Bai?

484
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,592
You'll be competing with Jiatong then.

485
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:27,720
I might not choose Ms. Bai.

486
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,560
Well...

487
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,960
Just don't pick Mr. Zhuang either.

488
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,889
Seems I'm the only true fan here.

489
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:39,016
Never changed my choice.

490
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,488
If Mr. Song doesn't pick me,

491
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:41,800
that's his loss.

492
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,304
What took Wang Lu so long?

493
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,570
We need to order food.

494
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:50,770
I'll text him.

495
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:53,736
Check the group chat.

496
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:54,889
He says he left already.

497
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,050
He left the group.

498
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,864
(Wang Lu)

499
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,250
You were so active to work with Ms. Bai.

500
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:38,050
Why not choose her now?

501
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:39,409
It's not like you at all.

502
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,490
Are you scared of competing with me?

503
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,409
Didn't Mr. Zhou say
Ms. Bai only takes one mentee per year?

504
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,050
If I choose her,

505
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,570
you might have no chance at all.

506
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,969
Think about it.

507
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,850
I might be letting you win.

508
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,672
(Bai Xiao)

509
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:25,768
Actually, I came to tell you

510
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:27,016
that you're really pretty.

511
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:32,727
(Song Yifan)

512
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,810
(Mr. Zhou, I'm free right now.)

513
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,689
(Need any help with your work?)

514
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,050
(Not much work.)

515
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,096
(Thanks.)

516
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,330
So busy today I didn't even drink water.

517
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,889
The weather is so dry.

518
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:27,129
My lips are chapped.

519
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,770
Need any help?

520
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:29,730
I'm super free today.

521
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,570
I have nothing to do.

522
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,209
I'm fine. I'm busy
working on the law article.

523
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,250
Almost done.

524
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:35,490
Law article?

525
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:37,969
When did you get involved
with law promotion?

526
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:40,889
Didn't you know?

527
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,129
Mr. Zhou said their team is overloaded.

528
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,169
But we need daily updates
for law articles.

529
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,969
So we all need to write an article.

530
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,224
I got scheduled first.

531
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:51,050
All of us?

532
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:55,112
I'm off.

533
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:05,576
Here.

534
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,290
Jacqueline du Pre.

535
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,649
I like it.

536
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,369
During my business trip,

537
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,290
I bought it.

538
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,209
Elgar's Cello Concerto in E Minor.

539
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,090
You're still not tired
of listening to this?

540
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,689
Thanks. If new figures

541
00:29:23,689 --> 00:29:25,050
from The Outcast series came out,

542
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,056
I'll buy them for you.

543
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:28,530
It's my only hobby.

544
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,929
The whole firm knows it.

545
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:32,330
Guo Xiaoyu came

546
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,169
to me for team assignments,

547
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:36,770
but ended up talking about The Outcast
for half an hour.

548
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:40,969
Guo Xiaoyu?

549
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:43,530
I think this girl matches your style.

550
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:46,850
Just say directly if you're mocking me.

551
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:48,090
I won't mind.

552
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:52,010
Those kids are good.

553
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,129
Who do you want to pick?

554
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:00,969
Ren Jiatong?

555
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,169
By the way,
during the last elimination round,

556
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:08,409
weren't you originally
supporting Guo Xiaoyu?

557
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:10,409
Why did you change your vote to approve

558
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,290
giving Ren Jiatong another chance?

559
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:14,929
I think she

560
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:16,889
reminds me of your younger self.

561
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,850
That's why I wanted
to give her another chance.

562
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,889
This is pure retaliation.

563
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,649
You just want to say
I'm as stubborn as her.

564
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:26,169
Are you not stubborn?

565
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,570
We've rescheduled dinner
a hundred times.

566
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:30,169
Finally, it happened.

567
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:31,592
Yet it's a working lunch.

568
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,129
Right next to the law firm.

569
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,290
Who else could be this stubborn?

570
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,609
Let me ask you.

571
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,369
You still read comics at your age?

572
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:41,050
Even my daughter reads comics now.

573
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:42,369
You and I

574
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:43,490
have a generation gap.

575
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,169
We're different.

576
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:44,810
Alright.

577
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,810
You win the argument.

578
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:46,730
Let's eat.

579
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:56,090
I think Ren Jiatong is good.

580
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,090
If you don't want her, I'll pick her.

581
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,050
She's indeed good.

582
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:04,010
But that boy is good too.

583
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,290
I need to think.

584
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:08,904
Drink.

585
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,208
You're really not choosing Ms. Bai?

586
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,169
Actually, I admire Ms. Bai,

587
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,010
but she doesn't seem to like me.

588
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:27,272
Yesterday, my submission was late.

589
00:31:27,272 --> 00:31:28,360
When I went to explain,

590
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:30,449
she lectured me sternly

591
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:31,570
and didn't help.

592
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:33,512
During the medical dispute case,

593
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:34,728
I contributed significantly

594
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,008
but she didn't seem to remember.

595
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,056
Probably, she just doesn't like me.

596
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:40,808
Ms. Bai...

597
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,290
In the end, Wang Lu messed up,

598
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,609
and Mr. Song counted half my score,

599
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,689
barely letting me stay as last place.

600
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,730
After all this thinking,

601
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,730
choosing Mr. Song seems safer.

602
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:55,889
So, both of us will choose Mr. Song?

603
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:56,530
That seems good.

604
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:58,536
Mr. Song will take multiple people.

605
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,730
That's great!

606
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,290
We'll likely be in the same team.

607
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,129
Then I can copy your work

608
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:08,490
and cruise to the finale.

609
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,770
I might not even survive
till the finale.

610
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:12,360
Don't dream.

611
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:15,080
Why so gloomy today?

612
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,912
It's not like you.

613
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:23,050
Your law article is good.

614
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,209
Absolutely.

615
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,609
I always work on quality content.

616
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,449
Share it in your Moments

617
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,856
and add the caption,

618
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,248
masterpiece from a legal prodigy.

619
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,649
Oh please, prodigy?

620
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:38,689
I shared it too early.

621
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,689
Next time, I'll use your caption.

622
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:45,969
Let me tell you.

623
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,169
I just found out today.

624
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:50,050
Yan Fei doesn't have
to handle the social media tasks.

625
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:52,730
She learned about this today herself.

626
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:54,969
She even went to ask Mr. Zhou.

627
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:56,169
Isn't that crazy?

628
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:58,090
Isn't that obvious?

629
00:32:58,169 --> 00:32:59,730
Her family must've pulled strings.

630
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,090
You're amazing.

631
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:01,889
How did you know?

632
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,090
Grunt work like this

633
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:05,649
is always handled by newbies.

634
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:07,090
Yan Fei's family

635
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,889
would never let her do this.

636
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,649
But given Yan Fei's personality,

637
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:14,570
Zhou Nian probably
got an earful from her today.

638
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:16,850
Ren Jiatong.

639
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,850
You're a psychology genius.

640
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,010
Hey, Mom.

641
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,730
Jiatong, I saw the article
you just posted in Moments.

642
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:36,649
There's a photo of a female lawyer.

643
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:37,960
Is she from Jun An?

644
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,688
What photo? Which one?

645
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:41,928
The female lawyer.

646
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,888
Why?

647
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:44,040
Hold on.

648
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,192
(Bai Xiao)
You mean Ms. Bai?

649
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,209
I told you before.

650
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,209
The lawyer who drove your dad to death

651
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,129
is her.

652
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:58,344
(Bai Xiao)
Mom, are you sure you're not mistaken?

653
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:01,169
I reviewed the case files before.

654
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,649
The lead lawyer on my dad's case

655
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:03,649
was a male lawyer.

656
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:04,929
I'm certain.

657
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:06,689
She's the one pressing your dad.

658
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,650
Her face is not easily forgotten.

659
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,449
Excuse me.

660
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,049
Let me verify the facts.

661
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:33,448
(China Judgments)

662
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:38,344
(Qing City Intermediate People's Court,
Shandong Province)

663
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:47,368
(Lawyer: Wang Qin, Manyida Law Firm;
Lawyer: Xu Ya, Manyida Law Firm)

664
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,610
What's up?

665
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,369
Good morning.

666
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,929
I have a question to ask you.

667
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:06,489
Go ahead.

668
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:09,864
For ordinary cases,
the representing lawyers

669
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:11,489
always sign the case documents, right?

670
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,320
Are there situations
where names get omitted?

671
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:14,929
Generally not.

672
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,449
For law professionals,

673
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:17,969
attention to detail matters.

674
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:19,170
Even if some files

675
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,889
only have partial lawyer signatures,

676
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,489
the court judgment paperwork

677
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,409
will list
all legal representatives in full,

678
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,208
except under special circumstances.

679
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,584
What circumstances?

680
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:29,770
Like when someone

681
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,610
recently leaves a court
or prosecutor's office

682
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,170
and joins a law firm,

683
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:34,969
by regulation, they can't practice

684
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,489
as lawyers for two years

685
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,730
in related cases.

686
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:39,250
In such cases,

687
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,489
they will serve as consultants

688
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:41,290
in certain cases

689
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,730
without official attribution.

690
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,690
But the lawyers
who join firms after graduation

691
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,850
won't have this issue, right?

692
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,009
Probably not.

693
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,810
Thank you.

694
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,449
Oh, there's another scenario.

695
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:06,449
Yan Fei,
why are you choosing Mr. Song too?

696
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:09,770
I've always been interested

697
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,369
in mergers and acquisitions.

698
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,650
Plus, Mr. Song is charming

699
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,152
and has the most stylish office.

700
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:15,880
Then I'm doomed.

701
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,409
You, Ren Jiatong, and I

702
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,040
all picked Mr. Song.

703
00:36:20,232 --> 00:36:22,344
If he only selects two people,

704
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,264
I'll definitely be the one cut.

705
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,009
Do you remember what they said

706
00:36:27,009 --> 00:36:28,089
when we just came?

707
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:28,889
Ms. Bai and Mr. Song

708
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,290
joined Jun An

709
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,880
right after graduation?

710
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:33,128
Yeah.

711
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:37,032
Mr. Song said that as Jun An's babies,
they came through on-campus recruitment.

712
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:37,929
Besides,

713
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,489
they were known

714
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,569
as the best partners.

715
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:47,560
Fei.

716
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:50,216
(Xiaojie)
Think twice.

717
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:53,089
What? Don't want to be in my group?

718
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,610
Who should I pick then?

719
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:05,928
Hello.

720
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:07,880
Jiatong, I passed.

721
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:09,969
What you wrote for me is great.

722
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:10,730
You're the best.

723
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:12,170
Glad it worked.

724
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:14,952
If there's nothing else,

725
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:15,850
I'll hang up.

726
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,770
Jiatong, don't hang up.
I have something else to say.

727
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,130
It's about the money
for my dad's surgery.

728
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:22,409
I'm still short on cash.

729
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,730
Give me more time.

730
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,810
I'll find a way.

731
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,409
Okay, take your time.

732
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,650
By the way,
there's something I want to ask you.

733
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:32,968
Go ahead.

734
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,369
Back then, the project client

735
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:36,850
hired a lawyer for you.

736
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:37,929
It was a man, right?

737
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,130
Yes. He kept visiting us
at the hospital frequently.

738
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,290
A man, not very tall.

739
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,049
His surname is Wang.

740
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:46,250
But at that time,

741
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,529
a woman also came often.

742
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:50,969
Actually, when I went
to see you last time,

743
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:51,610
I saw her there.

744
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,569
You saw her?

745
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,850
When?

746
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,944
When I asked you to help with paperwork.

747
00:37:55,944 --> 00:37:56,854
In your firm's lobby.

748
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,360
Wait a second.

749
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:09,192
(Bai Xiao)

750
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:11,048
(Xiaojie)

751
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,049
Check the photo I sent you.

752
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:13,730
Is that her?

753
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,610
Yes, that's her.

754
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:44,034
(Bai Xiao)

755
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:50,280
(Lawyer: Shi Zhiming,
Manyida Law Firm, Beijing)

756
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,642
(Lawyer: Bai Xiao,
Manyida Law Firm, Beijing)

757
00:38:59,089 --> 00:38:59,944
Ren Jiatong.

758
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,480
Are you okay?

759
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:04,089
I'm fine.

760
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,969
It's my turn to write an article.

761
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:11,369
Just stuck on ideas.

762
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,650
There's another answer

763
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,810
to the question you asked me.

764
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:17,352
The lawyer might change a job
and couldn't take the case,

765
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:19,330
so the lawyer has to
assign a new lawyer.

766
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,529
All previous work is done
by this lawyer,

767
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:22,290
but then,

768
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,610
another lawyer's name is used.

769
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,369
This situation is rare but possible.

770
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,464
Mr. Zhou, I'm going
to get water. Thanks.

771
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,584
Guo Xiaoyu told me you chose Mr. Song.

772
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:42,728
I thought you were joking earlier.

773
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,232
I never expected you'd skip Ms. Bai.

774
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:49,608
Ren Jiatong.

775
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,632
Want some coffee?

776
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,210
If someone you deeply admire

777
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,369
once did something that hurt you badly,

778
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,969
causing you to lose everything,

779
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,016
what would you do?

780
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,216
Someone I deeply admire?

781
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,896
I might

782
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:15,752
instinctively avoid them?

783
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:17,928
I'd fear and resent them.

784
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:18,504
But...

785
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,850
if they truly made me lose everything,

786
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,112
I'd definitely take revenge.

787
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:24,680
Then what?

788
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:29,384
Actually, I'd want to ask why.

789
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:30,969
Why would they do this?

790
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,424
What reason drove them to do it?

791
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,770
I know myself.

792
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,130
I won't admire someone without reason.

793
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,330
And the person I admire

794
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,240
won't act without purpose either.

795
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,520
But what if that person
completely ignores you?

796
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,256
Or worse,

797
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:47,976
you're so insignificant
that that person doesn't notice

798
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:49,416
or care about your feelings?

799
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,529
That powerful?

800
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,049
Yes.

801
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:53,889
Then become powerful yourself.

802
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,529
Surpass them.

803
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:57,929
Become undeniable

804
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,009
so they can't ignore you.

805
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,369
What is it?

806
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,529
Come back if you're not determined.

807
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:20,552
I want to join your team.

808
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:26,850
Jiang Chen already talked to me.

809
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,250
He does have potential.

810
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,489
Ms. Bai, I know I've made mistakes.

811
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:33,810
And you don't like me.

812
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,449
But...

813
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,850
I don't like you?

814
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:37,250
Who said that?

815
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,330
I feel it.

816
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,409
As a law student,

817
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:44,850
you analyze issues
without logic or reason

818
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,009
but rely on instincts?

819
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:48,409
If you truly want into my team,

820
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,569
I suggest you

821
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,130
drop this excessive emotional approach

822
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,969
immediately.

823
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:54,690
My feelings don't matter.

824
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,489
Only your work results do.

825
00:41:56,929 --> 00:41:58,290
Seems you still haven't taken

826
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,009
my words to heart.

827
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:01,850
I only need someone
who gets things done.

828
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,529
Go ahead.

829
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,330
Why do you

830
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,489
join my team?

831
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:16,929
You're exceptional.

832
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:18,730
I aspire

833
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,770
to become as exceptional as you.

834
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:28,850
Listen.

835
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,330
You and Jiang Chen

836
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:32,369
will compete fairly.

837
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,130
I'll assign you a case study.

838
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:36,170
Materials will be emailed shortly.

839
00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:37,929
The better doer gets the spot.

840
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,432
Okay?

841
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:41,889
I'll win.

842
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,009
I just got Ms. Bai's email.

843
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:56,089
Well,

844
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,449
you are

845
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,929
playing one-on-one with me.

846
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,810
Sorry, but I have to beat you this time.

847
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,409
I need Ms. Bai to choose me.

848
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:07,752
Same here.

Are Forbidden for Health Products?)
