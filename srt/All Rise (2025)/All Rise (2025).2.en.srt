You and Ms. Bai
trained us exactly like this

when we first joined the firm.

63
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,101

73
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,420
She looks gentle

74
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,821
but packs a punch.

75
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:40,740
She argued with the legal rep

76
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,821
of a big company

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,101
and even left them a response letter.

78
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:46,700

79
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,981

122

I can text Mr. Zhou.

129
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,901
He said he's in a meeting.

130
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,060

Because I discussed

The "Courier Service Agreement"

190
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,260
(No employment relationship)
they signed isn't an employment contract.

191
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:53,461
Moreover, Li lacks

192
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,780
the necessary dependency
and subordination

193
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:58,301
required to establish
an employment relationship

194
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,181
with Skyline Logistics Company.

195
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,061
Regarding the subordination,

196
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,461
I researched previous court rulings

197
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,701
(and compiled a case research report)

198
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,181
(as an appendix)

199
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,380
(Similar case research report)
(to my legal opinion.)

200
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:11,301
(Scoring point: Collated cases)
It can support the viewpoints

201
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,101
(Supports legal arguments)
in my legal opinion.

202
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:14,780
Well done.

203
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:18,780
Given Jiang Chen's
common law background,

204
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,500
he emphasizes case law research.

205
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,581
This is highly commendable.

206
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:24,900
Because he's the only one

207
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,821
who addressed

208
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,380
this aspect.

209
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,660
Thank you.

210
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:30,140
Ren Jiatong.

211
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:31,221
Your thoughts?

212
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:33,061
While Jiang Chen's use

213
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,221
of case research and precedents

214
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:36,581
is admirable.

215
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,140
I maintain that

216
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:39,260
legal opinions must

217
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,260
provide substantive assistance

218
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,461
to our clients.

219
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:45,061
My client is courier Li.

220
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:46,020
My proposal

221
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,860
not only offers

222
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,941
detailed legal analysis

223
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:50,900
(but also outlines)

224
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,421
(Scoring point: Client guidance)
(potential litigation strategies)

225
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:55,301
(Litigation strategies)
if he is to file a lawsuit,

226
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:56,181
including

227
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,421
jurisdiction selection,
party identification,

228
00:11:58,701 --> 00:11:59,660
and enumerated

229
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,020
(Scoring point: Enumerated)
actionable claims.

230
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:03,380
(actionable claims)
I think

231
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,101
if my proposal is chosen,

232
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,380
my supervisors

233
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,780
won't need to revise my work extensively

234
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,500
and can quickly respond to clients.

235
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,181
Brilliant.

236
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,101
While others focused solely

237
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:18,020
on case analysis,

238
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:20,461
displaying a student mentality.

239
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:22,500
Ren Jiatong stood out.

240
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:24,101
Ms. Bai remarked,

241
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:26,821
"You're thinking like a working lawyer

242
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:28,461
solving real problems."

243
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:30,581
It's high praise from her.

244
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,380
I've also done
some case research last night.

245
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,341
I realized that our case

246
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,701
qualifies for evidence preservation.

247
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,341
But Mr. Zhou specified that

248
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:44,701
this opinion is client-facing,

249
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,581
and such technical details seem

250
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:48,221
quite excessive for the client.

251
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,461
Here are my additional comments

252
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:52,461
for the lead lawyer.

253
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,341
Good job.

254
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,341
You're right.

255
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,140
We don't need to present

256
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,500
these documents to the clients.

257
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:07,620
But if you had submitted

258
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,660
these documents

259
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,780
to your supervisor

260
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,461
as reference material last night,

261
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,221
then you'd have

262
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,660
taken first place.

263
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:20,341
Mr. Song,

264
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:21,981
I object to the ranking.

265
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:24,981
I've carefully reviewed

266
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,461
the other three proposals.

267
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:29,821
I have doubts about one
that scores higher than mine.

268
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,736
Yan Fei.

269
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:36,380
Any thoughts?

270
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,380
I think Guo Xiaoyu's approach

271
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,941
with the Q&A format works well.

272
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,780
She addresses clients' specific concerns

273
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,581
while maintaining clarity.

274
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,301
If I were the client,

275
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:49,301
I'd prefer that style

276
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,821
over dry legal recitations.

277
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,821
Not legal recitations.

278
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,860
I was applying legal terminology,

279
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,020
which embodies the essence of law.

280
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,461
Our expressions

281
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:00,540
shouldn't mirror those of

282
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,301
untrained laypeople, right?

283
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,101
Lord Denning once said,

284
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:06,140
"To succeed in the profession

285
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,821
of the law,

286
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:07,660
you must seek to

287
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,900
cultivate command of language."

288
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,540
The study of law

289
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,421
is the study of Forensic Linguistics.

290
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,740
I acknowledge that

291
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,341
I need to improve my legal writing,

292
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,660
but making complex concepts accessible

293
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,620
for clients

294
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,860
doesn't indicate greenness.

295
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,821
Think about those popular

296
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,020
Bar Exam prep videos.

297
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,020
Instructors gain popularity

298
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:31,981
by explaining intricate legal issues

299
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,380
with clarity

300
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,380
and humor.

301
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,341
In this case,

302
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,981
most of us chose client Mr. Li,

303
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,341
the deliveryman

304
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,701
without a legal background.

305
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,341
Guo Xiaoyu?

306
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:46,181
You make legal education videos?

307
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,461
Your channel's called

308
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:50,821
"Xiaoyu's Legal Tips".

309
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:52,981
Guo Xiaoyu.

310
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,660
That's you?

311
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:58,221
I remember your video

312
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,581
about recent graduates

313
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:01,461
signing employment contracts.

314
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,140
It was an animation.

315
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:03,981
That was fun.

316
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:05,540
Really, Mr. Song?

317
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,380
I just threw that together.

318
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:10,581
I can't believe you saw
and remembered it.

319
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,061
I remember because

320
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:13,660
you misrepresented a legal relationship.

321
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:18,900
That's all regarding the assessment.

322
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,461
I expect more dedication

323
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:22,660
in the next test.

324
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,221

326
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:29,581

327

378
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,181
But pay attention here.

379
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:34,701
Ms. Liu.

380
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,861
Any precautions for interns?

381
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,296
(Sherry)
(Ren Jiatong helped me)

382
00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:45,141
(Ren Jiatong: Thanks.)
(with documents.)

383
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:45,861
(Good job.)

384
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,181
Ren Jiatong.

385
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
You know Ms. Bai?

386
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,421
Wang Lu.

387
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,621
Aren't you a veteran here?

388
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:06,020
Ms. Bai didn't ask you?

389
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,621
Let me correct you.

390
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:08,981
It's not like that.

391
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:10,780
I didn't see it first.

392
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,300
I remember now.

393
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:13,580
Last night,

394
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,221
she sent a message in the group chat.

395
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,060
But I was so tired

396
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,340
and pretended not to notice.

397
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,421
So that was Ms. Bai.

398
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Her WeChat name is in English.
That's why.

399
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,740
Let me edit it.

400
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,421
Congrats.

401
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,100
The first to work with Ms. Bai.

402
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,400
Thank you.

403
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,661
You're truly exceptional.

404
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,060
You reminded me.

405
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:39,300
I need to adjust my jogging schedule

406
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:41,141
or I'll miss group messages.

407
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:43,901
Thanks again.

408
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,580
(Jun An's headstrong female lawyer
causes trouble at Warm Nest)

409
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,941
Law School of Jingbei University.
Jun An Law Firm.

410
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,381
Jun An Law Firm.

411
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,740
Jun An Law Firm.

412
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,224
(Found the video
from your colleague's account.)

413
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:03,621
(Had someone edit it
and spread it on Weibo.)

414
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,500
(One competitor down.)

415
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:34,120
(Ms. Xu, Xiaoxiao, Mom, Missed calls)

416
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,912
(Notifications: 56 new messages)

417
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:38,568
(Voice calls: 19 new messages)

418
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,580
Get our money back.

419
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,020
I recorded the video.

420
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,820
I posted it online and forgot about it.

421
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,141
How did the content farm notice it?

422
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,621
Nobody ever checks my account.

423
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,421
I swear I didn't see it coming.

424
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,381
You did nothing wrong
by posting the video.

425
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,461
Don't beat yourself up.

426
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,020
I never meant to harm Ren Jiatong.

427
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:17,221
Maybe Ren Jiatong sent it

428
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:19,060
to those marketing accounts herself.

429
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,820
Maybe she wants to
capitalize on it to gain fame.

430
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,260
She's not that type of person.

431
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,701
Besides, I'm the one who recorded this.

432
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,020
It's my fault.

433
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,060
Where is she?

434
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,701
She used to come so early.

435
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,060
She wouldn't quit over this, would she?

436
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,300
No way.

437
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:38,664
No way.

438
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:39,941
She came this morning.

439
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,060
Her things have been moved.

440
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,020
You even noticed that?

441
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:45,500
She's always the first in.

442
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,461
I'm the last to leave.

443
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,421
So I can tell.

444
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:00,020
Mr. Zhou.

445
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,941
Will I be eliminated
because of Warm Nest?

446
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:04,020
To be honest,

447
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,580
this is quite significant.

448
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:06,340
I've learned

449
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,461
that Warm Nest's previous legal counsel

450
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,861
was an obscure small firm.

451
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:11,540
Warm Nest has been talking with us,

452
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,941
thinking about employing us.

453
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,060
Your timing couldn't be worse.

454
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,060
I don't know the final decision,

455
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,141
but Mr. Zhuang

456
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:19,340
and the partners

457
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,020
will talk about it and decide.

458
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,221
Is there something I can do?

459
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,100
I can't just wait to be eliminated.

460
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,621
Prove your worth.

461
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,540
Excel in your current tasks.

462
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:38,340
Thank you.

463
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:56,661
Ren Jiatong.

464
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,661
I'm so sorry.

465
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,861
I-I didn't do it on purpose.

466
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,020
I film random videos for fun

467
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,300
and upload them to my account.

468
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,381
I wasn't plotting anything that night.

469
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:09,020
I just found you amazing,

470
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,740
so I filmed it and posted it.

471
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,941
Hardly anyone

472
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:13,461
ever watches my videos.

473
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:14,701
Most of my followers are

474
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,221
my classmates and friends.

475
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:18,340
The most likes I ever get
are around a few dozen.

476
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,461
I don't know

477
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:20,981
what happened this time.

478
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,820
It's fine.

479
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,181
I feel awful.

480
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,020
It's fine.

481
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,020
You didn't edit it maliciously.

482
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:32,260
You just recorded objectively, right?

483
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,141
You even used a beauty filter on me.

484
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:36,381
Can you let me through?

485
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,100
(What do I do?)

486
00:24:03,181 --> 00:24:04,661
(Huang Yue)
(I didn't know it'd blow up.)

487
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,661
(She's in trouble.)

488
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,461
(Should I tell my superior the truth?)

489
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,141
(My older guy)
(Didn't you tell me)

490
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:10,381
(to secure your position?)

491
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:11,260
(Yue.)

492
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,740
(There are ways to win.)

493
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:13,621
(Grow up.)

494
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:14,221
Everyone,

495
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,340
Mr. Song has sent

496
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,780
the requirements and materials

497
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,381
for the second task

498
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:20,260
to your emails.

499
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:21,621
Please check them.

500
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,981
Let's have a meeting

501
00:24:23,381 --> 00:24:24,621
at 10:00 AM.

502
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,221
Mr. Song will provide

503
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,300
further explanations.

504
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,300
This assessment requires

505
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,500
all of you to collaboratively translate

506
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,540
legal documents
for a cross-border M&A case.

507
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,421
Let me brief you on this.

508
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,701
Our client is a Chinese company

509
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,901
acquiring a foreign enterprise,

510
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:46,780
named Kern.

511
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:50,260
The "Kern Company"?

512
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:52,500
The promising unicorn company

513
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,260
in semiconductor design

514
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,780
with numerous patented inventions.

515
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,608
That's right.

516
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:59,260
After the acquisition,

517
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,861
Kern will integrate

518
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,421
with our client in semiconductor R&D.

519
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,300
They have

520
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,981
signed multiple agreements.

521
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,941
Recently,

522
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,020
they finalized some details
through negotiations.

523
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,340
Kern Company

524
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,141
has retained the renowned US firm

525
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:13,740
James Law Firm

526
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:14,780
to work with us.

527
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,181
They need joint legal reviews

528
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:18,740
from both perspectives.

529
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,740
Hand them out.

530
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,740
Pass them on.

531
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,621
James Law Firm

532
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:27,340
drafted the latest
supplementary agreement

533
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,100
with supporting annexes
in English based on

534
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:31,100
the negotiations.

535
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:32,780
Your task is to

536
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,661
translate these documents
and submit them

537
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,421
within 24 hours.

538
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,701
It's time-sensitive.

539
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,820
So I recommend clear task division.

540
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:41,500
There's also a memorandum

541
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,500
outlining the acquisition background

542
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,540
and newly

543
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:46,740
negotiated terms.

544
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:48,540
Feel free to contact

545
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,020
Mr. Zhou and me anytime.

546
00:25:52,981 --> 00:25:54,260
Are we clear?

547
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,621
Any questions?

548
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,820
I skimmed the materials.

549
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Looks like we must each

550
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,020
translate about 20 pages.

551
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,580
Let's divide tasks now.

552
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,540
Alright.

553
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:16,780
I suggest the top two candidates
take the lead.

554
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,861
One coordinator.

555
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,981
One proofreader.

556
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
Others split the translation work.

557
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:22,580
The proofreader

558
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,072
must work close to the deadline.

559
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,141
Of course.

560
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,181
Oh no.

561
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:29,381
I've never read English contracts.

562
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:33,221
Jiang, your English is the best.
Will you finalize the proofreading?

563
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:34,740
I'd like to do the proofreading.

564
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,461
I can proofread with Ren Jiatong.

565
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,820
Also, I noticed that

566
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,221
section one seems the toughest.

567
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,780
I can take the first part.

568
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,941
I'll team up with Jiang Chen.

569
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,020
My English is not bad.

570
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,181
Alright, let's hurry up.

571
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,981
Allow me.

572
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,861
Jiang Chen, Li Ke.
You two will handle section one.

573
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
Wang Lu, Yan Fei.

574
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,580
You two take section two.

575
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,941
Huang Yue, Guo Xiaoyu, Ren Jiatong.

576
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:02,740
The lengthy third section is yours.

577
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:04,181
Jiang Chen, you'll review

578
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,941
the translation with Ren Jiatong.

579
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:06,600
Alright.

580
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,340
Alright. Get to work.

581
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:14,780
- Conference room.
- Let me grab my laptop.

582
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,304
Alright.

583
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:37,981
Something

584
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,820
is wrong with
this supplemental agreement.

585
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,740
Check the records in your memorandum.

586
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,461
The client explicitly stated

587
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:50,181
that they're acquiring Kern Company

588
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,701
because they value Kern's

589
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:53,661
semiconductor chip invention patent.

590
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:55,181
They believe Kern

591
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:57,340
has massive growth potential.

592
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:58,820
But James Law Firm

593
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,981
included this appendix
to the supplemental agreement

594
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,820
that states

595
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,621
Kern had previously licensed this patent

596
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,421
to a third-party company,

597
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:08,141
namely Kensit Company.

598
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:11,461
And the license model is
an exclusive license.

599
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:14,540
What is an exclusive license?

600
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,300
Exclusive license

601
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,820
means exclusive authorization.

602
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:20,780
Once the patent
is granted to another party,

603
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,461
even the rights holder

604
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:23,461
loses usage rights.

605
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,661
In other words,

606
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,580
even if Kern is acquired,

607
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,941
they can't use this patent anymore.

608
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:30,181
This jeopardizes

609
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:31,941
our client's expectation

610
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,941
of substantial performance growth.

611
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,820
But this agreement comes from

612
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,020
the renowned James Law Firm.

613
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:39,181
Rushing to criticize their work

614
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:40,941
might be reckless.

615
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:43,540
Ren Jiatong,

616
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,120
maybe we should
focus on translating first.

617
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,861
That's the test.

618
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,780
If we

619
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,540
can't finish on time,

620
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,340
your review process

621
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
will be hindered.

622
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,941
Plus,

623
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:57,100
the Warm Nest case remains unresolved.

624
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,820
You can't afford mistakes this time.

625
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:32,820
What's wrong?

626
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,981
What's so funny?

627
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,701
It's nothing.

628
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:42,340
Actually,

629
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:43,540
I...

630
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,861
I kind of like you.

631
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,820
Sorry, I...

632
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,780
No.

633
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:51,560
I mean

634
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,780
I'm rooting for you.

635
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,500
Rooting for you.

636
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,181
Look at you.

637
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:57,461
So professional

638
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,701
and handsome.

639
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,020
If I were as good-looking,

640
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,340
I wouldn't be a lawyer.

641
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,981
I'd hail a cab

642
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:05,221
and charge into showbiz.

643
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,340
Do some acting.

644
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
Film dramas.

645
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:09,340
Come on.

646
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:11,540
You're good-looking too.

647
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:12,500
But

648
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,861
I think actors need more

649
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,740
than just good looks.

650
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:18,461
True.

651
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,861
Let's take a break. Grab a bite?

652
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,740
I-I have one page left.

653
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,340
Go ahead if you're hungry.

654
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,340
Alright.

655
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:31,701
I'll get you coffee.

656
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:33,224
Americano?

657
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,300
Mr. Zhou, haven't you eaten?

658
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:46,901
Nah, I worked.

659
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:47,500
Hardworking.

660
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,621
How's your team doing?

661
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,141
Jiang Chen and I are doing well.

662
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,181
We're working well with good synergy.

663
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,260
Do a good job.

664
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,540
The partners can see your performance.

665
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,540
Yeah.

666
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,621
Mr. Yang called and told me

667
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:00,621
to take care of you.

668
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,621
I told him not to worry.

669
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,020
Everyone here

670
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:04,901
is top talent.

671
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,861
Thanks, you're the best.

672
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,580
So nice.

673
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:09,780
You know...

674
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:13,621
Mr. Zhou,

675
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:16,421
since we're divided into teams,

676
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,820
the scores

677
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:20,340
will be calculated

678
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,020
by team, right?

679
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:23,461
I don't think so.

680
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,540
Based on my experience,

681
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,901
each team usually has a high scorer

682
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:28,621
and a low scorer.

683
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,981
One high scorer?

684
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,621
Yeah.

685
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,421
Let's go.

686
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:03,461
Yue.

687
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,540
What's wrong?

688
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,780
I ranked last in the previous test.

689
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,340
I'm really anxious.

690
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:14,861
I thought

691
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,020
I should follow Ren Jiatong's example

692
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,901
and find some work

693
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,340
from other lawyers.

694
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,820
I didn't know

695
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,300
it'd overlap with the translation.

696
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,780
Now I'm kind of caught

697
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:26,861
in a dilemma.

698
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,901
I can't delay either task.

699
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,941
I got zero points last round.

700
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,621
If I end up last again,

701
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,381
I can just pack up and go home.

702
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:41,901
Let me help you

703
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,300
translate a few pages.

704
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:45,861
But you have a heavy workload too.

705
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,580
It's fine.

706
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,381
I'll treat it as Legal English practice.

707
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,020
Xiaoyu.

708
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,060
Come on.

709
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,621
You're so kind.

710
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,740
Not at all.

711
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:56,981
We help each other.

712
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:26,740
I'm done with my part. Review it first.

713
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,260
Impressive.

714
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,421
How are you so fast?

715
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:31,141
Did you grow up abroad?

716
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:33,421
It happens to be one of my strengths.

717
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,661
"One of"?

718
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:36,580
Do you have any other impressive skills?

719
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,221
I haven't encountered anything

720
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:40,780
more interesting than being a lawyer.

721
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,260
So I can't answer that for now.

722
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,540
But I haven't failed anything

723
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,500
I set my mind to.

724
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:47,461
Yan Fei, you're awesome.

725
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,381
You have so much to translate?

726
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Yan Fei, your group translates so fast.

727
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,621
Is Wang Lu also done?

728
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,820
We work separately.

729
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:02,981
I'm faster.

730
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:04,340
And it's a competition.

731
00:34:14,393 --> 00:34:16,168
(Sole license)

732
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,344
(Please replace the ink cartridge)

733
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:49,781
Thanks.

734
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,100
No problem.

735
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
After what happened,

736
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,261
I studied every printer model

737
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,220
at Jun An from top to bottom.

738
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,220
You noticed too?

739
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:15,060
I've been thinking.

740
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:16,981
There are two possibilities.

741
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,020
First, the agreement

742
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:19,500
James Law Firm provided

743
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,261
is correct.

744
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,500
Our client made a wrong judgment.

745
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Maybe Kern Company

746
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,580
granted the exclusive licensing rights

747
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,660
and lost the ability

748
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,861
to use this patent.

749
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,781
Our client

750
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:30,220
believed their empty promises

751
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,341
and miscalculated
their future profitability.

752
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,060
That's one.

753
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,261
Second...

754
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,180
Second possibility.

755
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,941
In James Law Firm's agreement,

756
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:39,421
the description
of this patent's prior licensing

757
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
contains errors.

758
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:42,660
They made a mistake.

759
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,140
I have a question.

760
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,941
Didn't we divide the task?

761
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,981
I handle the first section

762
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:54,020
and you handle the third.

763
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:56,781
The term "exclusive license" appears

764
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,700
on page 15 of my part, but appears

765
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,781
on the first page of yours.

766
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:00,981
You must have

767
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,500
noticed it much earlier.

768
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,461
Why haven't you

769
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,301
mentioned it to Mr. Song or Mr. Zhou?

770
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:08,620
Do you think

771
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,700
that James Law Firm

772
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,781
with decades of roots on Wall Street

773
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,540
would make such elementary mistakes?

774
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,580
Our top priority

775
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:20,341
should be

776
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:22,060
going over their original agreement

777
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,821
right away.

778
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:25,180
If we do that now,

779
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,020
we'll never meet
the translation deadline.

780
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,461
Plus, we're responsible
for the final review.

781
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,981
We can't jeopardize everyone's work.

782
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,580
Besides, the two of us

783
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,500
can't review

784
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,220
the whole file in such a limited time.

785
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:43,020
Our primary duty

786
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,180
as lawyers isn't submitting assignments

787
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,620
but serving our clients.

788
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:48,461
We've identified an issue.

789
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,381
If we ignore it

790
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,741
and let it become

791
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,620
the dealbreaker one day,

792
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,861
it will be our mistake.

793
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,981
If the deal gets canceled,

794
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,060
all our paperwork and translations

795
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,020
become worthless.

796
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:00,500
But think about it.

797
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,421
If Jun An fails to
deliver the translation,

798
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,220
within two days,

799
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,020
the client won't even work with us.

800
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:07,060
We won't get paid a single cent.

801
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:11,220
Haven't you been

802
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,341
even slightly

803
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,020
affected by that video incident?

804
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,152
Are you playing it safe now,
afraid to lose?

805
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:21,861
Do you

806
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:23,981
naturally enjoy rubbing salt in wounds?

807
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:25,580
Is it wrong to be afraid?

808
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,261
What's going on?

809
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,220
Listen.

810
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,220
Let's get everyone

811
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,060
to vote. That's fairest.

812
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:44,901
Alright.

813
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:47,821
Everyone, look at

814
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:48,981
the highlighted section.

815
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,901
Ren Jiatong and I talked about this.

816
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,861
From our client's perspective,

817
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:54,540
this should actually be written

818
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:55,660
as "sole license".

819
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:00,100
Sole license means authorization

820
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:03,220
where, after patent licensing,

821
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:05,140
the licensor retains usage rights.

822
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:06,700
If this holds true,

823
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
our client's expectations

824
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,620
for Kern Company's future performance

825
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,500
would be secured.

826
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:12,821
Top students indeed.

827
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,580
I suggest

828
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,620
we pause our translation

829
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,700
at hand,

830
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,220
find the original documents together

831
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,620
and see whether

832
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:23,381
James Law Firm made a mistake.

833
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:26,020
How could they make mistakes?

834
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,461
That's a top-five global firm.

835
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,540
Jiang Chen.

836
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,660
I know you're a Haryald elite.

837
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,981
But are you really nitpicking

838
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:33,941
a top-tier firm?

839
00:38:34,341 --> 00:38:36,500
We're only a few hours away
from the deadline.

840
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,941
I haven't even had dinner.

841
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,861
Can we be somewhat reasonable?

842
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,500
The test is about translation.

843
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,301
Creating extra complications

844
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,261
will make us miss the deadline.

845
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,660
True.

846
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,981
This is just a speculation.

847
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,781
What if we go through the documents

848
00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:53,620
only to find that they were right?

849
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,941
We'd waste so much time

850
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,500
and fail the test together.

851
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,981
Here's what I think.

852
00:38:58,261 --> 00:38:59,381
Impressive though it is,

853
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:01,861
James Law Firm
is just another law firm,

854
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:02,821
just like Jun An.

855
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,020
They're not gods.

856
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,861
They can make mistakes too.

857
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:09,060
No more debates.

858
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,381
We're out of time.

859
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,421
Majority rules, agreed?

860
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:15,261
I vote to continue translating.

861
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,901
Be done and go to sleep.

862
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,500
I agree.

863
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,981
I agree with Jiang.

864
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,620
Let's pause for now.

865
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:35,941
Ren Jiatong.

866
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:38,180
You caused the Warm Nest commotion.

867
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:39,540
Are you dragging us

868
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,220
down with you now?

869
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,741
We're trying to be lawyers.

870
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,060
Can't we be practical?

871
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,500
Sorry.

872
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Let me ask a practical question.

873
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,020
If we need the original documents now,

874
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,580
we'd have to contact Mr. Song,

875
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:54,461
and ask him to reach out to the client,

876
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:56,580
who in turn would contact Kern.

877
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,660
Wouldn't that involve too many people?

878
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:00,941
Plus, it's so late.

879
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,140
They're probably asleep.

880
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:04,540
Isn't it inappropriate to contact

881
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,020
Mr. Song now?

882
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:07,421
Of course it is.

883
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:09,901
If we disturb him so late at night,

884
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:10,941
we'd upset him,

885
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:11,700
a senior partner.

886
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,421
What if he doesn't want us

887
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,901
in his group?

888
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,140
Then we'll suffer.

889
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,741
Let's contact Mr. Zhou instead.

890
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:22,421
He's probably asleep.

891
00:40:24,741 --> 00:40:25,381
Ren Jiatong.

892
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,821
The seniors said that

893
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:27,941
Ms. Bai returns tomorrow.

894
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,140
The partners will discuss
whether you stay.

895
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,421
Think about how to

896
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:32,461
retain your position.

897
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,781
Is this necessary?

898
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:44,660
I was against it at first too.

899
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:46,341
But a law firm

900
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:48,620
isn't a school after all.

901
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:50,301
We're not graded by scores,

902
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:51,741
but by client satisfaction.

903
00:40:52,461 --> 00:40:54,180
Is it good enough
to translate the files?

904
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,941
Seek truth not from authority,
but from facts.

905
00:40:57,781 --> 00:40:58,981
Is it hollow inspiration?

906
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,660
If I were the client,

907
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,620
I wouldn't want

908
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:06,341
my lawyer to rush through tasks,

909
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:08,580
instead of actually solving problems.

910
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,301
I have a practical solution.

911
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,381
Everyone keep translating.

912
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,821
Yan Fei, Li Ke, and Wang Lu
can review together.

913
00:41:21,421 --> 00:41:22,220
Jiang Chen and I

914
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,140
will check the agreement's annexes

915
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:25,381
to see if we can find

916
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,341
records of prior patent authorizations.

917
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:29,660
We'll have something to submit

918
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,140
and won't hold everyone back.

919
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:32,421
If there is a problem,

920
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,421
I'll explain to the mentors and request

921
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,941
that they only deduct my points.

922
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:36,941
How's that?

923
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:45,180
I have points too.

924
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,941
They can deduct points

925
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:49,020
from both of us.

926
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,741
What do you think?

927
00:42:06,248 --> 00:42:06,861
Get started.

928
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,341
I'm off.

929
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,821
Take care.

930
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,540
Bye.

931
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:46,060
I'm off.

932
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:47,741
- Bye.
- Bye.

933
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:48,741
- Bye.
- Take care.

934
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,620
Leaving?
