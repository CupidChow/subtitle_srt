Ren Jiatong: 1, Jiang Chen: 1)

27
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:01,996
Master Jiang?

28
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,076
This is my colleague.

29
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:07,175
May I?

30
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:07,856
Yes?

31
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:12,316
Mr. Jiang.

32
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:13,175
Hello.

33
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:14,395
I'm Guo Xiaoyu.

34
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:15,675
Like Jiang Chen,

35
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,435
I'm also part
of the Talent Hunt Program.

36
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:20,756
I'm a huge fan of yours.

37
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,275
I've featured you before

38
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,155
on my video channel.

39
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,636
Everyone calls you

40
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:25,640
Master Jiang.

41
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,495
- May I have your signature?
- Sure.

42
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,316
Of course.

43
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:30,375
Thank you.

44
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,036
It's Ren Jiatong's notebook, isn't it?

45
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:33,275
Your dad is a Legal God?

46
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:33,956
Tight-lipped.

47
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:38,995
He never told you people

48
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:39,835
I'm his dad?

49
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:41,215
He didn't.

50
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,675
Get that girl earlier as well.

51
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,155
I'm treating you all.

52
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:51,356
You pick the place.

53
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:52,916
Get whatever you want.

54
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:54,055
Okay.

55
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:56,275
Jiatong, come quick.

56
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,155
He wants to treat us to dinner.

57
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,715
I'll pass.

58
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:01,756
I'm tired.

59
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:03,516
Then come back to Chongqing with me.

60
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,196
My firm isn't big on rules.

61
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,236
Dating in particular.

62
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:09,595
It's very free.

63
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,756
Mr. Jiang, let's treat you.

64
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:16,995
If you don't mind,

65
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,595
we'll take you to this small restaurant.

66
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,715
It's Jiang Chen and our favorite spot.

67
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:21,435
It's downstairs.

68
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:22,655
Not at all.

69
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:24,375
Let's go.

70
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:25,655
This way.

71
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,236
Why'd you have to invite him?

72
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:36,196
All this over instant noodles?

73
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:38,476
And Xiaoyu too.

74
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:40,595
"Legal God! Master Jiang!"

75
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:41,495
Shut up.

76
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,036
Is having dinner with me this hard?

77
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:56,555
Jiatong, you're here.

78
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:57,275
(Noodles)
Ma'am.

79
00:03:58,236 --> 00:03:58,736
Here.

80
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,476
Try these tangerines first.

81
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:03,275
My folks brought them
from home, super sweet.

82
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,516
Noodles are almost ready.

83
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:05,516
Wait a second.

84
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:06,196
Thank you.

85
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:06,696
Thank you.

86
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:07,715
Let me help you.

87
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:08,675
Alright.

88
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:09,275
Sweetie.

89
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:11,555
No milk for you today.

90
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:14,275
Mr. Jiang, the puppy's named Sweetie.

91
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:15,356
We all adore him.

92
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:18,116
But,

93
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:19,355
we never dare hold him

94
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:20,996
when we're in our good clothes.

95
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:22,632
Or we'll end up covered in fur.

96
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:23,996
I remember once

97
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:26,196
I wore the coat my dad gave me,

98
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,676
a gift for my 17th birthday.

99
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:30,436
Kind of my nicest outfit.

100
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:31,636
After I held him,

101
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:33,035
I was completely furry.

102
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:35,196
I used sticky rollers on it.

103
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,076
It took me forever to clean the fur off.

104
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:38,952
Using sticky rollers for dog hair?

105
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:39,636
It's not like

106
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:41,475
something kids your age would do.

107
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:42,915
Ask Jiang Chen.

108
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,956
He knows it too.

109
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:45,756
He lived overseas.

110
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:46,715
I'm a Beijing drifter.

111
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,355
We pick up these little life hacks.

112
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:53,116
I've known so little
about my son all these years.

113
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,915
Chen's childhood dog
was also named Sweetie.

114
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:05,835
Back when we first joined Jun An,

115
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,556
everyone wore their finest clothes.

116
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,715
Then we realized that it would be

117
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:11,835
endless subway crushes,

118
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,715
burnout, and takeout.

119
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,756
Scrapes and stains
happened all the time.

120
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,956
Slowly, we stopped wearing nice clothes.

121
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,235
Ask Jiang Chen.

122
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,956
Those nice outfits you bought him?

123
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,155
He probably won't wear them.

124
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:24,235
He cherishes them.

125
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,035
Noodles are ready.

126
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:30,256
Here you go.

127
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:32,116
It's your first visit. Try our noodles.

128
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:33,355
Thank you.

129
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:34,516
Where's the owner?

130
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:36,295
Thanks.

131
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:40,676
Mr. Jiang,

132
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,436
this is where we usually eat.

133
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:44,835
We're showing you

134
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:47,355
so you won't worry
about Jiang Chen's daily life.

135
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:48,516
When we work overtime

136
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,956
or have free time, we eat here.

137
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:50,676
It's delicious.

138
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:51,275
Please try it.

139
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,715
For the restaurant you mentioned,

140
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:56,676
we'd love to experience it
with you another day.

141
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:58,835
But today, try this first.

142
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,636
Consider this our Michelin-starred meal.

143
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:10,176
Tasty.

144
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,636
Much better than that Michelin place
I mentioned.

145
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,640
Ending the lease?

146
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:19,756
You can't just end the lease.

147
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:20,516
You have no right.

148
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:22,275
Our lease extends
to the year after next.

149
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:24,395
You know I just renovated

150
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:25,835
this place.

151
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:27,436
That's against the law.

152
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:27,996
Do you know?

153
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:29,715
We own this property.

154
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,756
The final say

155
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:31,436
is ours.

156
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:32,595
You're one to talk!

157
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:33,676
Read the lease.

158
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:34,316
Let's talk.

159
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:35,155
- Be reasonable.
- Let's go over there.

160
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:35,835
Let's go there.

161
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:37,835
Right. We should...

162
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:38,636
Ridiculous.

163
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:43,196
Earlier

164
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:45,835
I saw what was in that notebook.

165
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,316
I suspect you care deeply
about Jiang Chen.

166
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:50,876
That notebook

167
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:53,116
documents every professional move
Jiang Chen made

168
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,116
since joining Jun An.

169
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,516
Why keep such records?

170
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:01,235
To be honest,

171
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:02,956
since childhood,

172
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,076
few peers could outperform me.

173
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:07,556
But Jiang Chen is one.

174
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:11,116
So during each notebook review,

175
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:11,915
I record

176
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,116
every strategic point where we compete.

177
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,235
Can I infer you showed me

178
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:18,715
that notebook on purpose?

179
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:19,855
Why?

180
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:21,956
Because I wanted you to know

181
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:24,516
Jiang Chen is exceptionally talented.

182
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,395
He'll become an outstanding lawyer.

183
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,035
How accomplished my son will become

184
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,355
is something I already foresee.

185
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,235
Does he know you're so proud of him?

186
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:38,395
Precisely because I'm proud,

187
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:40,116
I'm bringing him back to Chongqing.

188
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:42,076
If he fails to recognize that,

189
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,196
he's unfit for legal practice.

190
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:46,516
Mr. Jiang,

191
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:48,116
Jiang Chen takes after you.

192
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:48,895
Is that so?

193
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,116
Haven't you considered

194
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:57,996
he might not want to return?

195
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:01,196
Bringing him back to Chongqing

196
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:03,595
actually benefits you most.

197
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:06,395
I disagree, Mr. Jiang.

198
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:08,516
After raising such an exceptional son

199
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:10,275
with such effort,

200
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:12,235
watching him work for another firm

201
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:14,316
and potentially oppose you
in court someday

202
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:16,795
would upset anyone.

203
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:18,395
But taking Jiang Chen away

204
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:20,395
still primarily benefits you.

205
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,915
Your logic is sound.

206
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:27,035
Jiang Chen's return to Chongqing
is another matter.

207
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,715
But I'd wholeheartedly
welcome you to join our firm.

208
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:31,475
Soon, I'll open a branch in Beijing.

209
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:33,235
I'll definitely give you

210
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:34,556
an exciting offer.

211
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,235
Thank you, Uncle Jiang.

212
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:38,635
I mean, Mr. Jiang.

213
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:40,396
- You're welcome.
- I've asked.

214
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:42,916
The property management

215
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,036
handles all the storefronts.

216
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,916
The lease hasn't expired yet.

217
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:47,475
But the management wants to end it.

218
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:50,076
The original contract didn't specify,

219
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:51,156
so

220
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:52,676
the management refuses to pay

221
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:53,956
renovation fees or penalties.

222
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:55,396
Those people earlier

223
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:56,635
were likely sent by them.

224
00:08:57,475 --> 00:09:00,276
Then tell the shop owner
to get the contract

225
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:01,515
and other paperwork ready.

226
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,475
Someone must be jealous

227
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:04,916
of the noodle shop's business.

228
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:06,316
That's their motive.

229
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,115
Set up contingency plans.

230
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,835
Minimize the losses.

231
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:10,615
Understood.

232
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,635
Xiaoyu is negotiating.

233
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:17,635
Your noodles must be cold.

234
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:18,956
I'll get you a fresh bowl.

235
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,355
Have a drink with your dad first.

236
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:22,615
Thank you.

237
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:58,196
I remember

238
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:00,355
we last drank during your

239
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:01,676
college entrance exams.

240
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:02,896
Yes.

241
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:05,235
You banned me from law.

242
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:07,755
And I failed the exams

243
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:10,956
and derailed the bright future
you planned for me.

244
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:12,255
Son,

245
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:13,916
do you know

246
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:16,115
why I didn't want you
to become a lawyer?

247
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:17,615
No idea.

248
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:18,916
I'm unworthy?

249
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:19,995
Nonsense.

250
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,635
If my son isn't worthy, who is?

251
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:25,635
Why would you ever think that?

252
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:27,796
Then why?

253
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:31,176
Son,

254
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,316
the legal profession

255
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:35,396
is brutal.

256
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:36,835
Endless late nights,

257
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:38,316
constant travel

258
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:39,875
and irregular meals.

259
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,916
Even the toughest body

260
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:44,235
breaks down after two or three decades.

261
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:46,676
I saw your director, Mr. Zhuang, today.

262
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,595
His physical state
resembles mine right now.

263
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:52,076
And he bears tremendous pressure.

264
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:53,396
I've endured

265
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:55,036
all this suffering myself.

266
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:57,156
I couldn't bear

267
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,235
to watch you endure the same.

268
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:02,036
I kept you away from the law before,

269
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:04,196
and I'm asking you to return with me

270
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,835
simply because

271
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,515
I want your life to be easier.

272
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:09,656
Son,

273
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,396
I've failed you as a father all along.

274
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:14,595
But everything I did

275
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:16,396
was for your own good.

276
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:18,995
What I want most now is for you

277
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:20,916
to not become a lawyer

278
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,875
just to spite me.

279
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:25,995
Why won't you believe

280
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:28,436
that I genuinely want to be a lawyer?

281
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:31,556
I might've been impulsive at the start.

282
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:32,676
But I'm not anymore.

283
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,475
I just helped that noodle shop owner

284
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,715
solve a very simple

285
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:37,796
legal problem.

286
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:38,796
It makes me happy.

287
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:39,715
I feel fulfilled.

288
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:40,956
And now I understand

289
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:43,316
what all those legal provisions
I memorized mean

290
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,835
and how they're actually applied.

291
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:45,995
But...

292
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,475
But you just refuse to believe me.

293
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:48,995
And you won't even try.

294
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:50,956
If you gave me just one-tenth

295
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,115
of your attention, patience,

296
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:52,995
or curiosity

297
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:53,956
with your clients,

298
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:55,676
you'd know me better than this.

299
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:57,956
I'm taking time to sit with you here now

300
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,436
because I want to understand you.

301
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:01,436
Isn't it normal

302
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:02,556
for a father and son

303
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,556
to have a meal together?

304
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,715
Why must it be "taking time" for me?

305
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:07,635
Am I wasting your precious time?

306
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:08,456
I'm sorry.

307
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:09,816
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,715
Son, that's not what I meant.

309
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:14,916
I heard everything you said.

310
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:16,556
I know you mean well.

311
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,156
But some wounds

312
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,956
took me a very long time

313
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,916
to slowly heal.

314
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,635
As an adult

315
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:24,475
or a young man

316
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:25,835
who studied law,

317
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:28,036
I understand every decision you made,

318
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:29,595
every word you said to me,

319
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,475
and every lesson
you taught me back then.

320
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:32,956
But I didn't get it as a child.

321
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:34,916
Besides being your son,

322
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,076
I'm also my mom's son.

323
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,396
And I feel sorry for her.

324
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:38,995
She was the one who sent me abroad.

325
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,515
She gave me another chance,

326
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,235
allowing me into this profession.

327
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,475
I can't go with you.

328
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,235
I want to stay at Jun An.

329
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,036
I've already made the decision.

330
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:51,196
Can you respect it?

331
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,692
(Noodles)

332
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:02,515
That girl is good.

333
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:03,475
Cherish her.

334
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:06,656
Son,

335
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:08,436
you've grown up.

336
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,396
You decide your own path now.

337
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:11,835
But remember this:

338
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:13,396
You are my son.

339
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:14,515
Don't lose.

340
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:16,816
I know.

341
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:18,176
I'm off.

342
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,056
Mr. Jiang.

343
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:40,215
Go for it.

344
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:24,995
Don't worry.

345
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:26,316
We didn't see anything.

346
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:26,936
Right?

347
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:30,436
Were you crying?

348
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:31,515
No, I was sweating.

349
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,095
(New email)

350
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,216
(Subject: Round 5
Overall Scores and Rankings)

351
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:49,608
(Overall Ranking: 1)

352
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:54,344
(Overall Ranking: 1)

353
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:58,284
(Overall Ranking: 2)

354
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,196
Yes!

355
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:13,960
(Overall Ranking: 3)

356
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:18,956
Mr. Zhou,

357
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:20,635
(Overall Ranking: 4)
my ranking is on the edge now.

358
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:23,076
Days remain in this round.

359
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,036
Could you help me with that?

360
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:36,595
Ke,

361
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,036
no matter how busy you are,
eat well, sleep well,

362
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:39,995
and exercise.

363
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:41,556
Don't stay up late.

364
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:42,696
By the way.

365
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,956
The fresh walnuts I sent

366
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,396
were all cracked by your sister.

367
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:46,276
Eat them soon.

368
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:54,276
This round still has a week left.

369
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:55,475
Until the last moment,

370
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,076
nobody knows who gets eliminated.

371
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:58,635
Seize every opportunity.

372
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:00,796
Now let me brief you
on the current situation.

373
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,475
Jiang Chen has some personal matters

374
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:04,796
and can't continue

375
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,436
the follow-up on the RE case.

376
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:08,676
Mr. Song and I have decided

377
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:11,515
that Jiang Chen's work
will transfer to Guo Xiaoyu.

378
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:15,676
Thank you for this opportunity.

379
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:17,916
You earned this through your own effort.

380
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:19,875
Mr. Song was pleased with your document

381
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:20,475
last night.

382
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:21,255
I saw it too.

383
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:22,556
Notable progress.

384
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:24,115
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

385
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:25,176
Jiang Chen,

386
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:26,835
given your great performance,

387
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:29,436
Mr. Song specifically requested you
as his assistant

388
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:30,635
to handle

389
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:32,196
Tian Kai Xin's remaining projects.

390
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:35,835
I have a task from Ms. Bai too.

391
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:36,676
I can do it.

392
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,515
It is time-sensitive.

393
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,036
You three all need to work on it.

394
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,076
The top performer

395
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,635
will earn points

396
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:45,276
and get

397
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:46,475
a business trip with Ms. Bai.

398
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:48,715
Even I'm tempted by this.

399
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:50,515
Don't overextend yourself.

400
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,436
Focus on your current work first.

401
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,156
Make sure you survive this round.

402
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:56,796
Jiang Chen, you should
follow Mr. Zhou's advice.

403
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:58,316
Because this opportunity

404
00:16:58,835 --> 00:16:59,835
is for me to take.

405
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,075
Hello, thank you for meeting me.

406
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:40,715
Hello.

407
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:41,775
Please sit.

408
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,552
(Equity Transfer Agreement)

409
00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:58,521
(Shareholder Capital
Contribution Agreement)

410
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:06,715
Both parties agreed on a thirty percent

411
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:09,515
and seventy percent co-investment ratio,

412
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:11,235
(Client: Hong Da)
totaling 100 million yuan.

413
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,254
(New Company)

414
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,480
(Xin Jian)

415
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:28,596
(Third Party, Client: Hong Da.
Xin Jian Ye: ¥45M. New Company: ¥50M)

416
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:29,396
Alright, I see.

417
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:31,795
I'll

418
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,396
be available after 8 PM tomorrow.

419
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:34,656
Okay.

420
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:36,176
Ms. Bai.

421
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:38,136
Come on in.

422
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:43,156
Here are my thoughts

423
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,715
on asset preservation for this case.

424
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:50,015
Go ahead.

425
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:51,995
Regardless of the finalized

426
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:53,596
arbitration strategy,

427
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:54,916
our client, as the claimant,

428
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,755
must file property preservation

429
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:58,356
against Hong Da.

430
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,275
This ensures

431
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,315
that if we win arbitration,
recovery is feasible.

432
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:03,156
So, when initiating arbitration,

433
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:04,755
we should petition the tribunal

434
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:06,755
for asset preservation measures
against Hong Da,

435
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,995
such as freezing their accounts
and equity holdings

436
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:11,624
and seizing vehicle and other assets.

437
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,515
Be direct.

438
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:14,235
These are the conventional methods.

439
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:16,156
But I noticed Hong Da

440
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,596
is in the clothing business.

441
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,715
If we can target Hong Da's

442
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,315
main registered trademarks

443
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:22,475
for successful preservation,

444
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:23,916
we could obtain execution funds

445
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,196
by auctioning off
those preserved trademarks later

446
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:27,075
to secure payment.

447
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:28,315
Good.

448
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:30,876
How long did you spend preparing these?

449
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:32,396
Under three days.

450
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:34,555
That's quite efficient.

451
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:37,735
Here,

452
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:38,995
read this document.

453
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:40,396
After reading it,

454
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:41,836
share your thoughts with me.

455
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,876
It also uses property preservation

456
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:51,916
as its core strategy.

457
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,436
She discovered Hong Da

458
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:54,636
has ongoing business

459
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:55,916
with another company.

460
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,995
That company owes Hong Da

461
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:59,836
three million yuan in overdue payments.

462
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:01,356
The debt has matured but is unpaid.

463
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:03,116
She proposes preserving Hong Da's

464
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,035
matured creditor rights
against that company.

465
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:07,475
After winning the case, our client

466
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:08,956
could directly collect that payment.

467
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,596
Between her approach and yours,

468
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:12,275
which is better?

469
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:14,836
Yan Fei's is great.

470
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,075
But mine holds up well.

471
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,676
Combining our approaches

472
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,156
gives the client the best solution.

473
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:21,995
How did you know Yan Fei did it?

474
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,676
This business intel requires

475
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,515
her family's unique connections

476
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,715
to uncover.

477
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:27,876
You're smart.

478
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:29,916
But you seem reluctant.

479
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:32,396
Feeling her success relies on resources,

480
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:33,676
and it's unfair?

481
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:36,475
Ms. Bai, I'm not a child.

482
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,715
I don't feel that way.

483
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,356
I work within my strengths

484
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:40,315
and do what I can.

485
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:44,075
But currently,

486
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:46,116
her approach appears superior.

487
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:47,676
Ms. Bai...

488
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:48,956
Remember what Zhou Nian said

489
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,436
during the assignment briefing?

490
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:52,876
He said your work progress

491
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:54,596
should be reported directly to me.

492
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:56,096
I remember.

493
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:58,396
That's why I've been waiting
since morning.

494
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,035
Then why didn't you

495
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,515
approach me once in three days?

496
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,116
You started immediately

497
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:04,035
after receiving the job

498
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:05,916
and submitted it now after three days.

499
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:08,676
Compared to most junior lawyers,

500
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:09,555
you're much faster.

501
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,075
But if your approach needs an overhaul

502
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:13,396
due to foundational flaws,

503
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,916
and the client inquiries

504
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,715
about progress,

505
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:17,636
what should we tell them?

506
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:21,235
Want to know Yan Fei's method?

507
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:22,636
First,

508
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,836
she drafted
a property preservation outline.

509
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:26,035
She sent it to me

510
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,755
and scheduled a meeting for day two.

511
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,995
When I didn't respond during court,

512
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,116
she developed the method further

513
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:34,035
and scheduled another meeting
on day three.

514
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:35,916
So before I met you today,

515
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,156
she'd already presented

516
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,596
her work progress and results

517
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:42,116
clearly and completely to me.

518
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:44,755
Now, do you still think
she outperformed you

519
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:46,995
just because of her family resources?

520
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,356
Consolidate
both your property preservation

521
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,315
approaches.

522
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:56,916
When possible, start preparing

523
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,315
the preservation application early.

524
00:21:59,235 --> 00:21:59,735
Understood.

525
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,504
(Property Preservation)

526
00:22:06,504 --> 00:22:08,874
(It refers to courts taking measures
before or after litigation)

527
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:10,934
(to ensure enforcement of future
judgments or prevent property loss)

528
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:12,194
(by restricting parties' control
over disputed assets)

529
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:13,384
(via compulsory enforcement mechanisms.)

530
00:22:20,075 --> 00:22:20,596
Got scolded?

531
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:23,275
Thanks.

532
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:26,075
Don't you want to know

533
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:27,156
where you fell short?

534
00:22:28,396 --> 00:22:29,396
Since childhood,

535
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:31,755
I've watched countless
subordinates report

536
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:33,836
in my father's and brother's offices.

537
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:35,676
And I realized

538
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,315
it's my unique edge

539
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,836
that others can't replicate.

540
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:41,795
Congratulations.

541
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:44,396
You failed
to report promptly to Ms. Bai.

542
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,396
Did you think the task was too simple?

543
00:22:46,676 --> 00:22:47,916
Or do you fear your superior?

544
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:50,475
So,

545
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:52,436
are you arrogant

546
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:54,396
or insecure?

547
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:01,075
Yan Fei,

548
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:03,916
if you thought I'd crumble
from these words,

549
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:05,596
you'd be underestimating me.

550
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:07,836
If you did everything flawlessly,

551
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:08,836
why did Ms. Bai

552
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:10,396
assign the consolidation task to me?

553
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:15,275
You kept saying you wanted
to join Mr. Song's team before.

554
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:16,916
Now you're so invested in Ms. Bai's

555
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:17,755
team's work.

556
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:19,916
Have you changed your mind?

557
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:22,636
Choosing a good friend is important.

558
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:25,315
But choosing a worthy rival
is even more important.

559
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,035
I think you're

560
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:28,775
impressive.

561
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:30,055
Thanks.

562
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:31,715
I think you are too.

563
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:34,475
But if only one can remain in the end,

564
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:35,795
it has to be me.

565
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:43,715
Mr. Song, I've printed

566
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:44,956
He Hui's project documents

567
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:45,755
you asked for.

568
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:48,075
Will they partner with Tian Kai Xin?

569
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:48,975
No.

570
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,116
Are there plans?

571
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:53,956
There won't ever be.

572
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:56,995
Let me introduce you.

573
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:58,636
This is Mr. Hu.

574
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,436
He's handling He Hui's acquisition.

575
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:01,836
He's vital to our team.

576
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:04,436
He urgently needs two interns to assist.

577
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:06,356
I recommended you and Xiaoyu.

578
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:07,676
Xiaoyu has agreed.

579
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:08,936
And you?

580
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:10,275
Any issues?

581
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,116
I don't have issues.

582
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,356
But on my end...

583
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:14,055
Don't worry.

584
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,515
I'll talk to Ms. Bai.

585
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,356
I had Mr. Zhou tell you

586
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,436
that you'd follow the Tian Kai Xin case.

587
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:21,676
Otherwise,

588
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:22,956
I couldn't have won you over.

589
00:24:23,715 --> 00:24:25,715
Dispute resolution
is fascinating indeed,

590
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,156
but non-litigation work
also presents challenges.

591
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:29,795
Your performance earlier

592
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,156
was remarkable.

593
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:33,356
Seize the chance

594
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:34,436
for diversity.

595
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:35,596
That way,

596
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:37,035
you'll know

597
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,596
the expertise you want.

598
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:41,475
Thank you.

599
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:42,755
Mr. Song,

600
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:44,795
I'm right here sitting with you.

601
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:46,035
Don't play favorites.

602
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:48,636
Rest assured.
I'll treat everyone equally.

603
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:50,275
But you need to fight harder.

604
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,676
Don't always stay down.

605
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:53,916
It'll make me look bad as your mentor.

606
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:55,636
I believe

607
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:57,956
my judgment about people won't fail.

608
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:00,396
Shock everyone.

609
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:05,596
I knew you were up to no good.

610
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:06,676
Poaching my team now?

611
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:08,795
I'll take that as a yes.

612
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,235
These kids now

613
00:25:15,235 --> 00:25:16,676
are outworking each other fiercely.

614
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:18,956
Ms. Bai,

615
00:25:19,515 --> 00:25:20,795
you praised Yan Fei

616
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:21,916
in front of Ren Jiatong.

617
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:22,596
I get that.

618
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:24,795
But which move did you play

619
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:26,876
to motivate Yan Fei so well?

620
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,876
I met her brother earlier

621
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:30,956
at a banquet.

622
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:33,916
He unexpectedly supported her
staying at Jun An

623
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:35,555
and even her joining your team.

624
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:38,596
You knew her brother came to me?

625
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:40,396
She's smarter than I expected

626
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:41,676
but also more rebellious

627
00:25:41,676 --> 00:25:43,080
toward her brother than I thought.

628
00:25:44,995 --> 00:25:46,436
If we messed up back then,

629
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:47,880
our mentors would scold us.

630
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:49,475
Dealing with these kids now

631
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,436
requires strategies.

632
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:53,224
We act by The Art of War
and the Thirty-Six Stratagems.

633
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,596
This profession isn't easy.

634
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:57,456
True.

635
00:25:58,035 --> 00:25:58,715
It takes time.

636
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:00,196
We've been there too.

637
00:26:02,235 --> 00:26:02,735
Right,

638
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:03,715
Tian Min said

639
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,315
she saw those two

640
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,676
declaring war in the pantry.

641
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:09,196
They said, "If only one could stay,"

642
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:10,715
"it should be me."

643
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:12,876
Doesn't that sound familiar?

644
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,876
Exactly what we said back then.

645
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:21,116
It's so late now.

646
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:22,555
You should go home to Niuniu.

647
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:23,876
Pack your things.

648
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:24,676
I'll drive you.

649
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:30,984
Where's the pen I gave you?

650
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,555
Have you used it?

651
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:35,356
It's expensive.

652
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:36,596
I fear I'll ruin it.

653
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:37,795
Then buy a new one.

654
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:41,475
Did you throw it?

655
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:42,676
I'm stingy with money.

656
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:43,956
I'd never throw it away.

657
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,475
I'll keep it as a collector's item.

658
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:47,255
Let's go.

659
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:48,315
Grab my bag.

660
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:54,096
Let's go.

661
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:04,495
Ms. Bai,

662
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:06,156
about that pen,

663
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:07,876
I thought it looked nice.

664
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:09,156
So I got it

665
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:10,075
for you.

666
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,436
No hidden agenda.

667
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:16,436
Stop playing dumb with me.

668
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:19,795
Yes, I do have a similar one.

669
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,396
But I truly meant nothing by it.

670
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:23,676
You're missing the point.

671
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:25,676
I was thinking

672
00:27:26,156 --> 00:27:27,555
about Jiang Chen.

673
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:28,995
He's my disciple.

674
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:30,315
You may borrow him.

675
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,515
But outright poaching?

676
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:33,275
He ultimately belongs to our team.

677
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:34,315
Don't change the topic.

678
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:36,235
I'm talking about the pen.

679
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:38,235
In the old days,

680
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:40,315
you'd invite me to a concert

681
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,515
or some pricey wine,

682
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:45,116
then ceremoniously return the gift

683
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:46,156
still wrapped up.

684
00:27:46,596 --> 00:27:47,196
Mr. Song,

685
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:49,315
I have matured since then, alright?

686
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:50,436
Matured?

687
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:52,956
It's twisting the knife in my heart.

688
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:55,515
Do I mean nothing to you now?

689
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,475
Not even the courtesy
of a formal rejection?

690
00:27:58,515 --> 00:27:59,075
Well,

691
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:01,515
fine wine costs.

692
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,075
If you gift me a pen,

693
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:04,315
I'll actually use it.

694
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:05,436
But wine?

695
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,035
Gone in one sitting.

696
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:08,235
What a waste.

697
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:09,676
Since when

698
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:11,596
did you become so transactional with me?

699
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:12,235
Is it necessary?

700
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:13,596
I need precision.

701
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:15,116
How else would I practice law?

702
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:17,235
Don't worry, I'll save that wine money

703
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:18,676
for a rainy day.

704
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:20,956
When you finally ditch the grind

705
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:22,235
and settle down to marry,

706
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:23,836
I'll gift you a huge red packet.

707
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:24,495
I mean it.

708
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:26,555
I can't believe you.

709
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:27,136
I'm leaving.

710
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:35,136
Ms. Bai.

711
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:36,475
Please.

712
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:37,755
Just don't

713
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:38,795
throw it away.

714
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:39,896
Okay.

715
00:28:40,515 --> 00:28:41,916
I'll start using it tomorrow, okay?

716
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:46,336
See you.

717
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:09,116
Now I see why they

718
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:10,475
assigned both of us to this.

719
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:13,315
It seemed straightforward initially.

720
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,315
Da Yuan holds 100% equity

721
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:16,436
in Zhong Yuan.

722
00:29:16,795 --> 00:29:18,275
He Hui wants to acquire Zhong Yuan

723
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:19,356
from Da Yuan,

724
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:20,836
so they've hired our firm

725
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:21,636
as legal counsel.

726
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:23,035
But digging deeper,

727
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:24,795
Zhong Yuan has

728
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,315
so many subsidiaries.

729
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:27,916
Due diligence for each one?

730
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,116
My head is spinning.

731
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:31,876
The other subsidiaries

732
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:34,075
were mostly covered by Mr. Hu.

733
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:37,235
Only Tian Yu subsidiary remains,

734
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,315
but they declined by email.

735
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,196
Basically,

736
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:40,755
Tian Yu is just a shell company

737
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,035
with no active operations.

738
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:43,315
So they couldn't provide

739
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,676
the due diligence materials to us.

740
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,315
This is suspicious.

741
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:49,636
But if even the senior attorneys
can't handle this,

742
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,035
what can a few interns like us do?

743
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:54,596
Mr. Hu said he's applied

744
00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:55,876
to interview at Zhong Yuan.

745
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:56,836
An on-site one.

746
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:57,876
He'll take us then.

747
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,916
We'll see if we can uncover anything.

748
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:01,136
Okay.

749
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:02,715
Then I'll use

750
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:04,916
my 24K-gold sharp eyes

751
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:06,035
to scan them.

752
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:08,035
If that fails, I'll deploy my

753
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:10,836
sweet smile to charm them.

754
00:30:11,836 --> 00:30:13,035
Maybe I can get something.

755
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:16,636
Want coffee?

756
00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:17,575
Yes.

757
00:30:17,995 --> 00:30:18,795
My mentor told me

758
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:19,916
I must nail this case.

759
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:22,515
If I don't turn things around
to make that old man proud,

760
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:23,235
maybe he'll never

761
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:24,715
live it down in front of Ms. Bai.

762
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,396
If your mentor finds out

763
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:28,156
you call him "old man" behind his back,

764
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:29,436
he might never

765
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,235
mention you to Ms. Bai ever again.

766
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:34,495
Okay.

767
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:36,075
Americano?

768
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:46,994
(Within 3 working days
after the contract effective date,)

769
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:48,616
(Party A shall pay Party B 50% thereof,
i.e., RMB 250,000.00.)

770
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:51,756
(Revoke clause: Within 3 working days
after the contract effective date,)

771
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:55,995
(Party A shall pay Party B 50% thereof,
i.e., RMB 250,000.00.)

772
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:01,078
(Due Diligence)

773
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:04,288
(Comprehensive background verification
for transaction subjects or partners)

774
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:08,104
(on, e.g., assets, liabilities, compliance.
Common in non-litigation services.)

775
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:16,156
Got two minutes?

776
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:16,795
Need your help.

777
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:18,396
What's up?

778
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:19,995
You scared me.

779
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:22,995
I made a litigation visualization chart.

780
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:23,715
Can you review it?

781
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:25,656
Five.

782
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:27,055
Four.

783
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,055
Three.

784
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:29,336
Two.

785
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:30,775
One.

786
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,075
Got it in five seconds?

787
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,156
Yes. The logic is solid.

788
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:35,436
Key legal relationships

789
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,436
are clearly presented.

790
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,396
The chart simplifies complex points.

791
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:39,075
Perfect.

792
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:40,956
Ms. Bai's task?

793
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:44,715
No, she criticized my work.

794
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,315
Said I never consider

795
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:47,596
senior attorneys during tasks.

796
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,116
So from now on,

797
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,715
I'll think one step ahead on every task.

798
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:52,475
You don't understand this case,

799
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:53,676
but you grasped it in seconds.

800
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:55,475
Meaning any judge would understand too.

801
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:58,515
You're becoming Ms. Bai's mini-me.

802
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:00,795
Friendly advice though,

803
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:02,515
don't worship idols blindly.

804
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:05,035
My dad told me

805
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:06,555
idols are meant to be humanized.

806
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:07,215
Humans

807
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:08,515
have flaws.

808
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,876
Never stop thinking independently.

809
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:13,356
Thanks, Mr. Jiang.

810
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,275
But I need her to notice me first.

811
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:17,956
Let's grab dinner.

812
00:32:18,475 --> 00:32:19,475
I've got a briefing soon.

813
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:21,356
Don't say no yet.

814
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:23,956
Seriously, thank you.

815
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,356
You got my dad and me to share a meal.

816
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,596
It healed something in me.

817
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:30,876
Let me return the favor.

818
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:31,616
Deal?

819
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:38,596
Hello.

820
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:41,475
Someone promised coffee. Where is it?

821
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:45,836
And I definitely heard a dinner offer.

822
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:47,235
How'd you hear that?

823
00:32:48,555 --> 00:32:49,396
So it's real?

824
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,196
Yes, a group dinner with everyone.

825
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:53,636
Get Li Ke and Yan Fei too.

826
00:32:53,836 --> 00:32:55,715
Okay, get Yue too.

827
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:57,235
She's wedding dress shopping nearby.

828
00:32:57,995 --> 00:32:59,876
Want to invite Mr. Zhuang?

829
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:00,636
Walk to his office,

830
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:01,555
knock on his door,

831
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:02,235
and tell him.

832
00:33:05,636 --> 00:33:06,136
Well?

833
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:07,596
Go ahead without me.

834
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:08,715
I'll catch up later.

835
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:09,495
Okay.

836
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:10,295
Do come.

837
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:13,235
Finally got my coffee. Thanks.

838
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:14,676
How did you actually hear us?

839
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:16,075
Let me try your seat.

840
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:19,215
Thanks.

841
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:20,836
Didn't expect you to come.

842
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:24,396
I've been pulling nonstop shifts
at the firm.

843
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:25,475
I needed a ride.

844
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:27,836
My overtime feels like

845
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:29,315
another lifetime ago.

846
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:31,396
I lost hair daily
from anxiety back then.

847
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:33,836
Now that I've heard you say it,

848
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:35,715
I actually feel nostalgic
for those days.

849
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,876
When's the wedding date?

850
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:40,356
We're still picking a date.

851
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:41,795
If things go well,

852
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:42,795
it's next month.

853
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:44,715
Congratulations.

854
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:50,356
What's that look for?

855
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:54,515
How do I put this?

856
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:56,356
In theory,

857
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:58,555
I've finally achieved
everything I wanted.

858
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:02,356
But I feel an emptiness inside.

859
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:04,876
It just seems

860
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:06,555
all this was what I once

861
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:07,795
exhausted myself pursuing.

862
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:11,155
Like being perfectly cared for by a man,

863
00:34:11,555 --> 00:34:13,155
following his schedule every day,

864
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:14,396
and learning how to be a wife.

865
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:16,916
But being fully supported like that,

866
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:17,876
over time,

867
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:19,956
it felt like my feet
weren't on the ground.

868
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:21,756
Then one day I started panicking.

869
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:24,396
The loss of control?

870
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:25,575
Exactly.

871
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:26,675
That's the feeling.

872
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:29,675
I got scared.

873
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:32,436
I'm afraid marriage
will erode our love over time

874
00:34:32,756 --> 00:34:34,716
and wear away my ambition
and professional skills.

875
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:36,796
Until I completely lose myself.

876
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,035
Then wherever he goes,
I'd have to follow.

877
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,155
He's even planned out
my pregnancy timeline.

878
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,236
I'm only in my twenties.

879
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:45,716
My whole future life

880
00:34:45,956 --> 00:34:47,356
would revolve around him and kids.

881
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:48,555
I'd have no career,

882
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,035
no social life, and no friends.

883
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:50,956
If anything

884
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,515
ever happens to us,

885
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,475
I could lose everything.

886
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,316
Am I being overly dramatic?

887
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,195
Not at all.

888
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,195
When going through
such drastic life changes,

889
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:08,155
emotional ups and downs
are completely normal.

890
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:09,956
Besides, nobody says

891
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:11,396
a housewife's life

892
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:12,956
can't include friends or social events.

893
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:15,796
Good point.

894
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:17,635
Looking back now,

895
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:19,916
the reason I chose him back then

896
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:22,756
was because I'd chased
this lifestyle for too long.

897
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:24,356
When he handed it to me,

898
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,396
I couldn't say no.

899
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:27,916
Also,

900
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:29,956
maybe beyond socializing and friends,

901
00:35:31,515 --> 00:35:32,555
I need colleagues too.

902
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:37,635
Being a wealthy wife
isn't exactly stress-free.

903
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:40,635
But you should protect yourself legally
before marriage.

904
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:41,916
Think about that.

905
00:35:42,716 --> 00:35:44,236
Don't just focus on negative examples.

906
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:45,436
Plenty of wives thrive.

907
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,236
Let's take my mom for instance.

908
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:48,675
Spoiled by my dad her whole life.

909
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:50,396
Now doted on by my brother.

910
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:51,916
She never worked a day.

911
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,475
Even in her sixties now,

912
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:55,436
she's still youthful as ever.

913
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:57,956
So when you're that fortunate,

914
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:58,916
it's quite good.

915
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:01,035
In the long run,

916
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:03,515
marriages survive
on mutual respect and conscience.

917
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,595
Your current panic

918
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:06,956
is mostly in your head.

919
00:36:09,796 --> 00:36:11,035
You haven't changed at all.

920
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:13,876
I'll take that as a compliment.

921
00:36:20,827 --> 00:36:22,876
(Noodles)

922
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:23,376
Ma'am,

923
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:25,075
any more trouble here lately?

924
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:27,195
All quiet now.

925
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:28,575
Okay.

926
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:34,876
Slow down.

927
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:35,876
It's rare to relax.

928
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:36,756
Got work to do.

929
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:37,396
I need to go.

930
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:38,276
Going back?

931
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:51,436
I can't wait.

932
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:52,595
Maybe next time.

933
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:53,615
Leaving now?

934
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:54,495
Bye.

935
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,316
The property management called.

936
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:02,836
I'll go and handle them.

937
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:04,635
Stop eating.

938
00:37:07,155 --> 00:37:08,316
Read the contract carefully.

939
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:09,316
It's clear.

940
00:37:09,675 --> 00:37:11,916
Either party
may terminate the lease early.

941
00:37:12,115 --> 00:37:13,236
But if the lessee

942
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:14,595
causes property damage,

943
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:17,276
the lessor won't refund prepaid rent.

944
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:20,276
(Xiaoyu's Legal Tips)
Lessor may charge lessee for repairs.

945
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,075
Your AC unit and sign installation

946
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:25,796
damaged the shop's walls.

947
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:28,195
Therefore, we cannot refund your rent.

948
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:30,475
Also, you need to pay
an additional half month's rent

949
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:31,716
as the repair fee.

950
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:32,776
Thank you.

951
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:33,296
Followers,

952
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:35,276
the management is twisting the facts.

953
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:38,276
They're falsely labeling renovations
as damage.

954
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,035
Legally,

955
00:37:39,236 --> 00:37:41,075
when the lessee, who is the shop owner,

956
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,635
adds attachments to the property,

957
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:45,115
they must get the lessor's consent.

958
00:37:45,316 --> 00:37:46,555
Upon contract termination,

959
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:48,316
both parties can negotiate
to remove them.

960
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:50,115
Now the air conditioner and signboard

961
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:51,075
qualify as attachments.

962
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:53,356
Shop renovations now

963
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:54,236
need management's

964
00:37:54,236 --> 00:37:56,276
approval before being started.

965
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:56,975
Exactly.

966
00:37:56,995 --> 00:37:58,956
The termination
was initiated by you, the lessor.

967
00:37:59,115 --> 00:37:59,916
Per the Supreme Court's

968
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:01,796
judicial interpretations
of lease contracts,

969
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,956
you must not only
refund the remaining rent

970
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:05,756
but also compensate
for the residual value

971
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:06,555
of renovations.

972
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:09,595
I also have an addendum

973
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,155
on future pipe replacements

974
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,035
for the shop.

975
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:12,675
Please read it.

976
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:13,675
An addendum too?

977
00:38:15,115 --> 00:38:16,115
Why did you come back?

978
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:17,916
Where did you find this addendum?

979
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:19,756
Wang Lu just called
to remind me about it.

980
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:33,716
Hello, Wang Lu?

981
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:34,216
Li Ke.

982
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:35,796
I'm watching the live stream.

983
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:37,276
Locate the addendum.

984
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:39,356
Check the handwritten clause

985
00:38:39,356 --> 00:38:40,515
in the "other terms" section.

986
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:42,075
I helped draft it

987
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:43,796
through a student legal aid activity

988
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:44,555
back in college.

989
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:46,916
It states neither party may terminate

990
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,316
before the lease expiration date.

991
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:50,796
Violation requires
paying one month's rent

992
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:51,555
as damages.

993
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:53,155
When the original lease

994
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:54,756
and the addendum conflict,

995
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:56,075
the addendum stipulates.

996
00:38:56,195 --> 00:38:57,595
So if you proceed with termination,

997
00:38:58,276 --> 00:38:59,436
you'll have to pay

998
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:02,075
both the compensation
and an extra month's rent.

999
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:04,436
Well, sir?

1000
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:06,916
I'll report this to my superior.

1001
00:39:07,155 --> 00:39:07,655
Hold on.

1002
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:09,276
Wang Lu,

1003
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,276
are you actually watching us live?

1004
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:13,716
Wang Lu, how are you?

1005
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:14,995
Thank you.

1006
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:18,356
You guys are amazing.

1007
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:20,595
Thank you all.

1008
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:21,836
Ma'am, you can't move away.

1009
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,035
We all love your noodles.

1010
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:24,232
Noodles on the house.

1011
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:27,796
Cheers!

1012
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:34,115
Though we're just interns,

1013
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,836
this victory feels incredible.

1014
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:38,716
Too bad we missed the main action.

1015
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,876
But catching the property manager

1016
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:42,635
personally delivering wine to apologize

1017
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:43,675
made it worthwhile.

1018
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:45,936
Li Ke,

1019
00:39:46,115 --> 00:39:47,716
thanks for shielding me earlier.

1020
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:48,436
Are you okay?

1021
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:49,535
I'm fine.

1022
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,796
You were about to leave earlier,

1023
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:52,956
yet you came back halfway

1024
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,195
and spent time helping us.

1025
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:55,035
Seriously.

1026
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:59,316
My mind was completely focused on work.

1027
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:00,555
But seeing them bullied

1028
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:01,836
really got me furious.

1029
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:03,336
Enough.

1030
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:05,035
No more work talk today.

1031
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:06,135
Cheers!

1032
00:40:06,276 --> 00:40:06,776
Cheers!

1033
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:07,515
Cheers!

1034
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:15,956
Li Ke, how have you been lately?

1035
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:17,916
Those dark circles under your eyes

1036
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,515
are almost as big as my idol Hua Hua's.

1037
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:20,555
What Hua Hua?

1038
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:21,595
The panda.

1039
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:23,716
Result of all-nighters.

1040
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:25,115
Honestly though,

1041
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:26,595
I'm actually envious of you all now.

1042
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:28,035
The more I consider it,

1043
00:40:28,316 --> 00:40:29,576
the more I feel work suits me.

1044
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:33,796
Giving up on your older guy?

1045
00:40:33,956 --> 00:40:34,728
Can you bear it?

1046
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:35,836
Absolutely.

1047
00:40:35,899 --> 00:40:37,608
(Talk later. Busy now.)

1048
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:42,155
What do you mean by "absolutely"?

1049
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:44,876
Stop pretending.

1050
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:46,515
No matter how good

1051
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:47,555
a lawyer is,

1052
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:49,236
they're just a glorified worker, right?

1053
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,876
Your fiancé has great prospects
and truly loves you.

1054
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,035
You're in deep love.

1055
00:40:53,436 --> 00:40:55,155
You're getting married.
So why stir the pot?

1056
00:40:55,595 --> 00:40:57,236
We are forced into this.

1057
00:40:57,436 --> 00:40:59,555
And you're just meddling needlessly.

1058
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,356
How are you "forced into this"?

1059
00:41:02,356 --> 00:41:04,075
Why call me "meddling"?

1060
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:05,716
How isn't this meddling?

1061
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:07,236
Among all present,

1062
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,115
some genuinely need this job.

1063
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:10,356
Ren Jiatong.

1064
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:11,535
Me.

1065
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:12,975
Xiaoyu.

1066
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:14,396
But Fei,

1067
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:15,436
you,

1068
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:16,796
and you.

1069
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,115
Do you three even actually need it?

1070
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:20,756
No matter how appealing

1071
00:41:20,756 --> 00:41:21,956
the Jun An offer is,

1072
00:41:22,236 --> 00:41:23,555
only the three of us

1073
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:25,075
might actually need it

1074
00:41:25,356 --> 00:41:27,956
for survival and building careers.

1075
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:29,675
But you three

1076
00:41:29,675 --> 00:41:31,716
might give up or quit any day

1077
00:41:31,716 --> 00:41:32,836
and walk away abruptly.

1078
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,316
Why are you competing with us then?

1079
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:34,836
For what?

1080
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:37,436
Let's not put it that way.

1081
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:40,836
Having a wealthy dad, husband,
or brother

1082
00:41:40,836 --> 00:41:41,796
isn't some original sin.

1083
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:44,276
Everyone selected deserves to be here.

1084
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:46,396
Making it to the end on your own merit

1085
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:47,356
is incredible.

1086
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:48,936
Leaving halfway isn't a shame.

1087
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:50,316
Numerous legal statutes exist.

1088
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:52,035
Why limit life to just choosing

1089
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:53,396
to do or not to do?

1090
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:55,356
Do you truly believe

1091
00:41:55,756 --> 00:41:56,956
everyone selected deserves

1092
00:41:57,236 --> 00:41:57,796
to be here?

1093
00:41:58,075 --> 00:41:58,635
Of course.

1094
00:42:05,595 --> 00:42:06,836
I just helped someone.

1095
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:07,995
I'm so thrilled.

1096
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:11,195
Jun An chose me. That shows I'm amazing.

1097
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:12,716
I'm not lacking at all.

1098
00:42:13,236 --> 00:42:14,195
Staying in Beijing,

1099
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:15,515
I have no regrets.

1100
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:17,015
Bravo!

1101
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:29,595
What's this?

1102
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:32,836
Ren Jiatong said Zhu Zhisheng
is in that group chat.

1103
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:34,236
Yan Fei said, "I love you."

1104
00:42:34,276 --> 00:42:35,595
Ren Jiatong replied, "Me too."

1105
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:36,876
Really?

1106
00:42:37,356 --> 00:42:37,956
You made it up?

1107
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:40,876
It's true.
We girls have our own code language.

1108
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:42,356
Guys wouldn't get it.

1109
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:46,276
Cheers!

1110
00:42:48,236 --> 00:42:49,316
Girls help girls.

1111
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:51,995
Xiaoyu, is this another thing

1112
00:42:52,515 --> 00:42:54,515
guys might struggle to understand?

1113
00:42:54,836 --> 00:42:55,336
Go ahead.

1114
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:57,475
I'm not lacking at all.

1115
00:42:57,796 --> 00:42:58,796
Staying in Beijing,

1116
00:42:58,995 --> 00:42:59,876
I have no regrets.

1117
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:01,396
I got your voice message too.

1118
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:02,436
You posted it

1119
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:04,035
in the main group chat.

1120
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:05,276
Zhu Zhisheng isn't in it.

1121
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:06,515
Only a few senior lawyers are.

1122
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:12,876
