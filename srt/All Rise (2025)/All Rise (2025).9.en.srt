(Li Ke 2, Yan Fei 2, Jiang Chen 1)

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,039
I've been working
on this case for a week

44
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,479
and revised it twice.

45
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,080
I don't know what else to do.

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
You know why Ren Jiatong
didn't have to revise it?

47
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,879
She also failed her first attempt

48
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,960
and was asked to redo it.

49
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,800
She first organized the facts

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,159
into a chronological table.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,759
Then she created
a clear and intuitive timeline

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
with visualization software.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
Then she slowly

54
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,719
refined the details.

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,759
And you?

56
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,759
Let me put it straight.

57
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,120
Your long paragraphs

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,759
of endless text give me a headache

59
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,560
every time.

60
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,120
Not to mention Ms. Bai,

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,199
who's so busy.

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,319
It's easier

63
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,919
to just flip through the case file.

64
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,360
Besides,

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,840
Ren Jiatong also attached a draft

66
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,120
of her legal opinion

67
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,000
to the review notes she submitted.

68
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,879
So what did Ms. Bai say?

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
She said,

70
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,919
"It seems I can rest early today."

71
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:58,984
Here.

72
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,056
Jiang Chen.

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
I bet you know

74
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,199
that the use of AI in law

75
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,680
is becoming

76
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,919
more widespread worldwide.

77
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,224
Yeah.

78
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,240
My classmates in the U.S.

79
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,039
are also using AI at law firms.

80
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,080
And AI is indeed

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
very powerful.

82
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
I heard that several
domestic Red Circle Firms

83
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,279
laid off their entire
translation departments.

84
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,199
So you should know

85
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,839
that AI can complete
basic tasks like case review.

86
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,000
This is a cost-saving improvement
for bosses and clients.

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,160
If our law firm implements AI

88
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,639
to handle basic tasks

89
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,959
that first to third-year lawyers

90
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,399
are doing now,

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
how will you fresh graduates

92
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,920
manage to stay?

93
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,759
Do you have case handling experience,

94
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,519
or do you know

95
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,519
how to deal with clients?

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,079
Why are you irreplaceable

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
when you compete with AI?

98
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,439
I know what to do now.

99
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,959
Thank you, Ms. Tian.

100
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,160
Way to go, Min.

101
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,040
Great tactic of provocation

102
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,279
by mentioning AI.

103
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,959
You're flattering me, Mr. Zhou.

104
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,959
I'm just an ordinary senior colleague

105
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,000
who's beautiful,
kind-hearted, and caring.

106
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,319
I'm no match for an expert diplomat

107
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:24,920
like you.

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,759
Please.

109
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,560
I have a reason to be worried.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
I seriously don't know

111
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,000
what our future looks like.

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,079
You know what?

113
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,199
One of my classmates was just laid off.

114
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,000
She has a two-year-old kid.

115
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm anxious.

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,079
Please.

117
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,759
Working moms during breastfeeding
shouldn't be anxious.

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,800
Be positive.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We're lucky to be

120
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,240
fifth-year associates.

121
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,480
Even if Jun An

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,319
really uses AI,

123
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,040
we won't be

124
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,399
laid off right away.

125
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,160
What you said

126
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,160
helped alleviate my aging anxiety.

127
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,319
Well, thanks.

128
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,600
My pleasure.

129
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,360
Mr. Zhou.

130
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:10,920
Ms. Tian.

131
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
May I go on a field visit
this afternoon?

132
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
I'm working on the negotiation

133
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,560
with the tenants.

134
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,199
There's still much uncertainty.

135
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,199
So I want to talk to the protesters
at the Warm Nest headquarters.

136
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,959
As I said when assigning this task,

137
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,800
use any necessary methods.
Your field visit is approved.

138
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,240
Thank you.

139
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,319
I'm betting on...

140
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,416
I'm betting on Ren Jiatong.

141
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,959
I called it first. She's my pick.

142
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,959
Fine.

143
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,480
Then I'll bet on our Haryald prodigy.

144
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,759
What a coincidence.

145
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,439
Ms. Bai defeated Mr. Song.

146
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,279
You defeated me.

147
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,240
This year, Ren Jiatong

148
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,160
came on strong.

149
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,120
What's with Jun An's legacy?

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,160
Why do women

151
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,079
keep winning?

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,800
Mr. Zhou.

153
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,959
Apply your rigorous logical reasoning.

154
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,879
This isn't a coincidence.

155
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,439
It conclusively proves one thing.

156
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,519
What's that?

157
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,319
Women are simply better.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,920
You redid it again.

159
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,519
Any thoughts?

160
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,439
Make case review notes,

161
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,720
conduct analyses,

162
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,319
think like a senior lawyer,

163
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,240
identify the key points

164
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,839
and defense strategies.

165
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,639
Those are the keys to case reviews.

166
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,240
I've learned that.

167
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,279
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

168
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,704
Not bad.

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,800
How did you figure it out?

170
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,519
Ms. Tian enlightened me.

171
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,680
She asked me

172
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,839
why I am irreplaceable

173
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,759
when competing against AI.

174
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,399
I reflected on this.

175
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,399
Let's hear it.

176
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,040
AI is indeed capable, but in the end,

177
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,800
it's still developing.

178
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,959
To extract insights

179
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
from case reviews

180
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,759
provided by AI

181
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,879
is where I must improve.

182
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,560
Make AI work for me.

183
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,879
Don't let it replace me.

184
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,759
This is my career focus.

185
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:00,968
Good.

186
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,839
You can wrap up this task now.

187
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,720
Focus on the Warm Nest project.

188
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,872
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

189
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,720
Hi, Auntie.

190
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,560
What's up?

191
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,240
Chen.

192
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,079
I heard

193
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,639
Jun An is representing Warm Nest.

194
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,159
Is that true?

195
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,399
Stay out of it,

196
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,279
got it?

197
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,399
Auntie, it's not what you think.

198
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,960
Let me explain tonight.

199
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,759
Okay?

200
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,000
Fine.

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,320
Landlords in our group chat say

202
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,960
they're protesting
at the Warm Nest headquarters.

203
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,279
They asked us to go

204
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,360
and make a scene there.

205
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,799
Then they might pay up.

206
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,600
You want to cause trouble? When?

207
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,759
We're not causing any trouble.

208
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,480
I'm heading out after this call.

209
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,399
They say it's well-organized

210
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,440
and quite impactful.

211
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,720
Stay home.

212
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,879
Auntie, listen to me.

213
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,039
Don't get involved, okay?

214
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,279
We'll talk tonight.

215
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,792
Bye.

216
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,168
Hello?

217
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,920
What happened to Warm Nest?

218
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,120
I heard from Mr. Zhou

219
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,600
that Ren Jiatong went to Warm Nest.

220
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,720
She went there?

221
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,879
Do you think

222
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,960
she got some information

223
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,200
from that tenant group chat?

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
She does have an edge
in handling this case.

225
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,919
There's a protest there.

226
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,480
Jun An's representation of Warm Nest

227
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,360
infuriated them.

228
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,960
Ren Jiatong's video went viral.

229
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,080
Is she in danger there?

230
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,480
I need to go.

231
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,799
I'll go with you

232
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,480
to help out.

233
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,360
Do you think it's going to work?

234
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,679
Nobody is showing up.

235
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,879
We haven't had food or water

236
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,039
(Unwavering determination)
for days.

237
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,240
What's going on?

238
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,960
When will this ever end?

239
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,720
Hurry up and pay us back!

240
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,440
Pay us back!

241
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,320
- Pay us back!
- We have been here for long.

242
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,759
(Warm Nest scam! Lost everything!)
I can't take this anymore.

243
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:07,399
(Stop fraud and return
our hard-earned money)

244
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,200
Life is tough.

245
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,360
Be careful.

246
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,559
Auntie, maybe you should

247
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,120
go home and rest.

248
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:15,799
(Stop fraud and return
our hard-earned money)

249
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,759
My son

250
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,759
insisted our whole family come here,

251
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,279
saying a big crowd makes more impact.

252
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,120
That will force Warm Nest to pay up.

253
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,799
- Are you a landlady or a tenant?
- No updates at all.

254
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,679
Auntie, don't talk to her.

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,480
(Pay back)
She's Warm Nest's lawyer.

256
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440
She's against us.

257
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,039
How dare you!

258
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,240
Trying to scam us, are you?

259
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,440
What do you want?

260
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,799
Guys, come!

261
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,559
Let's take a look.

262
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,840
Drop the act!

263
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,039
Still trying to trick us?

264
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,240
I knew all lawyers were scum.

265
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,080
Yes! Capitalists' lapdogs!

266
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,480
(Pay back)
Wait.

267
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,279
This girl is kind-hearted.

268
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,279
She helped me up when I fell earlier.

269
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,639
Don't let her fool you!

270
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,159
She's with Warm Nest.

271
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,000
- Yeah.
- She's one of those scammers.

272
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,159
- Exactly!
- Scammers!

273
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,399
Don't speak to her!

274
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,480
Don't speak to her. She's a scammer.

275
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,799
Pay us back!

276
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:20,712
(Emergency)

277
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,360
Am I right?

278
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,759
Pay up!

279
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:34,799
Pay up!

280
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,000
Our hard-earned money!

281
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,240
Pay us back!

282
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,279
Pay us back!

283
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,679
Pay up now!

284
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,200
Pay up!

285
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,240
Pay us back!

286
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,720
Pay up now!

287
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,440
Stop! You hit her on purpose!

288
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,000
Are you hurt?

289
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,440
Trying to leave?

290
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,840
No way!

291
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,679
Back off!

292
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,120
He hit him.

293
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,679
He attacked him.

294
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,279
How dare they hit someone!

295
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,679
What happened?

296
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,200
Come on.

297
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,808
It's fine.

298
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,159
Outrageous.

299
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,840
Not paying and hitting people?

300
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,799
I can't move.

303
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,360
What's your plan?

304
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,919
He looks injured

305
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,320
and demands an assessment.

306
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,960
This one.

307
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,440
Put this on.

308
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
If he is confirmed with minor injuries

309
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,639
and causes trouble,

310
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,040
you may get kicked out from Jun An.

311
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,200
It's fine.

312
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,600
I just gave him a light push.

313
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,159
Who knew

314
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,639
a young guy would be so unsteady?

315
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,399
He fell from one little shove.

316
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,159
Right?

317
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,799

Jiang Chen

320
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,000
heard about the protest from his aunt

321
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,759
and rushed over

322
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,360
to you without asking for leave.

323
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,080
Nonsense.

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,120
I went there for the case proposal.

325
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,559
I had to understand
the tenants' situation

326
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,720
to figure out how to provide

327
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,039
corporate planning services
for Warm Nest Apartments.

328
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,879
Corporate planning?

00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:56,639

00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,544
Come over here.

331
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,320
I did.

(Case Handling Area)

334
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,840
You said you came

335
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,600
for Warm Nest's corporate planning.

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,592
Really?

337
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,968
Yeah.

338
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,960
Warm Nest Apartments
just had a huge crisis.

339
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,120
They must have failed in risk control

340
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,000
or messed up other preparations,

341
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,720
leading to this major crisis.

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,159
If we follow your proposal,

343
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
and they achieve

344
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,759
reconciliation this time,

345
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,679
the risk of another collapse remains.

346
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,000
So I was thinking

347
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,080
maybe we could offer

348
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,960
to provide them
with corporate planning services

349
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,480
to minimize future risks.

350
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,440
Well said.

351
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,279
But I think you're improvising.

352
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,480
Great guess.

353
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,639
But you have no proof.

354
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,960
Plus, my intelligence allows me

355
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,559
to spout nonsense

356
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,440
with a straight face.

357
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,559
Why didn't you

358
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,759
dodge earlier?

359
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,840
You just stood there.

360
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,000
How do you plan to repay me,

361
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,120
your life savior?

362
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,960
Life savior?

363
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,919
You got framed
for blocking that minor hit

364
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
and got dragged here

365
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,559
during work hours.

366
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,360
You can question

367
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,039
my professionalism,

368
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,039
but never doubt my capabilities.

369
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,639
Ever watched The Flash?

370
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,039
I moved at lightning speed,

371
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,879
saved you in one second

372
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,279
and stopped all chaos.

373
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,840
With such extensive knowledge,

374
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,440
think about what to tell our superiors.

375
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,320
Why did you push him?

376
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
You majored in law.

377
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,720
Shouldn't you assess risks
before every act?

378
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,799
I knew he was about to charge.

379
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,720
I had to protect you.

380
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,919
Jun An members shouldn't get bullied

381
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,039
by outsiders.

382
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,559
No one gets to bully me.

383
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,240
Your forehead is swollen.

384
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,039
Looks like you grew a horn.

385
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:29,919
Put some ice on it.

386
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,799
No need.

387
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,488

They're asking where we are.

407
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,880
What should I tell them?

408
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,599
Don't reply yet.
Jiang Chen is still in there.

409
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,279
You think

410
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,640
I enjoy tattling, huh?

411
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,039
Jiang Chen is one of us after all.

412
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
That's not what I meant.

413
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,799
But honestly,

414
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,160
something is wrong.

415
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,359
Why is he still not out?

416
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,359
There's surveillance footage.

417
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,200
Nothing complicated.

418
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,119
They should've been done.

419
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,039
Is he actually in trouble?

420
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,799
I'll go check.

421
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:18,519
(Consultation)

422
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,799
Excuse me, officer.

423
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,759
I-I'm Liang Xiaosong's sister.

424
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,720
What happened to him?

425
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,279
Is he okay?

426
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,920
His family member.

427
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
Hello, officer.

428
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,920
We're from Jun An Law Firm.

429
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,279
You're from Jun An?

430
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,119
Zhou Nian, come here.

431
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm at the police station.

432
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,839
Xiaosong got beaten up.

433
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,119
The attacker

434
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,960
claims to be from your firm.

435
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,968
Zhou Nian?

436
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:55,440
Stay calm.

437
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,119
I'm on my way.

438
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,928
It's rush hour. I can't get a ride.

439
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,519
I'll hail a cab on the street.

440
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:00,880
Okay, got it.

441
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,039
Something urgent?

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,720
My brother-in-law is
at the police station.

443
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,880
Ride with me.

444
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,720
It will be faster.

445
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,400
Okay, thanks.

446
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:19,080
(Police)

447
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,891
(Baishuiqiao Police Station)

448
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,640
Thank you.

449
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,279
I have to go.

450
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:28,456
(Police)

451
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:32,456
(Case Handling Area)

452
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:36,759
Are you okay?

453
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,592
Alright.

454
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Since the family came

455
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,720
and you agreed to settle,

456
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,640
this matter

457
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,279
is resolved.

458
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,559
Behave yourselves.

459
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:46,792
Wait.

460
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:47,656
Officer.

461
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,960
What about my medical expenses
and compensation?

462
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,880
Come on, I...

463
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,839
I want him to apologize to my colleague.

464
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
Apologize to her?

465
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,079
Are you serious?

466
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,440
I'm the injured one.

467
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,279
Listen up, pretty boy.

468
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,440
Don't be cocky.
My brother-in-law is here.

469
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,624
Your brother-in-law?

470
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,720
A bunch of junior interns.

471
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,680
Don't get cocky.

472
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
My brother-in-law is your mentor.

473
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,559
I don't want to talk to them.

474
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,960
You have to stand up for me.

475
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,680
That's not how it works.

476
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,920
The surveillance footage showed that

477
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,240
Xiaosong was causing trouble.

478
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,039
He pushed our intern

479
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,312
and threw a bottle at her.

480
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,200
Truth is, he's more at fault.

481
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,599
If she actually

482
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,559
got minor injury certifications,

483
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,200
he might've been detained.

484
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,440
Can your parents

485
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,839
handle the consequences?

486
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,480
He's better off settling.

487
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,279
Zhou Nian, whose side are you on?

488
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,440
You've only been

489
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,319
their mentor for less than a month.

490
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,000
How could you side with them?

491
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,160
What?

492
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,680
You have a crush on that girl?

493
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Of course, I'm on your side.

494
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,039
I became a mentor

495
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
to buy a house and marry you.

496
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,359
If you don't like it,
I'll quit tomorrow.

497
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,472
Okay?

498
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,880
You can't

499
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,920
keep blindly taking Xiaosong's word

500
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,960
for everything.

501
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,359
He was in the wrong today.

502
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,960
I know those kids.

503
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,680
They'll become excellent lawyers.

504
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,160
They wouldn't cause trouble.

505
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,359
Excellent lawyers?

506
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,160
Define excellent lawyers.

507
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,279
Zhou Nian.

508
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,079
Do you count as one?

509
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,960
We've been together
since your master's degree.

510
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,160
For seven years,

511
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,400
I accompanied you through exams

512
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,559
and job applications.

513
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,519
I asked you to buy a house
so that we could live alone.

514
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,559
And it's like we're pressuring you.

515
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:50,888
Zhou Nian,

516
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,599
do you know why we're still not married

517
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,680
after all this time?

518
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,599
Do you know how many times

519
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,200
I've fought with my parents over you?

520
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,559
Do you realize

521
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,160
I don't want to marry you anymore?

522
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,359
Because I know that

523
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,279
even if we're married,

524
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,680
the next decades

525
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,839
will just be more of this.

526
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,680
I'll wait for you to finish work,

527
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
to have days off,

528
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,559
to make more money,

529
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,359
and to have time for me.

530
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,079
My brother got into

531
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,599
some trouble today,

532
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,000
and you sided with outsiders.

533
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:21,599
Zhou Nian,

534
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
I should've known seven years ago

535
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,559
that you'd never be there for me.

536
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,240
Mr. Zhou.

537
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,240
You left your phone in my car.

538
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,599
Zhou Nian.

539
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,119
I think we're done.

540
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:57,480
(Police)

541
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,120
Wait.

542
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,039
I'm sorry.

543
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,799
Did I come at a bad time?

544
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,759
Come on. Let's explain to her.

545
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,016
Don't bother.

546
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,839
I always thought

547
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,200
I had to marry her because

548
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,880
I'd held her back for so long.

549
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,839
But now I realize that marriage alone

550
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,119
isn't what she wants.

551
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:29,960
Well,

552
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,839
I can finally relax now.

553
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,640
Sorry. Jiang Chen
and the others are still inside.

554
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,599
Say goodbye for me.

555
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,856
They've settled.

556
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,359
I'm off.

557
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,559
Li Ke has already gone home.

558
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,680
Why are you following me?

559
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,799
I'm just on my way home.

560
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,359
That's all.

561
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,319
Besides, I'm making sure

562
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,079
that you don't

563
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,880
end up fighting

564
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,799
with someone on the way.

565
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,200
Don't be silly.

566
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm not leaping from Law on Security
Administration Punishments

567
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,240
straight to the Criminal Law.

568
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,680
Am I capable of that?

569
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,039
I'm not stupid.

570
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,880
And I know

571
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,119
we should accept others' care.

572
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,240
And to ask for help when needed

573
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
is an important skill too.

574
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,839
Being a lawyer felt so tough today.

575
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,680
Zhou Nian defended us

576
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,640
and lost his girlfriend

577
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,440
of seven years.

578
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,559
I'm starting to get swayed.

579
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,640
Lawyers are stressed
especially in the early years.

580
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,799
It's hard to balance work and family.

581
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,720
Then their love wears off

582
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,359
when they finally
get a break from the job.

583
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,759
So why pursue this job?

584
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,000
When I was young,

585
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,480
my parents fought every day.

586
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,680
I'd hide in my room reading comics

587
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,400
where the superheroes

588
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,319
had even harder lives than mine.

589
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,880
Many didn't have both parents

590
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,559
but still became incredible.

591
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,839
Plus, I want to see whether I could

592
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,480
be a good lawyer

593
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,359
while having a nice relationship.

594
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,279
Jiang Chen.

595
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,079
Thanks for standing up for me today.

596
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,240
All these years,

597
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,440
you're the first to stand up for me.

598
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,400
After my dad passed,

599
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,640
I had to face every family crisis alone.

600
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,359
Since high school, I've learned

601
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,079
that I must

602
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,319
protect my mom to let my dad

603
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,559
rest in peace.

604
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,480
This is

605
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,880
the first time someone

606
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,279
has stood up for me after my dad died.

607
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
It's my pleasure

608
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,359
to stand up for you.

609
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,039
That sounded almost like

610
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,400
a confession.

611
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,160
No, no.

612
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,519
You're my friend, my buddy.

613
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,000
Don't push your luck here.

614
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,839
Exactly.

615
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,119
I don't want to

616
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,720
compete with you by crushing

617
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,440
your morale.

618
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,720
I want a real victory.

619
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,279
I'm almost home.

620
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:52,799
Go home.

621
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,799
Review the case files.

622
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,160
Get the case analysis done.

623
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,079
Otherwise, beating you
won't be exciting.

624
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,440
Fine, Ren Jiatong.

625
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,319
I'm impressed.

626
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
"Won't be exciting"? Alright.

627
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,279
Courtroom debater.

628
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:08,936
Alright.

629
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,024
Bye.

630
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:14,880
Ren Jiatong.

631
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,920
Talk things through with Guo Xiaoyu.

632
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,119
Don't lose your friend

633
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,160
to this job.

634
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,880
Are you going to keep ignoring me?

635
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,079
It was clearly your mistake.

636
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,160
So don't blame me.

637
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,360
What...

638
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,960
What happened to you?

639
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,319
Jiang Chen said that

640
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,640
you ran into trouble.

641
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
How did you get hurt?

642
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,880
Got it checked?

643
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,960
Will it leave a scar?

644
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,680
Let me have some water

645
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,240
before your interrogation, okay?

646
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
You just wouldn't listen to me.

647
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,319
See, now you're

648
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,559
caught in the middle.

649
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,720
Look up.

650
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,839
What's this?

651
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,880
Marinated pork belly.

652
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,680
I already iced it, thanks.

653
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,559
Opposing Counsel.

654
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,160
Is it my turn to speak now?

655
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,319
Knock it off.

656
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,359
Don't you want to know

657
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,160
why I insisted on taking this case?

658
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,319
To win, obviously.

659
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,119
Not entirely.

660
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,160
It's also for us.

661
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,039
We both paid
six months' rent to Warm Nest.

662
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,160
That's not a small amount of money.

663
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,359
All those victims must be furious

664
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,279
with Warm Nest now.

665
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,039
Why are you helping Warm Nest?

666
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,319
Without a settlement,

667
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,359
we'll never get our money back.

668
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,799
Our job as lawyers is to solve problems.

669
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,279
If both parties compromise

670
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,640
on something reasonable,

671
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,400
then the issue is resolved.

672
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,559
If we can help

673
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,519
Warm Nest get through this

674
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,920
and assist the victims

675
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,440
in recovering some of their losses,

676
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,759
why wouldn't we do it?

677
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,880
That makes sense in theory,

678
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,279
but it's not that easy.

679
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,559
Besides, our firm represents Warm Nest.

680
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,119
Of course, we will

681
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,160
prioritize Warm Nest's interests.

682
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,839
Nobody will care about the tenants.

683
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,640
Your idol Mr. Song once said

684
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,200
that negotiations aren't zero-sum

685
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,640
in the adult world.

686
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,279
The ultimate goal is to make deals

687
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,960
where both sides get what they need.

688
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,039
So why can't we create a win-win

689
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,920
or even triple-win scenario?

690
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,000
The best case is that everyone's happy.

691
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,599
Even the worst case

692
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,440
is better than the current situation.

693
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,519
At least, I would have

694
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,599
fought for my rights.

695
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,720
I think I know how to approach

696
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,920
this assessment now.

697
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,759
Just like that?

698
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,359
You're staying?

699
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,680
Of course, I'm staying.

700
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,319
I haven't shown my talents yet.

701
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,200
My idol also said

702
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,000
that you must take initiative

703
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,200
in the adult world.

704
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,359
If you dislike others' solutions,

705
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,279
present your own alternatives.

706
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,279
For example,

707
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,880
I'll take the initiative to hug you now.

708
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,160
Enough.

709
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,920
How old are you?

710
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:16,520
(Unethical lawyer assaulted me.
So hard to protect my rights legally.)

711
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,448
(@Jun An Law Firm, @Warm Nest)

712
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:18,720
(It's him, right?)

713
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,272
Oh no.

714
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,599
Bad news.

715
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
I figured out

716
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,680
why Liang Xiaosong went crazy

717
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,960
and slandered us on Weibo.

718
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,559
Come on, spit it out.

719
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,759
Is it because

720
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,640
Mr. Zhou defended me
at the police station?

721
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,240
Is it because his fiancée got jealous

722
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,240
and sought revenge?

723
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,359
No, our future sister-in-law is nice.

724
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,240
They just broke up.

725
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,480
She's heartbroken.

726
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,040
Their seven-year relationship

727
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,880
was lost to this
one-month apprenticeship.

728
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,839
She must have

729
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,720
cried all night.

730
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,640
Her brother must have felt bad for her,

731
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,039
thinking that Jun An
ganged up against her.

732
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,920
So he wanted to escalate it

733
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,920
to mess with us.

734
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,960
I actually feel bad for Mr. Zhou.

735
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,519
Weren't they together for ages?

736
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,480
I heard they were getting married soon.

737
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,599
But I recently did a tarot for Mr. Zhou.

738
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,400
His love prospects look good this year.

739
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,480
I bet they won't really break up.

740
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,559
If he just apologizes and comforts her,

741
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,200
they'll be fine.

742
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,880
I don't think he is very skilled at

743
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,799
comforting her.

744
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,359
Should we help him out?

745
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:28,319
Alright.

746
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,640
My knowledge of
"how to win back your wife"

747
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,759
can finally be put to good use.

748
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,519
We'll split into two groups.

749
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,400
We girls will...

750
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,519
No, you girls

751
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,680
will team up

752
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,480
and give Mr. Zhou a preview

753
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,039
of how to win back his wife.

754
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,000
Alright?

755
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,880
Jiang Chen, let's find
Liang Xiaosong at noon.

756
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,680
You'll apologize to him.

757
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,240
While the post hasn't

758
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,519
attracted much attention,

759
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:49,799
we'll ask him to

760
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,559
delete the post.

761
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,559
And it's over.

762
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,000
Good idea.

763
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,880
I don't want Mr. Zhou to break up

764
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,880
with his girlfriend.

765
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,200
But I won't apologize.

766
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,279
The one at fault is not me,

767
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,799
but Liang Xiaosong.

768
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,759
Jiang Chen.

769
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,960
Mr. Zhou's been good to us, right?

770
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,720
Apologizing won't kill you.

771
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,519
And I said I'll go with you.

772
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,079
We'll record the whole thing.

773
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,960
If they try

774
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,160
to pull any shady moves,

775
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,880
we'll be prepared.

776
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,160
He's right, Jiang Chen.

777
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,119
Apologizing doesn't seem like

778
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,440
a matter of principle here.

779
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,319
Didn't you see

780
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,160
the comments under that Weibo post?

781
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,400
The most-liked

782
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,839
was your photo and profile.

783
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,559
Aren't you worried?

784
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480
I've preserved the post as evidence.

785
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,759
I can pursue

786
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,559
legal action against him anytime.

787
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,920
And you got the point.

788
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,599
This is about principles.

789
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,920
I won't

790
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,559
apologize for something

791
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,599
I didn't do wrong.

792
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,319
If I abandoned this principle,

793
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,359
I wouldn't be here,

794
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,039
trying to be a lawyer.

795
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:14,952
(Accumulated Scores)

796
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,000
Jiang Chen.

797
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,440
You have the highest score among us.

798
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,760
What if you lose points because of this?

799
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,440
All your previous efforts would be...

800
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,056
Mr. Zhuang.

801
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,599
How should we handle

802
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,679
Jiang Chen's case?

803
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,079
First,

804
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,000
he caused trouble during work hours.

805
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,159
Second, this matter

806
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,679
was leaked online.

807
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,519
This reflects very poorly on us.

808
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:45,679
Besides,

809
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,719
if we don't discipline him,

810
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,079
others might think

811
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,599
Jun An lacks fairness.

812
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,440
What if similar incidents occur?

813
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,920
We won't be able to do our jobs.

814
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:54,760
Yeah.

815
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,920
I was on the phone

816
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,256
(Zhang Kai, 39, Business Development Director)
with Warm Nest's legal director

817
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:58,679
for 30 minutes.

818
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,559
He said that

819
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,639
if we don't handle this seriously,

820
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,480
he'd file a complaint
with the bar association.

821
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,472
Mr. Zhuang,

822
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,039
these kids are selected

823
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,320
through our high-profile

824
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,840
Talent Hunt Program.

825
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,679
What if we suppress this

826
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,480
and the other clients

827
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,679
have doubts about it?

828
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,544
Ms. Bai.

829
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,639
Your thoughts?

830
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,639
I'll move up

831
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,039
the Warm Nest meeting.

832
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,119
About those "what if" worries

833
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,199
and fears you talked about,

834
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,960
when I first joined Jun An,

835
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,239
my mentor told me that

836
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,320
anyone overusing this phrase

837
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,599
needs to reflect on their competence.

838
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
If I recall correctly,

839
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,079
they are just interns,

840
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,039
not trainee lawyers.

841
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
The bar association

842
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,039
doesn't govern interns.

843
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:46,888
Right, Mr. Zhang?

844
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:50,760
Come in.

845
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,320
Mr. Zhuang, sorry

846
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,239
for the interruption.

847
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,400
Mr. Liu from Warm Nest

848
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,608
and their legal director came.

849
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,559
They came right after the phone call.

850
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,599
To corner us?

851
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,184
Okay.

852
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:02,960
I see.

853
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:04,920
I'll go with you.

854
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:10,760
(New email
The deadline has been advanced.)

855
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,880
(Interns, your mentors decided...)

856
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,960
There's a new email.

857
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh my god.

858
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,920
The deadline was moved up
to 10:00 PM tonight.

859
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,280
No extensions.

860
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,119
Why?

861
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,679
The files are still encrypted.

862
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,239
I haven't even sorted them out.

863
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,000
Help. I'm about to have a heart attack.

864
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,840
Got the email, huh?

865
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,960
Any questions?

866
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,976
Mr. Zhou.

867
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,000
Why was the deadline

868
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,239
pushed up by a full day?

869
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,960
Will this count for points?

870
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:40,840
Yes.

871
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,400
The criteria remain the same.

872
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,000
As long as you perform well

873
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:44,960
in this task,

874
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,360
you might get bonus points.

875
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,480
And the deadline

876
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,119
was moved up

877
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,119
because our meeting
was rescheduled earlier.

878
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,239
The mentoring lawyers decided

879
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,480
to take the best proposal drafter
to the meeting.

880
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,079
This is a great opportunity.

881
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,559
Mr. Zhou, with such tight deadlines,

882
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,000
can we form teams?

883
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,280
Excellent question.

884
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,679
You can form teams,

885
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,039
so there's competition

886
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,760
both inter-group

887
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,639
and intra-group.

888
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,639
So that means

889
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,719
I need both my group to win

890
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,599
and my performance to be top in my group

891
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,880
for high scores.

892
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,912
Exactly.

893
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
Don't you want to work with top lawyers?

894
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,360
Rare chance.

895
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,159
Show your best moves now.

896
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,016
Jiang Chen.

897
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,616
Come here.

898
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:38,760
(Story 1
Jiang Chen vs. Ren Jiatong)

899
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,320
Ms. Bai, take a look.

900
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
Go home and rest.

901
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You've been traveling.

902
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,960
Your neck is hurting.

903
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,760
And you moved up the meeting

904
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,159
because of Jiang Chen,

905
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,119
working through the weekend.

906
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,119
This will help you.

907
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,519
No need, I'm fine.

908
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,160
Come in.

909
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,920
Ms. Bai.

910
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:07,816
Ms. Tian.

911
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,079
I'm off.

912
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,136
Ms. Bai.

913
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,000
Mr. Zhou said I might get penalized

914
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,079
because of the incident.

915
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,679
Is that true?

916
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,599
Got a problem?

917
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,119
Yes.

918
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,239
The police determined that I bear

919
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,360
no legal responsibility.

920
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,519
Please give me

921
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,840
a reasonable explanation.

922
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,519
You didn't break any laws,

923
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,400
but it's against protocol

924
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,320
for you to leave

925
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,400
without informing
or getting approval from

926
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,119
any superior

927
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:34,840
during work hours.

928
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,119
As someone aspiring to be a lawyer,

929
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,719
you went to our client's headquarters

930
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,719
and got into trouble.

931
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,280
You went to the police,

932
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,599
and got posted online,

933
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,679
causing negative publicity

934
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,079
for both Warm Nest and Jun An.

935
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,000
That's improper.

936
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,440
Besides, your mistake

937
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,599
forced all those working on this project

938
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,519
to reschedule meetings

939
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,599
sooner than planned,

940
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,199
increasing our workloads.

941
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
The deadline was moved up

942
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,639
for all your peers

943
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,039
at the Talent Hunt Program

944
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,239
because of you.

945
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,639
Aren't these reasons enough?

946
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:10,119
Jiang Chen, do you really
want to be a lawyer?

947
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,336
Of course.

948
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,519
My senior once told me

949
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,400
that lawyers

950
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,320
are ultimately
part of the service industry.

951
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,239
Therefore, we must strive to maximize

952
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,079
our clients' interests.

953
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,559
Do you agree with this?

954
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,000
Yes, I do.

955
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,280
Okay.

956
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,840
Now our client Warm Nest

957
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,360
believes you made a mistake,

958
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,440
wants you to apologize,

959
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:32,239
and resolve the issue promptly.

960
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:32,960
What will you do?

961
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,840
But the problem is,

962
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,559
my photos were posted online

963
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,039
with false accusations.

964
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,519
Yet I should apologize?

965
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Ms. Bai, are you saying

966
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,199
that I should sacrifice my rights

967
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,320
for my clients?

968
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,519
That's your problem.

969
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,480
Find your own answers.

970
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,039
But first, don't get eliminated.

971
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,199
I'm only responsible for assessing you.

972
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,559
If you want to stay,

973
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,679
prove your worth through real skills

974
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,800
and regain your lost points.

975
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,079
Our law firm

976
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,199
doesn't exist to hear
the lawyers' complaints.

977
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,760
We exist to help clients

978
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,840
solve their problems.

979
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,559
So you've got principles.

980
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
You're in trouble?

981
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,039
Impressive.

982
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,079
You saw through me.

983
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,360
Keep it a secret.

984
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,519
After talking with Ms. Bai,

985
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,840
you've been off all morning.

986
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,400
What happened?

987
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,280
Since when do you care?

988
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,000
Don't get me wrong. I don't care.

989
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,639
I saw Warm Nest's Mr. Liu
meeting with Mr. Zhuang.

990
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:49,880
Is it about this?

991
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,344
Let's talk outside.

992
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,119
Listen to Li Ke.

993
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,320
Don't delay this.

994
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,239
Solve this problem now.

995
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,480
I thought you were different.

996
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,920
But you're pressuring me too.

997
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,039
Jiang Chen.

998
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,679
This Weibo post
contains your information.

999
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,519
It also tags Jun An and Warm Nest.

1000
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,039
It's no longer about who's right

1001
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:20,840
or wrong.

1002
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,519
Our job as lawyers is to solve problems.

1003
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,079
You shouldn't create issues

1004
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,840
just to prove you're right.

1005
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,320
I don't mean to create issues.

1006
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,480
I want to resolve this, too.

1007
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,199
Li Ke makes valid points.

1008
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,159
I shouldn't let my principles

1009
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,440
ruin Mr. Zhou's engagement.

1010
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,639
So I'll compensate.

1011
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,119
I'll pay no matter

1012
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,199
how much he demands.

1013
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:39,760
I accept that.

1014
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,320
But I can't apologize.

1015
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,960
Got it?

1016
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:42,960
What should I say?

1017
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,320
Sorry you tried to assault my colleague.

1018
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,039
I apologize.

1019
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,800
Sorry you twisted the truth.

1020
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,424
I apologize.

1021
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:49,880
Sorry you posted slanderous posts.

1022
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,519
I apologize.

1023
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,840
It's ridiculous, you know?

1024
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,320
I can't convince myself to do this.

1025
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,639
Do you want to stay?

1026
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,519
The Weibo comments haven't exploded yet.

1027
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,039
We can stop this.

1028
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,760
Apologize

1029
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,800
and he might delete it.

1030
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
Then it's settled.

1031
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,719
If it escalates and ruins

1032
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,119
Warm Nest's reputation,

1033
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,199
they'll come after you.

1034
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,039
What then?

1035
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,440
No matter how well Jun An treats us,

1036
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,599
it's still a law firm.

1037
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:12,599
With such fierce competition,

1038
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,559
when choosing between

1039
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:15,559
a major client
and a Talent Hunt Program intern,

1040
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,840
are you sure Jun An will side with you?

1041
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,119
Ms. Bai just asked me the same question.

1042
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,559
What did you say?

1043
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:24,920
Nothing.

1044
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,800
I have no answer.

1045
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,559
All I know is,

1046
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,400
I can't betray my intention
of studying law.

1047
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,760
Right is right.

1048
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,039
Wrong is wrong.

1049
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,039
I didn't study law to learn

1050
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:35,559
how to twist right into wrong.

1051
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,760
What's so funny?

1052
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,519
Am I being naive?

1053
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,840
Not at all.

1054
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,639
It's not funny.

1055
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,000
You're precious.

1056
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,320
Idealism is rare.

1057
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,199
So it's valuable.

1058
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,760
But if this world

1059
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,480
lacks idealists like you,

1060
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,119
what's the point?

1061
00:43:15,515 --> 00:43:17,160
(Ethical dilemmas:
principles vs. client/firm interests)

1062
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,696
(Answer: Legal practitioners
must protect clients')

1063
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,424
(legitimate rights
and interests, and social justice.)

1064
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:21,800
(Meanwhile, lawyers have
diligence obligations to their firms.)

1065
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,432
(Lawyers often face conflicts
between personal principles)

1066
00:43:23,432 --> 00:43:24,776
(and client demands
and the law firm's interests.)

1067
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:26,216
(They must seek alternative solutions)

1068
00:43:26,216 --> 00:43:27,656
(through rule comprehension
and risk assessment.)
