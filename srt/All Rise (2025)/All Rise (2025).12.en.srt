We haven't named it yet.

31

Why don't you give it a name?

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,681
How about Chen?

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,320
Chen.

I don't like dogs.

It doesn't even move. So calm.

38

It's so sweet.

39

57

either of you.

58
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,920
He didn't pressure me.

59
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,880
He's not some tycoon in the novel.

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,121
He can't tell me what to do.

61
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,280
He sent someone to me because

62
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,080
he cared about you.

so much trouble at work.

right from wrong?

69
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,320
No, she did it because
she's Liang Xiaosong's sister.

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,400
She was trying her best to protect

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,001
her brother.

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,064

No matter what he does,

74
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:40,481
he's trying to protect you.

75
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:42,760
I don't know

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,960
what your family is like.

77
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,001
Your brother's only four or five years

78
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,801
older than me,

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
and he's carried Xingke alone for years.

80
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,640
Business isn't easy now.

81
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,001
You get to

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,440
chase your dreams

83
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,400
without worries at Jun An.

84
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,960
But him?

85
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,241
He might never even get a choice.

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,400
Doesn't he have a dream?

87
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,080
Most of our generation

88
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:11,681
are only children.

89
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:13,161
I envy those of you

90
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,760
with siblings.

91
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,320
After all, I wish someone

92
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,721
could share my burdens too.

93
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:18,536
Right?

94
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,361
So forget about the ride.

95
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:21,640
Go home and talk

96
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:22,801
to your brother,

97
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,944
okay?

98
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:26,441
Well.

99
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,681
It's karma for bullying me all the time.

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,640
Caught a cold, huh?

101
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,840
There's a reason for this.

102
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:57,921
Reflect on it.

103
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:01,241
Ask the housekeeper to cook for you

104
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,520
if you're hungry.

105
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm too tired to argue.

106
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,280
My head's pounding from meetings.

107
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,681
All you do is work

108
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:11,921
and have meetings.

109
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,361
What's the point?

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,241
This is life,

111
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:19,241
even if it's pointless.

112
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:23,241
Will you attend the meetings for me?

113
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:24,121
No way.

114
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,888
Yan Da.

115
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,080
If you hadn't become Xingke's boss,

116
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,241
what'd you do?

117
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,200
What are you plotting?

118
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:40,400
Just chitchatting.

119
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,001
How old were you when you joined Xingke?

120
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,161
Twenty-eight.

121
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,481
You were a freshman.

122
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,721
I got into

123
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,121
a sociology PhD program in the UK.

124
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:57,960
I meant to go abroad with you,

125
00:06:58,721 --> 00:06:59,960
but then Dad fell ill,

126
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:02,440
so I didn't go.

127
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,041
Doesn't matter.

128
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,241
I wouldn't have become
some great scholar anyway.

129
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:11,440
Someone

130
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,601
in the family
had to shoulder the burdens.

131
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,520
That must have been

132
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,801
really tough for you.

133
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,456
I hate it when you interfere in my life.

134
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,561
But someone said you were protecting me.

135
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,440
Actually, I know

136
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:31,440
you've been making decisions

137
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,801
for me to protect me.

138
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,561
I'll forget about what happened today.

139
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:38,921
But

140
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:40,520
promise me.

141
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Ask me for help if anything happens

142
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,361
at home

143
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,960
or in our company.

144
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,241
You might look down on law graduates,

145
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,880
but I'm your sister.

146
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,640
I'm also a Yan.

147
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,561
I'm not useless.

148
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:53,481
I'm pretty capable.

149
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,400
Fei.

150
00:07:58,721 --> 00:07:59,440
What happened?

151
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:03,400
You don't sound

152
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,880
like yourself.

153
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,561
I'm getting deeply moved.

154
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,440
Should I burst into tears

155
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,561
right now?

156
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,960
Have you lost it?

157
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:20,280
You just can't take sincere words.

158
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,001
Are you hungry?

159
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,200
No.

160
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,481
"I don't like dogs."

161
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,280
You almost took Sweetie home.

162
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Actually, I had a dog when I was young.

163
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,920
But after my parents divorced,

164
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,321
my dad gave it away.

165
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,241
I remember how heartbroken I was.

166
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:51,400
I cried so much.

167
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,601
I kept begging him,
"Don't send Sweetie away.

168
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,601
Don't send Sweetie away."

169
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
He wouldn't listen.

170
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,001
I don't know where he sent it.

171
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,321
It was also called Sweetie?

172
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,760
I named it randomly. What a coincidence.

173
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:09,680
After that,

174
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,001
I've developed

175
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:12,400
PTSD

176
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,441
with dogs.

177
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,001
Even at that moment,

178
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:17,800
my dad made sure

179
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,721
to lecture me.

180
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:21,400
"If you can't take care of someone,

181
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
don't selfishly

182
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,121
keep them around.

183
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,520
You want to look after Sweetie? Fine.

184
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,001
Gain power first."

185
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:30,760
Well said.

186
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,481
As expected of lawyer Jiang Ruocheng.

187
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:36,560
You know how old I was?

188
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,321
How could I gain power?

189
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:41,760
A decade later,

190
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,601
you're rubbing salt in my wounds here.

191
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,081
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,601
You didn't join
your dad's law firm because

193
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:51,201
you disagreed with his principles?

194
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:53,520
Kind of.

195
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,040
He doesn't

196
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,920
think much of me, saying that

197
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,280
I'm not cut out to be a lawyer.

198
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,441
That only makes me

199
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,841
determined to prove

200
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,361
that I could study,

201
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,721
get into Haryald,

202
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:07,841
and stay at Jun An.

203
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,001
I could even...

204
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,241
What?

205
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:14,880
Outdo him?

206
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:16,800
Defeat him?

207
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,520
Fishing for information?

208
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,400
Why am I the only one talking?

209
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,960
What about you?

210
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:23,361
Me?

211
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,721
Are you a child?

212
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:35,001
Want to try?

213
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,008
No.

214
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,280
It's stress-relieving.

215
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:37,920
No.

216
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,080
Seriously.

217
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,560
I said no. I refused.

218
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:45,201
Just try it.

(Zhou Nian: Made peace with him?
He won't interfere anymore?)

239
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:56,872
(Yan Fei: Not really. It's just...
Things are fine.)

Jiatong, you're back?

246
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:24,640
Have you eaten?

247
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:26,560
Yeah.

248
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,880
Something amazing happened.

249
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:30,961
You know?

250
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,640
I always thought
I had great people skills.

251
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,920
Being likable is what I've excelled at

252
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,961
for twenty whole years.

253
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:38,601
But today I met this lady,

254
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,121
the one Yan Fei pissed off.

255
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,121
The residents' committee staff

256
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:44,880
said her husband
got injured during his commute.

257
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,040
I was about to raise funds for her.

258
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:48,920
But Mr. Zhou told me

259
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,560
that we must treat

260
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,520
the clients

261
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,481
who are relatively disadvantaged

262
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,201
with empathy,

263
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,680
but not sympathy.

264
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,241
I shouldn't judge others from

265
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,520
a privileged standpoint.

266
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:00,880
That's disrespectful.

267
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,280
Guo Xiaoyu, you've really changed.

268
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,081
You used to nag me

269
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,721
about Zhubao all day.

270
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,201
Now all you talk about is work.

271
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,672
Really?

272
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:22,760
Maybe it's because

273
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,441
things are over between us.

274
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,800
Forget it.

275
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:31,121
Work keeps me busy.

276
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,560
But at night,

277
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:36,280
I feel completely hollowed out inside.

278
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,728
Don't even wanna watch shows.

279
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,361
Did he contact you?

280
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,241
But I think he will.

281
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,800
Our last fight

282
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,040
lasted even longer than this.

283
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:55,001
It's just about who caves in first.

284
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,640
It's a mind game right now.

285
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,280
Whoever surrenders first
will have to submit to the other.

286
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,721
So I can't back down.

287
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,760
Impressive, Xiaoyu.

288
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,520
You've got so many strategies.

289
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,232
Jiatong.

290
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,001
I've never heard you mention any guys

291
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,121
or ex-boyfriends.

292
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,680
Stop being so mysterious.

293
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,441
What's your type?

294
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:17,841
Got a photo?

295
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:18,680
Show me.

296
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:24,361
No.

297
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:27,432
I've always been solo.

298
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,481
I'm aiming for asexual reproduction,

299
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:30,920
following the paramecium model.

300
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:32,280
Knock it off.

301
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,632
Be honest.

302
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,001
Is there anyone

303
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,640
around us that you're into?

304
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,121
Wang Lu is thoughtful and careful.

305
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:45,441
Li Ke is handsome and good with people.

306
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,400
Mr. Zhou is responsible.

307
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,680
Jiang Chen is...

308
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,481
Arrogant.

309
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,880
Full of himself.

310
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:52,961
Self-righteous.

311
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:55,241
Not really. I think he's quite handsome.

312
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,441
He's got something
to back up that ego, okay?

313
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,481
Handsome?

314
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:04,880
I don't think so.

315
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:11,961
This is fishy.

316
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Really fishy.

317
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,160
Come clean.

318
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:19,601
There's nothing.

319
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,841
There's nothing between us.

320
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:23,121
We're extremely incompatible.

321
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,241
To put it in the terms you know,

322
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:25,864
it's like

323
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
"different styles,"

324
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:28,201
"incompatible

325
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:30,001
zodiac signs," and "mismatched views."

326
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:33,280
You can't stop talking

327
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,121
when I mention Jiang Chen.

328
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:36,601
You think I'll believe you?

329
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:37,736
Why are you so nosy?

330
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,321
Are you

331
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:39,081
eating or not?

332
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,321
Yeah, I'm eating.

333
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,472
Morning, Ms. Tian.

334
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,248
I've reviewed the case you and Ms. Bai

335
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:16,081
posted in the lawyer pool yesterday.

336
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:17,520
Is there any chance...

337
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Just like you,

338
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:24,961
they texted Ms. Bai and me.

339
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:27,280
I'd wait for you at the office.

340
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:30,560
But you camped at the reception
to snatch the case.

341
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
You three are seriously competitive.

342
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,201
You're in charge of this case.

343
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,961
We'll absolutely give it our all.

344
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:40,640
You punk.

345
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,920
I like what you said.

346
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,400
Ms. Tian.

347
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:45,400
Can we compete for this opportunity?

348
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:47,680
I understand the enthusiasm.

349
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:49,241
Alright.

350
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,160
I'll keep it brief.

351
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:52,441
Our client

352
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:53,481
filed a lawsuit

353
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,121
as plaintiff in Beijing

354
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,160
based on the defendant's

355
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,841
registered address.

356
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,160
But the defendant claims

357
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,560
that their site isn't
within Beijing's jurisdiction.

358
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,800
They merely rented an office there

359
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:06,080
with no actual staff.

360
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,001
Therefore, the defendant

361
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,360
raised jurisdiction objection.

362
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:11,560
Currently, they intend to have this case

363
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,681
transferred to Shenzhen.

364
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,401
We've sent interns to investigate

365
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,881
their office in Beijing.

366
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,600
Their statement is accurate.

367
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,080
Meanwhile, we also asked

368
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,520
our colleagues in Shenzhen

369
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,800
to check their offices there.

370
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,080
Those were also just a few offices,

371
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,520
which couldn't be their primary base.

372
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,320
So now, I need you

373
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,120
to investigate and verify the details

374
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:37,481
on their actual place of business

375
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,800
to see if we can
find something more solid

376
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
to counter their argument.

377
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,320
So? Is everything clear?

378
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,360
All clear.

379
00:17:50,376 --> 00:17:53,384
(Jurisdictional Objection)

380
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:57,800
(An objection raised when a party
believes the court lacks jurisdiction.)

381
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:14,344
(Zhubao: Sep 5th.
Dinner with colleagues.)

382
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:14,952
(Aug 17th. So beautiful.)

383
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:15,656
(Jul 9th. Staying up
watching sports together.)

384
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:16,488
(Jun 7th)

385
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:22,568
(The sunshine that day
was as lovely as you.)

386
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:24,840
(Zhubao Loves Xiaoyu)

387
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,464
(Who brings a laptop to dinner?)

388
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:29,736
(No overtime today.)

389
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,921
(141 following)
141.

390
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,001
(His friend)
He followed someone else?

391
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:40,680
(Quiet Woods)

392
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,288
(Nice weather.)

393
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,152
(Stunning sunset.)

394
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:53,961
You think that Zhu Zhisheng

395
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,760
is cheating?

396
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,120
He won't answer calls

397
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,001
or messages.

398
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,401
I've DMed him on Weibo,

399
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,800
Douyin, and RedNote.

400
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,441
Still no response.

401
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,001
This was impossible before.

402
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,808
Yeah.

403
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,840
I must go back to Hangzhou

404
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,881
and get the full story.

405
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:20,320
Maybe you should think twice.

406
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,441
I'm just so lost right now.

407
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,961
You're accusing him of cheating based on

408
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,280
a pair of shoes in a photo.

409
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
That's a severe lack of evidence.

410
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,360
But in relationships,

411
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,560
a woman's intuition beats evidence

412
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,481
every time.

413
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,520
We've never gone this long
without talking.

414
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,201
Jiatong.

415
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,681
Was it a mistake for me

416
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:47,800
to come to Beijing

417
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,840
and join Jun An?

418
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
If he's not cheating,

419
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,001
your baseless suspicion

420
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,721
will only damage your relationship.

421
00:19:57,641 --> 00:19:59,401
But if he cheated on you

422
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:01,800
so shortly after you came to Beijing,

423
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,721
it only shows that he's unreliable

424
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,840
and wrong for you.

425
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,001
Say bye to him.

426
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,681
If you want to go back,

427
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:19,280
I'll go with you this weekend.

428
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,641
But for now,

429
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,040
get changed, take a shower,

430
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,921
and get some sleep.

431
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:26,641
He might answer your call tomorrow.

432
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:28,600
It could be a misunderstanding.

433
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,161
It's entirely possible.

434
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,481
You're right.

435
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:36,881
I'm staying.

436
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,241
I've always been in charge

437
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,360
of our relationship.

438
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,320
My word is the supreme law

439
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,641
over his.

440
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:45,520
I trust Zhubao.

441
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:46,800
He listens to me.

442
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,161
He'd never hurt me.

443
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:50,641
I must've overreacted.

444
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,681
Go to bed.

445
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,681
Feel free to knock on my door anytime.

446
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:04,681
Jiatong.

447
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:10,040
Do we have to choose

448
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,921
between career and love once we grow up?

449
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,080
If we can't achieve a balance,

450
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:20,441
maybe so.

451
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,441
What would you

452
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,721
choose then?

453
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,120
Ren Jiatong.

454
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,800
I haven't thought about it.

455
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:53,481
Xiaoyu.

456
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:56,560
Are you sure you're okay?

457
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,201
I'm totally fine.

458
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:00,320
Don't worry. See you tomorrow.

459
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:37,992
(Jiang Chen: Asleep?)

460
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:42,760
(Ren Jiatong: Not yet. Why?)

461
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,464
Hello.

462
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,080
It's nothing urgent.

463
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,760
I just

464
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,520
saw Guo Xiaoyu's new WeChat post.

465
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,560
Something felt off.

466
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,201
(Guo Xiaoyu: I wish everything
around me could stay this way.)

467
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:00,808
What is it?

468
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:04,241
It's fine.

469
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
You or Guo Xiaoyu?

470
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,401
We're both fine.

471
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,280
You don't have to

472
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
build walls around yourself.

473
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:19,040
Do I do that?

474
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,080
Yes, you do.

475
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,320
You don't let anyone get close

476
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,481
and guard against all.

477
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,001
Sometimes you should

478
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,520
share your thoughts with people.

479
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,320
It's not a big deal.

480
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,800
It's okay to trust others.

481
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,401
That doesn't always make you vulnerable.

482
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,241
It might be because

483
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,641
I've seen people's trust
get betrayed before.

484
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,040
But I'm not as extreme as you claim.

485
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,280
Having lived with you for so long,

486
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,600
Guo Xiaoyu finally managed to

487
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,800
breach your defenses.

488
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,001
That's something.

489
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:56,280
Are you calling at this hour
just to lecture me?

490
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
I'm just worried about you.

491
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,921
She's your only friend at Jun An.

492
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,881
Don't mess this up.

493
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,721
Her post wasn't about me.

494
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,120
Wait.

495
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Aren't we friends?

496
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:14,600
No.

497
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:16,721
We're

498
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,896
rivals.

499
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,401
Because you're drawn to
those who could defeat you.

500
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,192
(Melatonin)

501
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,441
Stop overthinking.

502
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:35,760
Xiaoyu.

503
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:37,760
Get up.

504
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:38,921
You'll be late.

505
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:47,641
Xiaoyu.

506
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:02,760
Xiaoyu, where are you?

507
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,161
Hello, Xiaoyu.

508
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,721
Jiatong, I'm back in Hangzhou.

509
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,161
Did you take leave?

510
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,760
Don't worry. I messaged

511
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,280
Mr. Zhou for sick leave.

512
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,441
But I didn't mention Hangzhou.

513
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:23,320
Jiatong,

514
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:25,881
I'm not acting impulsively.

515
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:28,001
I listened to you and went to bed.

516
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,681
And I took melatonin pills,

517
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,481
but still couldn't sleep.

518
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:32,921
I lay wide awake,

519
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:34,641
staring at the ceiling all night,

520
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,921
thinking about Zhubao.

521
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:39,001
I wanted to see him immediately.

522
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,001
You know?

523
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,201
My heart started racing

524
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:43,280
the moment I got off the plane.

525
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,201
My hands were shaking.

526
00:26:44,441 --> 00:26:45,760
My instincts are never wrong.

527
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:47,760
Do you think he's in trouble,

528
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,481
Jiatong?

529
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,120
Don't panic.

530
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:50,560
Since you're there,

531
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,688
be it good or bad,

532
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:53,280
talk it through.

533
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,921
I'll say you have
something to attend to.

534
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,800
Come back as soon as you're done.

535
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,961
Don't sacrifice your future for this.

536
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,360
Actually,

537
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,040
I haven't decided

538
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,401
whether I should try to stay at Jun An.

539
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,961
I thought about it all night.

540
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,921
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

541
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:14,401
Xiaoyu,

542
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,201
you really think

543
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,600
you should choose Zhu Zhisheng?

544
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,961
Last night you asked me

545
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:22,201
what I'd choose between career and love.

546
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:25,360
Career. I'd always choose my career.

547
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,280
I watched someone choose love,

548
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:29,001
more than once.

549
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,201
But she got nothing in the end.

550
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,921
Work's different.

551
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,681
It may be the wrong choice,

552
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:37,921
but I'm sure you won't regret it.

553
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:41,641
Jiatong, I understand.

554
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:45,040
I promise

555
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,600
I won't make a choice I'll regret.

556
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,520
Xiaoyu?

557
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,280
Ms. Wang.

558
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,800
Everyone,

559
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,120
the fourth round
of elimination starts today.

560
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:07,401
Same rules.

561
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,401
In two weeks,

562
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:09,881
the lowest scorer is out.

563
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:12,961
Is everyone here?

564
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:15,120
What about

565
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,840
that sharp girl?

566
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,520
Mr. Zhuang, Guo Xiaoyu is unwell.

567
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,881
She has asked for sick leave.

568
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,961
I'll relay the meeting notes.

569
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:23,760
Rest assured.

570
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:25,832
Zhou Nian.

571
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,881
Present the case

572
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:29,681
you're handling.

573
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:30,472
Okay.

574
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:32,241
(Case Overview)

575
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:33,320
Hangzhou Yiaiwan Tech

576
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:34,921
is a major client of Jun An.

577
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,392
One of their employees

578
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:38,641
was found unconscious
in the parking lot after work.

579
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:39,201
The family

580
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,201
isn't filing
a work-related injury claim.

581
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,881
They're demanding the company

582
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,320
cover all medical expenses directly,

583
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:46,040
as well as

584
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:48,481
work injury-related costs.

585
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Plus compensation.

586
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:50,721
Mr. Zhou.

587
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:51,681
Mr. Zhuang.

588
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:52,481
I have a question.

589
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,960
Go ahead.

590
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,840
To my knowledge,

591
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,320
the employee's coma is merely

592
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,681
a medical observation status.

593
00:28:57,921 --> 00:28:58,520
We have to

594
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,721
wait for the hospital's final diagnosis.

595
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:01,520
Legally speaking,

596
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,921
we only assess matters
with clear outcomes.

597
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,840
So they don't need legal representation

598
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,760
at this point, right?

599
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
Besides, even if the family doesn't

600
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,600
seek work injury certification,

601
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,401
the employer retains the right

602
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,040
to pursue certification, right?

603
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:17,600
I'll be in charge.

604
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:18,681
I need one of you

605
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:20,520
to be my assistant.

606
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:21,641
We'll go to Hangzhou.

607
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:23,681
Your questions were excellent.

608
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:24,760
I'll provide

609
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,320
a comprehensive briefing

610
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,800
after I select an assistant.

611
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,881
Mr. Zhou, I'm interested in this case.

612
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:30,681
Same here.

613
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,760
Everyone's passionate.

614
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,241
I'm glad.

615
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,401
Mr. Zhuang. Mr. Zhou.

616
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,040
I'm ranking first.

617
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,721
I'd like to request this assignment.

618
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:45,760
Mr. Zhou.

619
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,201
What do you think?

620
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:48,961
They're all exceptional.

621
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:50,520
It's not easy to rank first

622
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,161
at Jun An.

623
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,560
Ren Jiatong.

624
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,481
Ms. Bai has praised you to me

625
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:56,760
more than once.

626
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,201
Keep it up.

627
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,921
Thank you.

628
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,280
I'll keep working hard.

629
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:11,001
She's recognized by Mr. Zhuang.

630
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,600
I'm so jealous.

631
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,721
Let it go.

632
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,840
The only one rivaling Ren Jiatong

633
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,600
is Yan Fei.

634
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,241
She took second place.

635
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:26,961
Congrats.

636
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,441
Stay safe in Hangzhou.

637
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,640
Thanks.

638
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:40,808
(Employee Info: Zhu Zhisheng)

639
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,192
(Name: Zhu Zhisheng)

640
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,201
You lied.

641
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,161
Guo Xiaoyu's Weibo IP shows

642
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:02,921
she's in Hangzhou, not Beijing.

643
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:06,161
We need to talk.

644
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,280
About what? Want me to keep the secret?

645
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:09,560
Help me this time.

646
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:10,560
I'll return the favor.

647
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,721
This mutual-help arrangement
is too messy.

648
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:14,401
I'd rather tell Mr. Zhuang

649
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:15,320
that you lied.

650
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:16,560
Then I might claim

651
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,760
this assignment.

652
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:20,401
You won't do that.

653
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:23,641
No, I won't.

654
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:25,040
But not for your sake.

655
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,360
It's for Guo Xiaoyu.

656
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,360
She didn't reply to my message.

657
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:29,401
What happened to her?

658
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
She's my first friend at Jun An.

659
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,241
If she's in trouble,

660
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:37,520
I want to help too.

661
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,376
Come with me.

662
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:47,272
Let me get this straight.

663
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,921
Guo Xiaoyu thought
her boyfriend was cheating.

664
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,080
So she took leave and went to Hangzhou.

665
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,800
Turns out that the unconscious employee

666
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,241
is Guo Xiaoyu's boyfriend?

667
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,721
And we're representing Yiaiwan Tech?

668
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:02,360
How come it's so entangled?

669
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:03,280
Does she know yet?

670
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,481
Probably not.

671
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,080
I haven't decided how to tell her.

672
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,641
What's so difficult about it?

673
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,360
Hello, Guo Xiaoyu.

674
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,760
I'm with Ren Jiatong right now.

675
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,320
How's everything going?

676
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:19,600
(Guo Xiaoyu)

677
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,161
Yan Fei.

678
00:32:20,921 --> 00:32:22,080
Zhubao is in trouble.

679
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:23,721
He's unconscious.

680
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,080
He's been

681
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,401
in the hospital for almost a week

682
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:27,481
and hasn't woken up at all.

683
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:28,961
Xiaoyu.

684
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,961
How are you holding up?

685
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:32,641
I'm at the hospital

686
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,080
with Ms. Wang,

687
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,280
Zhubao's mom.

688
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:38,441
Xiaoyu, I'll make this short.

689
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:39,641
Ms. Wang might not

690
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:41,921
want to apply
for a work injury certification.

691
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:43,401
She wants Yiaiwan Tech

692
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:45,520
to cover all the medical expenses.

693
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,241
Plus some compensation.

694
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:49,800
We are Yiaiwan Tech's legal counsel.

695
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,320
And the firm has confirmed that

696
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,721
we're handling this case.

697
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,201
Right now, you need to

698
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:55,961
report the conflict of interest
to Mr. Zhou

699
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:57,840
and get yourself out of this mess.

700
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,760
Also, for now,

701
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,721
stop meeting with Zhu Zhisheng's family.

702
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:02,961
I'll report to Mr. Zhou.

703
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,600
But Zhubao is from
a single-parent household.

704
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,360
His mom can't

705
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,320
look after him alone.

706
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,481
We need to take shifts.

707
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,360
Xiaoyu, is it worth it if Zhu Zhisheng

708
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:18,681
really cheated on you?

709
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:21,201
I just want him to wake up.

710
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,040
I don't care about anything else.

711
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,520
I just don't understand.

712
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,120
How did everything change

713
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,760
in just over a month?

714
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,120
A perfectly healthy man

715
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,921
is now lying in a hospital bed.

716
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
I've known him for over a decade

717
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,560
and dated him for four years.

718
00:33:34,961 --> 00:33:36,560
Even if he fell for someone else,

719
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,721
our feelings for each other were real.

720
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:39,961
I can't just abandon him.

721
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,080
But

722
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,481
how are you going to help him now?

723
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,800
It's way too complicated.

724
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,481
Don't do anything foolish.

725
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,201
You'll only get yourself in trouble.

726
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:50,921
Xiaoyu, listen to me.

727
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:52,080
Remember

728
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:54,560
what you told me
during the Warm Nest case?

729
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:56,520
Win-win is the best outcome.

730
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:58,520
We understand how you feel.

731
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:00,120
But you've got to protect yourself.

732
00:34:09,288 --> 00:34:11,400
(Conflict of Interest)

733
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,576
(Lawyers must not
represent clients in cases)

734
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:16,584
(where there is a conflict of interest
with themselves or their law firm.)

735
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:21,600
She's not in a good place.

736
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,321
The past few days

737
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:25,680
have hit her way too hard.

738
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:26,401
She even asked

739
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,200
if she had made the wrong choice.

740
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,560
I think she regretted

741
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,120
joining the Talent Hunt Program.

742
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:33,040
If she starts blaming herself

743
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,240
for Zhu Zhisheng's coma,

744
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,441
no one can stop her downward spiral

745
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:37,881
into guilt.

746
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,961
Why is it her fault?

747
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,600
How is any of this her fault?

748
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,281
Why are women so prone to reflection?

749
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:45,720
She did absolutely nothing wrong.

750
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,841
She's brilliant.

751
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,120
Why is she reflecting on herself?

752
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,481
What's there to reflect on?

753
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,321
Didn't Zhu Zhisheng
prioritize his career?

754
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:54,240
He didn't choose

755
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,841
to come to Beijing for Guo Xiaoyu.

756
00:34:56,232 --> 00:34:56,841
Listen.

757
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:57,961
We must stop her

758
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:59,361
from doing anything foolish.

759
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,200
If nobody can stop her, I will.

760
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,520
If I were Guo Xiaoyu.

761
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,680
I wouldn't choose Zhubao.

762
00:35:07,361 --> 00:35:07,961
I'd choose you.

763
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,080
No offense.

764
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,361
But I don't date lawyers.

765
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,361
No thanks.

766
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,160
I'm off to work.

767
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,520
Mr. Zhuang, I spent all day researching

768
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,841
labor dispute cases
between companies and employees,

769
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,680
especially work injury
compensation claims.

770
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,321
And I did preliminary research

771
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:33,921
on Yiaiwan's case.

772
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,881
Plus, my classmate from the UK

773
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:38,120
is working at their legal department.

774
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:40,520
If you could give me this opportunity,

775
00:35:40,841 --> 00:35:42,200
I promise I'll contribute

776
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,040
to this case.

777
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:45,841
You did well.

778
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,040
I truly admire your initiative
in seizing opportunities.

779
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,120
I know my brother came to see you

780
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:53,801
about my career path.

781
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,160
But the fact that I'm standing here now

782
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,600
proves you're fair
and impartial, Mr. Zhuang.

783
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:00,720
You didn't eliminate me because of him.

784
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:03,401
You owe it to your own efforts.

785
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,680
We have no reason

786
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,401
to eliminate a talented employee.

787
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,841
So I'm not here

788
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,881
to ask for privileges.

789
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,801
I'm here to earn this opportunity

790
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,801
through my hard work.

791
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:16,961
You know

792
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:18,680
I've always wanted to
join Mr. Song's team.

793
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,200
This is a rare chance.

794
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:22,640
I want to prove my capabilities
through this case.

795
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:35,841
Not bad.

796
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:37,600
Full of doubt yesterday

797
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:38,961
and determined today.

798
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:41,841
Mr. Zhou, I don't think a senior lawyer

799
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:44,560
should act like
he's spying on his colleagues.

800
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:46,001
When did I spy on you?

801
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:47,481
I don't think you should

802
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:49,001
speak to a senior lawyer without

803
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:49,520
respect.

804
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,768
Mr. Zhou.

805
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,761
I've been thinking about

806
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,001
what you asked me yesterday.

807
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,680
But I haven't figured it out.

808
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:03,600
But it may not be a good thing

809
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,841
to have every answer, right?

810
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,841
Right now, I just want this opportunity

811
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,680
to join Mr. Song's team.

812
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,520
I'll get by for now.

813
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,160
Someday,

814
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,600
I'll figure out what I want.

815
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,881
I'm impressed.

816
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,720
A bottle of champagne for celebration.

817
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,080
Sorry, but I've quit drinking.

818
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,881
Alcohol doesn't solve everything.

819
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,921
Plus, there's alcohol poisoning.

820
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,792
It's not worth it.

821
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,801
But I've gotten into boxing now.

822
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:25,761
More competitive.

823
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:27,656
It feels great,
just like being a lawyer.

824
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:30,560
I dare not cross you now.

825
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,680
I'm a law graduate after all.

826
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,361
I wouldn't resort to violence.

827
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,264
Fair enough.

828
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:39,200
But to be honest,

829
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:41,080
I must thank you

830
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,560
for grilling me yesterday.

831
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:43,560
Otherwise,

832
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,240
I'd be convinced that I was worthless.

833
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,080
Then I wouldn't go boxing.

834
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:48,801
Join me sometime.

835
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,680
I respect you as a senior.

836
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:53,200
But in the ring, winners make the rules.

837
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,696
Alright.

838
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,680
Deal.

839
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,321
One ground rule.

840
00:37:59,001 --> 00:37:59,720
Not in the face.

841
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:00,881
I have barely

842
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:02,801
used any cosmetics in 30 years.

843
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,040
A fist imprint on it

844
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,961
would tarnish my glorious image.

845
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,600
No promises.

846
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,281
But I'll try not to hit too hard.

847
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,200
What's going on?

848
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,560
So mysterious.

849
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,600
I've got an idea.

850
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,921
But I need you

851
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,560
to work with me.

852
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:25,600
Are you in?

853
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:30,160
This round is just starting.

854
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,321
We're falling way behind.

855
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:34,001
Ren Jiatong and Yan Fei might team up

856
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:34,841
in Hangzhou.

857
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:36,321
We'll be efficient

858
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:37,281
as a team of three.

859
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:38,401
What do you say?

860
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,321
I'm on board.

861
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,600
What's your plan?

862
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,080
The defendant

863
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,520
sent this to the plaintiff.

864
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,520
I noticed this.

865
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,424
(From Fei Chang Ke Xin)

866
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:57,080
(No. 16, Zhaoxia South Road,
Chaoyang District)

867
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,640
A corner of the express delivery slip.

868
00:38:58,761 --> 00:38:59,481
The courier

869
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:01,120
is located in the Chaoyang District.

870
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:02,680
I suspect it's near

871
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,520
the defendant's address of operations.

872
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
So you're saying

873
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,801
that if we prove

874
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:10,160
their actual operating address

875
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
is in Beijing,

876
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:13,720
their challenge of jurisdiction

877
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,361
won't stand.

878
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,208
That's right.

879
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,392
Okay.

880
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:19,240
But it's very difficult.

881
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,680
That's why we need to work together.

882
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:23,600
The map apps have

883
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,801
a "nearby search" function.

884
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:26,321
I once developed a mini-program.

885
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:27,240
I can modify it now

886
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,240
to compile a list
of all office buildings

887
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,200
within two kilometers

888
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,520
of this courier station.

889
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:34,001
We'll search together.

890
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,544
(Hangzhou Xiaoshan Airport)

891
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:54,761
I booked a car. Cancel yours.

892
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:58,160
I'm joining the negotiation.

893
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,001
It's here.

894
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,281
I know what you're thinking.

895
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:10,361
But I earned

896
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,120
this opportunity fair and square.

897
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:13,921
I paid to upgrade to business class,

898
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,680
and I paid for this ride too.

899
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,832
I didn't know Mr. Zhou
wasn't on our flight,

900
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,001
or I would have ordered a smaller one.

901
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,841
What a waste.

902
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:23,680
Are you rushing to explain everything

903
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,961
because I mind it,
or because you mind it?

904
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,560
I used to mind it a lot,

905
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,640
but recently someone told me

906
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,240
that if I know what I want,

907
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,160
utilizing all available resources

908
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,120
is a good thing.

909
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,168
What do you say?

910
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,361
I thought you came to Hangzhou
for Guo Xiaoyu.

911
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:40,801
It is for Guo Xiaoyu,

912
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,281
but also for myself.

913
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,640
I'm tired of losing

914
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,040
at Jun An,

915
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
especially

916
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:51,001
to you.

917
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,001
You're pretty cute like this.

918
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,720
Why are you alone? Where's Mr. Zhou?

919
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,200
He was needed for a meeting

920
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,801
right before boarding.

921
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:22,160
He switched to the last flight.

922
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:24,001
So we can only meet with Yiaiwan Tech

923
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:25,281
tomorrow morning.

924
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,921
Straight to the hotel?

925
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:29,481
It's half an hour away.

926
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,321
Let's go over the case.

927
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,761
In the car?

928
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:36,281
Aren't we doing a job

929
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:37,481
where all we need is a laptop

930
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:39,160
to start working anytime, anywhere?

931
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,560
Why does that sound so familiar?

932
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,720
Ms. Bai's exact words from an interview?

933
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,801
Oh, someone at Yiaiwan told me

934
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:55,801
that Zhu's mother had

935
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:57,680
approached their management
several times.

936
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,001
But what puzzles me is,

937
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,680
if she believes this is a work injury,

938
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:03,600
she could've applied

939
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,160
to the Social Security authorities.

940
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:07,441
Then she can claim

941
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,520
work injury compensation right away.

942
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:11,240
Why did she rush to negotiate

943
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,120
compensation with Yiaiwan?

944
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,040
You know people at Yiaiwan?

945
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:16,120
Yeah.

946
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,881
I meant it when I told you

947
00:42:17,881 --> 00:42:19,281
that I'm sick of losing

948
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:20,160
at Jun An.

949
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,560
She pulled all of Zhu Zhisheng's

950
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,841
clock-in records,

951
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,680
claiming he worked overtime daily.

952
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:30,481
So she insists that

953
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,520
his coma was caused

954
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,720
by chronic work exhaustion.

955
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:36,481
The day before yesterday,
she sat for hours outside the company.

956
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,921
But Yiaiwan

957
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:39,640
is at a critical pre-IPO stage.

958
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,120
They can't afford scandals.

959
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:44,441
No wonder they rushed us to Hangzhou.

960
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,961
I knew they wouldn't need

961
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:48,160
lawyers to step in at this moment.

962
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,200
Their HR should be able

963
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,160
to handle this.

964
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,560
So that's what's going on.

965
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,001
If this happened
at your family's company,

966
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,321
how would you handle it?

967
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:58,240
Our company treats employees very well.

968
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:01,040
Do you think

969
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,200
Yiaiwan exploited its employees,

970
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,040
or is Zhu Zhisheng's mother using this

971
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:08,240
to demand huge compensation?

972
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,321
Don't try trapping me.

973
00:43:10,441 --> 00:43:11,640
I didn't say anything.

974
00:43:15,528 --> 00:43:16,936
(Jurisdictional Objection)

975
00:43:16,936 --> 00:43:18,632
(A jurisdictional objection
is when a party argues)

976
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:20,264
(that the court handling their case
is not the right one.)

977
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,800
(They ask to move the case
to the proper court,)

978
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,240
(usually within the time limit
for responding to the lawsuit.)

979
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,744
(This is often used as a legal tactic)

980
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:26,408
(to delay the case
or seek a more favorable location.)

981
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:28,008
(Objections must be raised
during the defense submission period.)
